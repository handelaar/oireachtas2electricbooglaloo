      <P>I take it that the proposal of the Leader of the House to take only portion of Item No. 1 does not preclude a debate in the reasonably near future on the other aspects of that motion and that the taking of the other two motions will not preclude at such further debate the discussion of matters which are reported on by the Commission but which will not be discussed in the present debate.</P>

      <P>I think we must allow the debate to develop and see what happens.  The House will knows now what it is going to discuss: paragraph 3 only of Motion No. 1:</P>
      <P>Discussions be initiated with a view to securing the co-ordination of university facilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Motion No. 3 which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the issue of a Summary of the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
      <P>and Motion No. 6 which reads:</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that discussions be initiated with a view to securing the co-ordination of university facilities in Dublin.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Minister for his courtesy in coming here after, in one sense, a long delay.  These motions have been down for a long time but were not pressed as it was decided not to press them until matters had been clarified further.  In coming to discuss these matters we understand that certain aspects of the problems involved are under examination; for example, between Trinity College, Dublin, Dublin University, and University College, Dublin.  The fact that negotiations are in progress and that decisions have yet to be taken will necessarily inhibit the Minister from taking decisions fully on these matters.  Indeed, inviting him to come here to listen to our debate has been on the basis that we hoped he would come and that we felt he would have something useful to offer; and we realised that in speaking in the debate he would suffer from some inhibitions and that we would not press him on matters which are at present under consideration. It was on that basis that he came here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that there has been so much delay in dealing with the problems facing university education in Ireland.  These delays started in the 1950s when the situation in the universities began to deteriorate.  This has continued during the lifetime of the Commission on Higher Education who, in their efforts to make a thorough study of the problem and produce a comprehensive report, took a very long time.  If any of us had known the Commission would have thought it necessary to take so long about their business we might have thought twice about agreeing to this Commission, of <Col N="301" /> 28 members, I think, as being the right approach to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Later experience has suggested that in modern conditions and with the technical complexity of some of the problems, economic and social, perhaps a better approach would have been to appoint a team to work under a steering committee as was done in relation to another body which produced a full and comprehensive report relatively expeditiously.  However, that is hindsight. At the time the Commission were established it was thought to be a good move and everybody concerned waited for something of permanent and enduring value.  However, during the period of the life of the Commission, the neglect of the universities continued unabated.  That was a mistake.  While awaiting the Commission's findings, there were phases in which the Government could have acted to prevent this neglect reaching the stage it has.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the existence of the Commission came to be used as an excuse for postponing all action.  The irony of it is that, having postponed action in relation to many matters which could have been dealt with reasonably and without prejudice to the work of the Commission, the Government then, without waiting for the publication of the final report, took a decision on one matter in respect of which the report had a special contribution to make&mdash; the merger.  The extent to which the neglect of our universities has left them in a serious condition as regards lack of resources is still not widely enough appreciated.  Though the heads of the colleges have referred to it, there is still inadequate public appreciation of how far we have fallen behind.</P>
    <P>Before coming here, I looked up some articles I wrote 13 years ago.  I was surprised to find how long it is since I wrote them.  The articles were on university education in Ireland and included some figures on how we stood 13 years ago and pointing out the appalling lag between the resources available to the universities here and in Northern Ireland and the lag between the universities here and in Britain, a lag which in the meantime has become many times worse.</P>
    <P>In figures in those articles which I <Col N="302" /> wrote in the spring of 1955, I pointed out that at that time the average endowment per student in Irish universities was £145 a year.  In the UK it ranged between £220 and £400, over a range of a dozen colleges and universities which I selected at random, excluding as special cases Oxford, Cambridge and London.  At that time, British university students were better off, over a large range, by from 50 per cent to 175 per cent.</P>
    <P>What has happened since then?  The related figure for Ireland is £236 per student, an increase of 65 per cent in a period in which the consumer price index has risen by 50 per cent.  Therefore, in the period, the appalling shortage of resources of Irish universities has barely improved at all.  In terms of real purchasing power per student, they are only 10 per cent better off.</P>
    <P>In the same period, the resources available to students in British universities in money terms have improved by 150 per cent on average.  Today, when our universities are lagging to the tune of 130 per cent below the average figure in the British range, the per student figure in Britain is from £600 to £1,000 per student.  The result is that the shortfall in our endowment compared with Britain, the lag which was so disastrously large 13 years ago, has not just been increased but multiplied. The worst off British college in respect of which I can find figures has an average endowment of £600, or 160 per cent more than the average Irish university&mdash;more than 2½ times as much&mdash;and that compares with a lag of 50 per cent 13 years ago.</P>
    <P>In the case of the best endowed British universities, which in 1952-53 were 175 per cent better off, the figure becomes 425 per cent, so great has the lag in the finances of the Irish universities become in that period.  Of course, more money has been given but the increased resources provided have just about caught up with the cost of living increase, so that in 15 years the endowment per student has risen by 10 per cent in real value.  British universities have increased their endowments by two-thirds as against our 10 per cent so the gap has increased to an enormous degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> It is worthwhile emphasising these figures which I do not think are appreciated here.  We must remember that we are talking not only of Britain but of Northern Ireland where in Belfast Queen's University has an endowment which is, putting it modestly, several times our endowment.  I have been told that the University of Coleraine will work at a figure of £1,000 per student, the figure of the better-off provincial universities in Britain.  As against that we offer less than £250 per student.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, our universities and our students suffer.  It is true that because of the enormous size of University College Dublin which, by British standards, is a very large college, and because there are economies of scale to be gained by lecturing to large groups of students&mdash;some of whom, of course, you cannot reach physically in a single room&mdash;there are some economies by comparison with some of the smaller British universities, but only by a small margin.  Even allowing for the very large numbers in UCD and the economies in scale this may yield, in real terms the standards in terms of teaching power, of equipment, of buildings are but a smallish fraction of those available in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Inevitably in this country we cannot afford in many respects the same standards as in Britain.  We have to face this fact.  Our national output per head is not very much more than half that in Britain.  We have to accept in many fields that our standards have to be lower than theirs but there is no reason why this disparity in the two countries should be intensified in the case of the universities.  We should not pick on the universities as one area in which we should concentrate on under-endowment or as one area which we should select to provide it with resources far less than even what could be justified in comparison with the standard of living in the two countries. This is something quite unforgivable.</P>
    <P>Now, turning to the Commission's report&mdash;they produced after seven years a summary report.  I think in retrospect that that was a mistake. Although one can understand after such a long period the Minister and <Col N="304" /> others were anxious to hear what they had decided, I think it was a mistake to produce a summary report.  The summary, however, was a rather defective summary giving a poor impression of the report as a whole and has, I think, contributed in some degree to an undervaluation of the report.  The report itself, of which we now have half, although we have none of the evidence, is telling and comprehensive but it has, nevertheless, a number of defects.</P>
    <P>It certainly shows that the authors have done a thorough job during the past six years.  They subjected every aspect of education to a careful scrutiny.  They have been enlightened by the study of educational methods in other countries.  The analysis of the problems of the universities could be given more publicity.  If people read this report it would be extremely useful to them.  I think a short statement of those problems would probably be accepted by most people as a fair statement of higher education in the first half of the 1960s.  While there may be economists and statisticians who are qualified to make more detailed forecasts their forecasts seem reasonable.</P>
    <P>There are some parts of the report which I think most people would regard as most controversial such as the statement of the principles which should govern education in universities, the section on the relationship between research institutes and the universities, a thorny subject.  We have to take into account that there are no research institutes outside Dublin.  The report has some useful things to say in its handling of this problem.  The report also has some useful things to say when dealing with the staffing of universities and also where it emphasises the disparity between staffing and students and the staff student ratio. The report, I think, places particular emphasis on maintaining quality in higher education and even the reference in the summary is valuable. We are faced with such appalling problems in education that we need to provide additional resources at every level of education, more people at the higher level but when we are tackling those problems there is a real danger <Col N="305" /> that the cultural aspect would be ignored, a danger that quality would suffer and that in our anxiety we would provide quantity of education and that quality would suffer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, in some way, the most enduring impression that this report leaves us with is the emphasis it lays on quality at the very time when we need it.  Those are all the good things in the Commission's report.  There are other things which have evoked criticism and some which I will criticise in dealing with particular aspects.  I think we all owe a great debt to the Commission.  It was most unfortunate that the Minister found it necessary to make his announcement about the merger before he received the full report because this left the Commission with a feeling that their efforts had not been appreciated.  They were clearly disconcerted and unhappy with the Minister's announcement.  While saying that, I do not quarrel with the fact that he had made the announcement, nor do I say that I agree with the Commission's views on the merger.  I think the Minister was right in seeking the merger.  The decision was overdue, but it might have been possible to handle it in a more tactful manner that would not have left people with a feeling that they had not done a good job in seven years.  The university has several different roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I take the Senator up on one point?  I did, in fact, have the report as well as the summary before I made my announcement about the merger.  I studied what the Commission had to say in regard to the merger before I made my announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I may have misstated the facts there.  I think the feelings of the Commission were aroused by the fact that their views had not been put before the public, although the Minister had received their report, before he made his announcement.  I recognise the fact that the Minister had considered their representations.  I do not place too much stress on that.  It is difficult <Col N="306" /> always to know when is the right time to do something and when something is overdue for a long period it is, perhaps, criticised because it is not done at that particular point.</P>
      <P>The university has many roles.  First of all, and most obvious, it provides higher education but it has other roles to play also.  One which in this country has tended to be undervalued is research.  Research has tended to be ignored for its own sake, and this is wrong, because there are many fields of knowledge where without considerable concentration on research within the universities the quality of teaching inevitably suffers.  The extent to which this is true may not be appreciated by people outside the university but many of us in the university who have experience of teaching there know this to be the case.  Should people for any period find themselves not undertaking some useful research in their subject they find themselves very quickly running dry and feeling that they are not in their lectures able to offer the students the kind of stimulus which they should have.  I have mentioned already that as regards research there is a problem because the existence of two universities in Dublin has encouraged the establishment of separate research institutes in areas where in happier circumstances research institutes would have been within the university, not necessarily an integral part of it, perhaps a separate organisation, but within the framework of the university and their staff might have been university teachers and there might have been an interchange of research workers and lecturers, lecturers going to undertake research and research workers giving lectures.  This we have not had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, for example, today the Agricultural Institute, a remarkable body doing an extraordinary range of work with relatively generous resources by the standards of this country and yet cut off from the university and having very little contact with it and certainly with no interchange of staffs giving lectures or no members of the university staff going there for their own purposes to do research.  We have similarly <Col N="307" /> the Economic and Social Research Institute with perhaps a little closer contact with the university but still not close enough, still without interchange of people.  There are others.  We have, indeed, quite a range of institutes of various kinds which have been cut off from the university.  I would hope that one of the happier results of the Minister's intervention in the universities would be that, having merged the two universities, the old reason for keeping the institutes out of the university would go and that they would become closely merged with the new university.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the importance, whatever may be done at the undergraduate level, of having single postgraduate schools as far as possible in the university so that there is one post-graduate school with which a research institute can be readily associated, in this way ensuring the interchange of people and of knowledge between the research and teaching levels.  I shall come back to that again but I want now to mention two other aspects of the role of the university which are more general and less specific but perhaps not less important. One is&mdash;and this is not a universal characteristic of all universities but it is something which universities have a potential for&mdash;the taking of an independent view, the creation of an independent opinion.  In Britain, Ireland and America this tradition is strong. It is not so strong on the Continent. I hope that when we join the EEC there will be a two-way flow of useful experience between ourselves and the continental countries.  I hope that one of the things they will learn from us&mdash; and we have much to learn from them &mdash;is the tradition of academic independence and the autonomy of the university, an imperfect tradition because people are imperfect and because the world is imperfect but, nevertheless, a tradition which has been maintained in Britain, Ireland and America.  It is not so on the Continent.  I recall within recent memory a university professor coming to this country to lecture. There was some dissatisfaction expressed by those who heard his lecture at the limited range he covered <Col N="308" /> and at the very narrow interpretation he put on the subject.  When inquiries were made from him privately as to why he could not have spoken more broadly it transpired that he had his instructions from the relevant Government department in the country from which he came as to what he could and could not say on the subject and that settled the matter for him.  That is something which, thank God, is inconceivable in this country.  University professors and lecturers, down to the lowest grade, are independent and they would not be told what to say or what not to say either at home or abroad.  Having seen the unhappy role that the university played in Germany in the Nazi period, we can see the importance of an autonomous university institution, the important role they can play in providing an independent body of opinion.  Many university people have their own political opinions.  Some of them are actively engaged in politics, most of them are not.  Some of them do not care a damn about politics but even those who, if I may say so, are actively engaged in politics find that the independent outlook of the university tends to infect them at times and certainly those who are not actively engaged in politics take an independent view and this is a great strength in any democratic society.</P>
    <P>Another quality of the university which is important is the tradition of high quality, the desire to maintain high standards, something which then can percolate down through the educational system but which if it is weakened in the university by negligence on the part of the staff, by lack of concern for high standards or by lack of resources which may make the maintenance of high standards difficult, is something which then can infect the other aspects of education.  It is from the university high standards come and they should be cherished there.  This is a point which is well made by the Commission and one which is worth making again here.</P>
    <P>On the question of the need for autonomy of the university there is, I would say, a misunderstanding here. There are people in the university who <Col N="309" /> push this to the point of feeling that the Government's job is to pay the piper whatever the piper asks and not only not call the tune but not even to whistle the air or to suggest what tune might occasionally be called.  The universities are a part of society.  They cannot act irresponsibly.  They must play their part in the life of the nation. They must concern themselves with the particular national needs at any given time and they must recognise that as they derive the bulk of their resources from the Government, the Government have a legitimate interest in the work they are doing.  At the same time the balance to be maintained is a delicate one and a difficult one because while the universities do have the duty of providing for the higher educational needs of society, the duty of having regard to what these needs are, the duty to provide courses in areas where there is a need for them, nevertheless they are not simply there to meet a demand.  They have an independent life of their own and the quality of life in the community depends on their living their independent life.  It depends on university staff being free to carry on research in the area that interests them and not in the area dictated to them by a Government Department.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of the university is important also for particular political reasons and the maintenance of this balance is a difficult and delicate thing to achieve.  So far in Ireland we have maintained balance fairly well but at I think considerable economic cost in that the lack of contact at policy level, the lack of even the beginnings of planning or co-ordination of policy between the Government on the one hand and the universities on the other, has left us with an untidy and unsatisfactory university system which has not played its role in the life of the community as fully as it should.  At the same time, in particular areas there is even today excessive Government intervention in the affairs of the university, too close contact, too much regard being paid in particular parts of the university to the special requirements of Government Departments.  However, it is a relatively small problem confined on the whole to particular areas but we <Col N="310" /> have failed to maintain a perfect balance here.  We have allowed parts of the university to become too much the tool of Government policy.  It is not a problem I stress greatly but in areas we have completely failed to co-ordinate the public policy with the actual work of the university.</P>
    <P>This, I think, the Commission has tackled well although I think we can add something useful today in this debate and I hope that out of this debate and the discussions and the legislation that will come will emerge a system that will preserve the autonomy of the university but will ensure that they are encouraged to play their full part in the life of the community and that the Government is in a position to ensure that they are aware of the needs of the community and to encourage them to meet those needs. I feel we can do much more in this regard in the future than we have done in the past.  At the same time, the Government's role within the university must be minimised.  It is important that at no stage should the university become the direct front of the Government.  I should like to pay tribute to the tradition that has been followed in this country by successive Governments and maintained by this Government of appointing to the governing authority of the universities outstanding people of integrity who make a great contribution to the life of the college in the work they do on the governing body but who are not the agents of the Government or the Minister, who are not there to execute his desires and whom the Minister maintains contact with and does not attempt to influence in the carrying out of their work.  We have the tradition of the appointment of people of high standing in these positions by the Government.  They may or may not share the political views of the Government. They are not concerned with pressing these views if they do share them and they are there to represent the public interests independently and not to press Government policy and not even to maintain liaison between the universities and the Government. This is a great feature of our present system.  I hope this will be maintained. <Col N="311" /> I should like to emphasise this point to those of our friends from Trinity because they have not had experience of Government appointments to their governing authority and they may fear that such appointments might affect their autonomy.  I can offer no guarantee that that might not happen because future Governments may change their view on these appointments.  Our experience in UCD has been happy in this respect and if the present system is maintained in future the universities have only to gain from appointments made by the Government and have nothing to fear or lose by them.</P>
    <P>The duties of the universities in playing their part in the life of the community are several.  First, they must take the social responsibility to provide courses in the kind of subjects for which there is a need at the proper level.  This does not mean that every time somebody wants a diploma in some subject at sub-university level that they will introduce a diploma course.  If anything, our universities have gone too far in that direction in introducing courses at diploma level which are not of university level, courses at times which would be better dealt with elsewhere.  They have done this because of general defects in higher education here and very often there is not an opportunity elsewhere for these courses to be given.  It has meant that the universities have been distracted at times from their true task and the calibre of their work perhaps reduced by catering for too many different kinds of courses, not of university level.  That does not mean that the university has not a duty to provide at its own level the kind of courses which are needed by the community.</P>
    <P>It also has a responsibility to ensure within the limits open to it that as far as possible there is freedom of access to the university for as many people as possible from as many walks of life as possible.  Universities have a duty to do this as far as possible within their powers because, in fact, the whole system by which the Government gives grants to universities is one which does not encourage the universities to take this responsibility.  Whose responsibility <Col N="312" /> is it to determine the terms of access of students to the universities? The universities' view is that it is for the Government which gives the money to decide how it should be given and that all they can do is give a small number of scholarships internally.  It may be that this is the Government's view, but the universities never found it out, that it is the university which should be more active in this field in allocating its resources in a manner which would encourage entry of students who have the ability but not the means.  It may well be that the universities think the Government should be doing this.  The universities in some cases feel that it is not their job but the Government's.</P>
    <P>I suspect a misunderstanding here as to who should play this role of ensuring free access to education.  I hoped that this question of the responsibility of the universities and the Government in this matter would be clarified, not in the course of this debate as we shall not go into that in detail, but in subsequent discussion which will arise out of the Commission's report and out of the situation created, and that we will get a system under which the relative responsibilities of the universities and the Government in this matter will be clarified.</P>
    <P>The universities have some responsibility. If they have not exercised it fully it is because it is not understood clearly how they should exercise it or what Government policy is in this regard.  The universities also have a duty to co-operate among themselves. The fruits of co-operation can be great in this field.  The possibilities for improving academic standards, for offering students a wider range of courses and specialised experience, are great.  These opportunities could easily be grasped particularly in the city of Dublin, especially in the last 50 years, where within a few hundred yards of each other we have two colleges each of which contained academic standards of high calibre, specialising in different topics and who could have lectured on or assisted in research work had there been a minimum of co-operation between the colleges.  But, there has <Col N="313" /> been a failure in this regard for which the universities must take responsibility, a failure which the Government is now seeking to overcome and do something about by this merger proposal.</P>
    <P>We in the universities must accept responsibility for not having acted cooperatively in these matters, for having avoided co-operation by tending to shut ourselves up and not play our part in working with each other in the common good of the students of our colleges. The fact that there was this failure in co-operation has, in fact, been one of the primary reasons which led the Minister to intervene.  There are voices in universities who criticise him for intervening, not only as regards the timing of his intervention but for the fact of his intervention.  Those voices are by people who fear any Ministerial or Government intervention a threat to the autonomy of the universities. These are proper and understandable fears.  If it is felt in the universities that it would have been better for the Minister not to have acted in this way then those in the universities who by creating a situation that left him with no alternative but to intervene must take the responsibility in this matter.  It is we who by failing to create the conditions of co-operation between the two colleges have necessitated this <i>deus ex machina</i> intervention, who have brought this on ourselves, and we do not have the right to say we will not co-operate with each other.  We will not let anybody make us co-operate either; this is something any university has a right to do in the exercise of its autonomy.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the failure in regard to provisions in the universities, not in a way that they are not comparable with Britain and Northern Ireland, but looking at our situation as we find it today.  The problem with regard to buildings is acute.  While something is now being done about that, and we are grateful to the Government for the financial resources they have provided in this regard, the situation is still not a happy one.  We have at the moment conditions of appalling overcrowding.  It is only because of the opening of the science block that the <Col N="314" /> bulk of the staff in University College, Dublin have even the opportunity of sharing a room with each other, not to speak of having a room in which to work for themselves.  There was a sigh of relief at the departure of the scientists as it became possible for people to sit two to five in a room instead of having to grasp the opportunity of popping in to see a professor for two minutes and wander around the corridors for the rest of the time.</P>
    <P>It is a great relief but it still leaves us in a very unhappy position because the average member of the staff is in a room with two to five other staff members and it makes it extremely difficult to give tutorials in these rooms.  It is in fact impossible to find any other room in which to give tutorials as the rooms in the college are occupied all the time. The situation is extremely difficult.  Box and Cox arrangements have to be come to.  Other staff members have to go out of the room while students are being given tutorials.  We hope that the move to Belfield, from the UCD point of view, will give some relief and in the other colleges also there are building plans which will give them relief.  I must, however, express fear lest the provision made is inadequate.  It is hard to judge this because the raising of standards in the last two years may have had an effect on numbers although we have not seen any sign of that so far.  If it does not, it looks as if the buildings now being provided at Belfield&mdash;I am speaking of my own college in this respect&mdash;will be barely adequate even in the first year for the students who will be occupying them and we shall, therefore, face either the need within a year or so to start building extensions&mdash;bad economics for a start to have to extend a building which was just put up&mdash;or more probably we shall be left to become overcrowded in Belfield just as we have been in UCD during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>There has been too much cheeseparing, leaving a small margin for extension so that buildings, when we go into them, will be capable of taking the extended population only for the first few years.  There is one particular <Col N="315" /> problem which needs to be managed.  It is in relation to the library.  The provision there has been cut from the original requirement very drastically by something like 60 per cent.  While we may fit into the lecture rooms and, if we can turn over the lunch-hour rapidly we may fit into the restaurant, we shall not be able to fit more than 40 per cent of the students into the library.  Many people felt the plan was far too inadequate to begin with, even before the 60 per cent was lopped off.  I suggest to the Minister that any capital resources that may become available will be used to restore the cut in the library plan, to bring it up to the approximate size required by the students.  In this matter the case is of a higher degree of urgency than in the matter of the other buildings.  The facilities in the library will not be half adequate and the case for the restoration of the cut is a very powerful one.  The time to do it is while the plans are at an early stage and the building work will not start for some time to come.  I plead with the Minister that when any capital funds present themselves he will bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The overall financial position as regards current needs is so bad that it is hard to visualise us catching up.  The fact that the amount of money per student per annum is only 25 per cent or 40 per cent of the British figure is so bad that it is hard to see how we can even offer to catch up.  This is reflected in the staff position.  Our staff student ratio of about 20 to one is so bad that if we seek to do what the Commission proposes, to bring the ratio down to 12 to one by 1975&mdash;a modest proposal&mdash;it would leave us 50 per cent worse off from the point of view of Britain.  This would require a 2½-fold increase in staff in eight years. One would like to think it would happen, but where will we get the staff on that scale in that period?</P>
    <P>We have fallen so desperately behind that it is difficult to find ourselves catching up in any foreseeable period.  The problem of getting the staff in that period will be almost <Col N="316" /> insuperable.  With all the best intentions and best work in the world it would take us well into the 1980s before our university could be brought up to British levels as regards staff. It is an appalling indictment of successive governments in the past number of years.  It is not entirely the fault of the present Government though it has been in the lifetime of the present Government that the situation has been allowed to arise in respect of which we must look to the prospect of waiting until the 1980s before we can hope to provide higher education for our children.</P>
    <P>At page 104 the Commission point out that the staff-student ratio is no better now than 25 years ago when it was appallingly bad.  In that time nothing has been done to improve it. Now we have the prospect of making up in eight years what we neglected to do in 25 years.  I am afraid it will be beyond us.  In all this, what we have faced is a total lack of planning, something which has been emphasised in several cases, in the Fine Gael policy in which we emphasise the need for a long-term plan to develop the Irish universities in consultation with the university authorities so that any improvement of the student-teacher ratio will be on a planned basis instead of allowing it to deteriorate from year to year.  This long-term plan which Fine Gael propose accords with the Commission's report where this is emphasised as follows:</P>
    <P>The framework of the system has been developed mainly since the midnineteenth century.  Its development, however, has come about piecemeal and is not the produce of any comprehensive plan.  Its component parts were created to meet the requirements of particular times: Trinity College to supply the needs of the Protestant State and its Church in the late-sixteenth century; the National University of Ireland to meet Catholic claims for acceptable institutions of higher education; the national teacher training colleges to provide teachers for a scheme of public elementary education; the technical and vocational education colleges to train personnel for commerce <Col N="317" /> and industry; the professional institutions to provide training for the professions they serve; and the research institutes to supply particular research requirements.</P>
    <P>The result is that the system which has thus evolved is not a unified system in which each part is functionally related to the others, but is a system of separate units which, in their working, often overlap with each other, while leaving some areas inadequately provided for.  The two universities, the National University of Ireland and Dublin University, operate independently of each other. Each of the five university colleges conducts its own teaching and research, although the NUI colleges are joined together in the University for certain purposes.  Each of the teacher-training colleges is a separate institution, and, with one exception, the colleges have no association with the universities.  The technical and vocational education colleges have been developed within their own particular system.  The professional institutions and the research institutes also work independently.  There is little co-ordination of effort even where it might most be expected.  The two universities, for example, operate separate matriculation examinations and prescribe different standards of entry.  Movement of staffs between the colleges of the National University is late, even on a temporary basis.  The permanent transfer of staff from one college to another is hampered by the absence of a common superannuation scheme.  Consequently, staffs are tied to particular colleges and there is little sharing of specialist knowledge among the colleges.</P>
    <P>The fragmentation of our educational system is serious; even more disquieting, however, is the fact that institutions appear to think primarily in terms of their own individual interests.</P>
    <P>The report spoke of antagonism between the different institutions and stated:</P>
    <P>As to the universities and the vocational colleges, evidence from <Col N="318" /> University College, Dublin, indicated the strong antagonism to the participation of the Dublin colleges of technology in the professional training of scientists, engineers and architects, while the authorities of these colleges, for their part, were adverse to suggestions of a university association.  Again, the evidence of the administrative authorities of University College, Dublin, showed hostility to Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is an unhappy situation.  We want to consider why it has arisen and we want to consider the increases in the numbers in the colleges without any adequate provision of resources.  It is not simply because of Government neglect.  It is due to Government neglect but we must look a little beyond it to see why there is such Government neglect.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of Government neglect over a long period.  It is much greater than in any other area and one cannot but feel that there is something else behind it than just simply a question of lack of interest.  We have seen here that there is a rather complex situation.  The university colleges have seemed to take the view that they have a duty to the public to take in any student who passes a qualifying examination which hitherto was of a grade of extremely low standard, and that they have no right to refuse anybody. They might claim the right to exclude people from particular areas but in principle they must find a place for everybody who succeeds in the pass Leaving Certificate examination.  I should like to know whether in continental Europe the entrance requirement to universities has been anything as low as ours.  You must bear in mind that the pass Leaving Certificate is obtained by 91 per cent who enter for the examination and you must allow for the fact that those who do the examination are, it is true, relatively more intelligent than the other section of the community who do not do it.</P>
    <P>A university examination which cuts out 25 per cent or less is quite inadequate as an entrance examination.  The universities should be catering for the top, I will not say five, ten, 15 or 20 per <Col N="319" /> cent of the 75 per cent, but they should be catering for a relatively small proportion. The result of the low entrance standard, and the system under which the Government provide grants for university education at reduced fees at a fraction of the economic level has been that you have coming into the universities a very large number of people who are quite inadequately provided to participate successfully in the life of the university and to emerge from it with a degree by the universities. That is all because the universities have the feeling that it is their duty to take those people in.</P>
    <P>One cannot feel helping but that this was motivated by a feeling that if they fill themselves up with as many students as possible the Government will bale them out.  There is also the feeling that secondary education is so inadequate that to exclude anybody from a minimum standard of a pass Leaving Certificate might be to exclude somebody who would do well in examinations, but through no fault of his own, but through deficiencies in secondary education, has only obtained a pass in this examination.  They feel that people should be given an opportunity to do well in the university and if they do not they can leave.  Besides that there is a feeling with universities that to abide rigidly by such a policy they would be making a strong case to the Government for extra resources and pressure could then be put on the Government to increase resources to them.  Quite apart from the fact that the Government have proved impervious to what they might regard as the blackmail element in this, the most they would have done would be to provide for extra students but not to improve the basic deficiencies in the universities, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the students.</P>
    <P>I do not believe you can improve the position in this way.  The Government have not accepted this philosophy and there is no evidence that any of our governments, up to this, have accepted the philosophy that they have a duty to provide adequate resources for all students who go to the university. You have, therefore, two policy making mechanisms operating in the <Col N="320" /> universities, one where they are hoping to secure extra resources and the other rejecting this philosophy, not accepting the fact that the universities have a duty to take everybody in and the Government have a duty to provide the resources to cater for those people. The result of this has been to provide us with a university system which is desperately overcrowded, desperately underequipped and desperately understaffed. It is, as I said, largely the fault of the Government, but I think the universities also have a responsibility. Certainly both have a responsibility that they have failed to come to terms in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>They have failed to sit down together and put their two philosophies together. The Government have never seemed to find out what was the thinking behind the university attitude to the entrance of large numbers of students and the universities have failed to find out what the Government attitude was in regard to this.  The result is that we are producing many more university graduates per head than in Britain.  In fact, the latest figure I have is that we have in our universities 4.5 per thousand of the population and in Britain they have 2.65.  We have, in other words, in our universities, a proportion of the total population which is about 70 per cent greater than in Britain, yet our national resources are barely half of those of Britain and the resources we devote to universities are only a fraction of what they devote in Britain.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong here. There is no policy making mechanism. The Government and the universities have never agreed what policy should be.  We have very many people who are not qualified to be in universities, very many who survive there for a long period but leave without a degree and without much benefit to themselves eventually either.  They take up room in the universities, they take up places in the library and the classroom and diminish the quality of education available to the remainder.  Out of this emerges rather more graduates than in Britain but this is because we produce six times as many pass Arts graduates as they do in Britain.  We are behind <Col N="321" /> in areas like science and technology but we produce six times as many pass Arts graduates.  Many go into teaching and many have to emigrate.  This is caused by there not being any coordinating policy between the Government and the universities.</P>
    <P>How can we achieve such a policy? There must be some kind of co-ordination which will not interfere with the autonomy of the universities in regard to the running of their own affairs, in deciding what courses they will give and in their charges.  They must realise that they cannot expect the Government to give them astronomical sums and that the Government must have some voice in determining the policy to be adopted.  The solution which one can see in this&mdash;this was recommended in the Fine Gael policy and in the Commission's report&mdash;is to establish a policy commission on which there would be representatives of the university and the public interest.  On such a commission you would have the public point of view and also the university point of view.  Such a commission would consist of academic interests and Government interests, not more than two civil servants, similar to that in respect of the NIEC, where you have Government representatives consisting of two civil servants and I think eight representatives of the general public interest.</P>
    <P>A committee with that kind of representation of the public interest and that kind of academic representation could attempt to produce a jointly agreed picture of the kind of resources that should be provided, the number of graduates that should be produced, where the need is greatest, where extra places are required, where they are producing more than we need.  These recommendations should not be binding on either the Government or the universities, on the Government because the Government cannot be bound to produce financial resources <i>ad lib</i> and not binding on the universities because their autonomy must be maintained and no committee should be able to dictate to them precisely what courses they should or should not offer.  I believe such a committee <Col N="322" /> producing an agreed report and recommending to the Government and the universities what the broad policy should be as regards entrance standards and perhaps needs in different areas would, in fact, be heeded by both sides. There could be occasions when the university could decide that it wanted to provide a course which such a committee decided was unnecessary and it could do so from its own resources. Universities do have some resources of their own apart from State funds.  There could also be occasions when the Government could feel that they could not meet such a heavy financial commitment as had been recommended by the committee and they might want to postpone or even not to accept some of the recommendations made by the committee.  Both should be free to do that but I believe that in normal circumstances the pressure on both sides to be reasonable and to accept the report would be great and that out of this mechanism you would get an agreed policy in marked and pleasurable contrast to the total lack of agreed policy which has brought us into our present disastrous position with universities overcrowded with the wrong people, many of them incapable of benefiting from a university education while at the same time the financial resources required to go to a university and the disastrous lack of scholarships exclude many people who ought to be there.  I believe, therefore, that such a mechanism which we in Fine Gael have recommended would avoid the present overcrowding.  We would balance resources with students. We would maintain standards and we would serve the national needs which require to be met.</P>
    <P>This whole question of entrance policy is a difficult and a thorny one.  It is something that should be decided by the universities themselves but so far they have not shown themselves effective at doing so.  They have, as the commission point out, failed to introduce at any stage a common entrance examination and the entrance examination they have accepted, the State past Leaving Certificate, has been a totally unsuitable examination for university entrance.  Serious thought needs to be <Col N="323" /> given to this.  We do not know what the Commission recommended on this because that volume has yet to come but I feel we must have a university entrance examination.  I believe, although I know there was division of view on this subject, that a leaving certificate examination, a school leaving examination designed primarily to give most students something to show that they have completed their school career reasonably successfully, something, therefore, which the great bulk of people should pass and few should fail, cannot be an adequate entrance examination to a university even though a student has passed an honours paper. I think it is desirable that it should be a general examination, that it should not be specialised, that it should involve a range of subjects and should not involve too narrow a base of specialisation.</P>
    <P>At the same time, for university entrance there is much to be said for requiring students to specialise in a smaller number of subjects.  Again the fact that there is strong evidence that Irish university students generally go too young suggests the need for a new entrance mechanism under which the present leaving certificate with all the improvements now being introduced would be independent as a school leaving examination and no one will be entitled to come to university who had not passed the requisite number of subjects.  A student would be required under this system not only to have passed out of the school system showing a competence in a fairly wide range of subjects but would require also to have passed a separate examination additional to and later than the school leaving examination, an entrance examination that might, perhaps, be in three subjects, preferably not in one area like French, German and Italian but three subjects from three different areas but, nevertheless, involving a certain degree of specialised work.  This would ensure a higher standard of entrance to the university.  It would ensure that people had experience of specialisation before they went there and it would ensure also without laying down any more rigid physical age rules than <Col N="324" /> at present that the average age of entry would be raised.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to rigid rules in regard to physical age because the degree of maturity of people varies enormously from one to another and those rigid rules can involve hardship for individuals and often operate quite unsatisfactorily allowing people in who are quite immature and keeping others out who are mature.  We should, as far as possible, avoid this obsession with physical age but by imposing a higher standard and the need for an additional year for most people to complete this examination we would, in practice, ensure that most people would be older.  If there is one thing university people are all agreed on it is that students are coming in too young, not sufficiently mature.  Again and again I have been told by students in their third year that it is only in their third year that they are beginning to understand what a university is about.  The first two have been a process of transition and now there is only one year to go.  I feel this is regrettable.  I feel that anything which raises the average age without imposing a rigid physical age barrier would be a good thing and I hope that the Minister would meet sympathetically any proposals that might eventually come from the universities for such a change of policy.</P>
    <P>For some reason universities believe that the Government insists that they must accept the Leaving Certificate. I do not believe that.  Certainly I am not aware that the Government has ever laid this down.  However, it is one of the myths of university life that this is something you cannot change, I do not believe the Department of Education would take a rigid view on this.  I am sure they would be sympathetic to any proposal.  Such an entrance examination should be common to all colleges rather than having separate examinations for different colleges.</P>
    <P>On the question of teaching I would merely comment that the present system of three year honours courses in NUI is not adequate and I would hope we would have a four year period as they have in TCD although <Col N="325" /> three years is adequate for the general course and I think the four years in Trinity is excessive there.  I am not sure that NUI should increase the length of the general subjects course.</P>
    <P>There are several points in the Commission's report which I feel one must criticise or comment on critically.  The proposal for new colleges has not met with university favour and I think it needs to be reconsidered.  The Commission's report on this in some respects is internally contradictory and the effect of their proposal would be to downgrade various professions by pushing them into new colleges, instead of the universities, with lower entrance standards.  Although there is a lower entrance standard, there seems to be a proposal that people could move freely from the new colleges to the universities despite the fact that the entry to the new colleges is at a lower standard than to the universities. This would be unsatisfactory.  I do not think that new colleges is the right answer in Dublin where we can expand university facilities perhaps by up-grading non-university institutions or establishing new ones.</P>
    <P>The new college proposal needs to be looked at carefully.  It appeared unsatisfactory in the summary but when we came to read the full version, having been told by people who read it in advance that it made a marvellous case for the new colleges, I, at any rate, felt unhappy with it.  I had thought that perhaps the summary did not do justice to the report and that perhaps in the full version the new colleges would be justified fully but they were not.  The proposal put forward, although one accepts the motivation in putting it forward, needs to be looked at carefully.  It would involve lowering the standards and may not be the best approach to the problem of extending higher education.</P>
    <P>There are problems in the recommendations for the professions.  The fact that the agricultural and veterinary professions would be hived off and put together in a separate college is something, I understand, that the veterinary specialists are not too keen about.  This is a solution which one cannot look at <Col N="326" /> with enthusiasm.  It should be carefully examined.  To take these groups out of the university is a pity.  They are, in fact, physically segregated from the university and in the first year do most of their lectures in different locations. The students are not integrated into the universities in these faculties, as indeed is true of some other technical faculties, but the tendency is for them to develop into an empire of their own, teaching academic subjects and duplicating the facilities available in the central corps of the university&mdash;in the Arts and Science faculties.  That is a reason for integrating them more closely into the university so that the students may benefit from more fully participating in the life of the university. This is a proposal which should be looked at.  There are technical difficulties of course in regard to the veterinary profession because of the requirements of registration from Britain&mdash; and we can see how useful it is when they are registered in Britain in the present foot and mouth epidemic.  The requirement is that the course should be in a university and the Commission treats this in a cavalier manner, saying blandly that presumably this can be got rid of.  They are unrealistic on this problem.</P>
    <P>There is also a proposal for a technological authority.  It is an obscure proposal and it is difficult to get to the bottom of it.  They say that this authority would have a function in the distribution of finance.  One cannot reconcile the distribution of finance to university faculties with the proposal that there should be a Commission for Higher Education to channel finance through from the Government to the universities.  This proposal for technological authority seems misconceived.</P>
    <P>Again, as regards the teaching profession, the proposal that the teachers should be associated with the new colleges and not with the universities is unsatisfactory.  The whole question of teacher training is something we need to look at.  I commend to the Minister the Fine Gael proposals on this point which have been carefully thought out and which may provide the basis of a solution.  We have been careful to declare <Col N="327" /> that they may not be the only possible solution but may be the best. They should be looked at carefully. We believe all teachers should have university education and not new college education.  Their university education should involve some current training in educational practice followed by a specialised year of educational theory in practice.  This would provide a better and fuller training and would also enable us to produce more teachers for the training authorities which are in a bottleneck under the present system.  If students had to spend one year in the training college after three years in university this would make possible an expansion of the output of teachers.  This proposal is one which needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Certainly the whole role of St. Patrick's Training College needs to be looked at.  We cannot possibly overestimate the magnificent work done there, where there has been such enlightenment in changes and improvement, not only in the training of teachers but also in the field of educational research.  In fact, the only serious research is being done in St. Patrick's Training College and the whole question of educational research and training of teachers is something which needs to be looked at again in the context of all these changes and any changes that take place in St. Patrick's should play an important part.</P>
    <P>With regard to Cork and Galway, before coming to a conclusion on the question of the merger, I merely want to say one or two things as there are others here who will wish to say something on those.  There is evidence that there is a certain minimum size for a university to be viable.  This is not an absolute figure as that would depend on the range of faculties.  A university which had every possible faculty would need to be bigger than one with a narrow range but even with a narrow range of faculties there is a minimum size required before you get enough students to enable a fairly wide range of specialisation to be carried out and to make it possible in turn to give a sufficient <Col N="328" /> amount of research and to give the quality of education and university life required.  It should be a priority for Cork and Galway to reach this minimum level.  Without wanting to put too fine a figure on it there are many people who feel that something like 4,000 students would in the range of facilities in Cork and Galway represent a minimum viable level in which those universities would be able to operate more satisfactorily.  Indeed, some feel one should go beyond that figure.  But you can get loss of contact with students.  It is, in any event, a view which many people think represents a minimum.</P>
    <P>Every assistance should be given to those colleges now becoming universities to reach this figure very rapidly so that they may be able to offer the wide range of specialisation within the faculties they will have and carry on the necessary range of research that will be desired.  In order to secure that result, and in order to compensate for the undoubted disadvantage of their geographical position in terms of attracting academic staff, these colleges should get preferential financial treatment, whether by way of grants or preferential treatment to students going there by way of scholarships, or both, and that is something which one should consider further.</P>
    <P>There is a case for differential treatment.  It is difficult for these colleges to attract staff.  The fact that this kind of problem can exist is recognised elsewhere.  In Queen's University in Northern Ireland in order to attract professors from Britain they are offered the mid-point, of three points, on the professional scale at entrance. A person who would be appointed at the bottom of the scale in Britain automatically goes to £400 higher in Queen's, but once they trap him he gets no more.  The maximum salary is the same as in Britain.  In this way they attract people.  Of course, Queen's is less attractive than Oxford or Cambridge or London, from the point of view of people in Britain.  We may have a similar problem here.  There may be difficulty in filling posts in Cork and Galway.  We have experience of civil servants at the moment which <Col N="329" /> is an example of that Dublin people do not like to leave Dublin.  To attract as wide a range as possible of people not only from Dublin but from outside Ireland some preferential treatment, or differential arrangement, is required.  It is important that if they become independent universities they should be given every possible opportunity to become successful ones.  Any cheeseparing in respect of Galway or Cork could be very seriously damaging in the long run and it is the opinion in the other colleges that preference should be given Cork and Galway at this point so that they should have a good start as independent universities.</P>
    <P>We have one other college, Maynooth. What role it should play in Irish education is an open question.  It does not appear that within the college there is general agreement as to how its role might develop and its governing body may not have decided.  If it is decided that Maynooth should become a full university college, a normal university with its own governing body chosen in the same way as the other universities, I am sure the staffs of the other colleges would welcome it as, say, another college of UCD.  That view has been expressed by the Irish Federation of University Teachers.</P>
    <P>Now what about the Dublin situation, this most critical and sensitive problem at the moment?  There has been some criticism of the Minister for intervening and of the timing of his intervention.  It may be that only such an intervention could have got something done in that area.  The Minister may be forgiven for thinking that there was a certain lack of progress in this area and that some kind of push was needed if progress were required.  Perhaps the first push came in the Fine Gael policy document at the end of November.  That document stated that Fine Gael favoured one effective policy-making university authority in Dublin and that, even though there had been ecclesiastical problems in the past, if the Government tackled them they could be overcome.</P>
    <P>That document was issued in November and I am glad the Minister, <Col N="330" /> in December, went to the Government with proposals.  I hope the fact that Fine Gael had committed themselves on this point helped him, if it did not even inspire him to do so.  The fact that he had the assurance that if he did take this step he would not be attacked in the rear by the Opposition made it easier for him.  In any event, he made the announcement.  He has indicated on occasions when he has addressed various bodies of university people that what he visualises and what the Government visualise is a university with two colleges as far as possible complementary and, in a gloss on his original document, when interviewed by the educational correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> he envisaged that this concept of two colleges, as far as possible complementary, did not include unnecessary duplication.  He realised that one cannot be doctrinaire in this matter&mdash; that it might well be necesary, while we can, to achieve economic and academic advantages.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal does not, as I understand it&mdash;I hope he will confirm this when he speaks&mdash;visualise a university with two colleges one of which would consist of certain faculties and the other with other faculties.  Such a university has been proposed.  In one article devoted to this subject it was suggested that a desirable solution would be a university with two colleges, one with arts and science faculties and the other with all the other faculties. Such a university would comprise two geographical sites.  To call them colleges would appear to be an abuse of the term as we have come to understand it in these islands, because the university would be a single whole with certain institutions in different sites, as indeed UCD is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Colleges which did not have a certain range of discipline, colleges which lack science faculties, would not be ordinary university colleges in the term used in these islands and I do not think it was the Minister's intention to suggest such a structure.  Several small faculties which are so small that they are not economically viable as separate units, where there are no strong grounds for their retention as such, <Col N="331" /> should be merged so that any economies to be gained may in this way be reached.</P>
    <P>After the Minister's speech, Professor Chubb said on television that the economies to be gained are not great. Perhaps the economies to be gained now are not but the potential economies may be considerable.  The Government, in planning university education in the years ahead, can legitimately want to ensure that there is not set up duplication of faculties in two places which would be uneconomical. The actual economies to be achieved at this point of time are not very great because the bulk of the students are in such large departments that the merger in one department would not bring any economies, only greater confusion.  When there is a case for merging, when the faculties are small, the cost would not be great.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against the merger on these grounds.  Any economies that can be achieved should be gained, but the great merit of the Minister's proposal lies not in economies at present or, indeed, in the future, but in the raising of academic standards which would be achieved in a university of two colleges, complementary as far as possible, in which the range of specialisation of staff would be open to all students.  At the present time we have in both colleges, and in most departments, excellent staffs but in neither college have we got all the available experts.  Even the largest departments could benefit, certainly at post-graduate and possibly at higher undergraduate levels.  The standard of the education now available would be considerably enlarged by merging two small staffs into one or at any rate making their services available to the students in either college.</P>
    <P>The academic gains from the merger would be great, the economic gains small.  Of course, the potential economic gain is significant but not nearly as great as the academic gains.  Let us consider the alternatives.  One alternative proposed by the Governing Body of UCD was not acceptable to the Minister.  It was that there should be <Col N="332" /> one university with one college.  The Minister has ruled this out on the grounds that we have two institutions with traditions of their own and that he does not wish to wipe out either but to bring them closely together for the economic and academic benefit of the community.  Another view is that there should be two universities but that they should be totally complementary. Another is that the university would be one, with one college but with sub-institutions.  The objections to this are several.  First, it would not meet the Minister's requirement that the identity of the two be maintained and their traditions preserved.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that if you put arts and science into Belfield and the professional faculties into College Green you could not say the traditions of Trinity College would be retained. Nor would UCD, endowed only with arts and science faculties, be the kind of college it has been in the past or that many of its staff and students would like to see in the future.  A college lacking any of the professional faculties at all will spend a large part of its time providing service teaching.</P>
    <P>That arrangement does not seem very viable particularly when one considers what the teaching services are in Stephen's Green and science in Belfield. Something like five-sixths of the teaching will have to be done by UCD staff. Most of the science work must be done where there are laboratories, which are situated in Belfield.  Moreover, in latter years, no fewer than 14 departments provide all the services for teaching for university faculties, so throughout the life of the student he would find not alone during his first year that the teaching would be in a different college from the one he nominally belongs to but in the years which follow he would be either going to the other college or be taught by teachers from the other college.</P>
    <P>It is an abuse of the term to have two such institutions.  Another alternative, of course, would be to put arts in one place and science in another and associate with each the relevant faculties. You would then have a liberal Arts College and a technological institution. <Col N="333" /> You would have a divided university system along lines which are not traditional in this country and which have been found elsewhere to be unsatisfactory. In other countries where you have such institutions, and an attempt to divide them in this way, it has been found to be educationally unsound.  This would again destroy the traditions of both colleges and it would end that there would only be a small degree fewer problems as regards the students.</P>
    <P>It does not appear, therefore, that any merger which involves a complete segregation of faculties is workable. The fact we are faced with here is an unalterable one, that is, that there are two sites.  There are problems of tradition and problems of identity, but due to the passage of time those could be got over if there were seen to be advantages, if both colleges were prepared to work together, to forget traditions, to forget identity.  The fact that there are two colleges creates insuperable difficulties.  You either separate them or they are both truncated. Agriculture could be attached to the Albert College but you have to watch that you do not separate the students and deprive them of the full educational facilities and also deprive the staff of frequent contact with people in other faculties.  This is very useful to the staff.  I am afraid that any such policy would be unworkable.  Moreover, it is unnecessary.  While nobody would make any difficulty about the merging of some departments, where there is an economic case to do so, the merging of larger departments has been shown to be unworkable and is quite undesirable.</P>
    <P>When you have, for example, 300 first year students in one class and 1,200 in another&mdash;those are real figures for some subjects&mdash;there is no conceivable economy to be gained by putting them together.  You cannot fit them in any one room and it would be most undesirable to build a room to fit them. We are already in the position in University College that we have to divide groups into as many as four divisions of 300 in each.  There is no economy, that means a proposal to <Col N="334" /> increase the space would not be of any value.  Indeed it would aggravate the very great problems of large numbers which we already face by putting two lots of large numbers together, thereby worsening the position of students, which certainly does not improve their position.</P>
    <P>Some of the ways in which large numbers affect students are not readily understandable.  I have only just discovered one particular aspect of it which had not struck me before as it is some years since I was a student and when I was a student the classes were smaller.  It has been pointed out to me by a student that it is almost impossible for students readily to get to know each other because if you were sitting in a class of students where there are large numbers you are very seldom sitting beside the same person twice. One effect of the present system is that people intend to keep in touch with those they knew at school and not to make any new acquaintances.  The students are not integrating together in the university community because it is physically impossible for them to do so because of the large numbers.</P>
    <P>From this emerges a picture of how the universities might work in accordance with the Minister's prescription and the problems involved in having two colleges, one in College Green and the other in Belfield.  Each would have a group of arts subjects and also science subjects.  Certain faculties would be in one and others would be in the other.  You would have between a half a dozen and a dozen arts subjects taught in both as they are at present, the other smaller arts subjects would be merged and they would be in one or other college.  The common subjects taught in both colleges would need to be closely co-ordinated if the full academic merits of the Minister's merger are to be gained.  How would this be effected?  It has been suggested by the Irish Federation of University Teachers that where you have parallel departments in the two colleges and maintained because the numbers are so great that to put the two departments in one joint one would be impossible, that faculty would be responsible <Col N="335" /> for the courses in the two colleges and would directly operate the post-graduate courses so that as I mentioned earlier there would be a single post-graduate school so that they would both link.  Such a structure seems to many of us to be workable.  It seems to us it will not meet the Minister's prescription as laid down.  It would give us two colleges, each maintaining its identity and its traditions, working together.  The question of the economic gain would be such that the larger subjects would be taught in both colleges and yet the post-graduate subjects would be organised by a single university and staff, both departments working closely together.</P>
    <P>This, I feel, is what we should be moving towards and I would hope that out of the Minister's merger proposals and out of the discussion now in progress something of this kind would emerge.  It would have the merit also of avoiding the complex movements of students and staff implicit in the other proposal because under this system the main service teaching subjects like mathematics and economics would be in both colleges subjects which serve other faculties, and this would mean that the students in a scientific discipline in UCD would be served by a mathematician in that college and the scientifically orientated students in Trinity would be catered for by the Maths.  Department in Trinity College. This would get over this mass movement. If the other proposal were accepted all the first year students of the one college would have to be contained in the other.  It is a practical system, probably the only practical system.  We know that an attempt to impose the other system would prove unacceptable to many people.  We have the views of Professor Chubb of TCD and Professor Meenan of UCD making it clear that the faculties should be located in one or other college but separately for the two colleges without any common element would be unacceptable to them and they represent, indeed, a large body of opinion.</P>
    <P>This was evident from the unanimity of the report prepared by the Federation <Col N="336" /> of University Teachers representing teachers of all the colleges, Cork, Galway, Maynooth as well as the two Dublin colleges.  They met in Maynooth last summer and reached a unanimous view on the shape of the new university and their view represents the majority view in both colleges.  I hope the Minister will have regard to it and I trust that the negotiating teams from the two colleges will have regard to it in the negotiations at present in progress.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the new university there must be a strong university authority, not alone co-ordination of parallel departments, but the authority itself must be strong.  The Minister has made this point in what he has said to the universities and in his original statement and I think he is right.  I might not agree with him in every detail.  He may have to reconsider his proposal that all property would be owned by the university.  I feel this makes nonsense of his other suggestion that the authority would be free to seek endowments from students.  I feel that the common ownership of property is a mistake.  However, I feel the university authority would need to be strong. It would need the power to ensure adequate co-ordination of the colleges in the future.  On this there are divergent views in the colleges but I think in principle the Minister is right though one may disagree with him on points of detail.  He has proposed that the university authority should be composed of equal representation from the two colleges and government representation. This is a hard pill for UCD to swallow because we are much larger than Trinity College.  It is asking a lot that we should accept in those circumstnces a position of equality with a much smaller college.  I believe, nevertheless, that this will be accepted in the spirit in which it is meant, as a generous gesture to the smaller college and regarding the smaller college as still representing in some measure a religious minority in this country although these religious divisions we hope will disappear completely in the new university, where they will cease to be relevant.  One of the advantages of the Minister's policy is that it has <Col N="337" /> led to the disappearance of these divisions already.  Their formal disappearance we hope will follow.</P>
    <P>On this university authority the Minister proposes to have public representatives. This is an innovation for Trinity College and they may fear it. Our experience has been to the contrary. I hope the Minister will maintain the tradition which has been maintained by his Government and other Governments over the years of appointing people of eminence to represent the public interest, who would be free to disagree with the Government's views or the views of the Civil Service and to represent the public interest in an independent manner and I think we can look forward to the contribution that those independent members will make.</P>
    <P>The question of how many there should be is a matter of opinion.  The universities have recommended one-third. The Minister has spoken of a half and expressed his willingness to accept a small figure but it is still a matter for negotiation.  Most people will wish that the number would not be one-third but somewhat less.  However, that is a matter which can be discussed. They will have a very important role to play in the early stages because there will probably remain at the beginning some rivalry between the two colleges and the independent members will have to hold a difficult balance especially in view of the fact that the representatives on this body will be so representative of the principles of the two colleges.</P>
    <P>I hope that the constitution of the colleges will be democratic and by democratic I mean that they will be run internally, by their own internal academic staffs and that they will not be so organised as to operate in an autocratic manner.  There is a real difficulty here because academics are not the best people to organise administrative matters.  On the other hand, a university in which the administrators are dominant and control the activities of the academics is a very unsatisfactory place to live and one in which there would be great tension.  A compromise has to be found in which there is a democratic constitution and the governing <Col N="338" /> authority of the college the academic council representing all the staff, not just selected or senior staff but all the staff but where they have the good sense and are required by the constitution to appoint administrative officers with the necessary authority to get things done.  It is difficult to maintain this balance.  It is not certain that in the existing colleges this has been maintained and it is a matter that is very important.</P>
    <P>The Commission put the emphasis on academic control by proposing that the President should serve for a relatively short period of five to seven years instead of up to retirement at the age of 70.  They have pressed for the introduction of a rather more democratic system than there has been hitherto, in some at least of the colleges. They have also suggested that with the exception of the President university officers should not be members of the governing body.  I hope the Minister in any proposals he has to make will have regard to these recommendations.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to thank the Minister for coming here today and to apologise for the inordinate length of my remarks which have exceeded the length of time of my remarks on any other subject in this House to date. They would have been longer but for the fact that the debate has been circumscribed and for that I think everyone will be thankful.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to range over the wide field so ably covered by Senator Garret FitzGerald. I shall confine my remarks to the section of the Report of the Commission which deals with the teaching profession. At the outset I would like to say that the Minister who is here today has succeeded in democratising secondary education to a very considerable extent. We hope that he will also succeed, partially probably at the outset and completely in long term in democratising university education.  I believe personally that every individual has the right to travel along the educational road <Col N="339" /> as far as his ability and perseverence can carry him.  He should have the chance to realise his full potential as an individual.  Society demands that we should not neglect the pool of ability in the community.  There is a well-established link between the standard of education and social, cultural, economic and technological standards.  I think the obstacles on the road to university education should be minimal so that we would have at the disposal of the community the best brains regardless of wealth or means.  In making a statement of that kind one finds oneself in accord with thinkers not only in the socialist world but also with thinkers in the spiritual world.  It might help the Minister, somewhat, to hear a quotation from a letter sent by His Eminence Cardinal Cicognani, in the name of His Holiness the Pope to a congress of Pax Romana, in Montevideo, He said:</P>
      <P>Who cannot but feel the imperative need for the university to open its doors to all who seek knowledge, rather than to reserve its instruction for those persons privileged by birth and good fortune?</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission has very welcome wonderful contributions to make to education.  On page 37, however, there is an unwelcome recommendation on teacher training.  The recommendation states:</P>
      <P>The course for national teacher training should be extended from two to three years.  The national teacher training colleges should be associated with the new colleges.  The training colleges should form the educational departments of the new colleges and would look to the new colleges for teaching the general subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say as a teacher who has been trained in a training college and who has also acquired the training required by a secondary teacher that I completely disagree with this recommendation on several grounds.  It would lead to a dilution of standards in the teaching profession.  At the moment following the recommendations of a committee set up under the auspices of the Department of Education <Col N="340" /> an entrant to a training college requires a minimum of three honours and the 476 people called to the training colleges this autumn have fulfilled that requirement.  To suggest, therefore, that teacher-training should be linked with the new college which requires an entry standard of only pass leaving certificate with 50 per cent in two subjects would lead to a lowering of standards, and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Our profession has been looking for a training college-university link for many years but we would prefer to forgo that demand rather than be linked with the new colleges because their entrance standards would be lower than those required at the present time for the training colleges. We consider the recommendation retrograde and that it would be a divisive force.  It would lead to odious and invidious comparisons among teachers. Throughout the world an effort is being made to unite the teaching profession. There is only one art in teaching, varying with the particular age group being taught.  In the lower group one has to adopt certain methods whereby involuntary attention is produced because children are not capable of self help.  As one moves up the scale children are able to perform acts of the will and at university level students can rely on their own determination and initiative to make progress. The principles of the imparting of knowledge and cognition are well established.  A teacher has, however, to adapt his techniques to suit the particular age group he has to teach.</P>
    <P>There is only one art of teaching and we cannot see why there should not be only one teaching qualification. We think the time has come when the teaching profession should be united through a common qualification based upon a four-year course linked with or within a university.  The teacher of the future will need broad horizons. He will teach children who are being reared in a very complex world.  In the past education was mainly an affair of the family and of the community and patterned on the moral order of that community.  There is a disappearance of the close knit society of the past and children are now reared in <Col N="341" /> an atmosphere which is influenced by factors inimical to their orderly upbringing. The teacher of the future will have to assume a new importance.  The role of the teacher of the future is, therefore, of vital significance in the orderly development of the community.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the suggested standard required for entrance into the new colleges.  It is instructive to examine the results of the Leaving Certificate of those 173 students who were this Autumn accepted into St. Patrick's College.  Six students had nine honours; 20 had eight; 16 had seven; 25 had six; 36 had five; 46 had four; 23 had three, the minimum qualification.  In the overall achieving an average of 5.3 honours for the 173, and the Commission asks us to accept the standard required for the new college.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in the report is most retrograde and as far as we in the INTO are concerned will be resisted with every force at our disposal. We could not accept that dilution at all.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald has referred to the low entrance standard for university. We think there should be an upgrading of the entrance standard requirements into universities.  We think there is an unanswerable case for a link between training colleges and the university on the basis of the results I have read.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the development of the teaching profession one would find the statement from Sir Charles Mallet who was the historian of Oxford, very interesting.  He points out that originally a degree was a licence to teach, that the original function of the university was to produce teachers.  Each student took what were known as the seven liberal arts and it was only at a later stage that the schools of law and medicine were added.  In the Gaelic monastic schools teachers set up institutions which in turn set up further schools.  Law and medical schools in Ireland were based on families and had no link with the original monastic schools in which the students learned the seven arts to become teachers.  In <Col N="342" /> Scotland every teacher is a graduate and suggestions in 1961 that there should be a dilution of this were strongly resisted and reached the point of teachers going on strike.</P>
    <P>Due to the demand for education in the nineteenth century, <i>ad hoc</i> establishments such as training colleges were set up but the time has passed for the continuance of these <i>ad hoc</i> colleges as such.  We shall have to look to a reorientation of the functions of the training colleges and ensure that training for the teaching profession is once more based in the university.  The claim for a link with the university is not a new one.  Many years ago, Dr. Walter Starkie, resident Commissioner for National Education, stated:</P>
    <P>The need for co-ordination in Ireland is undeniable.  It is not of recent date.  The teachers, from the earliest times, are cribbed, cabined and confined within the narrow curriculum of the primary school and of a Training College.  The primary school is the bedrock upon which the whole structure is based and if there is such a thing as continuity in mental development, it should be leavened with the broad and liberal ideas which have their source in the university.</P>
    <P>In 1908, the link between the teachers' training colleges and the university was recommended in a paper read to the Maynooth Union and in 1923 a joint body representing the university colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway, and representatives of the INTO recommended that &ldquo;on and after a certain date to be hereafter determined, a professional degree shall be necessary for first recognition as a national teacher&rdquo;. This was referred to by Monsignor Alfred O'Rahilly at a national teachers' congress in 1923 and he reiterated it as President of University College, Cork. Therefore, we can say that the suggestion to link training colleges with our universities is by no means a new one.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the wide field of university education.  Senator FitzGerald has given us a wonderful contribution here on the necessity for the development of university education and I take it our colleagues from <Col N="343" /> Trinity College will significantly add to it.  I will conclude by saying that national teachers will resist to the utmost the suggestion that the training of national teachers should be linked with the new colleges.  I ask the Seanad to support the suggestion that in the near future the training colleges will be linked with the university.</P>

      <P>We all know the report of the Commission on Higher Education was a long time in reaching us and I suppose each of us who has a special knowledge of some aspect of this will find fault with various things that appear in it.  However, we must all agree that the report itself is a remarkable document, that the work done by this Commission during this period of years represents the most important contribution to the position of higher education in this country that has ever been made.  Having read through the report, one could not but be impressed not only with the work that went into it but by the fact that this numerous body of people reached almost unanimous decisions on certain matters that are obviously very controversial. Their thinking is set before us in an attractive way.  I felt when the document was put in my hand that I should never read such a thing but when I picked it up I found it was difficult to put it down.  This is a tribute to the Commission and to the people who produced the document.</P>
      <P>I will follow Senator Brosnahan's example and not deal with the report in general, though there are lots of things I could say about it.  I will try to deal in a particular way with its references to my own interests in medicine and research, particularly medical research.  Meanwhile, I should like to express support for Senator Brosnahan in the position he has taken up about the training of primary teachers.  A motion was debated in the House some months ago in which this view received some support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chapter on medical education is the longest in the report.  This is understandable to anybody involved in this field because in the university it is <Col N="344" /> probably the most controversial subject. This I used to think was the misfortune of a man but, having had a great deal of experience in other places, this is not so.  Medical education is controversial for a number of reasons.  First of all, it is very expensive. Secondly, a large chunk of the work has to be done, in the nature of things, in institutions over which the university has no control and a large number of the teachers, who are eminent in their own way, are not acquainted with the university in the ordinary way.  In such circumstances it is understandable that the university authority should be somewhat bewildered with the whole structure. Then there is the mystique of medicine and the trade union of doctors; and all sorts of pressures are brought to bear when medical education is discussed in the university.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is understandable that this chapter should have caused the Commission a certain amount of trouble.  We take first of all their references to the numbers of students and of doctor graduates.  On page 242 they set out the numbers and point out that in most schools there was a reduction in numbers in the mid-fifties.  This took place because at that time we had a number of visitations, like the General Medical Council and a number of Americans and they found that our facilities were terribly bad and they made adverse reports.  In Trinity College we decided that because we had not got money to improve the staff-student ratio and could not improve the facilities in our hospitals, the only thing we could do was to reduce the student numbers, which we did drastically.  This was in accordance with the recommendation on page 256 of the report of trying to fit our work to our resources.  We were doing that ten years ago in the medical school.</P>
    <P>However, during the past four or five years, great improvements have taken place in the facilities.  We now have a better arrangement in our hospitals and we are, therefore, justified in increasing student numbers.</P>
    <P>At the moment I think the non-medical students in Trinity College cannot be very much shorter than 350. <Col N="345" /> It is certainly over 300 in the medical course proper.  At one stage, about ten to 15 years ago, and, perhaps, as recently as five years ago, the percentage of non-Irish in the medical school was quite high, somewhere about 25 to 30 per cent.  This, during the last few years, has diminished very steadily and at the moment I do not think it is more than 12 per cent.  I am speaking particularly of the people admitted at the beginning of the present session which I think was about 12 per cent of the number of admissions who are not normally resident in this island.  Of that 12 per cent we have definitely decided they would be now limited to applicants from developing countries. We would reserve places for them and to sons and daughters of Irishmen or Irish graduates who are working in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have good reasons for both of those decisions.  We want to help those developing countries and we have over the years established relations with those so that we now have sons and daughters of graduates from those countries coming to join our medical school and we welcome them.  The graduates of Irish universities or Irishmen who are not graduates, who are residing in other countries, not necessarily born there, can come back here and it is rather hard to say: &ldquo;You are no longer Irish and, therefore, we cannot consider your children.&rdquo; Therefore, we take those students in.</P>
    <P>It is a competitive situation and the numbers are so large that it is not merely sufficient to gain two honours in the Leaving Certificate or two A level passes in D. grade, which admits you to the university.  If you want to get into the medical school you have got to be better because otherwise you will not be good enough.</P>
    <P>The Commission have got a certain amount to say about the numbers qualifying.  This is something we are all used to.  We are asked why we produce such a large number of doctors, that only about 100 a year is needed. We are asked why we go on producing over 300, particularly when we talk about the expense of medical education, that it looks as if we are <Col N="346" /> giving away a most expensive article when we allow our medical graduates to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is a complex situation.  We only need about 100 medical people to staff permanent posts in this country in medical practice but there are two grades of medical practice.  There are temporary posts which are held by junior doctors in hospitals all over the country as well as the permanent posts in the health services or in private practice.  Now, we need a great deal more people to fill the temporary posts, the junior posts.  In this country, at the moment, there are certainly many such posts being held and filled by graduates from Asian universities, who are really sometimes not awfully familiar with the language that is generally spoken in this country.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a situation which is even more forcibly felt in other places.  In Britain there are many provincial hospitals in which the patient finds it very hard to get efficient treatment because the junior doctor in charge cannot understand him.  He has qualified in Pakistan or somewhere else like that and he is only coming here in the hope of gaining a higher degree and holding a post in the meantime. Every dean in this country is probably familiar with the procession of deans from America in the summer time who are looking for young graduates who will go out and accept those posts.  In various parts of America there is a general dearth of those graduates.  In this country we can only fill those junior posts every year by the graduates who qualify in our medical schools when we allow for those who want to go and do this junior work in hospitals elsewhere.  We have great difficulty in filling posts even in our teaching hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report brushes this aside rather lightly by saying: &ldquo;There were many of those posts&rdquo;&mdash;it realises this&mdash;&ldquo;where we must take into account the number of temporary junior hospital posts which might have to be converted into permanent posts if they could no longer be filled on a temporary basis only.  A clear estimate of this requirement would certainly be beyond the scope of our terms of reference.&rdquo;<Col N="347" /> They are certainly right in that. It would require such a review that it would be a very formidable undertaking because it would involve a review of the whole staffing structure of our hospitals in this country, particularly our teaching hospitals, in which by tradition the students at this stage are really apprentices and doing the most important part of their learning.  I think, in relation to the number of doctors we need and the number the medical schools should qualify, there would have to be a great deal more careful consideration given to that particular problem than the Commission have given.</P>
    <P>Now, in the medical schools all the students take their courses in pre-clinical and clinical subjects.  There is not much to be said about the pre-clinical. It has been part and parcel of the university and it has been welcomed by the training schools.  The first pre-clinical school here was established in 1711 so it is quite an ancient section of the university.  However, things evolve in this sphere also and as in other matters nothing ever gets easier.  It always gets more difficult and more expensive.</P>
    <P>A recent General Medical Council recommendation encouraged medical schools to experiment and experiment in new methods of teaching.  The older methods were the cheapest we could have.  You had large lecture rooms in which one teacher lectured to 100 or perhaps 150 students.  You then examined those by written examination and an oral test.  The teacher very rarely got to know those students.  The new suggestion is that teaching should be done in much smaller groups of ten, 15, or 20 people, that each subject would be taught not just by itself but in association with others in a disciplinary manner and that you should give up this business of a wholesale formidable examination every year or every two years and embark on the person's continuous assessment in which you can arrive at the merit of the student because you know him. You have got to know him and his value, whether he is working or not and if he understands his stuff or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> This is going to mean an awful lot more staff and it is, therefore, going to be more difficult and more expensive but all the same it is not so difficult as the clinical section because at least in the pre-clinical period the university is in charge and nobody in the university can deny that these departments are part and parcel of the structure of the college.  However, when you come to the clinical side you have to make arrangements with the hospitals and this is where you meet the real trouble. The teaching hospital must be different from another hospital.  It needs more space.  The students have to have rooms to be taught in and laboratories to work in.  It needs a higher staff-patient ratio because a doctor who is teaching students cannot spend so much time with his patients.  Therefore, he can only have a fewer number of patients. It needs a wider scope of investigative facilities because the students cannot be put off with being told: &ldquo;Such and such a person discovered this in such and such a place at such and such a time and you must be satisfied with that.&rdquo;  They must be shown it and the investigations must be carried out on the spot, very often when they do not appear to be completely necessary for that particular patient because the doctor knows well enough what is wrong but he must demonstrate it to the student.  Then they must provide for research by the staff involved in teaching.  In hospitals just as in other places staff must be involved in research and provision must be made for it.</P>
    <P>Finally, there must be post-graduate training.  The General Medical Council recommendations refer to the scope of their document as basic medical education and this takes you up to the end of the first year.  If you pass your final examination at that stage you are expected to have completed your basic medical education and to have embarked on the road for qualifying yourself to take on patients.  This means that the hospital situation must be looked at extremely carefully.  Quite obviously, the commission has appreciated this very clearly and if nothing else had been done by this commission and even if they had spent the whole of their time reaching the conclusions <Col N="349" /> that they have reached in this chapter about the clinical situation in our medical schools here, their report I think would have been worth while.</P>
    <P>The situation is unsatisfactory but, of course, it has improved a great deal. When the first lot of General Medical Council visitors came here in 1954 or 1955 I happened to be one of those appointed by the GMC to take part in this process and having gone round all the other schools in Britain and come back to my own, I was actually rather dismayed and I could understand why my colleagues on that team found such great difficulty in doing what they wanted to do, namely, to be kind to the schools in Dublin because they knew they were not very well placed; but at the same time they had to be factual and some of the facts they revealed were pretty brutal.  There were some hospitals in Dublin, ten general teaching hospitals.  None of them had any connection with any of the others and none of them had any formal connection with any medical school system.</P>
    <P>The hospitals had students from all three medical schools.  Some had a majority from one or other or the third. Many students had all three hospitals and no method of co-ordination was used.  A student might hear about rheumatism today in one hospital and tomorrow someone else told him that what he heard the previous day was all wrong.  This went on the whole time. Therefore, our report was not very satisfactory.  We have improved on that because the schools in Dublin have made agreements with the groups of hospitals to which their students go and one particular group of seven hospitals with which I am associated have got together and agreed that they will form a federation in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and waste of resources. The one thing that remains now is for the hospitals themselves to be put into proper shape.</P>
    <P>There is no modern teaching hospital in Dublin.  There is one at Elm Park about to be completed for the Sisters of Charity and this will be a good hospital but it is a hospital which was planned a good while ago so, <Col N="350" /> therefore, I think, although I shall not say anything about the details of it, that even those who planned it would agree that since it is so long in the building it may even now not be absolutely up to date.  However, it will be a very good teaching hospital but it is not yet in use.  The seven hospitals that have formed the federation need a building into which they can come and carry out their teaching in a properly co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The medical school of the University of Dublin which is one of the oldest in these islands is now the only medical school in these islands not to have a teaching school, that is to say, a hospital of substantial size, of 400, 500 or 600 beds.  We have not got that at the moment and we have been in existence since 1711.  In fact, the first professor of medicine was appointed in 1662. We are all hoping that arising out of these recommendations the Minister for Health and Minister for Education will get together and produce for us a satisfactory teaching hospital.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to the difficulty of the relationship between the medical school and the teaching hospitals. This is something we are all aware of. Nobody could be dean of a medical school for five minutes without knowing all about this.  When I took on the job of dean of the School of Physics in Trinity College I managed to get a grant to enable me to travel around America and see how deans in American schools got on with their teaching hospitals.  I visited 18 or 20 schools and in the course of the six weeks I was there three deans were sacked because they could not get on with their teaching hospitals.  I returned with some trepidation to my job. Always you have to try to bridge the gap between the independent whose viewpoint is absolutely invaluable to the students because it is independent and the ordinary formal teacher that the medical school employs and sometimes this is not easy.  The way in which it can be brought about is, of course, by close association.</P>
    <P>The deans who came to grief in America suffered because they tried to impose something on the hospitals <Col N="351" /> which the hospitals would not accept. They got themselves out on a limb and they could not get back.  You cannot do it that way.  You must try to work it out by association and the university on that account must be represented on the governing body of the hospital.  I feel this is essential. It is essential that there should be a definite agreement about what each has to do, the hospital on the one hand and the medical school on the other, with regard to the education of the student and it must be accepted that everything that happens in a teaching school is of interest in the education of students.  If the patients are badly fed, the hospital is not doing its job properly and this will reflect on the standard of the medical school eventually.  Therefore, you have to go right through the whole business of running a hospital when you become associated with it through medical teaching.</P>
    <P>The question of making appointments was referred to in the commission's report and there is a scheme worked out there which is good as far as it goes but I do not think it goes far enough.  I think that the arrangement we have worked out with the federated hospitals is as ideal as one could get.  Perhaps I might mention how it goes: the kinds of appointments that we have in these hospitals are divided into two.  There is the ordinary clinician who is appointed primarily for the purpose of looking after the patients in the hospital but must also take students and teach them.  There are the people who are clinicians but who were appointed primarily by the university to teach students as well as to go round and look after their patients.  You have those two categories of people, both hospital and university are represented in the appointment of every one of these.  If it is a university appointment there is a joint committee set up between the university and the hospital and the university has a majority on that joint committee.  If it is primarily a hospital appointment with teaching duties being subsidiary, as it were, then there is still a joint committee but the hospital will <Col N="352" /> have the majority on that joint committee.</P>
    <P>When a vacancy occurs an appointing committee is nominated and if it is a university appointment there is an external assessor and if it is a hospital appointment there is an external assessor. The people on the short list are interviewed by the committee and by the extern assessor and the report is issued jointly and both then have to jointly accept the nomination of the committee.  If either disagrees the whole process starts and the next person on this list is looked at, and so on, until you find someone mutually acceptable to the two places.  In any situation where a medical school and the new university in Dublin were to operate, a system like that would have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>The committee suggests that the teaching method for medical students would be a university hospital owned and run by the university for its medical school.  I do not agree with that.  I am familiar with academic bodies for a long time and I do not think that a university is the proper body to run a hospital.  It is far better to have the arrangement I have mentioned, where the university is involved in the running of a hospital, where it is run in agreement with the hospital about what is to be done by the two bodies and where there is a proper association in the matter of the making of appointments. Then, you do not want to involve the university people in the dreadful complications of the running of a hospital.</P>
    <P>The method of paying university staff in a hospital is important.  This has given a great deal of trouble everywhere.  You want to get the best staff but the best doctors can command salaries far higher than any university could pay any of its professors.  How can you get the best people to work in a medical school when your budget is so limited?</P>
    <P>It must be realised that the work the doctor does in the hospital, the ordinary clinical work, is part of the experience he has to have in order to teach and that it is right and proper for him to be paid for his work.  If he <Col N="353" /> cannot do that work he would be just as bad a teacher as a teacher of chemistry or physics who had not got the experience, so he is to be encouraged to do this work, be paid for doing this work and after that it depends on what arrangement you have with him about his salary.</P>
    <P>We in Trinity College like to appoint our professors and as many lecturers as we can afford in the clinical departments on a full-time work basis.  In other words, they do all their work inside the hospital where their appointments are.  They are not away from it on private practice elsewhere.  They are always there for the students.  If they work in the hospital they should be paid for it.  We pay the salary but we ask them to return to us anything they get through work elsewhere, including their hospitals.  This means that the expense to the university is not as great as it is in many of the ordinary Chairs in the College.  It also means, on balance, that these clinical teachers earn more than the average professor in the university.  This is fair enough; they have a considerable responsibility of clinical care.  Very often they have to leave their beds and they forgo weekends and sometimes holidays to look after their posts.  I do not grudge them the additional salary they get.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the merger between the two university colleges in Dublin, Trinity College and University College, will make the whole position of clinical teaching easier.  There are many thorny problems, as you will have gathered from what I have said, but the thorniest of all I have not mentioned and that is the development of the expensive specialised section of the medical faculties.  In some of these cases, while you are not in the realm of nuclear physics or anything like that, the cost is enormous.  The expense that must have been incurred in order to enable a South African surgeon to replace a man's heart by somebody else's heart must have been colossal. The trouble is that only a limited number of people benefit from this enormous expense, whereas the enormous amount of time the average doctor spends with patients is spent <Col N="354" /> on a much lower level of professional skill.</P>
    <P>We have to merge the two; we have to have a medical school which will cater for a large number of people who will be ordinary practitioners, but still make provision for the very expensive training of teachers who will by their skill be able to do these wonderful things, but in the knowledge, by and large, that they will not be dealing with as many people in the community as the less highly skilled, less highly qualified and probably less brilliant general practitioners.  The only way we in Dublin with our limited resources can get over this is by trying to pool these in somewhere.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when we have our three hospitals, the new hospital in Elm Park, the Mater Hospital, which is an excellent institution, and the federated hospitals, that these three will be able to look after all the specialities that are involved, and no one will have to have any highly specialised section that another has.  In other words, there will not be duplication or triplication as there is at present of many extensive and scarce facilities.  The students can rotate round these hospitals and benefit from these hospitals.  They will all be teaching hospitals of the medical faculty of the future university of Dublin.  All students can have appointments at these hospitals when they qualify and have their training there as junior students, and possibly even be on the staff subsequently.</P>
    <P>This is the state of affairs I look forward to.  As far as the medical school and medical future of this country is concerned, I think this would be a very important thing to emerge from this step.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced last March the joining of the two colleges in Dublin into a single university of Dublin.  There are two other factors which are not stressed in the report in relation to medical education and the medical schools.  There is reference in the report to the community association of medical schools.  They tend to play it down, to suggest that it is not a good thing for a university or medical school to be too involved with a community because this interferes with the <Col N="355" /> academic commitments of the people in the school.  This is so, of course.  It was held that the medical school should not be so involved with the community that it gets down to being the solver of <i>ad hoc</i> problems, producing short-term solutions to difficulties that very often ministerial Departments are presented with.</P>
    <P>When you have said that, you should also realise that there are vast advantages from a close involvement one with the other.  In my subject in particular we would be helpless without contacts with the community.  The community, one may say, is our laboratory; and this applies also to the schools of social studies and, I suppose, to the schools of business studies. It very particularly applies to the medical schools, and in particular to those aspects of the medical schools which are interested in community matters.  That is where we get our material.  But what can we or do we give in return?</P>
    <P>The community, as I have said, is our laboratory as far as we are concerned and therefore it follows from that that we should be able to carry out investigations on health services, on social services and various other kinds of community services, to find out what is the best type for that community. We could carry out experimental investigations into different types and so make our knowledge available to the community and to the people who are responsible for community operations.</P>
    <P>The report has missed just that point and I should like it to go on record that this is an important aspect of a medical school.  The second point that is not fully developed in the report is the relationship between medical science and the general sciences in the university.  Senator FitzGerald referred to service teaching.  This is in my view a bad word.  I do not like it at all.  I do not like somebody from a department being dragged along to teach at a relatively low level students in another faculty entirely, to give information to them and hope they will assimilate <Col N="356" /> it.  Very often this is not good.  I realise it is unavoidable to a certain extent, but we can avoid it in the medical schools by bringing our colleagues in the other sciences in closer association with our medical science subjects.  I should like to see the pre-clinical subjects taught in association with the biological science subjects, forming in that way a complexity of biological departments of which the medical student would be one element.</P>
    <P>I should like that extended to include the abnormal, so that you would have not only the normal but the abnormal in anything from the bacterial cell to the human being. Every aspect of biological study could be included.  In that way, you could have a basic science set up in relation to the pre-clinical sector of the medical school.  That is a further thing which could, with advantage, be developed in relation to the report.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with medical research for a couple of minutes.  Following the report on medical education proper in this chapter, there is a section on medical research and the Medical Research Council is especially referred to in it.  I have been a member of this council since it was founded and I have been honorary secretary for more than ten years.  The figures given in the report about the grants and their breakdown are accurate for last year. We have a little more money this year. We are an organisation with a turnover of something like £100,000.</P>
    <P>There are criticisms in this section of the report of the Medical Research Council&mdash;not very serious criticisms, not presented in any invidious way. However, one would get the impression from them that the council had somehow failed or not completely succeeded in certain respects.  First of all, it is stated that the programme of the Medical Research Council is not co-ordinated. We started off in 1937 with £5,000 a year.  We remained at that figure for many years.  It is only in the last few years that it became a subsidy of £20,000 or £30,000.</P>
    <P>We started off also without a single thing to build on in medical research. There were no departments to which <Col N="357" /> we could send a student to do research, to learn, because no research had been done.  We started far below the ground level in this matter and there was therefore nothing to co-ordinate then. We were given £5,000 a year.  That was very little, but the conditions in which it was given were less satisfactory even than the smallness of the amount, because there was no permanence.  We were told: &ldquo;You can have that for five years and then you can ask again.&rdquo; Then we were told that the grant we were given depended on the condition of the Hospitals Trust Fund, that we could not be guaranteed any increases, that we could not be given the additional sums we had asked for, that if the Hospitals Trust Fund were to collapse our position would become extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how you could produce a co-ordinated programme if the amount of money you have to encourage the different aspects you are to co-ordinate is inadequate and if, in any case, you cannot depend on it over a period of years in the future.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, we have in the past five years begun to develop a plan for co-ordination.  We have set up committees to look after the fields of cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, pregnancy and congenital deformities, gastro-enterology and anaemia, endocrinology and metabolism.  Each of these is reviewing what is being done in this country in its own area and each is producing a co-ordinated plan for its own area.  We hope to discuss that in due course with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>On page 69 of the Commission's report there is reference to a statement by the Secretary of the Department of Health who is supposed to have said that the Department had drawn the council's attention to the need for coordinating its research programme and the greater value that was naturally to be expected from work carried out on a co-ordinated plan.  I have no recollection of ever having seen such an intimation from the Department of Health.  We have often asked them for suggestions on what we could do but we were told: &ldquo;That is your business. We are giving you such an amount of <Col N="358" /> money.  This is all we can afford.  Carry on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other thing is a national programme. We have not got a national programme.  You cannot produce a national programme in the circumstances which I have described.  We will do the best we can to do such a programme if there are funds available to develop the various aspects in it and if we are given a degree of permanence in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>We are concentrating on the co-ordination of the universities.  I am sure every right minded Irishman is in favour of this proposal of the Minister, provided that we gain more than we lose by it. Most of us are optimistic enough to believe that we will gain more than we will lose by it.  But there are grave risks.  At this early stage of the negotiations between the two university colleges I think it is well perhaps to emphasise those risks.  The main risk is the lowering of academic standards. This can be done in many ways.  We can overcrowd the new university of Dublin and this can soon lead to a situation which I had some experience of two years ago in the University of California, in Berkeley.  Berkeley is a great and noble university which became notorious about three years ago for student discontent and student riots, and for a while in that university the business of the university almost came to a standstill.  The students there were thoroughly discontented with their conditions.  They put forward as a reason for their discontent certain political principles but in fact, as the <Col N="359" /> Commission, whose Report I will read from in a moment, said, the real discontent of the students of Berkeley was that they felt they were not treated as university students ought to be.  Let me quote from this Report&mdash;I recommend it very strongly to anyone interested in the future of universities in this country and throughout the world.  It is entitled &ldquo;Education at Berkeley&rdquo; and was published by the University of California, Berkeley Academic Senate, in March, 1966.  On page 12 there is a section on &ldquo;The Missing College Community&rdquo; and I quote one or two sentences from it. I will return to it later on again.</P>
      <P>When a new student arrives here, he does not find a tight-knit college community.</P>
      <P>Again, later:</P>
      <P>In such a large student body with widely scattered residences and a high rate of turnover, it is hardly surprising that many students feel alone in a community of strangers. In the April 1965 survey, almost two-thirds of the students felt the University to be an &ldquo;impersonal institution,&rdquo; and one third agreed that they &ldquo;often feel lonely walking on campus even though there are crowds of people around.&rdquo;  Loneliness is one factor behind the decision of many freshmen and entering transfer students to drop out of Berkeley.  The women who transfer to other campuses of the University of California give as their main reason for leaving Berkeley their feelings of isolation because of its large size and impersonality.</P>
      <P>This is something we might run into in the new University of Dublin.  It is something we have to be very careful to avoid.  We find at the present time in Britain, as well as America, a deliberate policy of breaking down the large institutions into smaller bodies. The University of London is decentralising itself as far as possible.  In other cities in Britain more than one university is being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying this to advocate keeping the two colleges separate, but I am saying it to advocate keeping the <Col N="360" /> community spirit in both colleges.  In Oxford and Cambridge they have very wisely maintained the sense of a whole university combined with a college intimacy.  I think students in this country particularly need the sense of belonging to a community which values them.  I can see it in the recent impressive gatherings in University College Galway and in University College, Cork, a very strong potential for good or evil in Ireland within the next few years.  Those young students have a far greater sense of responsibility than we had as undergraduates 40 years ago.  They have a very great sense of responsibility but with it goes a far greater capacity for irresponsibility, if they feel frustrated.</P>
    <P>As I say, at the present time students are far less neutral.  They want to be positive, they want to co-operate and help in reforming the universities.  But this could be of very great danger for this country.  Therefore, at the beginning, I would appeal to the Minister and those negotiating at the present time for a new University of Dublin, not to overlook the need for promoting effective loyalty and a sense of belonging in the new university.  It would be rash and foolish indeed if, for the sake of this university to be, we were to destroy any emotions of that kind, valuable emotions, which exist at the present time.  I personally am speaking for Trinity College when I say there is some risk that valuable emotions might be lost.  That is something to be guarded against very strongly.</P>
    <P>The fact is that&mdash;I think we must speak frankly: what is the good of coming here to debate this matter unless we are frank?&mdash;most of us think that this proposal of a merger is a confounded nuisance.  Most of us feel in our heart of hearts that it is a confounded nuisance, but we also know that it is a necessary nuisance.  It is something which had to be done and the sooner we do it wisely the better. I regard it as being very like the economic unions which have become necessary, where similar conditions in the past would not have allowed this to happen, between France and Germany, for example.  What a great miracle this has been in our time, that <Col N="361" /> two ancient nations like France and Germany should come together and merge a good deal of their political power for the sake of greater prosperity and greater achievement! There is no reason why two bodies like Trinity College or University College Dublin should not come together similarly for the sake of mutual prosperity and efficiency.</P>
    <P>One of the great benefits of the Minister's action, as Senator Garret FitzGerald said, was to bring together two bodies which were for one reason or another not co-operating as they should.  There is rather a terrible phrase used in the Report of the Commission by a former President of UCD which says on page 417 of the report:</P>
    <P>A state of truceless cold war.</P>
    <P>That unfortunately was true on the whole.  But I would like to emphasise that the main fault was not on the side of TCD within the last 20 years.  We have attempted to operate in harmony but have failed.  We welcome, then, the necessity to co-operate, though in many ways it will give an enormous amount of trouble and anxiety to both bodies for the next year or so.  But if the economic union between two such disparate powers as France and Germany can succeed, then we certainly can succeed.</P>
    <P>The fact of course is that no university in Europe or the US can survive by itself, absolutely free and independent, at the moment.  Even Oxford and Cambridge now depend to a great extent on the Government of their country.  Since the Government of this country generously last year gave us over £600,000 towards the working of Trinity College the people of Ireland and the Government of Ireland are entitled to ask for efficiency and cooperation. So when we say we welcome the merger as we said in the beginning, we said it with truth, though at the same time when one is faced with the necessity to go through so many negotiations, to submit to so many anxieties, we wish it was not necessary.</P>
    <P>Clearly in the Ireland of 1967 the proper union of these two great institutions will be fruitful and valuable.  I am going to emphasise the year 1967. <Col N="362" /> The debaters here this afternoon up to the moment have wisely not looked backwards.  Neither shall I.  It will be better if we in these negotiations all look forward.  It is what happens in 1967, 1968 and 1969 that counts.  Let the dead past bury its dead.  However, clearly&mdash;and this I must say with all the emphasis I command&mdash;a worse university could emerge too.  It could emerge if we do the wrong thing.  We could destroy something that at the moment is reasonable, honourable and effective, and put something futile in its place.</P>
    <P>How could that be?  Worst of all if we established a university divided within itself, a university divided between hostile and dissatisfied factions. That would be ruinous to Irish education. It must be avoided at all costs. Secondly the result would be retrograde, the result would be depreciation rather than appreciation of our educational values, if we, as I have mentioned already, produced an overcrowded university, a university with insufficient laboratories, with insufficient classrooms, with insufficient teachers.  That would be going backwards.</P>
    <P>If we lowered our academic standards the same thing would hold. Senator Garret FitzGerald has also gone into this.  I need not dwell on it.</P>
    <P>Again we would be going backwards if the new university were too much under non-academic controls.  While I emphasise this I also know the Minister is conscious of it.  I am convinced that I am not saying anything against his opinion.  However, when Governments intervene, as intervene they must at times in university matters, there is the risk that as a result of their intervention they may keep too strong a control.  I hope that will not be.  We have a proud tradition in this country of academic independence.  I hope we will hold to it.  This is best for the country, as well as best for the universities. There is a risk too that by one means or other in the new university professors and lecturers might be appointed not for academic merit but for other reasons.  There are always pressures in every country, and not least in our own, to get people into jobs.  In some ways university jobs are <Col N="363" /> attractive in modern society, and the jobbers will always be at work.  I hope there will be strong safeguards built in against that tendency.</P>
    <P>There is a risk too that the new university might be too isolated, too insular, in the learned world of today. This is something to be guarded against.  I shall say something about it later on but there is that risk particularly if we cut down too much on the foreign intake as at present in Trinity College.  Further, to come back to the Berkeley situation, if we overcrowd our classrooms and our laboratories we may have student discontent.  At the moment in this country we are fortunate in not having students demonstrating violently against the governments of the universities.  But it could come.</P>
    <P>As I see it, then, in one of the two constituent colleges of the University of Dublin to be we have on the whole avoided these risks.  We in Trinity are not a divided university on this question of the merger.  There is a remarkable unanimity of opinion and remarkable unanimity in welcoming it in its best light.  Secondly, we are not yet gravely overcrowded.  We have a magnificent new library which is the admiration of all visitors.  Here the students have a great asset.  But suppose 1,000 or 2,000 students came crowding down from UCD, this library would soon become overcrowded and the advantage that the UCD students will gain will, I feel, be a loss to the nation, and to the disadvantage for learning in general.  There is this risk in the near future of saying: &ldquo;Crowd them in, it will be all right tomorrow&rdquo;. It is not fair to Irish education that one or two generations of students should suffer in that way, and I am very happy that the Report makes that point very carefully.</P>
    <P>Again I must emphasise that at present we think in TCD that we are helping to keep Irish university education from becoming too insular and too isolated.  We have been criticised for this.  We have been told, with some justice, in the Report of the Commission that we have had too many students from outside Ireland in TCD. <Col N="364" /> I would like to go into this in a little detail.  In fact it is the only grave criticism that the Report offers on TCD as it is at present.  Let me make it clear to the House how this situation has arisen.</P>
    <P>When I was an undergraduate in Trinity College just under 40 years ago there were about 1,200 students and over 90 per cent were Irish.  The English student was a rarity.  I have not got the exact figures because we did not classify them then but certainly I would stand on 90 per cent of the students being Irish.  We had only about 1,200 in all then.  Then came the war, and then came the tremendous demand from England and overseas for education.  From Nigeria students came in hundreds; from England they came in thousands.  Why could they come to TCD and not to UCD?  The answer is clear to all, though many people shirk it.  It is for the simple reason that Trinity College, Dublin is under the ecclesiastical ban of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.  It is as simple as that.  If we could have filled up those places 20 years ago with Irish people we would have done it gladly, but here we were in a situation in 1946 where British students and Nigerian students were crying out for education We could fit in 1,000, or 2,000 more. Irish students would not come to us because they were not allowed to come. Surely is was right that a foundation which was founded for the education of Ireland and after Ireland for the world should take in students from overseas.  Should we selfishly have shut our doors and kept ourselves comfortable at a 1,200 limit?  I do not think any fair man could advocate that. Indeed I have thought that the motto of the new university of Dublin should be the Papal locution <i>Urbi et Orbi</i>&mdash; for the city of Dublin and for the world.  In the past the city of Dublin has not been allowed to fill the university of Dublin.  So we filled it up with students from abroad.  Now the proportion of Irish students is suddenly growing, and from our point of view it is a happy change.  It would be unfair for anyone who takes the world view at the moment to say that Trinity College was wrong to take thousands <Col N="365" /> of British students and hundreds of African students.  These countries now have their universities, and we have an opportunity of taking in our countrymen.  So I sincerely hope that in the next few months the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will make it clear how Trinity College stands with regard to the ecclesiastical ban.  It would be unkind and unfair for Trinity College to be left in a state of uncertainty about this.  I appeal to them from this House to give a clear statement on what the position will be in the new university of Dublin.  It is unfortunate and inconsiderate that we have not had such a statement up to the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made it quite clear that the large proportion of overseas students in Trinity College Dublin in the past 20 years is an extremely unusual situation.  It has only happened for 20 years in almost 400 years; so, to take this as typical of Trinity is quite unfair.  But supposing we got this proportion down to zero, would that be to our advantage?  No one, in fact, has asked us to do that, because we would lose by not having strangers or visitors amongst us in the university.  Let me say this. English students have done a great deal for Trinity College, Dublin.  They brought in high standards, the latest educational ideas, and demands and have put us on our toes in ways that we tended to neglect in the good old days when we had a comfortable 1,200 Irish students.  We have gained from that, and I think Ireland has gained from that too.  It may be that all we had to gain is now gained.  But I would greatly dislike it if we had less than ten or 15 per cent of students from overseas bringing in their new ideas, helping us understand our neighbours, especially if we were helping them when they could not get the same kind of education elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One other harmful result of possible conditions emerging from the merger would be if students from Northern Ireland were discouraged from coming in to the new university in Dublin. I think, and I hope the Minister will agree with me, that this would be a great loss.  We cherish them for three <Col N="366" /> reasons.  One is that they are a living symbol of united Ireland.  Trinity has never recognised the Border, and this fact has been exemplified by the large northern proportion we have had all the time.  Secondly, it gives our students of the Republic a better opportunity of understanding the thorough-going true-blue unionism which some of them bring with them.  This is desirable. Also, they are good students. Our classical department would be very much impoverished if we had not these citizens from the North.  I hope this is one of the things that is clear and acceptable.  We have a very valuable asset here, and we should certainly not risk losing it.</P>
    <P>We have another asset which might be lost.  It is harder to assess and harder to value.  I shall not be sentimental or expansive about it.  In our college we have dignified ceremonies, a certain nobility of buildings, furnishings and grounds, created during hundreds of years.  You could ask does this add up to anything.  But I am convinced that some of you will agree that it does add up to something if it is preserved, and that we would be impoverished if it were lost.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking of the virtues of TCD.  Do not let me give the impression that I believe UCD has not special virtues of its own, too, which are worthy of preserving.  For example, there is the fine tradition of liberal nationalism which they have always had, and that is something that might be lost.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to details of the merger, I should like to comment on one or two things said in the debate earlier. I heartily welcome Senator Garret FitzGerald's speech.  Unfortunately, I missed some of it at the beginning.  It was statesmanlike; it was liberal-minded, and it was generous towards TCD.  If everyone in the negotiating body on both sides was in sympathy with Senator Garret FitzGerald I do not think we would go far wrong.  It is a very rare thing to hear such a judicious and sensible speech being made on so controversial a topic.</P>
    <P>I do not think the proposed &ldquo;new colleges&rdquo; are a desirable idea.  I think they will put certain Irish citizens into a kind of half-way house, between <Col N="367" /> university and non-university.  It would be much more desirable to have a University College, in Limerick, for example, if the Minister would see to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>He agrees with you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think these proposed colleges should be supported.  I have not heard of many educationalists who approve of them.</P>
      <P>The Senator also has spoken very effectively on the lowering of standards. He has also emphasised, and I add a word of emphasis of my own, the necessity for keeping step for step with University College, Cork, and University College, Galway.  We are interested in a special way in TCD in this.  In the merger you have a large monolithic campus in UCD.  If we in TCD can bring in other interests, it would broaden the field.  So we are not pure idealists in this, when we say that such decentralisation would be good.  At present the focus of attention is on UCD and TCD.  But the out-of-Dublin institutions should be built up to something like equals of the two Dublin colleges.</P>
      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald also emphasises&mdash;and I quote it again because it is a precious phrase&mdash;that the Minister says there will be some necessary duplication.  This is a wise phrase.  We must at all costs avoid the factory idea, the idea that universities can be streamlined like a factory. Here I should like to refer to the report on &ldquo;Education at Berkeley&rdquo;. On page 15 it reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature of many colleges which adds to the student's sense of belonging is close contact with members of the faculty.  A professor can assume the role of surrogate parent for the student newly departed from home or can provide personal adult recognition of his work in preparation for life in an adult world.  These needs, more than dissatisfaction with the particular method of teaching, lie behind the frequent complaints about the large lecture courses in the lower division.  The same reasons account for much of the prevailing resentment expressed against undergraduate <Col N="368" /> advising.  Advisers spend little time with students and change all too frequently.  &ldquo;I can't even remember the names of my advisers for the last three semesters&rdquo; is a quotation that could come from countless students in many areas of the University.  In the absence of a real adviser, a student will sometimes turn to one of his professors, but these too change, and as one student put it, &ldquo;You never go back to see a professor after you're out of his course&rdquo;.  These complaints are directed especially at certain parts of the College of Letters and Science.  The professional schools and colleges are smaller and frequently do provide the desired intimacy with professors.</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph it goes on to refer to the factories:</P>
    <P>Under these conditions, the popularity of the &ldquo;factory&rdquo; metaphor begins to be comprehensible.  Incoming students contrast their experience at Berkeley with their lives in high schools or junior colleges. The University does not fit common concept of what a college should be, and in their disappointment they find &ldquo;factory&rdquo; an apt description. Few students have actually worked in a factory but they know that it is a place where identical articles are mass produced and workers are treated impersonally.</P>
    <P>We must avoid that at all costs.  I believe that in Trinity College we have been avoiding it, on the whole.  Let us continue to do it in the new University of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald envisages, and I join with him in it, that to speak of a university campus without arts and sciences, or one in which you have arts and sciences in one place and the other subjects all in the other place, is an abuse of the term &ldquo;college&rdquo;. Fortunately, we have common ground on this between TCD and UCD. Newman's idea of what a university should be is gospel for us at Trinity College as it is at UCD.  Anybody who takes it seriously knows that a college without the essential basic subjects is not worthy of the name at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> Again, and here Senator FitzGerald can speak with a great deal more authority than I can, Senator FitzGerald pointed out that there was not much hope of great financial gain as a result of the merger, not unless we are to allow our standards to go down. There are the obvious mergers of small departments, the sharing of expensive equipment by both.  But beyond that let us be quite clear that the new university of Dublin will and should cost more than the previous two colleges put together because our standards are still not sufficient.  At present the colleges are under financed, under staffed, under equipped.</P>
    <P>Let me give a couple of examples. There are some eminent professors in Trinity who have no personal secretaries. This is trivial: they accept it as an economic necessity.  But it is not the kind of condition that prevails in a well-equipped university.  Take another example.  Trinity College has no lecturer or professor in medieval Latin. UCD has an eminent scholar in it. Trinity College is fortunate in having a department in Russian.  UCD has not.  Here are things we can share, things any great university should have.  That is what we look forward to.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what Senator FitzGerald has so effectively said on the subject of a unitary university. What I have read from the Berkeley report, what many other people have said as a result of a number of studies, shows what a backward step it would be to have one of those monolithic, impersonal organisations which wise educationalists elsewhere are avoiding.</P>
    <P>May I say in connection with Senator Brosnahan's statement that I hope we all agree that teachers should have full university training?  They should be, to use his phrase, &ldquo;based in the university&rdquo;&mdash;they should have university degrees.  I am happy to say that in Trinity College for many years we have encouraged the Protestant trainees for primary schools to take degrees in Trinity College.  Many of them have done so.  And I am happy to say that the educational authority Senator Brosnahan quoted, Dr. W. J. <Col N="370" /> M. Starkie, was a graduate of Trinity College.  All our teachers should be graduates and I hope we will find support for whatever can be done to secure this.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Jessop in commending the Commission's report.  It is really a most valuable document.  It took a long time to reach us, but it was worth it in the end.  It has, and this naturally appeals to me, a very fair, sympathetic assessment of the present conditions in Trinity College.  It is a model of judicial investigation which we are very fortunate to have.</P>
    <P>It suggests that we should cut down on numbers from overseas.  It does not give an exact figure.  I hope we can hold it at 10 per cent or 15 per cent. This will be used against us by our enemies.  We are always very conscious of having historical enemies.  It will be said that our hearts and minds naturally turn to England.  This is simply untrue, though perhaps it may have been true 50 or 100 years ago.  The important point is that we need this intermixture of ideas and traditions from outside.  It does us all good.</P>
    <P>On matters of detail, I consider that my work has largely been done, and I hope that in a sense the work of the negotiating teams has been done, too, if they have the wisdom to accept it&mdash;here I wish to emphasise that I am speaking my own point of view, not any official point of view of the governing body of Trinity College&mdash;in the comments of the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  Here we have an exemplary model for the future university of Dublin.  I should like to pick out one or two matters that particularly appeal to me under the heading The Principles to be Followed in Determining what Subjects shall be Taught in Each College.  The report envisages the need for basic subjects in each college and goes on:</P>
    <P>We consider that in determining which teaching areas should be maintained in both colleges and which in one only, the following criteria should be applied: academic experience here and elsewhere as to what constitute &ldquo;basic&rdquo; or essential subjects; economic considerations; the necessity for having an adequate range of staff in any <Col N="371" /> teaching area; the desirability of maintaining student numbers in any teaching area within acceptable upper and lower boundaries; the maintenance of interdisciplinary links; the relationship of certain subjects to cultural background and traditions; the views of the academic staffs in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>As I see it, perhaps the real crux in the negotiations may be on the question of the faculties and departments who will control the teaching in the two colleges.  Here again, I believe the report of the Irish Federation of University Teachers is admirable.  They suggest that where, as a result of the application of the criteria proposed in the previous section of the report a subject is taught in both colleges, separate departments should exist.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>It should be the responsibility of the faculty to provide a forum for teachers in closely related areas in which they could exchange ideas and provide co-ordination and maximum utilisation of teaching resources.</P>
    <P>This distinction is of basic importance.</P>
    <P>Both this document and the report of the Commission envisage the need for improving our graduate studies. There is something that comes as a revelation when one goes to a university in the USA and senses the extraordinary amplitude of graduate studies there.  We are years, centuries, behind some other universities in this. At the moment our universities are crippled by lack of specialists.</P>
    <P>I pass on to another primary matter of importance in the report, the composition of the governing authority of the university and governing bodies of the colleges.  I think most people have now come to agree that there should be equality of representation between TCD and UCD.  I do not think anyone is trying to maintain opposition to that now.  I also hope that we will agree that a fairly small governing body is desirable, something of the order of seven from UCD, seven from TCD and three from non-academic origins, or possibly a little larger but <Col N="372" /> at any rate not an unwieldy body in which people will make speeches rather than act as committee men, with a genuine exchange of opinion. However, I do not think one need labour that point.  Equality is conceded. It is a matter of finding the right way to ensure that they will be more efficient.</P>
    <P>There is much more of value in this report.  For example there is the question of the position of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  Again, partly for reasons of policy, partly, I hope, for idealism, Trinity College I believe would welcome St. Patrick's College as a constituent in the new university of Dublin.  It would be a very happy thing, and its influence on Dublin University could be salutary.  Maynooth is reaching out towards Kildare and Meath and there is a larger catchment area to be gained from it.  I understand from conversations with friends in Maynooth that they would welcome it.  I hope it will be kept very much in the forefront of negotiations.</P>
    <P>One other matter has come from a different source.  It comes from a recommendation from the Students' Representative Body of TCD.  This should be considered very carefully. They feel that on at least some of the new governing bodies there should be some kind of student representation. This horrifies some people.  But I revert to what I said earlier in this speech.  I like the sense of responsibility which many of our students have.  But if they are frustrated in expressing this sense of responsibility with some degree of power it may turn to a worse channel of activity.</P>
    <P>Let me speak frankly on this.  There is a movement in our country amongst young people, partly of discontent.  If some unscrupulous leader or leaders get hold of this we are in for very grave trouble.  As I say, at the moment in Trinity College there is a group of very responsible young students who want to share the problems of governing a university.  If we give them more than a little encouragement they can help to hold things together.  What I saw in Berkeley convinces me that if they cannot enter into those matters <Col N="373" /> agitation will start.  I saw the agitators coming into the open campuses there which are unlike Trinity in that no gate could be shut.  Agitators could go in there on to the campuses.  Then the trouble is that when something like this starts, the wrong type of people use the students' discontent for their own purposes. This is what is fermenting in our country now.  One way in which we could stabilise this matter, and show that we are on the side of the students, would be to recognise their demand for responsibility.  I can see that there are difficulties and that matters of confidence and discretion are involved, but this should be very seriously considered.</P>
    <P>In general, looking back over the situation, if we accept the Minister's proposal, if we can do well in making things better, it looks as though we have a lot to gain.  But I appeal to the Minister to resist certain public pressures. He is a democrat.  We are living in a democracy, and all the time the voice of the plain people is speaking. But sometimes they are wrong.  If the voice of the plain people of Ireland says that what we want is more degrees, what we want is less failures, what we want is easier qualifications, what we want is simply technological skill, and not what we educationalists value as a university education, he should say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Once again, I repeat that UCD, TCD, UCG and UCC have one doctrine in common&mdash;Newman's idea of a university.</P>
    <P>So, I come towards my conclusion. I congratulate the Minister on the decision he made.  We are very cynical in Ireland at times.  I happen myself to be a part-time politician, and he is a full-time politician.  I think he will agree with me that we as politicians just could not keep going unless we had some idealism.  We just could not do it.  I am convinced that his decision is based on an ideal for Irish education. I am also convinced that he did not foresee some of the difficulties which may emerge now.  But he saw the light and followed it.  The right thing is to have TCD and UCD working together.  I believe the Minister wanted help to reconcile the various conflicting elements in our country. <Col N="374" /> This is why the new university of Dublin will be a stronger university because it will have two great traditions working together.  The essential thing is to keep the dynamism of those traditions going in this new ideal of a university.</P>
    <P>Now, having congratulated the Minister, I also appeal to him.  I appeal to him, first of all, not to rush legislation. He has said that he proposes to introduce legislation by next summer. I suggest to him that such a date would probably be precipitate.  It would be too soon.  He has produced a magnificent ideal, but if he knocks our heads too hard together too soon it will not work.  I think he sees that this would antagonise many people.  Academics are, by nature, slow movers.  Also, he might find his own hands tied in a way he would regret later on, if he rushed things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator O'Quigley's remark but we will leave Party matters aside.  I appeal for the Minister's good sense to see that it would be rash to introduce legislation within a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to him to consider one other matter very carefully.  It matters a good deal more in TCD than in UCD as will shortly emerge.  I appeal to him not to put a moratorium on increased grants to universities until the merger is settled.  We have had approximately seven years moratorium while waiting for this valuable document, the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.  It has in fact been used as an excuse: &ldquo;We will wait for the Commission's Report&rdquo;. That probably was wise but as has been often said &ldquo;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick&rdquo;.  If we are going to have another moratorium now until everything is settled in the new university of Dublin, I feel it would do a great deal of harm.  I appeal to <Col N="375" /> the Minister then when he makes up his mind that something is really needed by one college or the other not to say &ldquo;Wait until the university is set up&rdquo;.  That really would have a frustrating effect on the dynamic, forward-looking feeling that I see in my college personally and which I believe exists in UCD.  However, UCD are in a stronger position here.  This in all fairness I must emphasise.  The Government quite rightly has given lavish capital grants to put up their lavish, and necessary, building in Belfield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear it.  At any rate, then, on the whole fairly generous grants have been given for capital expenditure in UCD during the past few years.  The grants to Trinity have not been on the same scale, and until recently the grants to UCC and UCG have not been on the same scale.  I hope that when the Minister is considering the estimates for the coming year, he will bear that in mind. UCD is ahead of us in capital grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish the Minister, and his deputy, and the negotiators, the cardinal virtues of fortitude, patience and justice.  I am confident that he will keep the scales of justice well balanced.  I hope his fortitude and patience will hold out.  He has offered Ireland and the universities a rich opportunity.  He has very wisely said: &ldquo;I leave the details to you university people to work out.&rdquo;  Let him remember that academic people by nature move slowly and <Col N="376" /> cautiously.  Let him allow the negotiators to get to know each other and trust each other more and more, by repeated meetings.  Then in the end we will put a statue up to him in Trinity College, perhaps, a hundred years hence.</P>

The Seanad will not, I hope, consider it discourteous of me if I do not participate in the discussion, certainly not at this stage.  The issues concerned are under consideration, as Senators know, and ultimately will have to go before the Government for decision.  In the meantime it would not be for me to anticipate the Government's views. Nevertheless, let me say that the reasoning and opinions which we have just heard will be most useful in the consideration of the matters involved.</P>
      <P>I am also grateful to the Seanad for giving me this opportunity of paying tribute to the members of the Commission on Higher Education and to the Report which they produced.  It has already been mentioned today that the preliminary volume does not do justice to the Commission.</P>

      <P>As Senator FitzGerald said, the preliminary volume did not do justice to the Commission. It was only with the appearance of the Report proper, volume 2, that the <Col N="377" /> extent of research, the profundity of thought, the remarkable liberality of mind and the very great care and patience which the Chairman and the members of the Commission devoted to their extremely wide assignment were apparent.  It is a great credit not only to them but to Ireland. Indeed, I am aware that this Report is admired and appreciated in universities and other relevant educational circles in many countries.  I accordingly thank the Chairman and the members of the Commission most sincerely on behalf of the Government for their labours and indeed, not only on behalf of the Government but on behalf of all those interested in the various facets of education in this country.  Without necessarily agreeing with all their findings, I would like to say that they did their job and more than well.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect touched on by Senator Garret FitzGerald on which we are not going into detail today, but I believe we are discussing it some other time in more depth.  The Government accepts the principle that if a student has the ability he must not be denied the opportunity of proceeding to higher education.  It is true that in the past many brilliant children have been denied university education because of their financial circumstances. Many thousands down the years were also denied post-primary education because of lack of finance. Since last September at least, all our children can proceed free of cost if they so wish as far as the Leaving Certificate.  It is true that it would be illogical and unjust to bring a suitably qualified student so far and then for the State to help him no further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased at the constructive remarks made by all the speakers.  I think the discussion has been of a very, very high level.  Senator Garret FitzGerald was on the ball.  He knew his subject intimately.  He spoke with sincerity, in depth, without any bias. On some of his suggestions I was aware of his views before.  All of the problems which he spoke about today were well thought out by him.  What he had to say will certainly be of tremendous assistance to myself and the Government and to people on, let us say at this stage, both sides of the fence.  As <Col N="378" /> Senator Stanford has said, if the spirit of Senator Garret FitzGerald in this regard permeated to all the negotiators in these very delicate discussions and negotiations, everything would go well.</P>
    <P>I heard with interest what Senator Brosnahan had to say and I appreciate the problem there.  With regard to the suggestion of the New Colleges and the training of teachers, this matter is under active consideration of course as is indeed the Commission's entire Report at the present time.  Senator Jessop dealt in depth with the medical problems and his observations were those of a reasonable man.  In the main one could not challenge the ambitions and hopes which he expressed. I think he is speaking for most people in the medical profession, particularly at university level, and I do not think there would be undue problems there.</P>
    <P>Finally, it was refreshing to hear Professor Stanford, and as far as I am concerned, I am very glad that this discussion has been initiated in the Seanad as it did nothing but good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to come in after my colleague, but there seems to be a reluctance on the part of others to participate at this juncture.  I listened to most of Senator Garret FitzGerald's speech with approval. I think he covered a wide range and he said things, in a moderate way, which are very relevant to the whole question, in particular with regard to the merger.  He did say one thing on which I am not quite sure that he is actually correct; that is, that negotiations between UCD and TCD are in progress.  As I understand it, TCD is waiting for the beginning of such negotiations, but have not so far managed to make official contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct that.  Negotiations were started last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been corrected.  I am glad to hear they are going on and are in progress.  I would express the hope that after another month they might come to some kind of conclusion.  I would be interested to know what it is that is preventing <Col N="379" /> the reaching of conclusions.  The Board of Trinity College sent to the Minister on 1st August a clear and cogent statement of Trinity's position in this matter.  While it may be true that legislation and the implementation of any project regarding a merger may take some time to evolve, nevertheless I think the main lines ought to be made public as soon as possible, for the sake of the public and for the sake of members of the staffs in both colleges.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the statistical comparisons established by Senator Garret FitzGerald between public expenditure in the United Kingdom and public expenditure here for university students.  I do not want to elaborate the point further, but it is obvious that we have not yet gone anywhere near what we might hope to achieve in this way.  If these figures are correct, we spent £236 in 1965-66, when in Britain they were spending between £600 and £1,000 per university student.</P>
      <P>The point was made by Senator Garret FitzGerald also that, in fact, in a large number of areas down the years there has already been between UCD and TCD a large measure of co-operation, and I think this is true.  The Report makes it clear that at the lower levels, and indeed at most of the teaching levels, relationship between Trinity and all the colleges of the National University, including UCD, has been most cordial since the beginning of the State.  I was reminded, when Senator Garret FitzGerald was talking about this, of an occasion in the 1940's when I was an extern examiner in the National University, and one of the very promising students taking French was a youth called Garret FitzGerald. At the moment, I am glad to say, Professor Louis Roche has often been our extern examiner in French; and this pattern of co-operation is more truly representative of the relationship in the ordinary everybody co-existence between the colleges than what the report calls the views and attitudes at the &ldquo;top administrative&rdquo; level.  That, I think, is the phrase they use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, indeed, I have run into some of this &ldquo;top administrative&rdquo;<Col N="380" /> level hostility.  I remember two occasions, if I might be allowed to mention them.  On one occasion I was phoned by the Auditor of the L &amp; H and asked if I would propose a motion &ldquo;That the ideals of the Communist Manifesto are worthy of humanity&rdquo;. He said: &ldquo;I warn you that a priest will be opening on the other side and several priests will be speaking in the debate.&rdquo;  I thought to myself for a moment about what was actually in that manifesto and I said: &ldquo;Yes, I am agreeing.&rdquo;  The day before the debate the Auditor phoned me and said: &ldquo;The President has banned you; do you know anybody who would substitute and take the same line?&rdquo; I racked my brain and had thought of one or two &ldquo;possibles&rdquo;, but the next morning I was phoned again and told that the debate, subject and everything else had been banned.</P>
    <P>I was invited to attend private business of the society from which I had been banned.  I demurred&mdash;their private business was not my business; though it is true that my father had been Auditor of that same society years before.  The Auditor assured me that the Earl of Wicklow and others from outside would be there and they were going to discuss the official banning of the debate.  I went along and heard a most stimulating debate. One student said: &ldquo;I could understand the authorities preventing us from discussing the Communist Manifesto at the corner of Abbey Street, where we might be shouted down or attacked physically or mentally, but if in UCD, where we know all the answers, or can be given all the answers, we cannot discuss it here, how are we ever to find out the answers; where can we hear the answers; how are we to be equipped to deal with the situation outside?&rdquo; I felt he was making a strong point, particularly as nobody had apparently read the Communist Manifesto, nor noted that the inter-Party Government and Fianna Fáil between them had long since introduced about five of the ten points out forward by Marx and Engels, such as nationalising the railways, the canals, and so on.  The <Col N="381" /> centrally relevant point in that seemed to me to be the question from a student: &ldquo;Where can we discuss these things if not here, where we know all the answers?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On a more recent occasion I was invited to take part in an opening meeting in one of the hostels in UCD on &ldquo;Nationalism Today.&rdquo;  Somewhat to my surprise, because I had already taken the chair at the same society a few months before, I was banned, and it came to my knowledge that the ban was not by the students, who held a meeting at which they unanimously condemned this ban, but it was decreed by a distinguished member of the Society of Jesus.  I will not mention his name because it would not be fair. I asked him in public to tell me in public or in private why I was regarded as such a dangerous person.  He wrote and said he would tell me in private, which he did.  We had a long session in Leeson Street during which I was told why.  The reason was, I was told, that I was a secularist and had been a critic of the Catholic Church, and he felt they were all <i>in loco parentis</i> for these boys and it would be dangerous to admit somebody like me. I asked him were they not willing ever to admit any critic and he said that they might admit somebody who has been critical, but to speak on a neutral subject.  I said that the subject of nationalism might be regarded as such a neutral one, and I asked could he imagine this happening in France; did he think a critic of the Church would be thus banned in France from a largely Catholic group?  He admitted this probably would not be the case, and even that some successor of his in Ireland might be more liberal, but he felt he was right.  I finally made two points: (a), it seemed surprising that 20 minutes from me might apparently destroy the effect of 20 years of tutelage under the Jesuits; and (b), that in France, where the Church is beset and beleaguered they can admit critics but in Ireland, where the Church is well respected, a critic could not be admitted.</P>
    <P>I ask to be forgiven for mentioning this because while it is true, as I have <Col N="382" /> said, that there is a great deal of cordiality between the staffs of the two colleges, there is the odd fact that some people will regard this ordiality as so dangerous that they could not admit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad you brought be back to that.  I am happy to say that I was invited to speak last year at the inaugural meeting of the L. and H., and I did so.  I do not know whether that is because the L. and H. are improving and I am deteriorating.  Anyway, this arises from a quotation from the report which states at page 99, in paragraph 3.5:</P>
      <P>Again, the evidence of the administrative authorities of University College, Dublin, showed hostility to Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Hostility.  I find that disconcerting.  It is even disconcerting when it is shown to such a dangerous person as myself, but when it is shown to the whole of the staff of Trinity College I find it very odd indeed.  On page 438 furthermore the report refers to the former President of UCD and quotes him as submitting that &ldquo;the ideal solution would be to close down Trinity College and to found a new University of Dublin located at Belfield&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is extremely odd.  To do justice to Dr. Tierney, he said he was on the whole unwilling to contemplate making the suggestion that Trinity should be closed down even though this would be in this opinion &ldquo;the ideal solution&rdquo;.  It is disconcerting to find this hostility&mdash;&ldquo;antagonism&rdquo; is the word used in the chapter heading&mdash;particularly from a Professor of Greek, as they are usually supposed to the mildest of men.</P>

      <P>There is a basic failure, as Senator Stanford has said, to know what Trinity is, and what it stands for now.  Senator FitzGerald spoke, I thought very cogently, about the merger.  I shall put my attitude to what he said in the following terms: if I thought a merger were necessary, the type I would accept would be the type put forward by Senator FitzGerald.  I am not as yet convinced of the necessity for a merger for reasons I hope to amplify further. I personally am opposed to the notion of the merger but, as I have said, the points put by Senator FitzGerald seem to me to be the concept of a merger in the least unacceptable terms.</P>
      <P>The Minister has paid tribute to the report.  What he said is true.  I hope I am not being unfair to the rest of the Commission when I say that the spirit of the Chairman of the Commission runs right through the report.  It is a model of scrupulous, judicial fairness.  There is a firm desire of the Chairman of the Commission to treat a rather difficult topic in a scrupulously fair way, and the report has been eminently successful in doing so.  One does not necessarily accept each recommendation, but the spirit in which it is written and presented is admirable, imaginative, enlightened and scrupulously fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though it is not really in order to deal in depth with it, I note that the whole question of public aid for higher education is mentioned on pages 18 and 19.  Apparently the amount of public aid that goes to university education is very small indeed.  On page 18 one finds the amount of local authority aid to higher education.  It is estimated at £145,750 a year.  That is in respect of all the local authorities in the entire Republic.  When we compare that with the British county council grants for university students it is very small.  On the following page the State contributions are given and the amount of State scholarships has been estimated at £225,000.  Certain points and reservations relevant to expenditure, I note with approval, have been <Col N="384" /> expressed by Dr. McElligott.  He makes the point that if we raise our entry standards in all the universities we shall <i>ipso facto</i> save money.  Perhaps we have opened the gates too wide.  Senator Brosnahan made that point justifiably.  He spoke of impressive qualifications at entry to training colleges, and it is obvious that many of our university entrants have not got these qualifications.  If we raise the entry standards we may not reduce the intake, but the rate at which the intake is rising year by year will be reduced.  The other point which was made by Dr. McElligott is in relation to the way in which money is spent on certain subjects in relation to others&mdash;one of them the Irish language. I quote now from page 112 of the Summary of the Report:</P>
    <P>In 1964-65, in TCD and in the Constituent Colleges of the National University of Ireland, the total number of staff (full-time and part-time) dealing with Irish, Celtic Studies and Welsh was 62, compared with 43 teaching Economics, 32 French and 16 German.  The salaries and other expenses were&mdash;</P>

    <P>The point I make is that there is a disproportionate expenditure on some subjects and that savings could be brought about but in many cases certain moneys are being injudiciously spent.</P>
    <P>On the question of the merger I notice that the Commission report says on page 89, paragraph 2.6:</P>
    <P>It was, for example, suggested that University College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin, be joined in a single university.  For this, however, there was no wide support.</P>
    <P>The opinion of the Commission was that there was no wide support for it. I was a little disturbed by this but this was brought out far better by Senator FitzGerald when he said the Minister said he could do nothing about higher education until he got the report.  When he finally got the report he said: &ldquo;I am now going to do something which <Col N="385" /> they specifically asked should not be done.&rdquo;  I do not quite get the point.  He did say he had the report for some time and had been studying it but I seem to remember&mdash;I am sorry the Minister is not here but I am sure he will correct me later on if I am wrong &mdash;when he announced this suggestion for the merger that he said: &ldquo;The Government had this in their minds for quite a long time.&rdquo;  I forget whether he mentioned the date he got it but it seemed to me that he did not mention when the Government decided on it but waited for the report and when the report did not recommend it he then decided to go ahead.  The report is quite emphatic in saying that there is no wide support for any such project.  It is more specific on page 446 where it says at paragraph 16.36:</P>
    <P>Our recommendations leave two universities in Dublin.  In the preceding chapter we have indicated why. It is not opportune to contemplate associating them in a single university. It is not uncommon to find more than one university in a large city. Many of the factors which Dr. Tierney saw as diminishing the status of UCD <i>vis-á-vis</i> TCD and as making relationships difficult would be removed by the establishment of UCD as an independent university.</P>
    <P>That is fairly strong.  There is a whole chapter leading up to it.  I shall not quote all of it to the House but it is quite clear a conclusion that the chairman and the members of the committee reached was that the two universities should continue in Dublin. That is my view and I have not yet been convinced of the opposite.</P>
    <P>There is a very generous tribute in the report on page 440 to what Trinity College can contribute.  This is at paragraph 16.23:</P>
    <P>Trinity College is an ancient university and one of the country's very few secular institutions deeply rooted in the past.  In three and a half centuries it has held an honourable place in the history of European learning, and its graduates have earned fame in many fields of activity and in all parts of the world. Its reputation and its liberal tradition <Col N="386" /> as a house of learning are a valuable part of the Irish inheritance; so, too, are its historical buildings and the treasures of its famous library; and so, above all, is the vigorous life of the College today.  These are assets that Ireland cannot afford to neglect or diminish.</P>
    <P>Those are strong, generous and enlightened words and I think they are very true.  This generous tribute sums up in one paragraph the best that one can say not only about the past but also about the present of this college.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald wisely said, and we would all agree with him here, that if there is a merger or a linkingup there must be a spread of discipline in each college.  As to whether or not the merger is necessary we did not hear anybody really saying just exactly why it is necessary.  Is it to save money? Would it really save money?  I think Senator FitzGerald removed some of the illusions which some people many entertain about it.  In many ways it would not save any money and in some ways it might even cause further expenditure.</P>
    <P>In some schools there might be extra equipment which would have to be bought but, overall, there is grave doubt as to whether it would save money or whether it might on occasion cause increased expenditure.  If in the sciences, for instance, it was decided that the basic sciences would be taught in both universities, both colleges of the same fused university, but that some specialisation would take place in one and other specialisations in the other this might well prove an acceptable formula and one which would, in fact, save some money.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this links up with the ecclesiastical ban because, of course, if our students in Trinity are told that for certain specialities they must go to Belfield, they will go off and there is no specific difficulty there but if the UCD students who are Catholics are told that for certain specialties they will go down to Trinity, as things stand at the present, they cannot go.  Consequently the ban is very relevant to this whole matter.  I agree with Senator Standford's hope that some explanatory statement will be made <Col N="387" /> by the hierarchy on this question.  It is true, of course, that the report deals with it in some detail.  It says on page 441, paragraph 16.25:</P>
    <P>Decree 287 of the Plenary Council held at Maynooth in 1956, approved by the Church authorities in Rome, is as follows:</P>
    <P>We forbid under pain of mortal sin:</P>
    <P>(1)  Catholic youths to frequent that College;</P>
    <P>(2)  Catholic parents or guardians to send to that College Catholic youths committed to their care;</P>
    <P>(3)  Clerics and religious to recommend in any manner parents or guardians to send Catholic youths to that College or to lend council or help to such youths to frequent that College.</P>
    <P>Only the Archbishop of Dublin is competent to decide, in accordance with the norms of the instructions of the Holy See, in what circumstances and with what guarantees against the danger of perversion, attendance at that College may be tolerated.</P>
    <P>This is clearly stated.  This cannot be ignored.  It has not been ignored by the Commission.  I heard the Minister say that it was his hope under the new university, if it emerged, that there would be no denominational discrimination. But the people who have decided that there shall be this separation on denominational grounds are not the Minister, the Department of Education, the Board of Trinity College nor the governing body of UCD nor the whole administrative organisation of the National University. It is decided by the Plenary Council of the Hierarchy and it is approved by the Church authorities in Rome.  Now the question must be put: if this remains, how on earth can you start talking about a merger where you can have some subjects taught in one college and some in another and students freely going from one college to another?  If the ban is to be removed or modified or changed, them is it not time that we were told this?  Does somebody know things that we do not <Col N="388" /> know?  There is a footnote on page 441 of the report which says that the relevant basic law is Canon 1374 CIC and the word used in that is &ldquo;pueri&rdquo;. This is translated into English as &ldquo;youths&rdquo;.  I am not a Latin scholar but I am informed that &ldquo;pueri&rdquo; means small boys pre-puberty and that &ldquo;juvenes&rdquo; is the word for youths.  If that is so, this would appear to apply not to universities at all and not even to secondary schools.  While I mention this, I am not a Latin scholar.  It may be that &ldquo;purie&rdquo; has a special ecclesiastical meaning.  However, I feel that is a point which the Minister might take up at some future negotiations to find out whether it really does apply to such institutions as Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I notice that a member of the commission, Most Rev. Dr. Philbin, states very clearly&mdash;and I think the commission is very wise to include this in their report&mdash;the reasons underlying the ban.  This is on pages 442, 443 and 444.  This is a reasoned defence.  It is something we should all read, it is something to which we ought to devote attention.  Such points are made as that:</P>
    <P>At the present time in particular, when we are living in the midst of conflict of the most radically opposed systems of thought and theories of morality, extending far more widely than controversies between Christians, it is considered more necessary than ever that the policy of a university in regard to basic issues should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The view is that since we are in the midst of conflict, it is more important than ever that the university atmosphere should, as far as possible, for Catholics have a Catholic atmosphere. This, as I see it, far from being a diminishing requirement is one that is increasing.  Now more than ever it is being demanded.  This is mentioned further at page 443 by Dr. Philbin:</P>
    <P>With this purpose, wherever possible, universities have been and are being established where it is expected that a Catholic rather than an anti-Catholic point of view will be adopted in regard to departments of knowledge which invite or admit ideological attitudes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> In other words, there are countries where Catholic universities have been set up and where these are available the implication is that it is necessary for Catholics to go to them.  One of the oldest of these is, of course, the very distinguished University of Louvain in Belgium.  At page 443 of this Report Dr. Philbin says:</P>
    <P>There are many parts of the world where, in the absence of such institutions as NUI, universities of the character of Trinity College are used freely by Catholics.  But the existence of NUI, the status it has achieved and the extensive range of its Faculty coverage are judged to indicate that the ordinary requirements of Canon Law, based on the considerations referred to, should generally apply.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that since there is an alternative here the ban is justified. In Belgium there is an alternative, a college which is a lot order than UCD, and there is no ban on Catholic Belgians from going either to the State University at Liege or the free-thinking University of Brussels.  I feel, since this is put before us in this very sober document, that at least the question should be put in public as to whether the general practice is, in fact, being applied here.  The suggestion that in 1908 the National University was set up in answer to Catholic demands is dealt with and the implication is that NUI is safe for Catholics, it is all right, though we all remember, of course, that for a long time the Lenten Pastorals in Dublin condemned NUI and said it was not what it ought to be from the Catholic point of view, but owing to certain safeguards it could be accepted. All these relate to the question as to whether you can set up a joint university. I shall not labour the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to refer to page 434 of the report in which the Board of Trinity College has made its attitude clear:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The College would welcome the appointment of a dean of Catholic students, and the Board would be glad to make land available for the erection of chapels on the College <Col N="390" /> premises in addition to the existing Church of Ireland chapel.</P>
    <P>In other words, the question remains open.  As far as the Board of Trinity College goes the Board is prepared and has been prepared for long years to extend the hand of friendship, but so far it has met with no response.  The decision, therefore, about a merger cannot be made in such a way as to be implemented by the saving of money in specialised equipment based on the sending of students to either place for particular specialties unless there is some strong change or modification in this ecclesiastical ban which makes what I have said and what the report talks about there relevant to our discussion today.</P>
    <P>Personally, I should like to see what the report asks for and what, indeed, Dr. Tierney wanted and wants, that is to say, an independent University College, Dublin.  I paid tribute already in the Seanad to the imagination, the vigour and the drive of Dr. Tierney personally. I think a great deal of credit goes to him for making possible what will be a magnificent university on 250 acres of ground within a few miles of the centre of Dublin.  There is no question but that something quite splendid will come up there.  There is no question in my mind but that to have it as a separate university, a degree-giving body is a perfectly normal development and I feel that the Commission is right in recommending that.  I feel the Government should go ahead on those lines.  This does not mean necessarily that it can expand to such figures as 12,000 students or more, but it does mean that it can have a separate entity as, indeed, it ought to have had years ago.  Senator Stanford has made the point that the Colleges of Exter and Southamption, which were colleges of the University of London, are colleges in their own right and that this is the general tendency in Britain and France.  There is even in France a fresh university starting in Paris side by side with the University of Paris.  There is no reason why there should not be a far more than viable college not only in Belfield but in Cork and in Galway and very probably Limerick and quite possibly Waterford <Col N="391" /> as well.  The future of University education certainly lies in its expansion, and the joining up of Trinity and UCD here in Dublin would have, in my opinion, a stultifying rather than an invigorating effect, and that is my reason for remaining, so far, opposed to the merger.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the question of the effect of merger on non-Irish residents in Trinity College.  Professor Stanford has dealt effectively with the proposition, but there are one or two points which should be made in amplification.  The report mentions on page 448 that the Provost wrote a letter to the Commission in January, 1967 and said that the numbers of non-Irish students to be admitted will be further reduced in 1967-68.  It is intended that by the early 1970's that the proportion of non-Irish students in the College shall be brought down to 15 per cent of the total.  It is most unfortunate that the Board has since decided virtually to do away with them altogether.</P>
    <P>The circular which was sent out made it clear, as I read it, that the number of people to be admitted were of four kinds: those who are resident in Ireland, those who came from under-developed countries or those who had some link with Ireland though living abroad, or were the children of those, or by reason of the fact that their parents were born in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is not unreasonable for me to assume only the facts that have so far been made public, I am not suggesting that the Board has not made such a modifying decision, but it is still known only to the Board.  The actual document says that the Board of Trinity College has decided to accept applications only from candidates (a) one of whose parents is a graduate of Trinity College, or (b) who have a brother or sister at present attending the College, or (c) one of whose parents was born in Ireland, or (d) who are from under-developed countries.</P>

      <P>I have here a letter received this morning from a Scottish group inviting me to attend the annual dinner of the TCD Graduates Association in Edinburgh.  They are several hundred strong.  We have a number of Scottish graduates and I feel sure that even the most parsimonious of them will want their children to come to Trinity College.  They are not all English, and the &ldquo;10 per cent&rdquo; is supposed to include French, Americans, Iranians, Indians and students <Col N="393" /> from all over the world.  This circular is a public document and it would seem to anybody reading it that the people who are not resident in Ireland are being reduced below the 15 per cent which is mentioned here.  It seems to me they are being reduced to zero. It also seems that they will have some consideration for another few years if they have brothers and sisters in the College but it would seem they will gradually be reduced to nought.</P>

      <P>May I state that the total of students coming from outside to the College will be British rather than Irish essentially and will not be reduced to nought.</P>

      <P>A serious reduction in the intake from outside Ireland would, in my opinion, be a mistake.  It must be limited to some extent but I do not think the figure of 15 per cent or 10 per cent is a fair or acceptable figure at which to limit it.  I should like to say something more about that as I had not reached the end of what I wanted to say before I was interrupted.</P>
