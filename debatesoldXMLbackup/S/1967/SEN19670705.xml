    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Finance Bill is to transform the Budget proposals into permanent legislation.  The Bill is fairly short this year and its provisions are summarised in the explanatory <Col N="587" /> memorandum which was circulated earlier.  It is not necessary, therefore, for me to describe it again in detail. I propose merely to refer, in a brief and general way, to some of the principal provisions.</P>
      <P>In section 1, income tax is continued at the 7/- rate while the surtax rates are increased by 20 per cent.  This increase in surtax is, however, more than outweighed over a wide range of incomes by the new earned income allowance of £1,250 for surtax purposes. I introduced this additional relief, which brings the level of taxation here on income in the middle ranges closer to that in Britain, because I was impressed by the representations made by industrialists and by professional and trade bodies that such an improvement was required in order to attract and retain persons possessing skills and abilities in short supply.</P>
      <P>Part I of the Bill improves and extends other income tax allowances. It also provides valuable incentives to industrialists in underdeveloped areas, extends the period of relief for mining of certain non-bedded minerals and grants an increase in the levels of initial allowance.  In addition, it introduces income tax relief for certain medical expenses and raises the child allowance.</P>
      <P>Part II confirms the budgetary increases in the beer and tobacco duties, modifies customs clearance requirements and provides for the approval of transit depots for goods in customs charge.  The provisions contained in Parts III, IV and V are of a straightforward nature and it is scarcely necessary for me to explain them here.</P>
      <P>If there are any points in the Bill which Members may wish to have clarified or explained more fully, I will, of course, be glad to deal with their questions at the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that this debate may range outside the Finance Bill to take in the Budget as a whole.  I propose, therefore, to refer briefly to the main features of the Budget which are reflected, in large measure, in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To an opening surplus of £1.3 million we add £2.5 million in higher duties on beer and tobacco and we take credit <Col N="588" /> for the allowing of £4.0 million for errors in estimation which made the disposal amount £7.8 million.  This was used to make improvements in social welfare, to give substantial further aid to agriculture and the western areas and to improve taxation reliefs and incentives.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to three of these taxation improvements in particular.  The &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; tax allowances for machinery and plant in use in western counties will enable industrialists in those areas to write-off their outlay in one year if they so wish. My purpose is to make investment in the West more attractive.  I expect that the additional tax incentives for mining of specified minerals will attract a further large inflow of capital and skill into an industry which shows promise of considerable expansion. The new incentives have been widely reported and well received in foreign mining journals.  The third alteration which I would like to mention is the introduction of income tax relief for certain medical expenses over £50 and up to a maximum of £300 incurred by a taxpayer on himself or on any one of his dependants.  This allowance follows&mdash;and indeed, is wider in scope than&mdash;a recommendation of the Commission on Income Taxation.</P>
    <P>The position of the social welfare classes was sympathetically considered and the budget announced increases of 5/- per week for all contributory and non-contributory pensions.  A similar increase of 5/- per week will go to the recipients of Department of Health allowances.  These improvements will cost the Exchequer £1½ million in the current year.  Innovations in social welfare which have been commended on all sides were the free electricity allowance for old age pensioners and free public transport for old age and blind pensioners.  At a cost of almost £½ million, increases are being given to public service pensioners and to military service pensioners.</P>
    <P>However, it is to agriculture and the development of the West that the greatest amount&mdash;£5 million&mdash;goes. These benefits are widely spread for we are endeavouring to give a variety of assistance to farmers and to help improve <Col N="589" /> farm production, income and structure.  The granting of complete relief from rates on farms of a rateable valuation not exceeding £20 was one of the most important features of this year's budget.  At a cost of over £1½ million the farmer with a holding of £20 valuation or less is being completely freed from the burden of rate payments while graduated relief is being given to farmers whose valuations range from £20 to £33.</P>
    <P>A rise of 1d per gallon in the price of creamery milk will increase farmers' incomes this year by £1.6 million; of further assistance to dairy farmers is the new scheme of grants for milk coolers.  As well as benefiting from the derating of their holdings, small farmers will be helped by the abolition of Employment Period Orders, by the intensification of the land settlement programme and by the funds made available to assist the provision of further farmhouse accommodation for tourists in the West.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to strengthen the economic structure of the West because it is in the interest of the balanced development of the State as a whole that the western counties should advance at a more rapid rate. Inducing industry to avail of the special incentives to set up operations in these areas, encouraging the development of tourist traffic and improving the lot of farmers in the region are important steps towards the attainment of this national objective.  The Government is playing a very active part in this effort. But even more vital than official assistance is the determination of the local people to progress.</P>
    <P>The county development teams have, in my opinion, a central role in this work.  In this year's Budget I announced the provision of a sum of £250,000 to finance the development of viable projects in the underdeveloped counties and I should like to repeat the promise I made in my Budget speech that any worthwhile scheme for development in those counties, whether mooted by the development teams or by others, will obtain maximum State assistance.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill now before us is <Col N="590" /> designed to make revenue available in order to carry the Budget proposals into effect, and to make certain other legislative changes.  I feel sure you will agree that the provisions of this year's Budget are beneficial both in the economic and social spheres, and that the increases in taxation required to finance them are extremely moderate.</P>
    <P>The Budget which this Bill confirms is, in a broader sense, I think, properly attuned to the needs of the economy. It is already playing an effective part in stimulating the rate of increase in national production, without risk on the external payments front.  So far in 1967 we can record excellent progress.</P>
    <P>Exports in the first five months of the year were just £18 million or 20 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1966.  As a result of the buoyancy of exports the trade balance improved by more than £3 million despite a steady growth of imports to sustain the rising trends in economic activity.  The industrial production figures for the first quarter of 1967 are encouraging.  They show a rise of eight per cent in the output of manufacturing industries and a rise of nine per cent in the output of transportable goods industries.  Employment has also increased&mdash;the average number engaged in both manufacturing and transportable goods industries being 2,000 more than in the first quarter of 1966.</P>
    <P>All this gives ground for confidence that economic policy is on the right lines.  For various reasons we may expect an increase in demand over the remainder of the year bringing with it a general expansion in economic activity and probably also a rise in imports&mdash;but not such as to cause any worry in relation to the external payments position.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in the Budget to which this Bill relates a number of provisions which certainly are to be welcomed and I shall start by welcoming them before referring critically to some other provisions and <Col N="591" /> critically to the Government's policies in relation to the national economy. Firstly, I should like to refer to the provision in relation to relief of surtax on certain categories of income&mdash; shifting the burden from those in the lower reaches of surtax who are earning to those in the higher reaches who are not earning.  It is the kind of shift in the balance of the burden that we hope to see continued and which we support, particularly as the burden on earned income was inordinately high &mdash;higher than in other countries, including Britain with its socialist Government.</P>
      <P>We can also welcome the provision in respect of medical expenses and the increases in child allowances for income tax purposes.  In relation to the latter, however, it is disturbing to find in a Budget of this kind that this relief is given in respect of children to people well enough off to pay income tax but that no relief is given to people who have children of the same age but who are not well enough off to pay income tax.  It is a pity we should have a Budget which discriminates in this way by helping people well enough off to pay income tax but which offers no assistance to people not well enough off to pay it.  Our whole policy in relation to family allowances is due for overhaul.  We are extraordinarily backward in this respect.  There is no country in Northern Europe which has such large families as this country, yet on the other hand we have totally inadequate provisions for assisting people with large families by way of supplementing their earnings.  We have a long way to go and this is very relevant to EEC membership because not alone are we far behind Britain in this respect but Britain herself is far behind the EEC countries.  It seems abhorrent that we should proceed to give further reliefs to income tax payers in respect of children and do nothing whatever in respect of other families who have difficulty in supporting their children on their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also welcome the provisions in respect of depreciation throughout the country generally and the special provisions in relation to the West of Ireland. <Col N="592" /> There is one point in this respect&mdash;it is a point of detail&mdash;which I will deal with on Committee Stage.  These provisions generally are welcome as is the provision in respect of minerals which should ensure the continued exploration of our mineral resources in the future. Another minor point, though important for many individuals, is the relief given in respect of errors in company returns.  Something can now be done to correct errors when a company has made a genuine mistake.  There are other areas in which we are less generous, one of them being where, through an error in the Department of Social Welfare, money is paid out to people beyond what they are entitled to, money which they, not understanding the complex work of the social welfare code, think is their due, since it is paid to them by the Department.  Then the Department punish not the person who has made the mistake but the person in respect of whom the mistake is made &mdash;there is a deduction from subsequent social welfare payments.  This is something in respect of which we should like to see relief given somewhat in the manner of relief given to companies who have made errors.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Minister could take a careful look at present procedures is in respect of arrears of taxation.  Under the taxation code, the Revenue Commissioners inform their customers, no matter how the circumstances arise, no matter how legitimately a person's complaint may be, that they are not empowered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is now going into matters of administration rather than matters involved in the Finance Bill.  These are more appropriate to the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that on the Finance Bill questions of legislation in relation to the administration of the tax code are permissible. Indeed, I had thought it was something in relation to which it would be appropriate to put down an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels these are matters for the Appropriation <Col N="593" /> Bill&mdash;matters of administration rather than taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there may be some misunderstanding.  My point is that the law requires the Revenue Commissioners to act in a certain way and that that law should be amended.  It is a matter in relation to which an amendment may be required.  However, I will not pursue it but I should like the Minister when he is concluding to let me know whether, in fact, the Revenue Commissioners are required to act in this way by law or merely by practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I should like to refer to which was referred to in the Dáil relates to the procedure in relation to double taxation treaties.  The reply given to Deputy Sweetman in respect of the Canadian Treaty was that a certain mistake had been made in the procedure which held up publication here.  However, I wish to emphasise that the same thing happened in relation to our double taxation treaty with Denmark.  Some of the contents of that treaty were published in Denmark but when I and other people attempted to find out what held up the publication here of our side of the treaty I was informed that no information could be given, though the people of Denmark were told of the contents of the treaty in so far as it referred to their country.  I should like the Minister to ensure that the practice will be discontinued through which this country is at a disadvantage, through which foreign investors here are deprived of information in regard to the reliefs they will get because of the holding up of information in regard to a treaty of double taxation.  I should like to reinforce what Deputy Sweetman said, by pointing out that this Canadian matter is not an isolated incident. It shows up as a normal practice which the relevant Department insist on pursuing.  Those then are just some points of detail I should like to make arising out of the Budget and the Bill before us.  Of course, the Bill is more than simply a means of raising taxation for financial purposes.  It should be designed to influence the economy in the appropriate direction as well as to alleviate social hardship.  We have to <Col N="594" /> review it in that light also as well as seeing it as the taxation measure.</P>
    <P>The first question we have to ask ourselves is what is the economic situation at the moment and what course of action is required from the Government, whether the Government measure up to the economic situation.  The Minister has referred in his remarks to industrial production statistics for the first quarter of this year which he says are encouraging.  They are encouraging in that the growth of output which they show is somewhat higher than experienced for a year or 18 months back but I suggest to the Minister that a careful analysis of them shows that the picture is not as encouraging as might appear at first sight because the growth of output which we have secured in this period is very narrowly based.</P>
    <P>Only one third of industry has contributed to this increase in output.  In more than two thirds of industry there is either no significant output or a decrease. The whole of this increase is accounted for by one third of industry, by a few industries which are engaged in the export trade, whose exports are expanding.  They are few enough because only one fifth of our exports have expanded significantly in the first quarter of this year.  That small sector has contributed to an increase in industrial output in certain industries and then we have had a mild recovery in the building industry, from the very depressed conditions of last year, which has helped the structural clay product industry and the cement industry.  You had also an increase in the output of fertilisers, demand for which is strong at present.  Outside those areas, in the other two thirds of industrial output, there is not an increase.  There is no sign of any general recovery in the economy as far as industrial output is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector the picture is as it has been for years now.  The Minister knows&mdash;he did not refer to it in his speech, he glossed over this point&mdash;that the breeding stock in the case of cattle is slightly down on last year and in the case of pigs and sheep it is substantially down.  Even allowing <Col N="595" /> for an increase in the acreage under crops and cereals, there is every indication that the agricultural output this year will be stagnant at best and at the worst will show a decline. Agricultural output over the past six years has been stagnant.  The prospect there is not a very encouraging one.</P>
    <P>This is the general picture&mdash;one of selective growth in industry and stagnation in agriculture which is confirmed by the trend of retail sales which showed an increase of only five per cent in the first four months of this year.  As prices are up by four per cent that indicates very little growth of demand in the country.  This is also confirmed by the banks' figures which show that the economy is in a state of depression to such an extent that even though credit now available, the liquidity of the system having recovered from the shock administered to it by mis-management of the economy by the Government in 1964 and 1965, even though the money is now available, enterpreneurs are so lacking in confidence in the future of the country at this point, after the mis-management of the last couple of years, that they are not taking up the credit and we are now in the absurd position, after the credit stringencies of the last couple of years, of having a surplus of credit.</P>
    <P>The figures for April show that credit was then running 8½ per cent ahead of last year, when the Central Bank would have been glad to see an increase of 10 per cent.  We cannot make direct comparisons with the month of May because the banks were shut by a strike in May last year but it looks as if this increase in credit compared to what it would have been in May last year may have been only about 7½ per cent.  This indicates a tapering off of the growth rate, as far as I can judge, although this interpretation is slightly speculative, for I can only estimate what the credit picture would have been in May last year.  The tendency here seems to be towards a slowing down in the growth of credit at a time when the Central Bank would welcome an expansion of credit as indeed the economy needs.  This clearly reflects a lack of confidence on the part <Col N="596" /> of entrepreneurs who are not prepared to invest at the moment in the future because they are not sure what the future will bring.  Their confidence has been shaken by the events of last year.</P>
    <P>Another sign of the extent to which the economy is still deflated and of its failure to pull out of the difficulties of the last couple of years can be found in our import figures.  For the three months March to May our imports were up by only £3 million or three per cent while our exports were up by £13 million or 24 per cent.  This may be said to be encouraging, a reduction of £10 million in our import excess, causing our external deficit to drop to perhaps £10 million in the 12 months ended May, but we do not need to have our external deficit reduced by that amount.  This indicates a sluggishness in the economy and a lack of domestic demand at a time when we could afford a faster growth than that.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, considerable evidence that the economy has not recovered from the shock of the last couple of years and that further action may be required to reflate it and to secure expansion.  It is true there is some evidence in the other direction, but on the whole the picture is a fairly gloomy one.  It looks as if the Government may have to take further action in the next few months to encourage a growth of demand in order to try to secure some genuine recovery in the economy in the 12 months ahead.  A problem here is that the economy has been over-deflated.  This is a persistent mistake of our Governments.  It has been made three times in the last couple of years by Governments here.</P>
    <P>First of all, in 1952 it was made by a Fianna Fáil Government, in that severe deflation which led to unemployment marches in Dublin, &mdash;a deflation from which the economy never adequately recovered in the years that followed.  We moved from that deflation into an inflation in 1955 without ever securing any genuine improvement in output.  Then in 1956 under the inter-Party Government again the economy was deflated after the crisis of that year and in retrospect we can see how excessively severe measures were taken <Col N="597" /> as a result of 1952.  Now, looking back we can see&mdash;there were signs of this at the time&mdash;that the deflation of 1965 was also unduly severe.</P>
    <P>Our economy is not resilient.  If we get ourselves into inflationary difficulties and are forced to deflate, as Governments have been forced to do on those three occasions over the last 15 years, the economy does not readily recover.  It takes a lot of pushing to get it off the ground.  It is more serious in Ireland to have inflation followed by deflation than in most countries.  Indeed, we have spent eight of the last 16 years effectively in a state of deflation with our economy bouncing along the bottom, showing little buoyancy and not recovering as it should do from those temporary difficulties.</P>
    <P>Every country is liable to get into inflationary difficulties from time to time.  Some of those difficulties in the past 15 years have been outside our control as was certainly true of the Korean war crisis in 1951, for example. Inevitably there are times when you have to deflate the economy but in Ireland, because our economy has so little buoyancy, it is more important than in other countries that we should avoid the necessity for this.  Where the economy has to be deflated unnecessarily because of an unnecessary crisis provoked by mis-management of the economy rather than by external events this is a very serious blow in this country, a blow from which we take a long time to recover.</P>
    <P>That is the position we are in today. That the crisis of 1965 was unnecessary is quite evident, and the Government have not ever attempted seriously to defend the contrary thesis, although there have been occasional references to the effects of the import levy and to the situation of the British economy but those excuses are so unconvincing that the Government have not even attempted to put them across in a convincing way.  The fact is that the NIEC Report Number 11 shows conclusively that there were three reasons for the crisis of 1965.  In respect of two of these, responsibility lies fairly and squarely with the public authorities and they could also be said to have <Col N="598" /> some degree of responsibility for the third.  The third cause, the one for which the Government are not by any means wholly responsible was, in fact, the increase in wages, the round of wages which occurred at the beginning of 1964.  The scale of this increase, however, is something for which the Government must take some responsibility because the fact that it was a 12 per cent increase and not an eight per cent increase goes back to the terrible blunder made in 1961 by the repeated Government interference with the ESB dispute which pushed up the increase at that time to 17 per cent for the ESB workers and leading to the 12 per cent general round of that year, a round repeated again in 1964.</P>
    <P>The primary burden of responsibility for the scale of those two wage rounds which set our economy on an inflationary course must fall on the Government's shoulders, and indeed, on the Taoiseach's shoulders for he was personally responsible for those interventions in the ESB dispute which were so mistaken and so dangerous as to be damaging.  The wage round of 1964 was appropriate in its timing, and I would not fault the Government for having encouraged the round at that time but their failure to make any attempt to control the amount of the round which was on an excessive scale did cause problems.  Personally, I do not think this was a principal cause of our difficulties in 1965.  The very fact that our difficulties only occurred eighteen months after that round, suggests that other forces must have been at work.  I think the wage round was contributory, but by itself, had our affairs generally been better managed in other respects, it would not have caused serious difficulties.  Other mistakes on top of that caused very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>The other two reasons given by the NIEC were, of course, the excessive rise in capital Government expenditure&mdash;and it is clear precisely who is responsible for that&mdash;and the failure to control the growth of credit, and it is equally clear who is responsible for that.  These are matters which fall within the ambit of the public authority, the Department of Finance <Col N="599" /> and the Central Bank.  These two reasons for our difficulties in that period are ones for which the Government must accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Government have not fairly and squarely accepted responsibility for these difficulties.  This, of course, is always difficult.  Indeed, no Government of any kind will readily say&mdash;we made a mistake.  I am quite sure even if there were a change of Government that those on this side of the House would have difficulty in making this admission at times too. There are times, however, when it is important to make that admission, and unless the Government in a case like this admit that a mistake was made, it is impossible to restore confidence, for example in the business community, that the mistake will be avoided again.</P>
    <P>So long as the Government persist in saying that no mistake was made in 1965, that they were in no way responsible and that the events of that year were not their responsibility, inevitably the feeling persists among people not engaged in politics that the Government do not understand the position, that if they cannot admit what the NIEC report says, and do not understand and accept it, they simply are not competent to manage an economy.  There is inevitably the feeling that the country left in their charge is liable to fall into difficulties again.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the mistakes made in 1965 were mistakes for which the Government must be blamed, as the Government in office.  That mistakes were made is understandable because of the complexity of the situation, and because of the problems then facing the Government.  But unless the Government come out and say distinctly&mdash;yes, we made a mess of things on that occasion because we did not understand fully the workings of the economy in the face of a situation which we never faced before; we now understand what went wrong; we will make perfectly sure it will not happen again; we have taken measures to control the growth of Government policy on capital expenditure so as to ensure that it will not happen again; we have introduced control of credit on a <Col N="600" /> voluntary basis with the Central Bank; all these measures we have taken to retrieve the mistakes made so as to ensure against a repetition&mdash;unless they say this plainly they will not restore confidence, and what we need more than anything else now is the restoration of confidence.</P>
    <P>We are in the position that there is nothing to prevent this country expanding again, at least on the industrial side, and even on the agricultural side if something could be done to change the Government's policies.  There is nothing to prevent the agricultural economy also from expanding.  The money is there; credit is available in the banks.  The only thing that prevents this expansion is lack of confidence, the unwillingness of people to borrow money and risk their own credit and make the necessary effort to expand our economy, because they fear the same mistakes will be made again. A Government that do not agree they made mistakes are liable to make the same mistakes again.  Therefore, the Government would do the country a service, and would not do themselves damage, if they came out a bit more clearly about the position and stopped trying to put forward the weak defence that external events affected the position.</P>
    <P>I would readily say that the crisis of 1952, when the present Government were in office, was one which was provoked by the Korean War difficulties rather than by domestic mismanagement, but on this occasion I could not make the same concession because external events have had only minimal effect.  They have, of course, had some effect.  It would have been much nicer to have had a buoyant British economy throughout this period.  It would have been much nicer not to have had the British import levy, but owing to the effective steps taken by the Government in regard to the import levy, with the introduction of special marketing grants, it did not do so much damage, in fact.</P>
    <P>While the British economy is not buoyant at the moment, nevertheless it must be accepted that we got through difficult periods of stagnation in the British economy before without <Col N="601" /> our economy coming to a full stop. Thus in 1962, as the Minister will recall, the British economy was stagnant. But this did not mean that our economy came to a stop, for things were better managed then.  These excuses just do not wash.  What happened in 1965 was due to mistakes that we made.  There may have been difficulties, and the mistakes made may have been understandable and explicable in the peculiar circumstances of the time, but unless that is admitted, unless the people are told that those mistakes will not be repeated, that the financial problems are now understood and that they will be guarded against in future, we shall not get the restoration in confidence that will enable us with the resources now before us to expand our economy rapidly again during the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>One lesson which we must learn, and I hope it has been learned, is the need for closer co-operation between the Central Bank and the Government. One of the problems that arose in 1964-65 was that the Central Bank, lacking legal power to control credit, felt itself unable to intervene in the excessive expansion of credit until the situation had got so bad that the Bank's intervention had to be accepted. Here, I think, Fine Gael can claim credit, without resorting to a pun, for having pointed the way.  In the election policy of April, 1964, before the crisis hit us, before it was admitted by the Government that there was a crisis, Fine Gael put forward in their Just Society policy a case for giving the Central Bank legal power to control credit.  We said that without that power the Central Bank would be inhibited in dealing with the situation.  It is fair to say that those responsible for that policy did not realise how immediately relevant it was as they wrote those words, how true it was that the very situation they said would arise in the future was arising at that point of time.</P>
    <P>Because the Central Bank could not in fact tell the banks to restrain credit it had to rely on moral suasion, and because it felt that moral suasion would not be effective until the banks felt themselves in difficulties the Bank <Col N="602" /> had to postpone action until May, 1965, when the situation had reached critical proportions.  Now, in retrospect, the Bank should have acted sooner.  It made a mistake in waiting so long.  The Bank was perhaps trying to be a bit clever, waiting until the banks were in real difficulties when they would welcome an intervention.  In the event, rightly or wrongly, that is the course of action the Bank adopted.  Some of the difficulties are due to the failure to take action in time because of the policy of waiting until things were in a real mess in the hope that intervention would be welcomed on a voluntary basis and the Bank would be able to take steps to control credit, even though it lacked the legal power to do so.</P>
    <P>At the same time as all that happened, the Central Bank and the Government seem to have been in a state of misunderstanding <i>vis-à-vis</i> each other.  It is difficult to see on what grounds we were forced to borrow money abroad in 1965.  There was a period in the middle of the year when it appeared that we were facing external payments difficulties and this might have excused foreign borrowing but, in fact, those difficulties were of their nature temporary.</P>
    <P>The crisis of 1965 was not primarily an external payments crisis but an internal financial crisis because of the Government's inflationary policies. Because of the desire of the Central Bank to ensure that this would not be repeated and because of the Bank's desire to ensure that the Government, as well as the commercial banks, would learn a lesson, the Central Bank adopted an excessively restrictive line on credit at that time and the Government, therefore, felt forced to borrow abroad.  This was nonsensical.</P>
    <P>I recall, as a journalist, sending a story on this to a very well-known financial journal explaining what was happening here.  One of the leading people in that journal telephoned me and asked me if we had gone mad; how could the Government in face of the situation that existed in the country at that time, have to borrow abroad; why was it not possible to raise money <Col N="603" /> domestically, as would have been the case in any other country?  This man was prepared even to fly across here and examine this extraordinary position though, in fact, he was diverted to Hong Kong or somewhere like that in connection with other events that occurred.  This crisis was obviously due to some extraordinary misunderstanding between the Government and the Central Bank, so that instead of raising the money locally in co-operation with the Central Bank the Government were forced to borrow abroad.  In any other country the money would have been raised domestically.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that out of this period some lessons have been learned, that co-operation between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank will be closer in future, that this misunderstanding will not arise again, that there will be some confidence between them, that co-operation between the Central Bank and the commercial banks will also be closer, and that we shall not face a repetition of this kind of crisis, partly caused by confusion, misunderstanding, and through bluffs and double bluffs being carried on between these different financial institutions and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The question before us now is what action should we take to get us out of our present difficulties.  The Central Bank's decision to expand the availability of credit has proved inadequate. The credit is there but has not been taken up.  Something more is needed.  This type of action on credit is clearly adequate in this country to deflate the economy, by restricting credit.  Indeed, our economy is extraordinarily sensitive to credit restrictions.  That is clear but, when it comes to reflating the economy, something more than the provision of credit is required.  Credit is in fact something of a one-way weapon; a good way of deflating but an inadequate way of reflating. Therefore, something more is needed now than a policy of expansion of credit.  What is needed is some form of action by the Government to encourage economic expansion.  That is what the Budget should have been doing.  To some extent, the Budget did <Col N="604" /> this.  It was not a deflationary Budget; it was a Budget which did in fact, by adopting a fairly optimistic view as to the future of revenue and by increasing expenditure in certain areas, tend, if anything, to reflate the economy in some degree.  Nevertheless, it is arguable that the form this increased expenditure took was inappropriate to our needs.</P>
    <P>If one examines the condition of the Irish economy in the spring of this year, one thing stands out more than anything else&mdash;the total stagnation of agricultural output.  One thing is clear beyond anything else, that Government policy should be directed and should give priority to the expansion to agricultural output.  The Budget certainly dealt with agriculture; it provided a significant sum for agriculture.  This was influenced, no doubt, by electoral considerations as well as others, but the Government did provide a significant sum for this purpose.  Where, I think, the Minister must be faulted&mdash;and this may be more the fault of the Minister for Agriculture and the advice he gave the Minister for Finance than of the Minister for Finance himself&mdash;is in the manner in which this money was given. A very large proportion of it took the form of provisions of various kinds, meeting social needs&mdash;certainly increases and provisions which we can welcome in terms of the social needs which they satisfy, but which were given in a form which tended not to increase output but, if anything, to reduce it.  If these social provisions had been accompanied by measures designed to offer incentives to increasing output, so as to offset any depressing effects they might have on farmers' willingness to increase output, then we could have welcomed them.  But such measures, in isolation, and with so little in the Budget to encourage the expansion of output of any product, except milk, force us to consider that the Budget, on the agricultural side, was not a balanced Budget, not a well thought out Budget, not directed to the country's needs.  Additional money was pumped into the economy but not in a way to encourage the expansion of output in the area where it is most needed.  The agricultural provisions of <Col N="605" /> the Budget are as unhappy and unfortunate in their general pattern and layout as the other provisions in the Budget are happy and well thought out.  Already, earlier, I welcomed a number of provisions in the Budget which seemed to me to be helpful, useful and desirable.  It is only when we come into the agricultural area that one sees a different hand at work, a different outlook.  There is no sign here of new thinking, new ideas, but only the same old ideas turned out again; the same old provisions offering nothing which would encourage the expansion of output in the sector of the economy where output has been totally stagnant for seven years.</P>
    <P>When I say that output has been totally stagnant for seven years, I am prepared to document that statement. The Minister will know that in the new Table which has appeared for the first time in National Income Expenditure, the value of agricultural output, in constant prices&mdash;making due allowance for price changes, in 1958 prices, was £144.1 million in 1960 and £145 million in 1965, an increase of less than one per cent in five years in the value of agricultural output, allowing for price changes.  Since then, the official estimate of the increase in agricultural output last year, in 1966 (the figure provided in the Department of Finance Progress Report which I have here), is an increase of two-thirds of one per cent last year in output and I have already said the prospects for this year are distinctly gloomy, with very little likelihood of an increase in output, with cattle breeding stock down, and breeding stock in sheep and pigs very much down.  Even allowing for some increase in output of crops and cereals, agricultural output can scarcely increase much this year.</P>
    <P>Thus, between 1960 and 1967 it is clear that agricultural output has been totally stagnant.  I should like the Minister to give us a short list of other countries in the world in respect of which that situation is true.  In the same period&mdash;between 1960 and 1967 &mdash;the numbers on the land must have fallen from 383,000 to something like 310,000, assuming that this year&mdash;as in other recent years&mdash;the decline in the numbers on the land is at least 10,000. <Col N="606" /> That will have been a fall of 73,000, or one-fifth, in the numbers on the land in seven years.  Now we must face the fact that no matter what policies are adopted, the number of people on the land is liable to fall.  This is true here as it is everywhere else but it is not true that they need to fall at the rate at which they have been falling in this country.  I should again like a short list of countries where the agricultural population has fallen by one-fifth in the last seven years.  I think the Minister would have difficulty in producing the names of very many.  This reflects simply the fact that output has been totally stagnant.</P>
    <P>There has been here an appalling failure and we require a radical review of policy; not the same old mixture doled out in the Budget, with an increased dose to cover the local elections and NFA pressure.  The only new element in our agricultural policy we have now is this feud with the NFA, as a result of which the Minister is busy dashing between the Dáil and Seanad, with Bill after Bill, to nail down the NFA, when he should be directing his attention to the increase of output and to trying to retrieve the errors of policy from which we have suffered for so long.  This, I think, is what could be described as the Achilles Heel of the Government.  It is clear now, from the evidence of activity we have had from the present Minister, that the Taoiseach made a serious blunder in appointing him Minister for Agriculture. We are aware of the Minister's qualities but they are not the type of qualities required for this post at this time, where we need a man of imagination and flexibility, two words not frequently used in connection with the present Minister for Agriculture.  The problem is intractable; it can be tackled only with political courage. Departmental policies are strongly held&mdash;as the Minister for Finance himself knows from his experience in that Department.  Nevertheless, a lot more could be done with imagination, with flexibility, by somebody concerned above all to retrieve the situation, to bring us out of this stagnation and concerned to do something constructive instead of directing his attention all the time towards a feud with one <Col N="607" /> organisation.  Unless some change in policy is made here and almost certainly this involves the necessity for a change of Minister, the Taoiseach will regret this in the next couple of years and will find himself facing a very unsatisfactory situation at the time of the next general election.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the individual targets for agricultural output; targets set by the Department of Agriculture themselves in 1964; not by anybody else; not by the NFA; not by the Department of Finance, but by the Department of Agriculture which, in 1964, decided that with the policies which they then were operating and with any change of policy then contemplated, they would be able to expand agricultural output by 3.8 per cent every year.  They set targets for the growth of output of each product published in the Appendix at the end of the Second Programme, Part II.  The only target in respect of which progress has been more rapid than was set out in the Programme is in respect of horses.  For some reason which I do not understand, horse output&mdash;which is of negligible importance in relation to other forms of output in agriculture &mdash;has run well ahead of the target. But the rest of the picture is utterly depressing.  The output of cattle last year was just about on target but this year, with the reduction of breeding stock, it will almost certainly fall behind target.  For the rest, in 1966, the output of sheep was 23 per cent below the target for that year; the output of pigs was 13 per cent down; the output of wool 18 per cent down; the output of eggs 11 per cent down; the output of wheat 41½ per cent down; the output of oats 33 per cent down; the output of barley 8 per cent down; the output of sugar beet 35 per cent down and the output of potatoes 12 per cent down.  The output for potatoes, 12 per cent.  The output for turf, 20 per cent.  I have not got the accurate figure here for milk.  I think it was 7 per cent below target but it may be slightly more, perhaps 9 per cent.  This is the record of the Government with their own policies and their own targets.  Nobody forced <Col N="608" /> these targets on the Government: nobody told the Government what their policies should be.  The Government decided that with their present policies that they had in 1964 and any changes they then contemplated they would achieve a growth in agricultural output and they set targets very proudly.  They made a lot of it.  They told us all about it in the general election campaign of 1965 and it was too soon for anybody to see that the targets were not being attained. Since then what have they been doing about it?  Nothing.  I have read all the documents the Government have produced on this subject and the only target I have ever seen referred to in the agricultural sector since 1964 is the cattle target to which reference has been made in a hand-out in connection with the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  No other figure is ever referred to.  These targets were set in 1964 with great <i>éclat</i> and since then there has not been a word about them.  The Government are so ashamed of them they are not prepared to mention them.</P>
    <P>Let us get these things straight.  What are these targets for?  The purpose of a system of economic planning and of targets is to force people to state clearly what their policies are and what results they expect so that when these policies work out favourably they can be continued and when they do not they can be reviewed.  In this case it is perfectly evident that above all other targets in the Second Programme the agriculture targets showed disastrous results.  Either the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1964 were totally irresponsible in stating that these increases in output would occur or, alternatively, if they were acting responsibly, then they are now obliged to reconsider the policy which, it must now be admitted, was a complete failure.  I know that sometimes the excuse is made that, of course, the targets were related to our joining the EEC.  This is certainly true to a point but, in fact, as we know the speed of change is so slow in the agricultural sector that even had we joined EEC the effects of this would not have been very great by 1970. Indeed had these targets taken full <Col N="609" /> account of the ultimate effects of EEC membership and had it been assumed that the benefits would have been reached by 1970, the growth rate would almost certainly have been well over 3.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>In any event, even if failure to achieve membership of EEC had any effect on the target growth rates, the fact remains that we have utter stagnation. Are the Government to tell us that unless we join EEC Irish agriculture must stagnate and nothing whatever can be done about it?  I think that the whole system of economic planning has not been understood by the Government. They represented it by targets. They looked very cheerful, 4 per cent growth rate, 50 per cent increase in national output in ten years.  They were good political gimmicks at the time and, without realising the implications of what they were doing, they adopted them, committed themselves to them, but there was no realisation that the purpose of this exercise is to create new pressures on policies, to ensure that people if they adopt policies which do not produce results which they think ought to come from them will be forced to reconsider them.  This was not realised and it is quite evident today that after three years of complete failure in the agricultural sphere there is no inclination on the part of the Government or Minister to notice this, to refer to it or to change these policies or to take any action to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government must face their responsibilities in this matter.  Do they want to face the next election with the Second Programme in ruins around them, the targets of which are already badly shaping?  They just accept the need for a total review of agricultural policies.  Admittedly, there are external constraints.  Until we join the EEC we are going to live under certain difficulties. The Minister here today 18 months ago told us with great enthusiasm about the enormous benefits to agriculture the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement would bring.  These exaggerations were not taken too seriously by anyone but some people did expect some benefits which did not accrue.  I did not <Col N="610" /> think they would be very great but they should have been rather greater than they have been to date.  Even in this situation with an unsatisfactory Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and without membership of EEC, it must be possible to achieve a somewhat better result than we have achieved so far.  It could be achieved if the Government were prepared to change their attitude.  This has been done in other areas.  I do not want to dwell all the time on failures.</P>
    <P>In other areas we have had successes. In other areas, in other Departments and State bodies responsible for the policies concerned, we have had considerable success.  The growth of our tourist industry is a case in point. There we look like attaining and, indeed, exceeding the Second Programme target because of the extraordinarily skilful and energetic way in which Bord Fáilte have undertaken its work in promoting tourism, in securing the creation of facilities to bring tourists to this country and in the development of hotels, which reminds me that I should have welcomed in the Minister's speech at the outset the provisions he has made for hotel grants. In that area we are achieving or likely to achieve the target of the Second Programme because the policies have been carefully conceived, because the Government&mdash;to be precise Bord Fáilte advising the Government&mdash;have thought out the problems, have seen the need for publicity to attract people here, have seen the need for extra car ferries and aircraft to bring them and extra hotels to put them up when they are here, the need for offices throughout the country to help people get hotel accommodation.  All these have been foreseen, planned and provided.  This is an area in which the relevant State body and the relevant Government Department deserve all credit for the success.</P>
    <P>In other areas the same thing is true. We had serious problems in our fishing industry in which, I do not think, we will attain the Second Programme target but we are securing the beginnings of growth in this sector.  If the Minister would relent on the provision of capital for fishing, I feel we could <Col N="611" /> make very great progress because the State body tackling its problems energetically, with a fresh mind, not tied down to ancient policies, willing to take a fresh look at the problem, has succeeded in reversing a very damaging downward trend and in setting this industry off in a good direction, although to reap the full benefits in that case a very big increase in the financial provision at present made would be required.  I would ask the Minister to look particularly at that question, preferably between now and the next Stage but certainly in the next Budget.  The provision of the capital programme for fishing is quite inadequate in relation to potential gains.  There are few areas where additional investment would now reap such a return because we have now reached the stage where, with sound policies and good administration, we have started to get growth in the fishing industry.  These are two areas&mdash;tourism in one case and fishing in the other&mdash;in which a failure was followed by a review of policies and now success.</P>
    <P>The same thing is possible in agricultural policy if the Government had the courage to review their existing policies&mdash;first of all, to assess the return they are getting from all the various grants they provide.  I do not know how many grants there are.  I have failed to count them accurately and successfully.  There must be something like 100 grants.  No attempt was made to review this until now.  I am assured by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that such a review is now in progress.  I hope the Minister for Finance will ask for details of it and hurry it up and that he will then drastically review the present system increasing provision where the provision is yielding return in output and cutting it out where it is not.  There are a lot of deadwood policies which need to be cut out and replaced by schemes tied to planned increases of output with the necessary building backed by State finance.</P>
    <P>I think there is also a need to review the role of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is significant <Col N="612" /> that the areas in which we have had success have been areas where State bodies have been responsible for the policies concerned.  Such bodies are able to act flexibly, are willing to review their policies if they are mistaken, are flexible and are not tied down by a long tradition as in the case of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and by an inflexible Minister.  I think that we might well consider transforming the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries into a high powered policy Department, transferring the administration of these schemes, as has been suggested by Fine Gael, to a rural development authority with local offices working closely with local farming organisations to administer the schemes and to give the assistance to farmers who are prepared to work for the authority, to prepare plans for increased output and show themselves able and willing to achieve increases in output.</P>
    <P>Nearer home to the Minister who is here today, I should like to ask him what the position is as regards the targets for public finance.  How is it that after three years of the Second Programme he has never in any speech that I am aware of referred to the targets of the Second Programme for public finance?  He has never told us whether we are achieving or overachieving the targets.  He has never reviewed the position.  Does he know how we stand?  Does he get regular reports for his own perusal as to the trend of public expenditure as against the targets?  If he does, why is he not giving them to the public, why is he not comparing the present position with what was planned in the Programme? If he is getting regular reports why is he not publishing them and talking about them?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is that the Government are embarrassed because some of the targets are not being achieved or that the the Government do not understand what economic planning is all about.  In any event, to get words of wisdom or even of foolishness from the Government about the Second Programme has become almost impossible.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for <Col N="613" /> his explanation as to why the percentage of the national output absorbed by taxation has been rising at three times the rate planned in the Programme. I have offered my own explanation, put forward in another place, where I have commented on it. If a Government sets out in a public document that they will increase the burden of taxation by .35 per cent annually, to rise during a period of seven years from 23.7 per cent to 26.2 per cent by 1970, and if a Government then proceeds to increase the burden at three times that rate, the public are entitled to some explanation, to some reference to it.</P>
    <P>Instead, they get nothing more than a total, embarrassed silence.  My own explanation of it&mdash;and I should be glad if the Minister would comment on it, if he has bothered to get the necessary information to do so&mdash;is that it is due to two things.  Firstly, the Second Programme made no provision for the status increases given in the public service, amounting to £10 million. The Government justify those increases, but those justified increases, which when they were asked for were met because they were justified, had never been thought of by the Department, never been provided for in the Second Programme.  Thus, two-thirds of the explanation for this rise in taxation is due to that situation.  The other matter contributing to the increase is that the national economic growth has levelled off and fallen far behind the planned rate of growth and the lower level of national output does not yield the figure provided for in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in this explanation I shall welcome correction by the Minister and I should like him to provide us with figures showing us precisely how and why taxation has risen by three times the rate planned in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Programme, which I criticised at the time, is that it made no provision for an expansion of the share of social welfare transfer payments.  The Government were then contemplating an economic programme for seven years ahead in which social welfare provisions would rise no faster <Col N="614" /> than the national output&mdash;in fact they proposed that they would lag slightly behind it.  That was their plan but in practice the Government have not adhered to it.  Social welfare provisions have increased faster, partly because of the Fine Gael 1965 election campaign. No provision was made for that in the Second Programme.  No provision was made for any increase in the share of transfer payments because the Government had not and have not any social programme.  Since they came into office, apart from one small change in relation to retirement benefits, there has not been any new development, no review apart from the small sums of 2/6d or 5/- each year added to social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The only thing we have had are two statements.  One of them was by the former Taoiseach who, in the 1965 campaign, said that it would be very difficult to produced a social programme. This statement came from a Government which produced a complex economic programme or had it produced for them.  The second thing is that the Government say they have transferred the job of producing a social programme to the Economic and Social Research Institute.  This, of course, if true, would be simply an abdication of responsibility by the Government.  All they have done in fact is to seek the data they need and which they have not got, to seek that basic data from the Institute so that a programme of social reform might be provided, for to have left the job of drawing up a social programme to an institute of that kind would be an abdication from responsibility by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have had ten years to produce a social programme but, in fact, they have not managed even to extract from their records the necessary information to enable a review to be carried out.  I do not think the Department of Social Welfare employ anyone with the expertise to do this work.  Such a record of failure during ten years in office is something of which no Government can be proud. Indeed, I am surprised at it because I would have thought that in commonsense any Government would, even <Col N="615" /> purely as a defence mechanism alone, have instituted some studies, instructed them to have been carried out, and would have endeavoured to have had the necessary data made available to them to carry out some reforms.  They may say that the money is not available for these reforms.  If so, if the money is not available, that is a further condemnation of a Government who have had ten years in which to work out policies.</P>
    <P>In the references I have made to the various targets in the fields of public finance and agriculture I have said that we have had no information as to where we stand.  What we have had is a promise last year that we would have a mid-term review of the Second Programme at the beginning of this year.  The beginning of this year arrived and we were told we would have the review in the middle of the year.  We are now past the middle of the year and where is the review?  This is a ludicrous position to be in.  We have had in the Second Programme a picture of our economic possibilities and this was a worthwhile exercise, although containing weaknesses at certain points because the Government did not examine it closely enough. Since its issue, however, the Programme has been dropped like a hot cake, and promises of a review have been repeatedly postponed, obviously with the hope that we would reach 1970 without anybody bothering to ask any awkward questions.</P>
    <P>I am asking them now.  I am asking why the mid-term review has not been made available.  Reports on the economy to which I have referred earlier are produced each year.  In the one I have here there are no references to the targets of the Programme.  This document is in exactly the same form as it might have been ten years ago or four years ago.  It is a document that could have been produced in a country that has never heard of economic planning.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in two ways, firstly in relation to the short-term management of the economy, they made serious mistakes in 1964-65 which they should admit and endeavour to avoid in the future.  Secondly, they <Col N="616" /> should have formulated a mid-term review of the Programme to examine its success or otherwise.  I know a review of policies is embarrassing to the Government for to change a policy is to make an admission of a mistake. But the Government have responsibilities&mdash;that is what they are there for &mdash;to run the country successfully and they have no right to refuse to review policies even though such a review might involve unpopular action.</P>
    <P>A large part of our difficulties arise from the fact that all Parties press all the time for demagogic popular policies which are damaging to the growth of national economy.  The responsibility for this is widely shared.  I do not place it entirely on the Government but the Government are responsible as no one else is for resisting those pressures and for implementing policies which, though they may be unpopular at the time, would secure economic growth and lay the foundation of long term prosperity and which would indeed probably lay the foundation of long term popularity for the Party which had the courage to administer such a policy.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to cut out policies which have not been successful in producing economic growth, which are wasting the country's money, and which are popular, because policies which hand out money are always popular, but this is what the Government has to do.  The responsibility for this is shared.  It lies not solely on the Government.  I would accept that there is responsibility also on the Opposition to refrain from demagogic pressures and to refrain from demagogic criticism as far as possible.  I am sure that on our side we, too, have failed in this respect but the primary responsibility lies with the Government.  It is they who have to give the lead.  If they give the lead and the Opposition do not follow the Opposition can be legitimately criticised for not doing so.  But the lead must come from the Government.</P>
    <P>This is the lesson of the NIEC report on full employment, the popular version of which, incidentally, if I may make the point, should never have been published without a question <Col N="617" /> mark in the title.  The whole purpose of this report was to put to the people that if we seriously want full employment it will require changes in policy that people will not readily accept and that if they are not prepared to accept them we can forget about full employment.  It is Full Employment?&mdash;with a question mark. Do we want full employment?  Can we get full employment?</P>
    <P>What did the Government do?  They published, the Department of Finance published, a very useful summary of this document headed &ldquo;Full Employment.&rdquo; full stop, as if this was a plan for full employment although throughout the document the NIEC reiterated again and again that there was no plan for full employment.  It was rather a challenge directed at the community as a whole, at its leaders, in politics, religion and other walks of life, a challenge as to whether they seriously believe in full employment and whether they are prepared to do the unpopular things necessary to secure full employment.  To publish that without a question mark was either to misconstrue the purpose of the document, showing no understanding of what it was about or else to play for popularity in a matter far too serious to be reduced to that level.</P>
    <P>This NIEC report is, above all, a challenge to politics and politicians of all Parties and, amongst politicians, above all, the Government.  I do not think our people will accept indefinitely the failure to mobilise our resources for economic expansion and full employment.  They may vote in the short term for the Party which adopt and persist in popular policies regardless of their damage to the possibility of growth and expansion of employment. In the long run, however, people will resent the failures of politicians and the failures of the Government to do their duty in this respect, to stand up to those demagogic pressures, to do the unpopular thing, to cut out the deadwood expenditure and to concentrate expenditure on areas where it can produce returns.  If we fail to do that, if this Government fail to do it and if the Opposition Parties fail to <Col N="618" /> press them to do it, we will have failed to make democracy work in this country.</P>
    <P>We will, by so doing, have endangered the fabric of our society.  Our people have an option, an option which they are all too willing to take.  If they do not like it here, they can go elsewhere. If we fail to create in this country the kind of society we could have, which our people want but are not always willing to pay for or to support by their votes, if we are not prepared to give the lead in creating such a society, there will not eventually be any society.  The fabric of our society was badly shaken in the 1950s when at one stage the percentage of our people leaving the country was the equivalent of 85 per cent of our school leavers each year.  It is all too easy to fall back into that situation if we allow the situation to drift as we have been doing in the last couple of years.  Either we make democracy work or we can opt out of the situation. Either we accept our responsibilities or there will not be any responsibilities left to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult to follow Senator FitzGerald but having castigated Fianna Fáil for their mistakes and having admitted the mistakes of Fine Gael, perhaps the Labour Party might have a few words. I will be reasonably brief on this Bill and largely I will be repeating a plea I made to the former Minister for Finance, who is now the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The effect of this Bill and of all budgets is to impose more taxation, but I feel we are approaching this matter on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The Minister, I feel, looks at the expenses he has to meet and he searches around and sees what is the most convenient way of collecting the necessary income which will be the least politically unpopular. I do not think there is any effort to work out a social policy in regard to taxation.  That is my criticism of this and other budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no effort to relate the taxation we are imposing to the ability to pay it.  It is here the Labour Party make the criticism.  All the <Col N="619" /> philosophy for that taxation should be directed according to the ability to pay, not on the basis of what might be most convenient from time to time, from year to year.  We have very little information as to the burden of taxation. We know what income tax is paid by people in the various income groups but we do not know the effect of indirect taxation on the same people.</P>
    <P>I made an appeal last year that there should be a survey of the impact of taxation on the various income groups. We should know and all Parties should have available to them information as to how taxation as a whole affects the people in the various income groups and in the various sectors of the economy. We have the burden of income tax.  We have customs and excise duties.  We have profits tax and lately we have had turnover tax and more recently again we have had wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, the burden of rates and also in regard to workers' social insurance contributions which are another form of tax.  I think we need to know, if we are to have a policy in relation to social justice, how the weight of overall taxation bears on the different income groups.</P>
    <P>I also expressed the view here previously that the people in the urban areas, particularly the workers, bear an undue weight of taxation but it would be far more realistic, and far more helpful to all of us, if there could be this type of survey, a survey which is, in fact, available in Britain.  There you can see the weight of overall taxation on the various income groups and the point at which people pay more than they get back by benefits from the effect of the Government redistribution of this money.  We have no information along those lines in this country.  It would be sensible that we should have it and the only people who can do it are the people in the Department of Finance.  I would again make a plea to the Minister that this work should be started.  It would be a help to him, to all politicians and to all political parties if we could have this type of information.  We have no <Col N="620" /> philosophy in regard to taxation but we may say that there is a hint of it in this particular Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I refer to the provision which cases the burden on the payers of surtax, people with incomes of £3,000 per annum and upwards, who get some relief in this Bill.  The cost is, according to the Minister's statement, £150,000 per annum.  Now, in relation to the overall taxation collected that is not much.  When we look at how it really affects the people concerned we find that around 5,000 people benefit by reason of this change, and, on average, that is a benefit of £30 per annum, slightly over 10/- per week.  In this Finance Bill the Minister is assisting those people, handing out to them, because the money has to be paid by somebody else, over 10/- &mdash;to people with over £30 per week&mdash;whilst in the same Budget he is providing 5/- per week for old age pensioners who are in receipt of £2 7s 6d per week.</P>
    <P>If that is the Minister's policy in regard to taxation policy we are clearly with him.  It is easy for people to argue that surtax weighs heavily on surtax payers but not many of us believe that people will emigrate and pull up their roots in this country because they might have to pay 10/- per week more in surtax than they will in Britain.  That is not likely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mainly a question of getting them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usually a question of their leaving.  The problem is that we educate people, largely on subsidies as well, up to a certain level and many people who get university education with assistance from the taxpayers are leaving the country.  Of course, they are entitled to leave.  The brain drain is upwards and I think it is a bit unrealistic that the Minister should try to get people with qualifications into this country.  The problem is in relation to the people who are leaving. It is not the level of surtax which affects the issue at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this.  The people who benefit by this are the influential people, those who have an ear of the Minister, those who subscribe <Col N="621" /> to Taca.  But, here in this Budget we are providing 10/- per week for them, whilst at the same time being terribly generous in giving old age pensioners with £2 7s 6d a week an extra 5/-, and that only from August of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than the Labour Party ever gave them anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And that subject to a means test.  I feel strongly that the lower and middle income groups, particularly in the urban areas, have an undue burden to bear in regard to taxation as a whole.  One of the reasons for this is the failure to properly adjust income tax allowances, with the result that lower paid workers, comparatively lower paid workers, are paying in come tax, and have no escape from it, deducted at source.  The burden is altogether too severe on them.  This is one of the reasons why I said that a survey would be useful so that we could have the facts of the situation and be able to make a judgment on the basis of the facts.</P>
      <P>The other criticism I have to make on the Budget is that there is no indication of long-term planning. There does not seem to be any long-term perception in regard to taxation. It is, as I said, an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement. The Minister imposes taxation, and properly, and I suppose understandably does it in a way that will create the least public outcry from the voters. But, I do not think that is sufficient if we are properly to plan our economy.</P>
      <P>One of the major failures in the Second Programme was the lack of discipline.  I think Senator FitzGerald made this point on the lack of discipline on the part of the Government in regard to their expenditure.  We should know if we are to plan our economy properly what part of the GNP the Government are likely to take in future years; in other words, instead of an annual Budget that there would be some sort of long term perception; that the Minister would be able to say and that the country would be able to know what the likely proportion is which the Government will extract by way of taxation in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> May I underline the fact that we are not opposed to the Government taking more in taxation?  The criticism is that they take it from the wrong people, in so far as we can judge the situation, and they take it in a way that has detrimental effects on the growth of the economy and on the achievement of social justice.  There is no evidence of any priorities in the Government's mind in regard to taxation policy, how they will spend the money they take from the taxpayer every year.  To be cynical about it, one might say that if Deputy O'Malley is shifted to another Department we might have a completely different taxation position. That Minister when he was in the Department of Health provided, or promised, free medical schemes, <i>et cetera</i>.  Then, he was changed to the Department of Education and he has swept his way through there.  He is doing a lot of good.  But, in all this we have not had any evidence of long-term planning on the part of the Government.  For example, let us take the provision in regard to schools.  We are not objecting to that but we have an arrangement which will involve increase in costs, costs which will grow year after year, and there is no indication that the Government have planned ahead.  There is no indication that they know where they are going or that they will simply look at the books next year, tot up the figures and take the appropriate money out of the GNP without any regard to the long-term growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister in replying to this debate will give us the benefit of his thinking and his philosophy in regard to taxation.  Are we to have a continuation of this Government's policy of a preference for indirect taxation rather than direct taxation, a preference for a system in which you take money from people irrespective of their ability to pay rather than a system advocated by the Labour Party, in which you collect money on the basis of ability to pay?</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  It would be desirable that there should be a continuous examination to see if we get due value for the money we collect by way of taxation <Col N="623" /> and which we spend on various services. For example, to go back to the school fees situation, this will cost about £2 million next year; it will cost an increasing amount of money in succeeding years.  Might it not have been better had the money been spent on paying maintenance grants to the parents of children who at present cannot afford to keep their children at school for secondary education?  That is something worthy of examination, but there does not seem to be any examination in depth of these types of problems.  I am not talking about a question of checking on the expenditure of State moneys &mdash; this is very adequately covered at the moment&mdash; rather am I talking about the cost benefit and increasingly the Minister might direct his attention to the question of taking a long-term view of this to see if we are getting the proper benefit for the cost of the various services.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating any cut at all in these.  What I am saying is that we seem to add on one service on top of another.  We leave the existing framework; we improve and so on but it would always be better that there should be this cost benefit analysis or examination of the situation to see if real improvements could be made by a change in the system.  An example of this which comes to my mind is the money spent on keeping old people in various institutions around the country. Might it not be better&mdash;again it is a matter of opinion, but certainly a matter worthy of examination&mdash;to spend that money on increasing the incomes of these people and provide the necessary help for them so that they could stay at home, and I suggest, be far happier if that was the situation?  But we simply go along. We provide benefits.  We never take a close look at the situation and there is no evidence that this Government know where they are going in this respect.</P>
    <P>Year after year we have increased taxation.  We agree that the State must spend more money.  We are a little critical of the <i>ad hoc</i> way this problem is approached.  The Labour Party are <Col N="624" /> all in favour of planning the development of our economy but an essential feature of the planning must be a long-term plan in regard to our taxation policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many features of this Bill which we can welcome.  I should like to welcome the section dealing with medical expenses. This is something which has been requested for quite a while and now we can all join in giving it a hearty welcome.  But I would appeal that the same provision should be extended to the cost of litigation.  Money spent in defence should be treated on a somewhat similar basis because when it comes to charging fees, I do not think the solicitors play second fiddle to any in the medical profession.  The impact can be very heavy and can also act on people who are innocent of the charge but have to provide a defence for it, I appeal to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to the bringing of this in in the coming year, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous years a central feature of the Finance Bill was the great consideration given to death duties, various rates of change and so on. Nothing has emerged in the present Bill.  In other words, it is the <i>status quo</i>.  I must confess grave disappointment at this, because we have pointed out very strongly in the past year and previous years the injustice of our present code of death duties on, above all, the young widow left with a large family.  The younger she is, the more death duties will be extracted from her by the State, that is, if she is in receipt of any pension on the death of her husband, the pension is cumulated based on her expectation of life. Therefore, if she is a widow of 70, it is just cumulated up for about three to four years.  If she is a widow of 35, it is cumulated on an expectation of life of 35 years.  The present value of the pension is calculated on that basis and the whole load is placed on the unfortunate widow at that stage.  Surely nothing could be crueller or more inhuman than such treatment.  I have asked here in the Seanad&mdash;and many others have joined me&mdash;to at least <Col N="625" /> have that burden lightened by paying it on a &ldquo;pay as you live&rdquo; basis.  If the State is going to extract its pound of flesh from the pension the widow gets, then, in the name of all humanity, why not at least take it as the pension comes in year by year, rather than insisting that it be paid all at once when the widow is in the worst possible condition to face any heavy financial commitment of that type?  I would ask the Government to add to the PAYE system&mdash;which has been such a success&mdash;a PAYL system to be applied to widows' pensions on that basis.  If they did that, it would be a great service to the widows in the community, and, of course, a great service to all husbands in the community who are really concerned with making certain that if they are cut off their widows and families will at least be able to exist in some way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, on that point, I might also draw the Government's attention in planning to the use of selected zones, development zones in the country with lighter rates of death duty, to attract people from abroad.  This was a scheme mooted first by the late Father Coyne, President of the IAOS, which seemed a highly imaginative one.  He envisaged it being applied to areas like Killarney, around Glengarriff and the Bantry areas, where people residing there would be free from death duties or liable only at a very low rate, which would be a means of attracting capital into the country and attracting people in retirement to come to spend their retirement money here.</P>
    <P>Again we must welcome the decision by the Government to remove all rates from land with a poor law valuation of less than £20.  This is a worthwhile step.  I should like to see it just a forerunner of the complete abolition of rates on agricultural land and the substitution thereof of a realistic income tax code.  That would be a much fairer system and, at the same time, it would get over the sense of injustice that the rest of the community feel against the farming community when they say: &ldquo;Oh, they are not paying income tax&rdquo;. In point of fact the burden of rates is such at present on agricultural land <Col N="626" /> that any farmer with under 100 to 150 acres would pay less if he were treated on an income tax basis rather than on the present rates basis.  I feel it would be a much fairer system if it could be brought in.  I know the National Farmers Association and Macra na Feirme have, over the last eight or ten years, advocated it on many occasions.  There may be difficulties in administering it but it is a direction in which I think Government policy should move.</P>
    <P>The Budget as such is an instrument of planning and shows the direction in which the Government are using the Budget in an effort to influence policy. We look then for evidence of imaginative planning and thinking on the future.  It is rather disappointing in many respects in this regard.  With regard to the question of agriculture, which has been dealt with so exhaustively by Senator FitzGerald, I just want to take a few points.  First of all, the penny increase per gallon of milk. That undoubtedly was justified.  However, the drop in the price of calves has more than counteracted this increase. In fact, the drop compared with 12 months ago has been over £5 per calf and a penny a gallon on our national average of 500 gallons is just £2 per cow.  Consequently, the drop in calf prices this year has been equivalent to a reduction in milk prices of 2½d a gallon.  The Government should do something about the position with regard to calves because the Government have called for an increase in the cattle population.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme sets a heavy but a realisable target.  Yet, this year, when cow numbers have increased just in proportion to what was expected under the Second Programme we find a disastrous situation with regard to calves.  Calves are the raw material of our beef industry.  I know it is difficult but there should be some means of coming to the rescue of the producers. A calf subsidy has been suggested in many quarters but I feel that, perhaps, it would be better and more useful planning if it could be directed at the marketing end and an effort made to get our beef marketed at a much earlier stage and, perhaps, channel quite a few of our additional calves <Col N="627" /> into the provision of baby beef and subsidies or help that accordingly.  That is the direction in which we must move. The policy should be that the money should be used rather than as a flat subsidy to attain desirable objectives. That, I feel, is something that all forward thinkers in agriculture regard as being essential.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute which is doing such excellent work and producing such valuable results on what we can achieve gave a warning two months ago that at the end of this year we are likely to have a surplus of 100,000 to 150,000 cattle that the present markets are not likely to absorb.  What are we doing about that?  I suggest the remedy is to decrease the acreage devoted to beef production and swing Government policy much more in favour of increased production of dairy products. It is in that direction and that direction alone our future in agriculture lies.</P>
    <P>During a recent visit to the US I had an opportunity of discussing this with some agriculturalists, some of our own men.  They were all agreed that the one banker in Irish agricultural policy is the success of the Feed the Hungry Campaign.  We all know&mdash;but do we shrug it off?  &mdash;that there are large areas of the world where people are dying of starvation.  We know that those areas are calling out for products that can be supplied through our material products.  What are we doing about it in any realistic sense?  I know we make a contribution but this is only a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware our foreign policy does not seem to show the slightest concern with this.  I would much prefer that our foreign policy was a crusade to get the wealthy nations of the world&mdash;in fact, all the nations of the world&mdash;to contribute according to their means to try to alleviate world hunger on a realistic basis. If that is done, the situation will change overnight from a situation in which we have a surplus of agricultural products, especially dairy products, to a situation in which the nations are asking: &ldquo;How much can you produce and what long term plans can you start to aid in that <Col N="628" /> production?&rdquo;  When that day comes we will be able to play a very valuable role and, at the same time, it will provide a real foundation for an ever-expanding dairy industry in this country.  It is only on that foundation and not on wide ranges devoted to the production of beef that a small country can operate.  I suggest that the Government should show their concern for this by devoting far more of our Budget to actually helping to send more of our products to those needy areas than they are doing at present. Let us not be content with merely giving what is the agreed international figure.  Let us show our concern by giving almost to the point at which it hurts and thereby setting an example to the other nations which have far more material goods than we have.  If that is done, we will be doing, perhaps, the greatest humanitarian task that can be done in the world and will be taking a really major step towards solving our agricultural problem, thereby putting the economy on a really sound and lasting foundation.</P>
    <P>On the short term basis, we need&mdash; there is no need to repeat it here&mdash; provision for meat marketing.  If we needed to have this brought home to us fully, the recent statement by the Agricultural Institute pointing out the glut we run into in the autumn should be sufficient warning to us to get on with the job immediately of having proper meat marketing to deal with the errors of our former policy, our fly-by-night record in the American meat market.  Thank God, we are in the positive cycle in that respect at the moment: we are back in the American market this year at approximately our 1962 figure.</P>
    <P>I must say that Government policy as expressed in this year's Budget shows concern by devoting funds aimed at holding that valuable market, now that we have got back into it for about the fifth time in the past 15 years.  I cannot see how any rational marketing system could tolerate a record like we have got in that most desirable of all markets.</P>
    <P>The flat increase in milk prices of a penny per gallon costs a good deal&mdash;<Col N="629" /> £1.6 million&mdash;but I go along with Senator FitzGerald that more imaginative use could be made of our scarce funds.  Another look should be taken at the two-tier system of milk prices because it seems more in accordance with social justice and cost of production analysis that the small man should get more encouragement.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Budget provides for further development of farmhouse accommodation in certain areas, particularly the West.  This is quite a worthwhile development, something that I and many others advocated in the Seanad for the first time about ten years ago.  Then it was hailed as a novel idea.  It is some consolation to know that after eight or ten years it is coming to fruition to some extent, though as conceived at present it is only a fraction of what it could be because the emphasis here is merely on farmhouse accommodation&mdash;accommodation for tourists as they pass around and spend a night, whereas a real type of scheme would seek to utilise all the resources available on a farm, not merely the extra room and the capacity of the housewife to provide certain services.</P>
    <P>In advocating this formerly we looked to a much more ambitious and imaginative scheme, a farm family holiday scheme with the emphasis on &ldquo;family&rdquo; and &ldquo;holiday&rdquo;.  What we envisaged was that a family who might not have a car, coming from England or from our cities, could go down for a couple of weeks to a farm and on that farm the family car would be available for hire for part of the holiday if the visitors wished to avail of it.  The farm pony would be available for riding, and the care of children would be included.  It would be much more comprehensive than the restricted form of farmhouse accommodation provided for here.  I suggest we should try to develop along those lines.</P>
    <P>The increased provision for the Tourist Board in some way pinpoints that the aid given to efforts to lengthen the holiday season should be more positive.  The season is lengthening but we could add to it considerably by providing suitable amenities to cater for both ends of the season.  Tying in <Col N="630" /> with our efforts for EEC membership &mdash;retraining and other schemes&mdash;we might start to make use of the accommodation in our resorts after the season is finished to bring groups together for retraining for periods. Passing through our resorts we see some of them shut down in early September and this cries out that there is too much waste of resources while there is not nearly enough emphasis on bringing groups together for retraining.</P>

I do not think we are moving fast enough.  I would have thought there would have been many more incentive provisions in the Budget to encourage groups to do more towards equipping themselves. I appreciate a good deal has been done but much remains.  We have got many untapped resources that can be mobilised to this purpose.

I support the Senator's plea that full employment should always be put off with a question mark.  It is a very difficult thing to attain but if as a nation we will to attain it then the NIEC Report gives some idea of the sacrifices each and every one of us must make to attain that idea.</P>

      <P>When the Budget was introduced by the Minister for Finance some months ago the general comment was that it was an election Budget designed to secure support for the Fianna Fáil Party in the local elections. The county council elections have come and gone.  Of course, Fianna Fáil have suffered a heavy defeat compared with the gains of Fine Gael in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, first of all, that this Budget was designed purely and simply for votes when we examined what was in it.  It was designed actually to secure votes from the people.  It did not succeed.  After so many years of Fianna Fáil we find that now the national debt is approaching £1,000,000,000 for a small population of less that 3,000,000 here.  The policy of Fianna Fáil seems to be that of putting the country further into debt, causing greater difficulties, so far as deflation is concerned, and stagnation in our economy.  They are just clinging on to office by the expenditure of public money but the fact is that some day this must come to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the Budget.  We find here that the Minister offers a joy ride to the old age and blind pensioners by offering free transport to them.  Of course, that was a very popular gimmick and, of course, it is correct that <Col N="632" /> many of those people will be glad to get it.  It was intended to make people happy.  Now we come along to the 5/-increase for the old age pensioners. That is the way it was read out but as soon as the old age pensioners went to look for it&mdash;they had to look for it&mdash; they discovered they would be subjected to a means test.  Many of them got less instead of more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to this 5/-per week phony offer to the old age pensioners, we have the Minister giving 10/- per week relief to people earning over £30 a week.  This is the relief in income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you have the Minister pretending to the country that he was giving relief in relation to the first £20 on the valuation of land.  He pretended that this was a very big concession but, in fact, the majority of people were not aware that the farmers were already getting relief <Col N="633" /> on the first £16.  The only difference was an extra £4 of the valuation on which full relief would be allowed. That amounted only to approximately 6d per day relief for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the £6,000,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that, we have the Minister offering rates relief to farmers up to £33 but the strings attached to it will make the position such that very few of the farmers under £33 will benefit from it. Then he offers a dole to the farmers. That may be all right for the unfortunate farmers who have been reduced to destitution.  It is a great relief for them but it would have been better if the Government could provide some kind of production policy that would bring a measure of prosperity to farmers instead of this relief, this dole.</P>
      <P>We then had free electricity allowances. We read the regulations recently relating to that and only a fraction of the old age pensioners who thought they were going to get this relief will, in fact, qualify for it.  In addition to that, although the Government are pretending to give them relief, they have left the administration of this to the ESB who will be involved in a considerable amount of work.  This will cost far more in the form of administration costs in the ESB than the benefit which will be made available to those old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is interested, I can show him the kind of work the ESB are involved in in trying to implement this scheme.  If it is worthwhile the ESB may be able to calculate how much, in fact, it will cost in administration to give this rather limited benefit to the very few people who will qualify for this scheme.  We then had Deputy Blaney on television telling us that the farmers never had it so good in 1966.  We saw last year the stagnation and confusion in the agricultural field.  In addition to that, there has been a very substantial drop in farmers' incomes for 1966 and there is nothing in this Budget which will ensure an increase in production and revenue for the farmers.  He offers 1d a gallon for the milk.  I remember when Deputy James Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, gave an increase of 1d per gallon for milk that the Fianna Fáil Party were scoffing at the miserable increase but at that time calves were fetching £30 each.  At present we know very well that the price of calves has dropped to a very low figure.  The 1d a gallon increase for milk will not compensate for the heavy drop in prices that the owners of those calves are experiencing at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister then offers relief in respect of medical expenses but there is a tag on that.  It is an expenditure in respect of £50 and under £300.  Anybody involved in expenses to the extent of £50 is hit financially very heavily. They should have been allowed medical expenses for a much lower figure than the £50 because it will be a heavy loss to them if they are involved in medical expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Senator is out of step with his Party.  Your Party in the Dáil strongly recommended adoption of the Commission's suggestion.  I have gone further than that.  You better resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With medical expenses <Col N="635" /> of £300 in a year they are at least entitled to a substantial reduction in regard to taxes.  Then the Minister in his statement tried to pretend that the employment situation for the first quarter was very good, but he did not tell us how many people were in employment in 1956 or in 1957.  He used the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; but what about the 57,000 people who have been driven off the land in the last ten years? They were at work in 1956-57 in addition to the industrial workers.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, we watched the nation being disgraced by the Taoiseach peddling around the world looking for a few million pounds.  He went to New York and was run out of it.  He went to London and that was a 90 per cent failure.  Then he went to Germany and got a little and came home boasting about it.  No attempt was made by the Government to keep our economy on an even keel.  All this arose from the fact that the floodgates of our economy were opened in the latter half of 1964 and the beginning of 1965 getting ready for the election. Then, when the election was over, the deflation set in and the difficulties began to arise so much so that the former Taoiseach baled out in the middle of 1966.</P>
      <P>Then, we had the present Minister coming home and telling us that he had sold 2,000 cattle in Germany.  That was an election gimmick for the by-elections last November.  There again there is no prospect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did think that up.  Those cattle are not sold yet and it is not likely that they will be.  He landed home and told the farmers when they were in bad humour that he had sold 2,000 cattle for them in Germany.  In addition to that, we had a situation in which last year the acreage of wheat was the lowest on record. When the inter-Party Government were <Col N="636" /> in office there was a considerable amount of criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to our wheat policy but since then the Fianna Fáil Party have sold out to the millers.  They allowed the millers to beat the farmers down to such an extent that the farmers felt it was not worth their while to grow wheat.  They knew that when they had the crop saved they would have to take from the millers whatever the millers were prepared to give them. The Government opted out and did not take hand, act or part in the sale of this wheat until after the millers had made their bargain and decided what wheat they would or would not take.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a guaranteed price for wheat and since there is the Government should take a very effective part in the purchasing of that wheat from the growers instead of leaving it, as at present, to the millers to beat down the growers and please themselves with regard to what wheat they will take and what price they will give.  A good deal of public money was spent on the hoardings on the &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; campaign.  This was mainly done by Fianna Fáil. There were, of course, votes in wheat at that time but when the Fianna Fáil Government took office then the &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; slogan came off the hoardings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a fact.  The Senator ought to read the records and stop asking silly questions.  If he looks up the records, he might get an answer to that.  The situation in so far as the farmers are concerned is still pretty bad.  The fact of the matter is that Fianna Fáil have been unable to find in their ranks a man who is capable of being a progressive Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  In fact, we found on one occasion that the Fianna Fáil Party actually formed a Government and Cabinet and they left that portfolio vacant until after <Col N="637" /> the Seanad election in order to put in a man to the Department of Agriculture. They were completely bankrupt in their own Party with regard to putting in a Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is still troubled about the relevance of this to the Finance Act of 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting here that we will need a change so far as the agricultural economy is concerned. We have not had any success in that Department in so far as the farmers are concerned.  There has been complete stagnation in so far as output and production in agriculture are concerned, although we always pay lip service to agriculture as being our main industry, the backbone of our economy.  If it is the backbone of our economy, it is stagnant at present.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Minister's statement but reliefs.  It is not reliefs the farmers want, but incentives.  A policy is needed that will bring hope to enterprise and increased production. We have reliefs but these reliefs were intended to get votes and to make the farmers happy.  They will not make them happy because their costs are rising all the time and production is stagnant.  We are facing a situation now in which we will have a surplus of possibly 150,000 cattle in the next couple of months.  What will be done about this surplus of cattle?  Last year there was a headage grant which did not benefit the farmers very much in the long run because the money was gone before it got that far down along the line from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, again, I feel that the Minister in the course of his statement should have alluded to these facts and problems and should have indicated his policy in relation to these problems. There will be problems.  The Minister boasted when he came back with the &ldquo;Act of Union&rdquo; as I call it &mdash; the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement&mdash; what this Free Trade Agreement would do but he is beginning to see now and the picture is beginning to get clearer regarding this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  We see we are getting <Col N="638" /> nothing out of it either in the industrial sphere or agricultural sphere and any benefits that flow from that Agreement are going to Great Britain and not to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to agree with Senator FitzGerald in his reference to the manner in which the farmers are helped by this grant of £1,500,000.  This money could have been spent to better effect, in relation to the small farmer in particular, than merely relieving him of some taxation in the form of local rates.  To decide that the farmer with a holding of £20 valuation or less shall be completely freed from the burden of rates does not seem to me to be the best way of providing an incentive to him to derive increased production from his agricultural resources.  It would seem to me that the whole question of the future of the small farm must be faced.  It might well be that&mdash;as in the case of the small shop-keeper&mdash;the day of the small enterprise in agriculture is over; and merely to say: &ldquo;We will charge him less in rates or taxes&rdquo; will not solve the problem at all.  In so far as he could have a continued existence on the land, on the small farm, it would appear to me that the only way he could hope to do this is by increasing his efficiency through planned and State-favoured co-operation.  Therefore, I should like to see more imagination applied on the part of the Government to the spending of this money.</P>
      <P>I feel disappointed that while a relatively generous amount of money is allowed for in this connection, the way in which it is spent is singularly unimaginative. We should not say to the farmer, &ldquo;We will charge you less money; we will give you a monetary grant&rdquo; but, &ldquo;We have here a whole scheme from which you can benefit if you are prepared, in certain aspects of your work, to co-operate in the use of machinery, in planned buying, which we can make possible for you&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, aim at the practical elimination of the small farm as a separate unit by means of State organised cooperation between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would share also in the gratification <Col N="639" /> expressed by some Senators at the expenditure of certain moneys for the increase in contributory and noncontributory pensions&mdash;old age pensions, blind pensions and so on.</P>
    <P>On balance, I think that the free public transport for old age and blind pensioners and the free electricity allowances are good, though it should be recognised, in relation to free public transport, that the extent to which the old age and blind pensioners will avail themselves of this privilege will vary greatly from person to person and will probably be greater in the case of one group than another.  I have the feeling that were these pensioners to be consulted as to whether they would prefer a money grant or free public transport, they might well say: &ldquo;We would prefer the money grant&rdquo; because of the fact that while some will benefit greatly from this&mdash;by reason of the fact that they will be in a position to use more of it&mdash;others, particularly the very old and the blind, the greatly disabled&mdash;will not use it much at all.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other point and that is the £500,000 granted for increases to public service pensioners and military service pensioners.  I want to make a plea once more&mdash;as I have done several times in this House &mdash;for a comprehensive scheme for Civil Service pensions so that they will be adjusted <i>pari passu</i> with the salaries of serving officers, and so that the Minister and his Department will no longer, on some future occasion, be content merely to dole out <i>ad hoc</i> moneys, as is done under this Finance Bill.  This has been asked for by the Retired Civil Servants Association time and again, and it is high time a comprehensive pension parity scheme was introduced by the Minister.  My impression is that the Minister personally would be extremely sympathetic to the provision of some such scheme.  He is an energetic man and is a person who, if he decides to devote his mind to a particular problem, tends to solve it.  I would ask him, then, in the House today to consider very seriously the merits of introducing some such comprehensive scheme for Civil Service pensioners.  Under this Finance Bill we <Col N="640" /> are giving an increase of £500,000 to pensioners.</P>
    <P>Presumably, this increase is related to the rising cost of living.  We know, of course, that the consumer price index has gone up from 185 in May last year to 192 in May of this year and that that represents a 53 per cent increase over the cost of living in 1953, and a 92 per cent increase over the cost of living in 1947.  We recognise that when the rise in the cost of living is such that salaries of serving civil servants have to go up, similar considerations apply always and at the same time to pensioners.  Therefore, in all justice, it would seem that pensioners should have their pensions increased <i>pari passu</i> with any increase in Civil Service salaries.  Therefore, this method&mdash;included in this Bill&mdash;of giving an <i>ad hoc</i> grant now and again to pensioners is, in my contention, not sufficient.  It is worth mentioning that in relation to income tax the Minister's Department treat Civil Service pensions as &ldquo;earned income&rdquo;.  They are not <i>ex gratia</i> grants.  They are earned income.  Civil Service pensioners, in other words, are regarded by his Department as being still on his pay roll.  This being so, it would seem to me that when the time comes when active civil servants are having their salaries increased, automatically these other people&mdash;the pensioners who are on the pay roll&mdash;should get a similar and proportionate rise.  It is worth noticing that the Retired Civil Service Pensioners Association do not ask for parity with the rise in the consumer price index figure.  All they ask for is compensation comparable with that obtained by the rest of the community or by their fellows in active service.</P>
    <P>It is usually conceded that the salary on which a Civil Service pension is granted is made up of two parts&mdash;the basic salary and a percentage above to compensate for the depreciation in the value of the pound.  Consequently, they contend, and I think they are right, that pensions should vary in exactly the same way and at exactly the same time as Civil Service salaries.  It has been said rather harshly, but with truth I am afraid, by the retired civil servants that it appears to them sometimes and <Col N="641" /> I quote: &ldquo;That the Governmental policy appears to be to delay compensation to Civil Service pensioners until death has thinned the list of potential recipients.&rdquo;  That is harsh but I am afraid that in present circumstances it would appear on the facts to be the case.  I am certain that none of us here, least of all the Minister probably, desires continuance of this state of affairs.  Therefore, we would welcome an assurance from the Minister that a change in the Department's attitude to this is under consideration and that the formulation of a comprehensive parity scheme will not be further long delayed.</P>
    <P>In connection with this, I must mention what seems to me even more iniquitous&mdash;the fact that the only pension that a civil servant's widow can get derives from the partial sacrifice by the dead civil servant of portion of his pension during his lifetime.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I remember one of his predecessors, Deputy Sweetman, introducing the scheme and my memory is that if a civil servant, when he retires, can show that he is medically fit he is entitled to give up a portion of his pension, and the State in its beneficence is prepared to hold that portion until he dies, and then if his wife survives, the State is prepared generously to pay this saved-up sum out of his pension, to the widow. Deputy Sweetman seemed to be under the impression when he introduced that Bill, that this was a generous arrangement, the allowing of a civil servant to give up some of his pension and the State agreeing to hold it for the widow, making sure as far as possible that there would not be a widow, by insisting on the medical examination before the sacrifice of part-pension was made.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's own Department&mdash; I do not want to mention any names&mdash; just the other day a very distinguished and devoted public servant died at the age of 50, a man who had devoted his life to things national and in particular to the Irish language.  He leaves a widow and two children.  In view of his great financial sacrifices to the Irish <Col N="642" /> language movement and Irish publishing, I should be very surprised if he has been able to leave any money at all, in fact, to provide for his dependants.  He was a man who appeared to be in excellent health and nobody, I think, would have anticipated that he would die at the relatively young age of 50.  It is, of course, possible for the Government to give an <i>ex gratia</i> grant to the widow and the family but I, as a Member of this House and as a citizen of this State, feel utterly and deeply ashamed that in such circumstances we should have to say: &ldquo;Well now, as a special favour we will give you an <i>ex gratia</i> grant, but we do not recognise your right to any pension at all, you are only a widow&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am used in this House to being told in relation to such things as ground rents and derelict sites that we cannot fail to give compensation to the owners because so many of them are widows and orphans.  Widows and orphans are used as a kind of stalking horse for the real owners of property, and crocodile tears are shed on their behalf in this House and the other House in such circumstances.  However, when it comes to the practical possibility of helping a widow in reality by giving her a right at least to half the pension which has been earned by her dead husband, then we as a House and we as a State say: &ldquo;No, you are entitled to nothing.  If you make a very good case and plead very humbly we may give you an <i>ex gratia</i> grant which will not represent anything like half the pension your husband would have continued to get if he had continued to live&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that a civil servant's salary represents what is considered to be just for himself and his wife and family, that a civil servant's pension is meant to be for him and his wife; and it is iniquitous, it is monstrous, that when he dies the State should treat the widow as if she ought to cease to exist.  It is regarded as rather barbarous when the widow is placed on the funeral pyre in distant countries and burned with the dead body of her husband, but as far as the Department of Finance go and as far <Col N="643" /> as we as a State go, this is what we imply, the widow should cease to exist with the death of her husband; and the most we can do is give a nonrecurring <i>ex gratia</i> grant.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point because I feel that public sympathy is with me on this, and that the House would agree that a widow is entitled at least to half the pension to which her husband was entitled.  I plead with the Minister who is known, in fact, to be generous-minded personally in cases of this kind to face this as a general problem, not a particular one relating to one case, but as a general problem and to go into the question as to whether the institution of a scheme of widows' pensions for the widows of dead civil servants should not be introduced by his Department at an early date.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks on this Second Reading the details of this Bill can be more fully and more adequately considered on the Committee Stage.  However, there are a few points which have been made by Senators to which I should like to reply in a very general way at this stage.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to take Senator Murphy to task if I may&mdash;I am sorry he has left&mdash;in relation to his unfair and unscrupulous remarks about the changes made in the provisions regarding surtax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of cheap political jibing which makes one less enthusiastic than one should be about trying to do something constructive. When I approached this problem, I was aware that I was taking a political risk but I was also aware of the urgency of doing something about it and the urgency was in the interests of the people that Senator Murphy purports to represent in this House.  I was approached from many directions about this problem of Irish industry in particular being unable to get into its ranks the type of managerial and technical talent which it needs if it is <Col N="644" /> going to exist in this competitive world. It is a question to some extent, as I pointed out by way of interjection to Senator Murphy, of getting back to this country Irishmen who have emigrated for one reason or another and who have acquired considerable skill and technical qualifications abroad and who are inhibited&mdash;there is no use refusing to face up to this fact&mdash;from coming back here because our surtax structure can be unfavourable compared with that in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Indeed, before the Budget I recall having a long conversation on this very matter with a trade union official, a sensible, practical trade union official with his feet on the ground, and he urged me to do something about it. As Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, what was done was previously to transfer most of the burden from the energetic earning type of person to the wealthier taxpayer with unearned income. To try to make the thing as effective as possible, we topped it up from the Exchequer with a sum of £150,000 which I think was well worth doing.</P>
      <P>I have had quite a lot of experience recently of workers in factories coming to me describing situations in which factories are in difficulties or closing down because of failure of management. From memory I can recall three cases recently where workers came to me and my Government colleagues and said: &ldquo;We have done everything required of us: we have increased productivity, we have refrained from making exaggerated wage claims, but our industry has failed because of weakness at the top.&rdquo;  That is the sort of situation I have been trying to deal with in relation to these surtax provisions&mdash;trying to ensure that workers get the management they are entitled to&mdash;and I think this is probably the best way of looking at it.  To say the least of it, it was unconstructive of Senator Murphy to take this constructive proposal and make political capital out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Sheehy Skeffington approached the matter of the provision of free transport for the old in such a coldly logical fashion, because the Government, in agreeing to do this, <Col N="645" /> were actuated by humanitarian motives.  Perhaps it might have been better to give an increase of fourpence or sixpence a week in old age pensions but we felt the time had come in regard to the old to do something different, a bit more humane, a bit more imaginative.  As politicians, we have all been impressed by the experiences we have had from time to time, going around canvassing, meeting those old people in their houses and flats. The person one became really sorry for was the old person living alone.  We tried to do something for them that would indicate they were not being forgotten, that there was a sympathetic and a humanitarian approach to their situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington underestimates the value this free transport will be to those old people.  Firstly, we put no limit on it with regard to distance.  Those old people will now be entitled to go to any part of the country, to visit relatives or make any other social contacts of what nature they wish.  Even if it were only a matter of getting the bus down to the dispensary or to the hospital or even the perhaps not very important business of being able to get to the seaside on a fine day I think it was well worth doing.</P>

Even a flat increase in cash allowances is in effect unevenly distributed also because to people in particular circumstances it means a great deal more than to people in other circumstances.  Anyway, I am glad I did this and I am glad the Government agreed to it and anyone who likes can call it a gimmick.  It is there now and I know it is appreciated by those concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say in this connection in respect to the electricity service, we have extended it a great <Col N="647" /> deal beyond what I envisaged originally while introducing it.  Originally in the Budget I stipulated that only an old age pensioner living alone would qualify.  On looking into it this did not appear quite equitable and we extended it to cover any household which consists exclusively of old age pensioners&mdash; it will cover a household where two, three or four old age pensioners live together.  An old age pensioner who lives with his old age pensioner wife, and an old age pensioner who lives with his wife who is not an old age pensioner, and an old age pensioner who lives with a young dependent person will be covered.</P>
      <P>We are not inflexible about this at all.  We have made a start and we think it will have a useful result to a sector of our community where there is a great need for such a thing.  We will see how it goes after that.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington was also a bit critical of the fact that we used the money available to us to assist agriculture to derate holdings under £20 valuation rather than by another way.  There are two things to be said about that.  First of all if you have money to give to farmers and you want to help them in regard to their income the most comprehensive way of doing it is to do something in regard to rates.  This is the way to give something to every farmer in the country.  If you do something about milk or beef or a particular commodity of that nature you only help certain limited sections.  If you want to give a benefit to as many farmers as possible then through the rates is the way to do it.  If we had not done anything about rates Fine Gael would have asked why we did not do it and would have said that relief in rates was the important thing.  I do not say that is Senator Sheehy Skeffington's approach.  I just mention it in passing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Indeed, I must congratulate the Senator on the constructive tenor of his remarks and particularly his admonition to members of <Col N="648" /> his Party.  Unfortunately after the Senator left Senator Rooney spoke and he did all the things Senator FitzGerald said he should not do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there were two things to be said about the relief in rates.  One was that this is the way in which you can do the greatest good for the greatest number of farmers.  Of course, a progressively minded farmer looks on rates as an overhead and so far as you reduce his overheads you help him to increase his production but there is also another aspect of this.  I agree if we could devote the £1½ million, or whatever it is, immediately to productive purposes, this would be much more desirable.  Unfortunately it would not work that way.  It is not easy to get farmers to produce and if I allocated this sum to an incentive scheme I might well be left at the end of the year with a fair proportion of the money not availed of or perhaps availed of by farmers who were already doing very well while the struggling type of farmers, by virtue of their circumstances, would not get any benefit from it.  The incentive schemes are availed of mainly by the progressive hard-working farmers who want to avail of them and we must have regard to the social aspect.  We must try to help also the very many small farmers here who have not any great possibility of availing of incentive type schemes. For those reasons I would be quite prepared to defend the rates relief which was given in this Budget.  As it is now getting late and we shall be returning to the Bill in greater detail on the Committee Stage I will conclude now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to say a great deal about it.  First of all, I want to take some credit for the 12 per cent.  It is going a fair distance towards achieving parity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps but I am satisfied that there is a case for looking at the manner in which civil servants are treated.  I do not want to be too specific at this stage.  I would like to point out also that the term <i>ex gratia</i> in relation to these payments to widows is really a misnomer.  It is automatic and widows do not have to apply.  I would not be prepared to defend the existing situation.  I will say no more than that.  Another point I should like to mention is that we have given an improvement with regard to the position of civil servants who have served part of their time as unestablished civil servants.  I have recently accepted a recommendation from the General Council to the effect that where a civil servant subsequently becomes established his full unestablished service should be taken into account for pension and superannuation purposes.  I have agreed to that recommendation.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 38, before &ldquo;make&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in accordance with the procedures therein prescribed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is related to the fact that under the Censorship of Publications <Col N="651" /> Bill before us in section 3 books which have been unbanned automatically by section 2, after the passage of 12 years from their first banning, may be rebanned.  The first subsection of section 3 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board may, under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in respect of which a prohibition order has ceased or will cease to have effect by virtue of section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that in deciding to reban a book the Censorship of Publications Board must re-examine the book in accordance with the procedures laid down in the 1946 Act.  Members of the House who were present during the Committee Stage will remember that the Minister then and earlier assured us that section 7 of the 1946 Act says and I quote:</P>
    <P>If the Censorship Board, having duly examined a book, are of opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that it is indecent or obscene, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that it advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or procurement,</P>
    <P>and that for any of the said reasons its sale and distribution in the State should be prohibited, they shall by order prohibit such sale and distribution.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the words &ldquo;having duly examined a book&rdquo; are contained in section 7, to which reference is made by subsection (1) of section 3 of the present Bill, this meant that they would have to re-examine the book.  But some of us contended that the words could be interpreted as referring to the original examination. The Censorship Board, having duly examined a book, might plead that they had duly examined it in 1942, or 1954 and, therefore, they were under <Col N="652" /> no obligation, under the present Bill, to re-examine it.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment on Committee Stage to require that they re-examine it and it was suggested by some Senators that this word &ldquo;re-examine&rdquo; was not sufficiently precise. The Minister assured us that since the phrase &ldquo;under section 7 of the Act&rdquo; is in, there would be a requirement upon the board to comply with all the provisions of section 7 of the 1946 Act and also of section 6 which prescribes the way in which a book must be examined.  It seemed to me that since the board could plead that they had already, years before, duly examined it, they might&mdash;under the Bill as at present drafted&mdash;fail to re-examine a book before rebanning it. Therefore, I decided to put down a freshly-worded amendment to require in writing&mdash;to insert it in the Bill&mdash; that they should do this in accordance with the procedures prescribed under section 7 of the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>I think it should be clear that the requirement imposed upon the board by the words I am asking to have inserted is a requirement which the Minister assures us is already upon the law and all I am trying to do is to have spelled out what the Minister tells us is, by implication, there.  I do not have to stress the fact that it is necessary often to have a thing spelled out in a Bill because a Bill is interpreted as it stands and the Minister's speech is not incorporated in it.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there might be some ambiguity about this, it seemed to me that we ought specifically to say that the rebanning of a book must be, again, in accordance with the procedures laid down in section 7 of the 1946 Act.  The implication of the second amendment, proposed by Senator FitzGerald, is precisely the same; &ldquo;having further examined the book in question&rdquo; being the phrase used.  On balance, I think the phrase I suggested would be more precise but I do not feel very strongly as between these two amendments.  I feel it is necessary to put into the Bill what the Minister assures us is the intention of the Bill.</P>

There is no conflict between us and the Minister as to the fact that this is what he intends by the section and I think it would be advantageous to the Bill to have it spelled out in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, on balance, that my amendment is better but I am open to argument on the point.  The reason I put it down was that I had hoped the Minister would table an amendment.  He made what can be described as encouraging noises the last day but whatever happened in between he got railroaded in some way and no amendment transpired.  Then, I read Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment when I came to draft one and I thought, on balance, it might not cover the point.  It seemed to me it was arguable, under his amendment, that the board could hold they were carrying out the procedures therein prescribed, having examined it the first time, without re-examining it.  It did not seem to me that Senator Sheehy Skeffington's wording was sufficiently tight.  Although I am not convinced my wording is in any way perfect, I thought it slightly better for discussion and so that we could at least set one against the other, I put down this amendment in this form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite clear from the discussion we had the last day&mdash;unless the Minister confuses me when he comes to reply&mdash;that something of the kind is needed.  The more I read the 1946 Act and what is now being done under the amending Act, the more convinced I became that, without this, there is a danger that the intentions of the Minister could be frustrated by the board taking a different interpretation. The Minister might say that this is not very likely but, perhaps or perhaps not, in this country it is quite clear that what is said by the Minister or anybody else in debate in the House has no binding legal effect, and we have no assurance that the board will go beyond the law to do what this House or the Minister might have interpreted the law as meaning, if they did not interpret it in that way.  We are <Col N="654" /> imposing a pretty onerous task on them.  If one were a member of the board, one might be tempted in regard to many of these books to contend that one look at the cover might be enough.  I presume that one look at the cover is not examination as intended under the original Act.  In view of the temptation of shortcuts, I do not think we should encourage shortcuts by leaving an opening.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one or other of these amendments is required and, on balance, I prefer mine, but I look forward to hearing from the Minister what happened between the last day and today for him to withdraw his apparent agreement that something needed to be done.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the suggestion that either of these amendments is, I think, almost necessary.  We know things change: that is why this Bill is before us.  Opinions change as to reasons why books should be banned.  I think it is necessary that they should be reexamined at the stage when they are to be rebanned.  I have no real choice as between the two amendments although, on looking at them, I think Senator FitzGerald's one is more direct and to the point, leaves less to the imagination and, on that account, I would support it but I am quite certain that either would meet the point reasonably well.</P>

      <P>I have not been convinced by anyone so far that either of these amendments is necessary.  It seems to me that the Bill is quite clear as it stands, that any of these further prohibition orders must be made under section 7 of the Act of 1946.  It seems to me that before a prohibition order can be made, a book must be unbanned; in other words, it is not a banned book, it is an ordinary book which may or may not be banned when they get around to looking at it again.  I cannot see how, under the 1946 Act, it could be held to be open to them to look at a book which was not at that moment to be banned and say: &ldquo;Oh, we need not look at it again, we looked at it on a previous <Col N="655" /> occasion&rdquo;.  If you are going to ban a book, you must go through the procedure of the 1946 Act at the time you are banning it.</P>
      <P>It may well be that the Minister is prepared to agree that even if the Bill is clear, if it can be spelled out twice over, no harm is done.  I rise to urge him&mdash;if he is going to accept either amendment&mdash;that he should accept Senator Sheehy Skeffington's because I am terrified of the phrase &ldquo;having further examined the book in question&rdquo;. It seems to me that when books such as the one about which Senator Ó Donnabháin is worried, &ldquo;Land of Spices&rdquo;, are examined again that it must be done.  You cannot tolerate the position in which any censorship board at any time in the future might sit down and say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, with regard to such a book, let us have another look at it and see whether we agree with what was done before&rdquo;.  The fact that a book was banned before is utterly irrelevant.  Let us be quite clear on that.  The procedure to be carried out is that the book is looked at completely anew.  Therefore, I hate the term &ldquo;having further examined the book in question&rdquo;, which, I think, gives rise to a series of further implications. If the Minister were to accept either amendment, I would strongly recommend him to agree to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's.</P>

      <P>They must be re-read, all of them, and I cannot see any censorship board sitting down to read 400 or 600 books before they were banned.  You must have some sort of an amendment such as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has put down if some of the books must be re-read. Otherwise you are leaving the situation that a book could be banned forever and there would be no redress <Col N="656" /> unless somebody appealed.  As we have heard from the discussion, there have been very few appeals.  I think it would require something like this to be as fair as it is possible to be fair under a censorship Act.</P>

      <P>There are two pitfalls in censorship legislation.  The first is to be too ambiguous and too woolly in drafting.  There is another equally dangerous thing, that is, to have redundant language in which there is, I venture to say, so much verbiage because I am going back again to the plain meaning of section 3 related to section 7 of the 1946 Act.  I said in the Seanad&mdash;but I did not give any guarantee&mdash;that I would have a cold look at the matter to see whether or not I might be wrong in my contention that section 3, read with section 7, meant quite clearly that the Censorship Board would have to re-examine a book before making a prohibition order.  It is quite clear that under section 2 that the book becomes automatically unbanned after twelve years.  Section 3 says: &ldquo;The Censorship of Publications Board may under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further Prohibition Order...&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the second banning process, there is no <Col N="657" /> change in the process as it operates in regard to a first banning or a second, third or fourth banning.  Under section 2 a book becomes automatically unbanned. The board may under section 7 of the 1946 Act make a further Prohibition Order against books that have become unbanned by way of a private representation or by way of customs and excise representation.  At any rate, whatever the channel through which the board proceed to consider whether or not a book should be rebanned, the fact of the matter is that they can only reban a book under section 7 of the 1946 Act.  Section 7 says:</P>
      <P>If the Censorship Board, having duly examined a book, are of opinion&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that it is indecent or obscene, or .... they shall by order prohibit such sale and distribution.</P>
      <P>This section, related to section 3 of the Bill, places the onus on the Censorship Board to duly examine the book before they can make an order.  If that is not one and one making two and unambiguous and without any doubt, I cannot see what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was my view originally but the criticism was so strong that at the end of the evening I thought that for some reason our mental processes might not appreciate what was said and I agreed to have a good look at it.  I did so and I am firmly convinced that my original contention was right and that the amendment would mean tautology in the Bill.  I think it is bad drafting. I like to see a Bill emerging from the Oireachtas that is clean, unambiguous and which contains neither too much nor too little but simply sets out the plain meaning of what was intended. The plain meaning is that section 3 of this Bill and section 7 of the 1946 Act are directly related and the onus to examine under section 7 of the 1946 Act is the onus that applies to the rebanning process which the board may engage in under this Bill.  I am fortified in that opinion by the draftsman and by Judge Conroy, who sees no point at all in the amendment.  To be candid, he thinks it is quite straightforward and indeed the implication in the <Col N="658" /> amendment is that for some reason the members of the board will not do their duty.  That is the practical implication that the board appointed by the Minister will not do their duty properly by examining the book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That interpretation would explain Judge Conroy's attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a sensible enough attitude.  Anyway whether the amendment goes in or not we are dependent on the <i>bona fides</i> of the members of the board, because no amount of legal draftsmanship will make the members examine a book if they do not want to.  Let us face it.  If you appoint members on the board who are so unscrupulous that they will not properly examine a book before making an order it is just the bad luck of the Minister or Government concerned. I am, of course, certain in regard to the present board that they are all conscientious people.  No matter what you write into this Bill we are dependent on their competence and integrity.  That is why it is better to leave it as it is.  I am quite clear in my mind and I am fortified by advice that my interpretation of the Bill as drafted now meets precisely the points intended in the two amendments.  Therefore, the two amendments are superfluous and only make the Bill that much more clumsy.</P>

      <P>It has occurred in the past that the Censorship Board have banned a book on one or two passages and it was revealed that it was the practice of an earlier board&mdash;not the present board&mdash;simply to have a quick glance at certain marked passages and ban the book.  Now the Minister's contention seems to be that the word &ldquo;under&rdquo; in the section as it stands at present in the phrase &ldquo;under section 7&rdquo; means that all the procedures prescribed by section 7 must be applied but he did not answer at all my suggestion that it could be argued that one of these requirements, the one that says &ldquo;having duly examined&rdquo; has been complied with since they have already years before duly examined it and that they could have a loophole there for not re-examining it.  It is for this reason that I consider it worthwhile to spell out again that it is not merely under the section but in accordance with all the procedures therein laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a question of interpretation <Col N="660" /> and I am sure the Minister will agree that his interpretation given in the Seanad or the interpretation given by Judge Conroy has no binding effect in law however correct it may be, whereas if we spelled this out in the Bill he has not shown that any harm can be done by it.  I feel that keeping the Bill as it is goes beyond the bounds of acceptable ambiguity.  The Minister has indicated that a certain measure of ambiguity is a valuable thing, which I would be inclined to dispute but I feel that it is necessary to spell it out and, therefore, although I felt at first that Senator FitzGerald was right in saying &ldquo;further examine&rdquo;, I think, now that the original spelling out of &ldquo;in accordance with the procedures therein prescribed&rdquo;, insists that all the procedures be recomplied with, the Minister agrees it should be recomplied with but he is reluctant to say so in print.

      <P>The position is that the debate on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill ended rather unexpectedly early and there was a question then of using the time which was available up to 10 p.m., rather than allow the Seanad to adjourn half an hour after the Censorship Bill was taken.  As the Members of the Seanad were here, I thought it was a good idea to take the opportunity to deal with this Bill.  If the Labour Party object, I can do nothing about it.</P>

      <P>Is é an cuspóir atá romham leis an mBille seo ná tuilleadh cúnaimh a thabhairt do Ghaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht chun go mbeidh ar a gcumas cóiríocht bhreise a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí.  Baineann forálacha uile an Bhille leis na ceantair atá, nó a bheidh, sonraithe mar limistéir Ghaeltachta le hordú de chuid an Rialtais faoin Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is eol don Seanad gur mór an tábhacht eacnamaíoch atá ag baint le tionscal na cuartaíochta ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de.  Le fada anuas tá daoine ag dul chun na Gaeltachta d'fhonn saoire a chaitheamh ann nó d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus ní beag le rá é an tionchar a bhíonn ag na cuairteoirí sin ar shaol eacnamaíoch na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn ar a gcumas cóiríocht oiriúnach a chur ar fáil.  Ar ndóigh, chuidigh na gnáthdheontais atá ar fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht)&mdash;idir thógáil, feabhsú agus sláintíocht&mdash;leis an gcóiríocht sin a fhairsingiú agus a fheabhsú.  Sa bhliain <Col N="665" /> 1953 ceapadh deontais ar leith faoi na hAchtanna chun méaduithe speisialta le haghaidh cuairteoirí a chur le tithe cónaithe, agus tá na méaduithe sin curtha le 314 de thithe ó shin agus á gcur le 115 eile faoi láthair.  Sa bhliain 1959 ceapadh deontais chun seallaí saoire a thógáil ach ní fhéadfadh an duine aonair ach deontas amháin acu sin a fháil; 42 shealla saoire atá tógtha ag iarratasóirí aonaracha agus tá 30 eile á dtógáil.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint don mhéadú mór atá tagtha le cúig nó sé de bhlianta anuas ar líon na ndaoine a bhíonn ag dul chun na Gaeltachta, tá i gceist agam sa Bhille seo tuilleadh tithe cónaithe agus seallaí saoire a thabhairt faoi réim na ndeontas atá ar fáil cheana faoi na hAchtanna, is iad sin na deontais a bhaineann le tithe cónaithe&mdash; tógáil, feabhsú, sláintíocht agus méadú speisialta&mdash;agus na deontais a bhaineann le tógáil seallaí saoire.  Tá cur síos ar na deontais sin uile ar leathanaigh 11 go 14 de Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne agus níl aon athrú á dhéanamh ar mhéid na ndeontas éagsúil&mdash;níl ach cúpla bliain ó méadaíodh cheana iad.</P>
    <P>I láthair na huaire níl cumhacht ann na deontais le haghaidh tithe cónaithe a thabhairt ach amháin i gcás tithe a mbíonn cónaí ar na hiarratasóirí féin iontu: tá i gceist anois na deontais sin a chur ar fáil feasta do dhaoine oiriúnacha le haghaidh tithe eile chomh maith.  Ina theannta sin tá i gceist an deontas tógála a thugtar le haghaidh sealla saoire amháin a thabhairt feasta le haghaidh an dara agus an tríú sealla.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gur fearrde a thuigfidh na Seanadóirí a bhfuil beartaithe agam má dhéanaim tagairt do na hailt ar leith atá sa Bhille.  Ós i mBéarla a ritheadh Acht na bliana 1929 atá á leasú arís anois, ní raibh aon dul as agam ach an Bille seo a chur ar fáil i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Baineann alt 1 le léiriú agus tabharfar faoi deara go gciallaíonn &ldquo;Acht 1929&rdquo; an tAcht sin faoi mar a leasaíodh ó shin i leith é.  Tá leasuithe a rinneadh sa bhliain 1959 san áireamh in ailt 2, 3 agus 4 den Bhille.</P>
    <P>Má tharlaíonn go sonróidh an Rialtas, mar limistéar Gaeltachta, aon <Col N="666" /> cheantar nach luaitear in Acht 1929, is cóir go dtiocfaidh an ceantar sin faoi réim Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) chun críocha tithíochta i gcoitinne. Féachfaidh alt 2 den Bhille chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Leathnaíonn alt 3 raon na ndeontas le haghaidh tithe cónaithe agus tá dhá chuid ann, cuid a bhaineann le tógáil tithe nua agus cuid a bhaineann le feabhsú, sláintíocht agus méaduithe speisialta.  Mar áis dhréachtaithe déanann an chéad chuid athachtú ar fhoráil atá ann cheana agus ina dhiaidh sin cuireann sí ar chumas iarratasóra deontas tógála a fháil nuair nach teach in ionad a thí chónaithe féin an ceann nua.  Sa tslí sin féadfaidh duine a bhfuil teach maith aige deontas a fháil chun teach nua a thógáil d'fhonn cóiríocht a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí nó, más fearr leis é, beidh deis aige féin dul isteach sa teach nua agus an ceann a bhí aige cheana a fhágáil le haghaidh na gcuairteoirí más teach fóirsteanach é.  Déanann an dara cuid d'alt 3 raon na ndeontas a bhaineann le feabhsú, le sláintíocht agus le méadú speisialta a leathnú go teach eile ar leis an iarratasóir é ach nach ann a chónaíonn sé; faoin bhforáil seo beifear in ann tithe a chur in oiriúint do chuairteoirí in ionad iad a fhágáil folamh nó a ligean i léig.</P>
    <P>Tá alt 4 ina dhá chuid fosta agus socraíonn an chéad chuid gur féidir trí cinn de dheontais tógála sealla saoire a thabhairt d'iarratasóir cáilithe feasta in áit aon cheann amháin mar a bhí go dtí seo.  Déanann an dara cuid aisghairm ar fhorálacha, nach mbeidh ag teastáil a thuilleadh, i dtaobh iasachtaí don dara agus don tríú sealla&mdash;na seallaí sin nach raibh deontas ar fáil dóibh roimhe seo: tá foráil ann cheana chun iasacht a cheadú cibé uair a thugtar deontas agus bainfidh sí feasta le gach sealla de na trí cinn.</P>
    <P>Níl in alt 5 ach na gnáthfhorálacha a bhaineann le gearrtheideal agus comhlua.</P>
    <P>Is ar mhaithe le Gaeilgeoirí na Gaeltachta a ceapadh an Bille seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an Seanad sásta leis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It has not been <Col N="667" /> possible for me to examine it as carefully as I would have liked in the time available but I do not wish to hold it up.  Therefore, we agreed on this side of the House to take it this evening, at very short notice.  For this reason, I shall not be able to contribute to the debate as fully as I would have liked.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill seem sensible and desirable.  They arise, I gather, out of the situation that has arisen under existing legislation.  Presumably, in introducing these provisions, the Government are aiming to meet a need which has shown itself in this respect.  I should like confirmation of that&mdash;that there does exist a demand for these additional grants.  I presume that is the case, or the Government would not be introducing this legislation.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing I should like to ask about because I have not had a chance to look into it.  It is my recollection that the Minister in his Budget speech referred to provisions in relation to hotels and said that in certain areas of the country grants of up to 50 per cent can now be given but that in Gaeltacht areas the amount involved could run up to 70 per cent.  I take it that what he was saying was that the additional provisions he was going to introduce would so increase the basic grant that, with the addition of an extra hotel grant, the figure would reach 70 per cent, because there does not appear to be anything here about hotels.  Do I take it that he was merely making extra provisions for hotels generally in development areas, to which the existing Gaeltacht grant could be added, bringing it up from the new figure of 50 per cent to a figure of 70 per cent?  If not, is there some other provision somewhere else under which a new Gaeltacht grant will be given? Would the Minister say if what we are talking about here is an existing Gaeltacht hotel grant, whether, in fact, any of these grants have been paid, if there is a Gaeltacht hotels grant at the moment which will be added to the increased provision for hotel grants generally, or whether this scheme has been successful at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with chalets and <Col N="668" /> dwellinghouses but there is also the question of hotel accommodation in Gaeltacht areas.  On the whole, these areas are not very well provided with hotels, which I think is a pity, although it could be argued that to have many hotels there might draw English-speaking visitors and this might be unfortunate.  I think we could make efforts to expand hotel accommodation in these areas without creating too much danger.</P>
    <P>I think they are the only points I should like to make at this stage.  It certainly seems a useful Bill and, if it does meet a demand which has shown itself, then we are happy to welcome it.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa fosta fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. Sílim gur chéim mhór ar aghaidh é agus go raghaidh sé chun socair ní amháin mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach mhuintir na hÉireann ar fad.  Cruthaíonn sé go bhfuil spéis faoi leith ag an Rialtas sa Ghaeltacht agus i muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ar dhóigh ar leith, taispeanann sé go bhfuil meas faoi leith ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte ar na daoine seo.  Ní inniu ná inné a bhí anspéis aige sa Ghaeilge agus i muintir na Gaeltachta.  Is eol dom go maith go bhfuil sé de nós aige tréimhsí fada a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht gach bliain agus go raibh an nós sin aige féin agus ag a chlann sul ar chuir sé cos leis san Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Sa Bhille beidh breis le fáil anois ag daoine a theastaíonn uathu teach nua a thógáil nó feabhas a chur ar shean teach.  Go dtí seo ní raibh cead acu teach nua a thógaint agus deontas a fháil nuair a bhí teach réasúnta nua acu ach anois tig leo sin a dhéanamh agus an teach nua a chur ar chíos do dhaoine a bheidh sásta a laethe saoire a chaitheamh sna h-áiteanna seo.  Sa tslí sin beidh dhá theach acu&mdash;ceann do na cuairteoirí agus ceann eile dóibh féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, tá deontas le fáil ag daoine chun feabhas a chur ar shean tithe agus beidh íocaíochtaí le fáil acu i ngach cás ón Rialtas.  Tá a lán daoine ar fud na tíre ar mhaith leo dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht ach go dtí seo ní raibh an deis sin acu go léir <Col N="669" /> mar nach raibh na tithe ann.  Uaidh seo amach beimid ag súil go mbeidh líon mór daoine, Gaeilgeoirí agus eile, ag triall ar na h-áiteanna seo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil cuanta, tránna agus sléite áille sna h-áiteanna seo agus go bhfuil clú agus cáil ar na daoine maidir leis an bhfáilte a chuireann siad roimh stróinséirí.  Cuirfear na stróinséirí seo in aithne do dhaoine a bhfuil sibhialtacht, léinn agus eolas as an gcoitiantacht acu.  Cloisfidh siad an Ghaeilge á labhairt ó mhaidin go h-oíche.  Dob olc an rud é don tír agus do mhuintir na hÉireann ar fad dá ndéanfadh an Rialtas faillí sna h-áiteanna seo.  Ar an ábhar sin, aontaím leis na daoine a chuir fáilte roimh an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it is a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to encourage people to go to the Gaeltacht. The question of accommodation has always been a rather difficult one in the Gaeltacht.  People who went there some years ago found the boarding houses themselves <i>et cetera</i> in very poor conditions.  I had experience of it myself; certainly they were not up to the mark.  There has been some improvement, but there is a good deal more to be desired.  I should like to have seen the Minister put in some proviso into the Bill which would prevent people from speculating on the fact that they can get grants now to build these chalets.  The prices for these chalets are really prohibitive.  I should also like to see the people of the Gaeltacht more serious about the revival of the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It has something to do with it.  People are being encouraged to go to the Gaeltacht and this is being used as a means of bringing them.  The only thing I want to say is that I think it is unfair to go into shops and find there are two prices&mdash;one for visitors and one for muintir na h-áite.  I do not think that the people from the Gaeltacht should cash in too much on the <Col N="670" /> people who go there to learn the language. Survival of the Gaeltacht will depend on whether we can encourage people and families to go there to learn the language in the Gaeltacht.  If it becomes too commercialised and if people are being charged exorbitant prices, the purpose for which this Bill has been introduced will not be served.  More than that I do not wish to say at the moment, except that we welcome the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is making a genuine attempt to give the people from the rest of the country visiting the Gaeltacht a fair opportunity of having reasonable accommodation when they bring their families to the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Mar adúirt Seanadóir amháin tuigimid uilig tábhacht na Gaeltachta ó thaobh athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Sé mo bharúil féin agus barúil na ndaoine uilig a bhfuil baint acu le hathbheochan na Gaeilge go mbeadh sé iontach deacair ar fad an teanga a athbheochan mura mbeadh an Ghaeltacht ann agus mura dtiocfadh leis na daoine dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht leis an teanga a fhoghlaim agus deis a bheith acu féin a fheiceáil gur teanga bheo atá inti agus nach teanga í an Ghaeilge a bhaineann leis an scoil amháin.</P>

    <P>Tá áthas orm gur cuireadh an oiread sin fáilte roimh an mBille mar tugann sé níos mó misnigh domsa dul ar aghaidh leis an obair atá le déanamh againn le saol eacnamaíoch mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir FitzGerald cúpla ceist orm.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, chuir sé ceist orm an mó de mhuintir na Gaeltacha a bhain úsáid as na deontais tithíochta atá le fáil cheana féin agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil a lán ann a bhain úsáid astu agus sin ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuilimid ag leathnú na scéimeanna sin.</P>
    <P>Labhair sé faoi na tithe ósta ach ní faoi Achtanna na dTithe&mdash;atá a leasú anois againn&mdash;a thugtar deontais do na tithe ósta: tá scéim ar leith againn chuige sin ach tá athruithe déanta ar na mallaibh.  An seachtó faoin gcéad ar ar labhair an Seanadóir FitzGerald is uasdeontas é nach mbíonn i gceist do thithe ósta sa Ghaeltacht ach amháin i gcásanna ina dtugann Bord Fáilte Éireann caoga faoin gcéad.  Chomh maith le céatadán an Bhoird tig le Roinn na Gaeltachta fiche faoin gcéad eile a thabhairt ach baineann an fiche faoin gcéad sin le Gaeilgeoirí amháin.  Más Béarlóirí a bhíonn i mbun na dtithe ósta seo&mdash; agus iad sásta an bhainistíocht a dhéanamh ar chuma a rachaidh chun leasa den Ghaeilge&mdash;ní thugann an Roinn ach deich faoin gcéad mar dheontas forlíontach.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ceist orm ar íocadh deontas ar bith go dtí seo faoin scéim seo. Díoladh ceann amháin agus tá iarratais eile os ár gcomhair nach bhfuil ullamh go fóill chun go bhféadfaí deontais a thabhairt.</P>

      <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir McAuliffe gurbh fhéidir go mbeadh baol ann go rachadh daoine isteach sa Ghaeltacht chun tithe a thógáil agus go mbainfidís úsáid as na deontais faoin mBille seo chun airgead a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leo féin.

We found that one small area which was within the Gaeltach as defined under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956, did not <Col N="673" /> come within the areas specified for housing purposes in the 1929 Act.  That is one reason for this section.  We also want to ensure that, if any part of the country not specified in 1929 were added to the Gaeltacht under the 1956 Act, the Housing Acts would apply to it.  For example, if we were to bring in some other part of the country for the purposes of the 1956 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We discovered that under the 1956 Act there was a small area not covered by the 1929 Act and we want to be in a position to give the full benefits of the Housing Acts in the area concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Not much.  When the debate was adjourned, Senators may remember I was referring to the very inconvenient but, unfortunately, very relevant question of cost which inevitably arises.  Who is to pay in connection with the preservation of old buildings, particularly if they are generally considered to be no longer capable of being satisfactorily put to their original purpose or of being satisfactorily adapted to other uses?</P>
      <P>I have not very much more to say on the subject.  However, I found it necessary to intrude this mundane matter of finance and this seemed on the last occasion to have caused some annoyance to those Senators who wished to deal solely with the aesthetic principles that are involved.  I found it somewhat regrettable that I had to bring this sordid question of cost into the matter but, unfortunately, somebody has to think of those things and they are relevant.</P>
      <P>I say that, though the Senators who sponsored the Bill maintained that the question of cost was irrelevant.  This is typical of the Fine Gael attitude.  The question of cost is never relevant according to them.  As we know, there is no difficulty in listing desirable things to do if cost has not to be considered. I admit the matter with which the Bill is concerned is desirable but it cannot be implemented without some cost.  The public know that cost is relevant; they also know from bitter experience what comes of succumbing to the efforts of particular Parties to sweep the question of costs under the carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I am quite certain that most <Col N="676" /> people would like to see as much as possible of our worthwhile architecture preserved, I believe they will be anxious to know the cost and just how it is proposed it should be met.  It is an unfortunate fact that what were originally gracious Georgian houses in this city have passed through a phase as insanitary Georgian slums, and even though their facades may still be pleasing, especially to those who do not have to worry about what lies behind those facades, it is doubtful if they can be economically rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Senators who are sponsoring this Bill should indicate if they believe it will be possible to rehabilitate those architecturally attractive houses as dwellings, whether it will be possible to get people to live in them if they are rehabilitated; whether it is their proposal that those houses should be adapted to flats of an acceptable standard or used as offices; whether the outlay for those purposes will be economically advisable; or alternatively whether this preservation is to be at the expense of public funds in one shape or another.</P>
    <P>From my point of view, I am afraid that however desirable preservation may be, if public money is to be involved I must take the stand that the cost must be within our scope without inhibiting the solution of urgent social problems.  If those architecturally important buildings can be kept in existence only by eating into the capital available for housing or other urgent social purposes&mdash;in other words, if they can only be maintained by making the choice of some families continuing to live in insanitary and overcrowded conditions&mdash;then I am afraid it must be regrettably accepted that we just will not be able to afford their retention.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed to me that a more effective way of ensuring the optimum degree of preservation by owners would be to provide that in those areas no buildings of greater height or floor area than the existing buildings would be erected and that they would have to conform with the existing ones.  This at least would make it advisable to maintain the existing buildings as long as possible since there would be no prospect of increased <Col N="677" /> revenue from their replacement. I certainly think a provision such as that would at the very least be a considerable help in securing the preservation of such buildings by eliminating the financial attraction of demolishing and replacing them.  I may say I fully agree with Senators that the avaricious speculator in lands and buildings who sees a well designed house in its own attractive grounds as an ideal site for the bulldozer and the erection of a money-making skyscraper is an enemy of society.  I am just as much concerned to frustrate those people's activities as any Member of An Seanad but this Bill, well-intentioned though it is, will be no help in that respect.  In view of the draft development plan and the fact, as I said, that the intervening time between now and the adoption of the plan will be covered by amending regulations, this Bill is not necessary.  Without committing myself on the actual details of the proposals in the draft development plan, I can say that the objectives in regard to the preservation of buildings seem to me to be worthy objectives and, taking everything into consideration, I think the extent of the preservation which the planning authority hope to secure seems to me to be as much as could be reasonably expected.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped it will be possible to rehabilitate the areas concerned and effectively to preserve those buildings which are, as I have agreed, of architectural merit, but I must point out again that it would not be realistic to believe that a mere decision to control demolition will in itself secure preservation.  I am satisfied that the complete control of all demolition proposed in this Bill is undesirable and it is ridiculous to apply such control in respect of buildings in regard to which no preservation objective has been laid down by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say.  Possibly, in view of the length of time that has elapsed I should go back and recap the other observations I made on the Bill but I presume Senators do not want to be reminded of them.  There is just one point.  Senator FitzGerald claimed that the regulations are <i>ultra vires</i> the 1963 <Col N="678" /> Act.  If that is so, it is remarkable that this point was not raised during the 21 sitting days the regulations were laid before the Seanad.  The Committee on Statutory Instruments also accepted them as being in order but if anybody feels strongly on the point, the High Court will be prepared to give a ruling on it.  I am quite satisfied the regulations are not <i>ultra vires</i> but that can always be established by the courts.</P>
    <P>I think every Senator who spoke on the previous day this Bill was before the Seanad related his remarks to the situation in Dublin city which was climaxed by Senator Sheehy Skeffington's Jeremiad on the disappearance of Nelson Pillar.  The Planning Act has wider horizons.  It deals with the whole country.  This Bill which I think is intended to deal only with architecturally important buildings does, in fact, seek to impose control for demolition of all kinds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It mostly revolved around Dublin city.  I want to point out that I consider the obvious way to deal with this matter is for the planning authorities to indicate which buildings they think should be preserved and then those buildings will be, in fact, controlled as effectively as possible rather than that we should have a Bill of this nature which would bring the demolition of every building for every conceivable purpose under control and which is completely unnecessary and would only make a great deal of unnecessary work and frustration both for me and my Department and for property owners in general. For those reasons and the other reasons I gave on the last day the Bill was before the House, I have to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a couple of words on this Bill.  Having listened to this debate through the speeches made for the Bill and also to the Minister's comments, it seems fairly clear that, while the intention behind <Col N="679" /> the Bill is a sound one, at the same time, the Bill is not necessary to perform the things it sets out to perform. The other thing is that it goes a good deal too far and would prevent demolition of all sorts of buildings which by no conceivable means would come under the sort of protection which we feel is needed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister, Senator FitzGerald and many others agree, it is obviously desirable that our heritage in Dublin city and other parts of the country of architecture from previous centuries should be preserved.  We have in Dublin city areas of Georgian architecture which are not matched anywhere else.  Not merely are those beautiful in themselves but looking at it from the meanest and most mercenary point of view, they are also very important tourist attractions and for that reason alone it would be worth while that the State would put a fair bit of money into preserving those squares and streets.</P>
      <P>I hope in years to come something of that kind will be done if only as I say from the point of view of the tourist trade which undoubtedly is attracted to Dublin very largely by the architecture in such places as Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Square and other areas in the city but it seems that this Bill goes a good deal too far and is not needed to control the demolition of buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes feel with regard to this Georgian architecture and the desire of so many of us to preserve as much of it as possible, that those Georgian buildings need protection from their friends.  One of the great difficulties in this whole question is the extraordinarily extravagant wild language indulged in by a number of people who are interested in this Georgian architecture. I was reading in a periodical in July, 1967, an article by an architect interested in Georgian architecture and it was written in wildly extravagant language.  It talked about political thugs and it accused the dangerous building inspectors of Dublin Corporation of being corrupt and doing their jobs entirely in accordance with whatever bribes they received.  It carried on <Col N="680" /> in this way and accused the Government of blowing up Nelson Pillar and blaming it on the Republicans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in a magazine called <i>Scene</i>.  It is worth reading.  It is wildly ludicrous and extravagant.  Those of us who are passionately anxious to preserve our Georgian buildings know that people are making those wild statements.  We all agree that as much of Dublin as possible must be preserved. The question of demolition has been dealt with and the draft plan has now been published.  It is intended to make an Order so that between now and the coming into force of the draft plan no demolition of valuable buildings will take place without permission.</P>
      <P>As the Minister says, we are faced with the question of how much money ought to be spent on our architecture. In so far as this Bill is concerned, I would suggest that while Senator Garret FitzGerald has done a good day's work in bringing it in in order to have this discussion, and we have got a good deal of clarification from the Minister, I think the Senator will agree that, as it stands, it goes a good deal further than is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points which the Minister made to which I should like to refer. He said that the Bill would create far too much work, that it was too broad and, therefore, was unacceptable.  The answer to this, I think, is that the Bill is, of course, capable of amendment. In so far as the Bill is wider than is <Col N="681" /> necessary for the purpose, it could be amended and I and my colleagues would be more than willing to consider any amendments designed to narrow the scope to ensure that it does not extend beyond the area needed, as long as we maintain and preserve the Bill in its application to the buildings we want retained.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there would be no exemption where preservation is the objective of the development plan or is declared by resolution to be an objective which it is proposed to include in a plan.  There are no development plans in existence at this time.  It is by no means certain that all development plans will be in force next October and the Minister may have to extend this period in some cases.  In fact, local authorities have not declared buildings to be objectives which they have proposed to include in the development plans, whatever the reasons for this may be&mdash;whether they fear that this might involve them in extra expenditure&mdash;no such resolutions have been passed.  As things stand at the moment, there are no buildings in the country which are, in fact, covered either by development plans in force or that it is proposed to include in a development plan.  The fact is that at the moment any building can be knocked down.  If various people had done various things at various times in introducing development plans or in passing legislation this might not be the case but these things have not been done.  The Minister is really raising a hare there.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that it is not true as Senator Sheehy Skeffington says that the demolition of any building is listed as &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;, and so on.  I assert that it is true to say that the demolition of any building is, in fact, listed as &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;.  When that Order was made there was not, and could not have been, in force a development plan because the Order was made immediately after the coming into effect of the Bill.  What the Minister did was to exempt all buildings in the country from any controls and, in fact, they remain exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reference to the <Col N="682" /> amount of work that would be involved in clearing applications is unsound also.  It seems to me that proposals for demolition of buildings should go hand in hand with proposals for re-development. I do not think that any proposals for demolition of buildings should be agreed until the person concerned says what he intends to put in its place, if anything.  An exception could be made in the case of dangerous buildings but otherwise one should not permit the demolition of buildings, other than industrial buildings, until it is clear what is to go in their place. Otherwise, many buildings of architectural merit and many houses would disappear without any idea, of what will take their place.  Once they are gone any proposal put down to replace them might have to be accepted because nobody at that stage would say to the person concerned: &ldquo;You must restore the building you have destroyed.&rdquo; No local authority would be prepared to impose such a requirement.</P>
    <P>In view of the definition in the Bill of minor works as excluding plastering, painting, and demolition, I should like to hear from the Minister what, in fact, are major works.  It is not clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Nelson Pillar was exempted by the Minister.  The Minister made various references the last day, before the local elections, and today after them, about insanitary conditions and the putting of aesthetic considerations before human considerations.  These are the arguments of people who I remember during the war would argue &mdash;and I am sorry to say many of them Americans&mdash;that no GI's life was worth losing to preserve anything of the past; the whole of Rome could be levelled if that were to preserve a single human life.  We are not faced with that kind of dilemma and to try and pose it in those terms is to try to reduce the whole argument to a plane which may have been appropriate before the local elections but which we need not get back to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The Minister said the references in this debate were confined to Dublin. They were not confined to Dublin but very properly concentrated in Dublin because Dublin is where most of the damage is being done, where the destruction is being wrought, because Dublin as the capital of this country, being the largest city and the most rapidly developing area, is attracting speculators who find they can make money most rapidly here.  Therefore, the examples we gave related to Dublin, but the Bill is of general application, because the problem is of general application.  It is relevant, indeed, to the whole question of what the Minister has said about his proposal to bring in an Order which would remove this demolition exemption in respect of buildings, in respect of which a plan has been prepared because, in fact, outside Dublin there are many areas where no plan has been prepared. If that is, in fact, the way in which this Order is to be phrased then this Order, while it may have some useful effects in Dublin for buildings covered by the draft plan, will not, in fact, operate elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his concluding remarks, made a useful reference, I thought, to the idea of some limitation on the re-development of property of this kind, for example, the Georgian buildings or buildings of that kind&mdash; that in re-development the floor area might not be increased because this would reduce the attractions to the speculator of rebuilding.  It is an excellent idea but I am wondering what the Minister had in mind in throwing it out in this way.  I am sorry he has had to depart but perhaps his colleague would convey to him the question as to what he had in mind when he made this suggestion.  Does he propose to implement it in any way?  How could it be implemented under present legislation? It seemed to me to be a very constructive suggestion, one we should all like to follow up and about which we would like to hear more from him.</P>
    <P>Less constructive were his references to the cost element.  These were, again, emotive in character and, as we endeavoured <Col N="684" /> to point out by a process of interruption the last day, irrelevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not require that any building be preserved.  It merely requires that people who want to demolish buildings should clear that with the Planning Authority first.  It will then be a matter for the Planning Authority to decide what buildings should be preserved and, in taking that decision, the Planning Authority will, no doubt, be guided by considerations of cost, as by other considerations. When a draft plan is put to a Planning Authority, they will naturally examine it to see what commitments are being entered into as regards the preservation of buildings.  If these commitments involve the preservation of buildings which are in a declining area, where property values are going down, where buildings are deteriorating, where, in fact, private interests concerned may not be prepared to preserve them and where, consequently, the local authority may be involved in some costs, they will, no doubt, take that fully into account in deciding whether or not to adopt the draft plan.  It is a matter for the local authority concerned.  It is up to them to decide whether they are likely to incur any costs through nominating any particular buildings for preservation and whether, if so, they consider that these buildings are of such value as an amenity in the area, as a tourist attraction, or under any such heading, as to deserve preservation and as to warrant the expenditure of public money on them.</P>
    <P>This Bill imposes no obligation on anyone to spend a halfpenny of public money.  It simply requires that before buildings be demolished, an opportunity be given to a local authority to decide whether they should be preserved, whether that preservation will or will not be likely to involve increased costs and, if so, whether that local authority wants to carry that burden.  The fact is&mdash;as I pointed out in my initial speech&mdash;most of the buildings concerned are in areas where property values are being well maintained and are tending to move upwards. I gave an example of a building in one particular square in Dublin <Col N="685" /> where the people concerned, who are now using it as an office, purchased it for a substantial price and spent a very substantial sum on it, so that, in all, they have invested in a straightforward, ordinary Georgian building in a Dublin square a sum in excess of £50,000.  They did that, not as speculators&mdash;they did not buy it to knock it down and build a larger place.  They bought it because that building, in its present form, with all the defects of a Georgian building&mdash;to which, indeed, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary made reference from time to time&mdash;in that shape, and with those defects, was worth to them an expenditure of over £50,000.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these buildings&mdash; not all of them; there will be marginal areas; there will be difficult areas; I suspect that Mountjoy Square would be a difficult area where there is probably a cost problem&mdash;are in areas where the tendency of property values is to move upwards, where if it were provided that they could not be replaced, where if the buildings could not be replaced by larger buildings out of which speculators could make profits&mdash; in those circumstances, private interests would be willing to accept these limitations on these buildings, even though often very large sums, indeed, may be required to preserve and maintain them in good condition.</P>
    <P>That is the evidence we have before us as we look around this city and these areas.  If an issue arises in respect of some marginal area which is going down the hill, if there is such a problem&mdash;perhaps in the case of Mountjoy Square&mdash;then it is a matter for the Planning Authority to decide whether they wish to risk the possibility of incurring costs by nominating such an area for preservation.  I suppose it is open to them to decide to do so and to change their decision subsequently if they find the costs involved rather too heavy for them to carry.</P>
    <P>This Bill imposes no burden of costs on anyone; it merely enables local authorities to take action which conceivably, though improbably in some cases, might involve expenditure, if they wish to take on the burden of the costs involved.  All this emotive language about costs is unnecessary <Col N="686" /> and, as we said by way of interruption the last day, irrelevant.</P>

      <P>Having disposed of Senator Ó Maoláin, I should like to quote one reference from the Minister's speech which gives some indication as to the extent we can take seriously his protestations of concern for the city of Dublin.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a practical and economical use cannot be found for them, then we have to face up to the fact that the number which can really be effectively preserved will have to be comparatively small and, regrettable though it may be, we will have to accept as a fact that eventually it may be possible to visualise old <Col N="687" /> Dublin only through such means as paintings and photographs.</P>
    <P>That is not the attitude the people of Paris take up on their city, and the Government of France nor is it the attitude&mdash;as I mentioned the last day&mdash; the Government of Poland take up with regard to the city of Warsaw, which they have rebuilt with such care where it was destroyed, rebuilding it in the form in which it was before the destruction.  I do not see why we alone among those countries should adopt this attitude.  Indeed, I could run through almost all the countries in Europe&mdash;Holland, Denmark, Britain, Italy.  All those countries are prepared to spend very large sums, indeed, to preserve their past, to preserve buildings and rebuild buildings where this is necessary, so that future generations may have the benefit of what has been inherited from the past.  Why, alone among the peoples of Europe, have we to adopt this ignorant attitude of rejecting our past heritage, of happily being willing to do away with it and not being prepared even to tolerate the idea of spending any money on it because all these interruptions of Senator Ó Maoláin, the Minister's snide remarks about cost&mdash;what they show is the same attitude of mind all the time &mdash;that if this costs any money we cannot afford it, never mind the past.  This is something which we alone among European countries do not care about. Never mind the past; there is nothing in our heritage worth preserving.  That is an attitude of mind I do not accept.</P>

      <P>What the costs are is something which has to be determined.  This Bill does not involve anyone in costs.  In most of the cases where the local authorities will nominate buildings as requiring preservation there will be no cost involved to the public purse.  If there are costs involved, these must be considered on their merits in each case but certainly in many cases I would be prepared to vote the necessary money so that we shall not stand out in the 21st century as the one European country that threw away the past, when other countries were prepared to spend the necessary money to preserve it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us he intends to introduce an Order to deal with this matter.  Several weeks have passed since we met before on the 14th June&mdash; three weeks, in fact.  Today he did not, in concluding his speech, tell us more about this Order, the drafting of which he told us was almost completed.  I am somewhat concerned about this, because we are talking now of a fairly brief period between now and October next.</P>
