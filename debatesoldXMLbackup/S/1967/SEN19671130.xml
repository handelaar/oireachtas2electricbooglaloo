    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete subsection (1).</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Mr. Murphy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm briefly to remind the House about this amendment.  The section proposes to take out from the cover for compensation, which has been traditional since 1924 in this State, employees of CIE.  I objected to this, saying there had been no consultation about it and because it unnecessarily complicates the situation for both management and trade unions in any further rail closures.  Most of the employees would be covered by the traditional compensation provisions traditional to railwaymen.  Anyone who had joined the service after 1st January this year would not be covered by this traditional method but by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good historical basis for the sort of compensation attached to railway closures because of the peculiar nature of railway work; and there is no good reason why, 43 years after the start of this compensation system, we provide for compensation that would be far less than has operated up to the present time.  We are asking the Minister to delete this paragraph from section 48 because of these arguments and also because of the fact that if this went through some of the employees will have no cover at all.  They would be the employees who are exempted from paying full social welfare insurance. I am not talking about the people with more than £1,200 a year but of people who earn less than that who do not pay the full social welfare insurance. This is not because of any desire on the part of the employees concerned. Because of section 4 of this Bill they would be excluded from the cover of redundancy payments and also by reason of subsection (1) of section 48. <Col N="209" /> This would be defenceless in a situation where men would be affected by a rail closure.  I hope the Minister will see the importance of this and delete the subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to compensation under the Transport Act is determined by the circumstances of dismissal and related to circumstances like dieselisation and the termination of railway services and situations of that kind.  It is not possible to ascertain in advance with any degree of accuracy what the position of individual employees would be under that Act.  It is desirable that those who could be covered by this Act should be covered.  I agree, in the case of people now serving with CIE, and now entitled to special redundancy considerations in the special circumstances which I have mentioned, that those people should continue to be so entitled, but newcomers into the service of CIE would come into the service knowing that so far as redundancy is concerned they were covered by the main Act only and they should not in any way be aggrieved because there is nothing being taken away from them.  What I intend to do is that those who are already entitled to special provision under the Transport Act would still be entitled to such cover but that people now coming into the service of CIE would be covered by the provisions of this Act and would not come under the Transport Act.  I do not think that there is any point of disagreement there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is plenty.  What the Minister has said is an explanation of what is intended under this section and I think I properly interpreted what is intended by this section.  What the Minister has said is a factual statement of what he is doing.  I do not agree that it is a proper approach to the problem and I would ask the opinion of the House on this.  It is not good enough to say that when people come in they are not covered by the traditional compensation but by redundancy compensation and that they would have no grievance.  This does not have regard to human nature at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> You might as well say to a member of a trade union: &ldquo;You took on this job and you knew the pay you were going to get&rdquo;.  Things do not operate like that.  The problem you will have is that this situation will never be appreciated by the individuals concerned and they will come back again asking about this.  You cannot say to Joe O'Sullivan, if CIE decide to close a railway line, that he is not getting the same compensation as John Murphy with whom he is working because he joined the service after the 1st January, 1968, and he is not covered by the other Act.  That will not satisfy him and it will cause terrible complications for those who are dealing with the problem of redundancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have regard to the fact that because of the nature and the extent of the compensation provided as a fall-back for railway men it has been possible for CIE and their predecessors to deal with trade unions in a satisfactory manner in regard to closures.  There have never been industrial disputes in regard to that.  It has been possible to deal with this by placing people in other employment and if they suffered because of this they were entitled to compensation or else there was longterm compensation given to long service people.</P>
    <P>This has worked satisfactorily up to now.  I am not aware that CIE feel that this is unsatisfactory and they want to change it.  This is not alone a problem in this country.  We had a problem in Northern Ireland also where, again, because of the situation there was provision for redundancy payments to the people there.  This covers every person, irrespective of whether that person is above or under it.  Even there, when dealing with the problem of railway closures and redundancy, the employers and the trade unions had to negotiate for special provision for the people concerned. take them out of the cover of the national scheme and apply a special agreement negotiated in the circumstances for them.</P>
    <P>This agreement about redundancy in CIE has been embodied in legislation <Col N="211" /> since 1924 and I do not think that there is any good reason why in 1968 we should depart from that for future entrants.  The Minister has not adverted to the other aspect of it that you would be leaving out certain employees without any cover at all.  You are taking them out of the cover of the Transport Act and they cannot come within this Act.  I would again ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  There is <Col N="212" /> not a great deal involved in it.  We could not attempt to estimate the number of people who might be affected in the future.  Neither could we attempt to estimate the case of CIE. As far as I know they have no complaints about the operation of the compensation provisions up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>To delete subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>This is a section which provides for the modification or winding up of existing schemes and arrangements for the provision of superannuation and redundancy payments.  It provides that any such scheme may be modified or wound up &ldquo;by agreement with the different parties concerned&rdquo; under paragraph (i).  I accept it up to there. What concerns me is that we go on in paragraph (2) to say:</P>
      <P>In accordance with regulations made by the Minister (after consultation . . . </P>
      <P>But, at his discretion in other words. We are providing here for the Minister's sole discretion to modify or wind up a superannuation scheme arising out of the setting up of this Redundancy Payments Act.  I find this very sweeping indeed.  I do not know why it was necessary.  Perhaps the Minister would say why it is necessary to have such sweeping powers.  I would prefer to see a situation in which the modification by winding up would be done by agreement with the different parties and not by the Minister acting on his own discretion after consultation, but ultimately at his own discretion.  I object to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage any situation where this subsection would be used to impose a modification of a private scheme against the wishes of either of the parties concerned.  But there are schemes relating to superannuation and redundancy which are controlled by Government Departments and which do not contain such provision for amendment or modification. The provision in this Bill is similar to section 18 of the Social Welfare Act of 1960.  By including this <Col N="213" /> provision it makes it possible to facilitate the amendment of schemes without having recourse to complicated legal procedures and legislation for amending trusts, and so on.</P>
      <P>The question of making regulations in relation to the scheme would arise out of agreement not being found possible between the parties.  In most cases the provisions here are to allow for an agreed amendment being carried out. If parties agree and if their schemes do not in themselves contain provision for change as agreed then, under the provisions of this section, they can do it without having recourse to legislation or other very expensive procedures. This would happen in the greatest number of cases.  I have an example of one scheme.  It would enable the Department of Finance to modify the Superannuation Act applicable to non-pensionable State employees.  Agreement has already been reached in this but it cannot be modified without this provision.  It is visualised by the Government that where agreement cannot be reached and where it would be desirable to amend, this could be done. The intention is to make it possible that if there is agreement to have provision that they can do it.  The added bit is to make it possible in cases where you cannot have agreement to make it possible to have a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he does not visualise the section to modify a private scheme against the reasonable objections of the parties.  Who will decide whether the objections are reasonable or not?  It is up to the Minister's discretion.  I cannot see the sense of providing a section like this to deal with a scheme such as he has mentioned as an example.  This scheme does not confine itself in any way to statutory schemes or schemes operated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Private schemes can come under it on the representations of one party.  The Minister could have representations made to him to consider amending a scheme and it is entirely at his discretion, having heard both sides, to make the change or not <Col N="214" /> to make the change&mdash;to make a decision if it has not been made by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is monstrous.  Suppose I entered into a scheme with my employer and my employer wanted to modify it, even though we do not agree.  We arrived at an agreement but he can go to the Minister and persuade him to modify the scheme.  I can see the sense of the Minister having power to modify a scheme by agreement or, failing agreement, at his own discretion where he, as a member of the Government, is the employer&mdash;in the case of a public servant.</P>

      <P>The matter was put to the House and the House agreed to it.  With the agreement of the House, and if the Minister is agreeable that the matter should be discussed again, <Col N="215" /> I shall allow the Senator, as a concession, to move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask your indulgence to retrieve my error.  I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>Before section 50 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make provision by regulations for securing that where apart from this section a person is entitled to compensation under a statutory provision to which this section applies, and the circumstances are such that he is also entitled to a redundancy payment, the amount of the redundancy payment shall be set off against the compensation to which he would be entitled apart from this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point here, as I understand it, is that there are many people earning £1,200 a year and I suggest that the best way of dealing with this matter is by way of an offset mechanism such as they have in Britain rather than by the Minister's system.  I should like to put it to the Minister that it would be useful to him to have the power to adopt this approach, which is in the British scheme, and it has been put to me by people in industry here as being a desirable feature.  I should just like to hear from the Minister as to why he does not want to have this power.  He may have felt that it has not been used very fully in Britain but there is a feeling here that it would be a useful way of handling this problem.  My amendment does not make it obligatory that the Minister will have to deal with this problem in this way.  The Minister has an option to deal with this in this way or in his own way, whichever is most acceptable to the people concerned. I do not know why the Minister will not accept my offer of additional power to operate the scheme in this way should it appear in particular circumstances that this is the best way of handling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite clear in my mind that non-manual workers under £1,200 a year and manual workers also can be in superannuation schemes.  The basis of <Col N="216" /> linking this amendment to amendments Nos. 4 and 5, the significance of which completely escaped me, is something we cannot stand over.  This is quite a separate point and I should like to hear the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this in the formulation of the Bill and the decision was made, in consultation, to do it in the way I am doing it.  The only thing in my mind now is what the Senator asks for in regard to people over £1,200 a year who are not covered by the redundancy scheme.  If I find that my examination of this warrants amending legislation, then we might have a situation where this section would be more applicable and more useful to them.  It was a positive decision to do it in this way in regard to the present scheme.  I discussed this with the parties concerned.  I can just see one situation where it might be more desirable that we would have it done in the way the Senator wants.</P>

      <P>Who decided that the best way to approach this is under section 49?  The House is entitled to know why it has been decided to do it in this way.  It may well be the best way but we are entitled to know why it was decided to do it in this way.  The Minister has said that he was advised that this was the best procedure and that it was in the interests of all parties that this was the best approach.  I have been approached in the opposite way and I have been told that what I want would be the best way.  I have been told that there is not agreement.  If there is not agreement I would hope that the Minister would accept my amendment.  This does not mean that he must do this in the way I want. It leaves the matter open to him to do it in the best way for the workers concerned. I believe that there is not a very substantial number of people under superannuation schemes at the <Col N="217" /> moment to whom section 49 and my proposed amendment would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any big principle involved in this?  Senator FitzGerald is only offering the Minister another option which might be more satisfactory.  It might be more satisfactory certainly where you might have one individual redundant and instead of amending and modifying the whole superannuation scheme in regard to his employment you would deal with it by simply setting off what he would get under this Bill by the provisions he would get under his own compensation scheme.  I do not believe that there is any big principle involved in this, if I understand it correctly.</P>

My proposal is that the Minister should have power to do this in either way and, after consultation with all those concerned, he should decide what is the best one to use.  It does not permit the Minister to do it in this way.  Members of the trade union might prefer it this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise the question of the power to relieve difficulties.  This refers to the mechanism by which funds would be collected for this scheme under this Bill, the mechanism to which the Minister referred on Second Stage when he explained that there had been a change of view on the question of the best method of getting over the <Col N="219" /> difficulty of collecting funds for the scheme.  What he said at that time was that it is now proposed apparently for one year to operate a separate card and a separate stamp and thereafter to combine it with the social welfare scheme.  I would like the Minister to reconsider using the powers of this section to simplify this whole system because from an employer's point of view to introduce a new card and a new stamp quite unnecessarily simply for one year when, in fact, it is now seen that the difficulties created by the Department of Social Welfare stamp, overcome and that the scheme can be operated on the Social Welfare stamp, as it should have been clear that it could have been operated from the very beginning, would be an absurd burden to inflict on industry.</P>
      <P>If one takes the building industry for example they are already stamping three cards: the Social Welfare card, the Wet-time card and the Pension Scheme card.  The idea that a fourth card should be superimposed is really an intolerable burden.  In firms which are highly mechanised now this means a complete re-working of their whole system and for firms with computers a very complicated mechanism is involved. For firms of any substantial size it would involve the employment of an extra staff member to operate this scheme.  This is something which is unnecessary and the only reason for it is that the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour were unable to sort out their administrative difficulties.  They now have sorted them out but apparently there is the problem of simply doing this quickly enough.  I have been strongly pressed on all sides on this question and I think Senators on all sides of the House will take the view that the Minister should reconsider the situation. I cannot imagine a greater administrative monstrosity than the introduction of a separate card and stamp for every worker in Ireland, except the non-manual workers earning more than £1,200 a year for one year, just because of some breakdown in communication between two Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> I think the Minister must reconsider this and get those stamps on the Social Welfare stamp even if he has to stick his stamp on top of the Social Welfare one.  The idea that there should be separate cards is something that is quite unacceptable and I would appeal to the Minister to get over the difficulties whatever they are and not to impose this ridiculous burden on industry because of some difficulties with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot argue against that now but when introduced in the Dáil the scope was different in the two schemes&mdash;the Social Welfare and the Redundancy Schemes.  By accepting amendments in the Dáil I changed the scope of the Redundancy Scheme in such a way that we might now be able to do with one stamp for the future but it is too late to do that for the first year.  It takes some months to have the stamps made available.  For the first year I am afraid we will have to do it the way I propose, and after that I will have to try to have one stamp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1, line 31, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;65&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a suggestion I made on Second Stage and on which I feel strongly. The Minister did not advert to it in his reply.  There is no reference to the point I made.  He has accepted in principle&mdash;he made reference to this in his opening speech&mdash;that the figure of 90 per cent in relation to earnings is an appropriate figure.  That is to say, he is limiting it to 90 per cent. Under his scheme, in fact, no worker will get 90 per cent of earnings.  The scheme is devised to prevent them getting it.  Broadly speaking, and I gave figures on my Second Stage speech on this, workers earning more than £16 a week will not get it and workers with £15 a week will get nothing like a figure of 90 per cent but something like 60 per cent.  The reason is that redundancy compensation is fixed so low that unless there are financial compensations accruing, the 90 per cent cannot be reached by a worker in many cases if he is a higher paid worker unless he has a large family.</P>
      <P>We should try to ensure that in as many cases as possible workers would get 90 per cent of earnings during redundancy when they get these weekly payments.  I want to substitute 65 per cent for 50 per cent.  This may appear to involve more cost but owing to the operation of the 90 per cent ceiling in the great majority of cases, that is, cases of lower paid workers and of workers with large families, it would involve no extra cost because they would already have had the 90 per cent.  The extra cost will arise in the minority of cases where there will be hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By accepting my amendment the Minister would alleviate a burden. <Col N="224" /> which would not be a hardship on the scheme.  The method I chose is a simple one.  At first sight it may seem a bit radical to push up from 50 to 90.  I am concerned about the higher paid worker who has established a certain standard of living and who in the period after redundancy is in a grave condition because he will be getting back to a much smaller proportion of his earnings than 90 per cent.  This could be a hardship and the Minister should have regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the arguments put forward, which are very convincing.  It may occur on the basis of a straight claim for a higher rate of benefit, not simply dealing with the better paid workers or small families. It would make the operation of the scheme better if you had the provision as suggested in the amendment and it would enable the people concerned to face the possibility of change on redundancy which otherwise it would not do.  The people to whom we are referring would be largely skilled craftsmen who are customarily well organised and who have a large measure of industrial strength.  If the redundancy pay they would be entitled to under any change proposed is not satisfactory, it would be virtually impossible to make the change.  It would be prudent in the circumstances to help the situation along by providing that the minimum be changed here to 65 instead of 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated often enough that I would be happy to increase the rate of weekly payments if it could be done without harmful effect on industry.  The best arrangements to provide in the Bill are those which would ensure that the scheme is viable when in operation.  There are so many imponderables, ages, lengths of service, levels of wages, and so on before redundancy, and the numbers of people who will become redundant.  I have taken the line all along, and I take it in this, that we begin with the benefits I have estimated as viable and, if it transpires that we can do better, then I will have to come back to the Oireachtas for any improvements the Oireachtas would like to make in them. We would all like to do better for <Col N="225" /> redundant workers in weekly payments but I would have to be sure that we can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot be sure about the higher paid worker who can be forced back to 65 per cent of his previous earnings.  It would not be likely to upset the fund.  If the Minister discovers that the fund is viable and there is room to make a concession of this kind without raising the contributions, for example, why can he not do so?  He is binding his hands here.  Outside the House we are not always too keen to give powers to a Minister but there are cases in which it is appropriate to give power to a Minister without his having to come back to the Oireachtas.  It is arguable whether the Minister should have to come back to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>What I press is that if the Minister finds that the contribution he is fixing is yielding a return he ought to have power, without coming back to the Oireachtas, to vary the benefits and I would like to see him varying the benefits in this respect.  If the Minister is prepared on Report Stage to vary the limits of the contributions fixed within the present limit of the fund and within the limits fixed by the Oireachtas I am prepared to await this.  I do not think it is right for the Minister to tie his hands so that no addition can be introduced without his return to the Oireachtas.  He should have power to vary the limits within the fund.</P>

      <P>To delete paragraph 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the waiting period to which I object. I am not very clear as to why this waiting period found its way into our social welfare legislation and is now being carried into this Bill.  It has been a matter of complaint at trade union congresses year after year.  It seems to me that if it is an administrative difficulty it is about time we overcome it. Is it a fact that the Department cannot get sufficient staff who would be able <Col N="227" /> to pay the people who are entitled to benefits immediately they become entitled to them and not have them hanging around for two weeks?  Or is this a sort of system of hardening them off, of letting them suffer for a couple of weeks, two in this case?  It may be said it is all right, that these people will be in receipt of a lump sum.</P>
    <P>We are talking about weekly benefits and it would make it easier for any worker waiting while readaptation was being considered if he knew his weekly payment was coming at the end of the week, though not the weekly amount to which he had become accustomed. At least he could give this few pounds each week to his wife and not have to say to her: &ldquo;Mary, we have to wait for a few weeks before we get any payment.&rdquo;  I cannot quite see the reason for this.  It is something which should not be in the Bill and I press the Minister very strongly to make it possible to arrange to pay the workers concerned immediately they become redundant.  If they are made redundant on a Friday, they should be in receipt of their payment the following Friday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I was so puzzled by the reason for this paragraph that in trying to amend it I had to propose two alternative amendments.  My first amendment is in case there is a difficulty in administering it, in paying the money in the period for which it is due. Without knowing the reason behind the paragraph, it is hard to know what to say.  I suggest in my first amendment that the two weeks be reduced to one, on the assumption that there is an administrative difficulty which could be got over more quickly.  There is also a principle of delaying payment for some reason.  If there is a good reason for delaying, fair enough, but if it is purely administrative, then the legislation should ensure that the person entitled to payment should not be deprived of the two weeks payments.  An administrative difficulty could be got over and we should establish here that the worker will be paid for the two weeks.</P>

      <P>I started off with four weeks before I went to the Dáil.  This is not like ordinary unemployment assistance.  The rate of payment is related to the man's or woman's previous pay.  The length of service, the period of service before 40 years of age and after 40 years of age, has to be taken into account.  It is very complicated. I was not thinking of a case where one man would come along and where only his case had to be calculated. I was thinking of situations in which a number of people come up for consideration and each one gets a different payment because of the differences in the periods of service.  When a person becomes redundant, a certificate of redundancy is sent in by the employer to the exchange.  The calculation of individual cases will take a long time physically.  I do not know how much time exactly will be needed and originally I allowed two weeks notice and a further four week period while payment is deferred.  This four week period was reduced to two weeks.  I emphasise that the deferment does not mean that payment is taken from the man.  He does not lose any entitlement, only that he starts getting the money at a later date.</P>

    <P>The Minister must have some provision which will enable him to get over the administrative difficulties involved. You would need to amend &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The other thing which concerns me very much is the latter part of the subsection which says &ldquo;and shall not be paid in respect of that two weeks period.&rdquo;  It simply is unacceptable that he must lose his entitlement.  The man is redundant and he tries to find another job.  He will spend four or five weeks on that.  He gets two weeks payment.  It is no consolation that if he becomes redundant again he will get two weeks deferred payment.  This man is out of work for four or five weeks.  If there is an administrative complication, then let us provide that the Minister shall not be required to make payment within the two weeks period but may when there is difficulty postpone it for two weeks.  When it is made let it be by retrospection.  Nothing which the Minister has said justifies &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first two lines or &ldquo;shall not be paid&rdquo; at the end of the sub-paragraph.  It justifies the middle part.  I would ask the Minister to consider my second amendment if he feels that the two week period is necessary.  From what he said at the end I wonder whether it is so hard and fast.  If the Minister feels that he must have the two weeks let him take that as an optional period. Nothing in what the Minister says <Col N="230" /> justifies the docking of the money for the two week period.  It only justifies the postponement of payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was under a misapprehension when he talked about taking account of the period of service after reaching 40 years of age.  That, as far as I can see, does not affect the payment.  It affects the length of time so it does not provide any complication in arriving at the decision about the weekly payment to be made to the worker concerned. This waiting period always gives me the impression that in some way the worker is getting some kind of kick.  If a person is unemployed for two weeks he does not get any payment.  He is getting a kick that in some way he is at fault because he is out of a job.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that in any redundancy we would be dealing with there would be agreement between the trade unions and the employers.  An employer could well say: &ldquo;We will reorganise and this is how we will deal with it.  A certain number will have to be made redundant at a certain stage.&rdquo;  You then turn around to those people redundant and say: &ldquo;For the first two weeks you are not going to get any weekly payment.&rdquo; The worker never recovers those two weeks.  This will make it more difficult to approach the problem. I want to delete the subsection altogether but maybe the Minister might find it more feasible, administratively, if it was amended simply to allow for a period but that the person concerned would not lose benefit for those two weeks; in other words, that the paragraph might read: &ldquo;A weekly payment may not be paid to a person entitled thereto until the expiration of a period of two weeks beginning from the date of the termination of his employment&rdquo; and drop the rest of the sentence.  Maybe that is not the best wording possible.  I want to provide that there should not be a situation where a redundant worker would have to lose two weeks benefit simply because he was redundant.  This would make for difficulty in the reorganised scheme.</P>

Everybody would accept that in those circumstances there would in some cases be delays but to say that nobody may get the money because there might be delays and difficulties in some cases seems to be wrong.  That is quite unacceptable. Could I ask the Minister if he would accept what I said about dropping the last few words?

      <P>Might I make a last appeal to the Minister in regard to this?  I can assure him that there is the greatest resentment about this waiting period.  The worker thinks he is paying insurance for it.  He is paying for it by a stamp every week.  He may be paying this for many years and he finds that eventually he is made redundant. As he sees it the State is docking him two weeks benefit.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 5, page 31, and substitute:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;5.  A weekly payment shall not be paid to a person in respect of any period unless during that period that <Col N="236" /> person was not gainfully employed and the fact that he was not so employed could not reasonably be attributed to that person's own failure or refusal to seek or accept gainful employment.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to delete paragraph 5 and substitute a new paragraph. The existing paragraph makes eligibility for weekly payments conditional on the person being eligible to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  Objections have been raised to the existing paragraph on the grounds that, first of all, a person who is in receipt of disability benefit would, under the terms of the paragraph as it stands, appear to be debarred from receiving weekly payments, and a person aggrieved by a decision relating to the cause of his unemployment could not have his appeal on the issue considered by the Appeals Tribunal under this legislation although the matter in dispute could affect his entitlement to redundancy payments.  I feel both of these are valid objections and the proposed paragraph meets the points.  It is essential to retain the conditions that the weekly payment would be payable in the case of persons out of work through circumstances outside their own control, that is, that the weekly payments would be payable to a person who is either unable to find work which is suitable, or is unable to work through illness, incapacity or injury.  The new paragraph provides for these conditions and also provides that a person will be entitled, if agreed, in relation to a decision about qualification in these matters, to go to the appeals machinery under this legislation.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;8.  Whenever a person who has received a weekly payment obtains employment he shall not receive any further weekly payments; provided that if he subsequently becomes unemployed, is laid-off, or is absent from work through sickness and is by reason of such absence entitled to disability benefit under the Act <Col N="238" /> of 1952, he shall, subject to paragraph 5, thereupon become eligible for the weekly payments which stood unpaid when he obtained that employment.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>These are necessary to bring the provisions in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Bill into line with the new proposal in the new paragraph 5 about which I have just been talking.  Paragraph 5 has been amended in relation to the condition of weekly payments subject to the person concerned being eligible to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance and paragraphs 8 and 9 contain the same condition.  These two amendments will bring the provisions of these paragraphs into line with the revised proposals in paragraph 5. There is a further small change being made.  The idea is weekly payments to redundant workers who resumed employment exhausts their entitlement to weekly payments, but who would subsequently become idle.  Where this occurs because of injury it is to balance a person's weekly payments that he would also be entitled to disability benefit.  This is the necessity for a duplicate medical certificate.

This would go some way towards meeting the cases referred to already where overtime might be more or less part of an employee's normal wages but cannot be covered in the expression overtime.  We feel this would be helpful and I would ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <P>The amount of the lump sum is in question in Schedule 3 and the amendment put down would have the effect of increasing the amount of the lump sum.  I do not think it relates to overtime.  I would resist increasing the amount of the lump sum until we have experience of whether the Fund could carry increased amounts.  My reading of this amendment is that it would delete one half and so increase the amount of the lump sum.</P>

      <P>This relates to the first division of paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 of the Bill where a worker has been dismissed because of sickness and his employer subsequently, when he has recovered from the illness, takes him back into employment.  It provides for continuation in employment during the period of illness so that his continuity will not be broken if the period of sickness does not exceed 52 weeks.  In the original draft I fixed this period at 26 weeks and in the Dáil opinions were expressed that I should extend the period.  I extended it on Report Stage in the Dáil to 52 weeks.  Deputy Larkin in the Dáil was very strongly of the opinion that I had not gone far enough and I promised at that stage to consider it before coming to the Seanad. The present amendment is intended to increase the period from 12 months, 52 weeks, to 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with workers who are unable through illness to continue <Col N="240" /> in their employment.  I do not think we can reasonably be expected to take the matter further.  The paragraph is intended to deal with the situation of not keeping the worker in employment.  This is a matter the employer can deal with at once and when the situation arises where an employer says: &ldquo;you are sick so long I cannot take you back and the continuity of your employment is broken and your previous credits are gone.&rdquo;  Eighteen months is as far as I can go.  I started off with six months, then went to 12 and 18 is as far as I can go.</P>

      <P>It is simply to deal with people who have been out ill for long periods, to maintain their rights in regard to redundancy payments.  Of course, such a person does not get anything, but simply because he is out ill he does not lose his continuity.  The Minister said he cannot carry the period for more than 18 months.</P>

      <P>If a man is ill for a week an employer might dismiss him for sickness.  If he is ill for two months or six months the employer might dismiss him and not take him back any more.  But an employer might say: &ldquo;This is a good man; I will take him back.&rdquo;  The effect of this section is to ensure that through that illness the man does not lose his continuity for the purpose of the scheme.  I consider 18 months to be a reasonable time.  If you press the employer further you might tempt him to dismiss the worker altogether.  What I have tried to do is get a fair period which would give a worker a long time of illness and, at the same time, if the worker were dismissed and taken back, would not break his continuity.  If we went any further we might be tempting employers to dismiss such workers altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  We have got established in recent years a sort of situation, in respect of TB particularly, through which it is realised <Col N="241" /> that a long period of sickness should be allowed by an employer.  I know this obtains in many semi-State employments.  The period of two years has been provided, especially in respect of TB.  What I am concerned about is that a person like that is not being dismissed.  He is out sick and it is essential that the period of sick leave allowed should be as long as possible in order that the worker might recover. That is why I fixed on a period of two years.  We do not compel the employer to keep him on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A worker could be out sick for many years and if the employer does not dismiss him he does not break continuity.  This arises only in the case of an employer dismissing and reemploying. We are not allowing an employer to do this until the illness has lasted for more than 18 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 5 (b) (iv), page 37, and substitute a new sub-paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  any period by reason of any cause (other than the voluntary leaving of this employment by the employee) not mentioned in clauses (i)  to (iii)  of (b)  but authorised by the employer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> What I am trying to deal with here is the case of an employee who can be given leave, authorised by the employer. In subparagraph (b) of the schedule we seem to be limiting the period to 26 weeks.  The schedule states &ldquo;for any cause other than the voluntary leaving of employment by the employee authorised by the employer&rdquo;. That is not covered by the 26 weeks provision at the beginning.  It would mean that if an employer is so generous as to give authorised leave it would not effect a break in the employee's cover or entitlement to redundancy payment.  The Minister may ask where this would happen.  I hope it happens more frequently than heretofore&mdash;that employees will be allowed to attend educational courses, perhaps university courses.  Here the Minister is imposing a limit of six months.  I do not think that is desirable.  If an employer wants to give longer leave than six months, for the reasons I have mentioned, he should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator is clear on this.  If a man is away studying, he does not break his continuity of service.  He must be dismissed to break continuity.  Therefore, a man sent away by his employer on a study course would not be regarded as having gone out of that employment.  The effect of the amendment would be that if an employee were dismissed and went off working in some other position for an indefinite period, he might be taken back by the first employer, and qualify later for redundancy payment on the grounds of previous service with that employer.  I set out to arrange that temporary absence would not break continuity of employment even though notice of dismissal was given.  There must be some limit as to what constitutes temporary absence.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 5, page 37, to add a new subparagraph as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Those three amendments are intended to correct a weakness in the drafting in relation to my intention that absences from work because of a lock-out, or because the employee was participating in a strike, should not break continuity of service. The existing paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 deals with the intention in relation to lock-outs or strikes which occurred prior to the commencement date of the Act, while paragraph 8 of the same Schedule is concerned with the position after the commencement date.</P>
      <P>As at present drafted, however, these two paragraphs might not, I understand, meet my intentions in a case where the employees were actually dismissed while on strike but were subsequently taken back into their employment. To meet the difficulty, it is proposed to delete altogether paragraphs 7 and 8, amendment No. 68, and to amend paragraph 5 of the Schedule in accordance with the terms of amendments Nos. 66 and 67.  If these three amendments are accepted, I am advised that my intention that lock-outs or strikes will not break continuity of employment will be fully met.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 12, page 38, line 5, to delete &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an unofficial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are back again to the unofficial strikes.  I thought it might be worth suggesting that in this case we are, in fact, disallowing as reckonable service a period when an employee is on strike and there is something to be said for making a distinction here which would operate as a deterrent against unofficial strikes.  I would be hesitant about taking too stringent measures against unofficial strikes because there are cases where they are the only remedy people have if their grievances are not, in their view, being adequately looked after by a trade union.  Not all unofficial strikes are to be condemned, although certainly one wants to minimise them because of <Col N="249" /> their disruptive effects.  At least by accepting this amendment there would be a distinction here.  If a person were on an official strike he would not lose his service but if he were on an unofficial strike he would.  This might be a useful deterrent in regard to strikes but in the light of what the Minister said a few minutes ago I have a feeling he will say no.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I disapprove of unofficial strikes.  The trade unions disapprove of them and so does industry. There was a committee some years ago which carried out research in this matter and there is a report giving clear indications of everybody's opinion of unofficial strikes.  However, they do happen and if you make legislation which says: &ldquo;I recognise that now and again we get unofficial strikes&rdquo; that does not mean we approve of them.  The argument I made stands.  I do not think we should use this legislation to penalise people who go on unofficial strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 15, page 38, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;but excluding overtime premium&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should approach this problem of redundancy as if it were something completely new about which previously we knew nothing.  Of course, in various employments compensation agreements are operated and it is usual and perfectly sensible to have regard to the amount of overtime attaching to a particular job when the amount of compensation which should be paid for loss of that job is being decided.  It is usual to approach this by way of what is normal to that particular job.  They usually approach it by counting emoluments, bonuses, allowances, <Col N="250" /> overtime, <i>et cetera</i>, which are of a recurring nature, as being part of the job.  If the overtime is of a recurring nature it would be regarded as part of the income that worker would normally expect from that job.  I am not speaking now of a particular rush of overtime.  A man may work a lot of overtime one week but it would not be a normal feature of that job and I would accept that in such circumstances it should not form part of the content of the compensation for redundancy. However, where overtime is a recognised feature of a job as it is in many employments, for example, in transport where people operate buses say, between here and Galway, the overtime would be a normal feature of that employment.  It would not be something exceptional.  It would be something that person on that job would expect to receive every week and he would be expected to work that overtime.  That would be an attachment to that job.</P>
    <P>You have that overtime; you are required to work the overtime and you are paid for it.  It is the same on the railway side.  For example, a guard operating a certain train assigned to a particular run might find that overtime is attached to that run week after week.  It is a normal feature of his work.  These are examples which I am sure obtain in many employments. People accept employment in a particular job and their acceptance is coloured by the amount of overtime attaching to that job.  We might as well face it that that is a fact of life. It is reasonable when you attempt to provide compensation for loss of that employment by way of redundancy pay to have regard to the overtime which is normally part of that job in determining the amount of compensation for redundancy.  It would be quite wrong to have regard only to the basic pay when the basic pay in a particular job does not provide the great amount of the man's weekly payment.  This is why I am objecting to the provisions which exclude from compensation for redundancy overtime which might be worked by an employee.</P>
    <P>I may confess that I am not happy <Col N="251" /> with my own amendment by simply deleting the time as such altogether. It might be more feasible to approach it by making provision for what is normally recurring overtime.  It would be reasonable to accept that a man in the last week of employment worked quite an unreasonable amount of overtime and that that would be the determining factor for his redundancy payment. Certainly where it is a normal feature of his job and he is losing that job, then it should be taken into account in arriving at redundancy compensation.  This is what has happened in every redundancy compensation case for any particular employment. I do not think we should leave that.  Perhaps the amendment I put down is clumsy and sweeping but the principle is what I am concerned about and I should like the Minister to have a look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Murphy is being very modest about his amendment although I think my own is better, naturally enough. The governing clause is normal weekly remuneration; that is, normal weekly hours worked.  The problem he poses against his own amendment about a person working more before redundancy does not occur.  The phraseology the Minister employs is good in that it takes the amount of payment for normal weekly hours worked.  If he leaves it at that we would be happy but, if he excludes payments which are part of the remuneration of the normal weekly working hours simply because they are technically overtime, it is wrong.  If the Minister is prepared to pay he is prepared to pay for the normal working week.  He has avoided that phraseology and has applied the principle that a person should be compensated for his normal weekly working hours.  Having done that, he then takes it away by saying in regard to this man who is doing this normal working week which he does year in year out, that because technically they happen to be hours of overtime, which are regarded by trade unions as part of his work, they are excluded. This I think is wrong.  The Minister <Col N="252" /> has covered the situation perfectly by using the phrase &ldquo;normal weekly working hours.&rdquo;  My amendment would perfectly cover the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Minister should include normally worked overtime in addition to the standard weekly work and then take it away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the weekly payments should be related to the weekly pay a person can be expected to receive in normal circumstances and this would not be circumstances which would involve overtime. There are circumstances in which people are required to do overtime.  I am advised that where people are obliged by their contract to work overtime they are covered by amendment 70 rather than by amendment 71.  In the case of people who are required by their contract of employment to work overtime, rather than people who may work overtime, it can be regarded as part of their normal weekly work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very tricky point.  I must confess I have argued with both sides, as trade union officials sometimes do.  We talk of overtime and compensation and say they are normal features and that, therefore, a person is expected to work overtime and that it should enter into his compensation. Equally, if you are involved in an industrial dispute and you do not want to call everybody out on strike you say: &ldquo;We are banning overtime.&rdquo;  It equally provides for the payment of overtime but it does not say that overtime is required to be worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not bring it that far.  The overtime that I speak of is a regular part of his week's work. There are circumstances, of course, where overtime would be available and the worker could take it or not.  If it is part of his regular and normal week's income, it is another matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister has introduced another aspect into this&mdash;that overtime is required to be <Col N="253" /> worked where overtime is normally worked.  Normal weekly working hours are to be interpreted as the hours a person works, week in, week out, and to get into technicalities would be unwise.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I thought my amendment was clearer and more specific; but if the Minister accepts that I am happy.  I want to make it clear that overtime would be counted where it would be included in the normal weekly work.  It might be misinterpreted as the standard working week.  I prefer my amendment to that of Senator Murphy.</P>

      <P>To add to the Schedule a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the year 1968 paragraph 5 (b) of the Schedule shall have effect as if &lsquo;52 consecutive weeks&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;26 consecutive weeks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5 gives a total of 26 weeks to save the continuity of service, among other things, where lay-offs are concerned.  The amendment proposes a transitional arrangement which we should like to have inserted in the schedule so that employers would not be avoiding their liabilities by delaying for a few weeks taking their men back. It is also aimed at protecting workers who might be asked by their employers not to come back, the excuse being that the weather is bad or something of the sort.  We want the period changed from 26 weeks to 52 weeks to cover cases like that during the first year of the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>There is complete misunderstanding.  We are forgetting what was arranged.  Originally, when it was decided to debate this, it was decided to defer it.  The Minister expressed a preference to have a discussion on the university motion. It was agreed to take out the motion now on the Order Paper until Part II of the Commission's Report was out. It was agreed also that it would be useful to have a discussion on that matter before the Government made decisions and that we would be happy to have the Minister in the House. Even though he would not be in a position to announce decisions we would like him to listen to our views on the subject.  This matter was agreed to at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking a debate at this stage it <Col N="257" /> was not our intention to press the Minister for decisions on some of those matters at this point.  Our fear is that if we do not have the debate now the decisions will be made before we have the debate here.  The discussion would be useful.  In case there has been some misunderstanding about the original concept of the debate, I would ask the Leader of the House to consult the Minister further in the matter.  If the Minister understands <Col N="258" /> that we do not expect him to make policy statements at this stage he may be prepared to come here for the debate.</P>
