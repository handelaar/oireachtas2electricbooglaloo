      <P>Senators will have noted that they received a fresh print of the Censorship of Publications Bill in this morning's post.  The reason for this is that a printer's error was discovered in the Long Title of the print of the Bill which was in the hands of Members and it was therefore, necessary to issue a corrected print.</P>

      <P>During the first part of this debate at our sitting last week the House traversed a very wide field of topics.  I do not propose to follow the other Senators in that, though it is tempting to comment on the use of four-letter words and on the use of the seven deadly sins.  I would make this comment, however, on the four-letter words&mdash;we must be very careful to distinguish between manners <Col N="404" /> and morals.  In fact, in the past I do not think our censors have always made that most important distinction. One can be highly immoral in polysyllables. One can be highly moral in four-letter words, though, while being moral in four-letter words, one might, in certain circumstances, be very rude.  I emphasise, however, that in the past books have apparently been banned more for bad manners than for bad morals.</P>
      <P>We all, I think, in this House&mdash; perhaps with one exception&mdash;would agree that some measure of censorship is desirable and necessary.  It is very much a matter of degree.  Most of us, I am sorry to say, would also have to agree that in the past the measure of our censorship has been too severe.  Our laws have been too restrictive; our censors have been too narrow-minded.  I think one of the saddest things that happened to this country in the early years of its independence was the fact that under the new laws of our land honourable and respectable Irish writers found their names going on a list of books which were condemned as being indecent, obscene, or liable to corrupt or deprave.  It was one of the saddest things that happened in the intellectual history of this country.  We all regret it.  We cannot do much to put it right now except by the small palliation that this Bill gives.  But, we can in the future try to ensure that that kind of thing will not happen again.</P>
      <P>We must remember too, in trying to improve legislation, that no matter what legislation we produce, in the end very much will depend on the censors themselves.  One of the reasons why those grave and culpable mistakes were made in the 1930s was that the censors, in the opinion of many, were not suitable for the purpose.  That condition of affairs, however, has seen a great improvement, too.  Our present censors and Board of Appeal are doing a much more reasonable job and the country as a whole is grateful for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill is a slight improvement and, as such, I welcome it.  For the rest of what I shall briefly say, I want to concentrate on one possible practical improvement in this Bill.  It has been mentioned before by various <Col N="405" /> Senators.  I want to urge it again.  It concerns the seizure of books, both banned and potentially bannable, by customs officials.  This undoubtedly is a cause of scandal in the country and outside the country.  It is offensive to liberal citizens of our own country, and to visitors, to find that their own personal reading is censored by people of, in some cases, not a very high literary standard, and is at times taken from them.  I am assured that many of the customs officials greatly dislike this duty.  It is hard enough for them to be able to deal with more material things, but that they should have to act as a kind of pre-censor in a matter of this kind is an anxiety and, to some of them, I think a source of shame.  They dislike doing it.  Therefore, the Minister can take it as a fact that both many citizens of this country and customs officials as a whole would welcome a relaxation of the law here.</P>
    <P>Just what the law is it is by no means easy to determine.  We had some difference of opinion in this House in the debate last week and in the columns of the <i>Irish Times</i> at the end of last week a statement by one of the Senators was questioned.  If the Minister would do nothing else&mdash;and I hope he will do much more&mdash;would he give us a brief and clear statement exactly as to what the law is at this moment regarding the rights of customs officials to take books from innocent travellers, because innocent travellers these people are: they do not intend to sell the book; they do not intend to display it or anything of that kind.  It is simply for their personal reading.</P>
    <P>What exactly is the law in this regard? If, as I assume, the customs officials are, in fact, entitled to seize both banned books and books that may be banned.  I would ask the Minister to remove this power.  There is, in fact, a legal precedent for removing this power.  It is found in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, No. 6 of 1935, section 17, subsection (1).  This deals with the importation of contraceptives into this country.  It is a liberal clause in its way because it does allow people to import contraceptives into this country provided that they are not for the purpose of exposing them or advertising <Col N="406" /> them or keeping them for sale. This was a liberal provision, for the majority of people in the country at that time&mdash;perhaps still, it is not so sure now&mdash;believed that these were immoral appliances.  Yet for the sake of liberalism and of giving more freedom to the minority this provision was put in, that they were entitled to import these appliances if they wished to get them for their own personal use.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister would he consider doing the same for books preferably both banned books and unbanned books but if he does not see his way to doing it for banned books at least for unbanned books.  It really is scandalous that any customs official with perhaps no literary training whatever can judge some professor, poet, or playwright or whatever he may be in what he should or should not read. That is the situation at the moment and it makes us a laughingstock in the learned world and the literary world. I cannot put this too strongly to the Minister.  I think he knows that what I am saying is true.  I would urge him to meet this, to meet it in very much the same way as this section of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act which I have quoted makes it possible, in other words, when these books are for purely personal use, to allow them in. This would remove very grave embarrassment to our visitors.  It would remove a rather unfortunate duty on the customs officials.  I shall not delay more on this but I will emphasise&mdash;I have mentioned it and several Senators have mentioned it&mdash;there is still a crying need for reform in this matter.  I think we have got used to the machinery of the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board now.</P>
    <P>I think most people say it is working reasonably well.  But hundreds of thousands of people every year are finding it an indignity to be stopped at the airport and have their personal reading removed from them.  If the Minister does not do this, I am afraid he is leaving the country open to a good deal of ill-repute in various circles.  I know he is one who values the honour of the country, as well as following commonsense as he has recognised in this Bill, and I shall be <Col N="407" /> very sorry now if he does not meet the House on this point.  However, in general, the Bill so far as it goes, marks an improvement in our standards of civil liberty and artistic freedom, and as such it has my support.</P>

      <P>It is difficult in this debate at this stage to say anything which has not been said in other words before.  Nevertheless, there are a few points that I should like to underline before the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, symptomatic that in this debate touching on the question of censorship today this House has got away from the type of debate which characterised discussion of such topics in the past.  We have had in this debate a clear realisation that in problems of censorship we are not dealing with matters of absolute right and absolute wrong but we are dealing with matters of what is proper to be done in existing circumstances in this day and age.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the last day there was reference to the question of the seven deadly sins and how many of these should be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I should like to turn from deadly sins to cardinal virtues and suggest that our main concern in matters of this type is with the cardinal virtue of prudence because this is the essence of the censorship problem.  When we have all finished making our reservations on the one hand and statements of opinion on the other, the problem that faces the Minister, the problem that faces the Legislature, the problem that faces the whole community is a question not of prudery but of prudence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as prudence is a virtue for the individual, a virtue for the individual in his own moral conduct, a virtue to be practised by the parent in regard to the moral upbringing of a child, so also prudence is a public virtue to be exercised by legislatures and by governments.  Indeed, this has been well recognised.  Theologians talk of this virtue of public prudence, and the fact that they call it royal prudence will not mean, I hope, it will not be practised in this republican assembly. <Col N="408" /> As I have said, the essence of this problem is what should be done in the circumstances of the day.  There will be a tendency among people who discuss this new move of the Minister to say that he is abandoning a moral principle, that there can be no change in matters like this, that what was morally wrong in 1929 must be morally wrong today.  The Minister has a good sound tradition behind him.  No matter how far we go back in the debates and discussions about what should prudently be done in regard to moral problems in the public sphere, we find always the accusation that people are taking the modern liberal line&mdash;that by taking circumstances into account they are abandoning traditional morality.</P>
    <P>We can go right back to the early centuries of the Christian era and find that St. Augustine, who now seems so old-fashioned to us, was taking a modern liberal line on subjects like this when he insisted that moral objectivity had no meaning without regard for circumstances. So, too, in the flowering of the Middle Ages, in the thirteenth century, St. Thomas Aquinas, who also seems old-fashioned today, found that the learned doctors who were the established order of the University of the Sorbonne disapproved of his liberalism so much that they condemned his propositions.  So we find ourselves in respectable company when we seek to make changes such as the Minister is seeking to make here.</P>
    <P>It is heartening in this debate to note the manner of the discussion. More than ever before the world in which we live is one world.  Less than ever before can we in this country isolate ourselves; less than ever before can we say it is for us to determine in this corner of Europe, in this corner of the world, what our manner of life is to be.  We are, by the circumstances of modern life, of modern transportation, of modern mass communication, more thoroughly a part of the world around us than we have ever been. We are on the point of seeking further involvement in the Europe of which we are part.</P>
    <P>All of this means we must examine every aspect of our particular culture <Col N="409" /> and customs and re-examine them from the point of view of our new involvement.  The Minister has done this in one respect and he is to be congratulated on what he has done.  I am one of those who feel that he has been unduly hesitant in the measure he has brought before us&mdash;that perhaps he could have gone a little further.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of our censorship code, many aspects of the operation of that code, which could well have been looked at.  It is true to say, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, that even though provisions are there for appeal it is unlikely they will be used.  Many years ago I was shocked, thoroughly shocked, by the banning by our Censorship Board of a book by that well-known non-pornographic author Sir Charles Snow.  I immediately determined that I would get three of my colleagues to join me in our statutory right of appeal to have the banning of the book, <i>The Light and the Dark,</i> the life of Roy Calvert, removed.  I came to this conclusion not once but many times but whenever I reached a firm conclusion I was in Cork and my colleagues were elsewhere; when they were in my company it never entered my mind.  That banning was one of the more ludicrous things our Censorship Board did, something about which my colleagues and I should have done something. Here, again, the seven deadly sins entered the picture: perhaps it was sloth on my part and not any deficiency in the statutory provision that we are here questioning.  That account of an academic life, that account of the career of the young man, Roy Calvert, remained under a shadow in this country.  There are many things which C.P. Snow wrote in regard to academic politics and in regard to national politics dealing with matters almost beyond the bounds of decency but not in the sense of which our Censorship Board should be taking account.</P>
    <P>I find, with other Members, that the present situation in regard to the activities of customs officers is unfortunate. I read in a newspaper this <Col N="410" /> morning that one of the Revenue Commissioners spoke on this subject yesterday.  He made a clear statement in which he said customs officers do not search baggage for banned books and he pointed out what they do: they search baggage and remove any banned books they find but they do not search specifically for banned books. It is something which we could well get rid of.</P>
    <P>Anybody who wishes to bring a banned book through customs can undoubtedly do so.  All he has to do is put it in his coat pocket and the book is through.  Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I found myself once in the unfortunate position of arriving at Irish customs with a book in my baggage which I was quite unaware had incurred the displeasure of our Censorship Board.  Because I was unaware of this, the book had been packed along with my pyjamas in the top of my case.  As soon as the customs officer encountered it there was a flurry.  I was removed to another room, there were hurried runnings to and fro, there were wonderings as to whether the airport bus should be held for me and there may have been a suggestion of whether I should be released from custody that day&mdash;a general flap.  Had I been aware that the book was banned and had I been determined to bring it in, all that fuss could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Not only had I that book but another which should be dear to the heart of our Censorship Board&mdash;<i>When the Kissing Had to Stop</i>&mdash;by Constantine Fitzgibbon.  The main theme of the latter book is the danger of liberal thought, of liberalism, and how they can lead to a Communist takeover.  When this book was found in my baggage with the title <i>When the Kissing Had to Stop,</i> the customs officer was so sure this book was banned that he went three times through the list of prohibited publications with increasing disappointment and I am sure he ended up with a firm conviction that our Censorship Board, for all their activity, were not really doing their job 100 per cent effectively. Those incidents occur.  As I say, the person who is determined to bring in <Col N="411" /> one or two banned books can easily do so.  It is the innocents like Senator Sheehy Skeffington and myself who suffer inconveniences.  It may be the innocent tourist who suffers.  This is something in which the present practice is certainly very far from the prudence we should all wish to see.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the distance he has come.  I think he has been unduly cautious in what he has done.  That some code of censorship is necessary for a long time to come, that pornography must be controlled, that some restriction is necessary. Those things are not really in debate. The question is what type of literary censorship, what type of treatment of travellers bringing in reading material in their personal baggage is to characterise the Ireland of the 1970s.  This is the Minister's concern and that of his colleagues and I think they could, indeed, have gone further in this Bill in order to give us a fair appearance to the outside world in this respect. We must, however, be grateful and we must say to the Minister: &ldquo;Thank you for what you have done.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was Minister for Justice for quite a long time and I remember on one occasion when we had a debate here a Member of the Seanad spoke for almost seven hours. I was introducing an amending Bill dealing with censorship.  I was always against censorship and I remember at that time the <i>Irish Times</i> used to say: &ldquo;Mr. Gerald Boland has banned the following books&rdquo;.  They never bothered to say &ldquo;the Minister for Justice&rdquo;.  I said at that time that if for no other reason I was going to stop that practice.</P>
      <P>I brought in an amending Bill and I think it was shortly before the long debate on that Bill in this House that the Censorship Board came to me and asked me to agree to an amendment. The representative of Trinity College came to me and also members of the Catholic Church.  The Chairman asked me to delete from the Censorship Act the proviso that we should have regard to the literary and artistic merits of any work which came before the Censorship Board.</P>

May God be thanked that there was no Censorship of Publications Act in force when the Holy Bible was written or when Byron or Shakespeare were writing.  A very eminent member of the Catholic Church, whom I am glad to say is still alive, met me shortly afterwards at some function in the ProCathedral and said to me: &ldquo;That was a good one for the Chairman.&rdquo;  I think it is not a very good thing that moral standards have changed.  I am still old-fashioned enough to say that if things were wrong 50 years ago they are wrong today.</P>

      <P>We have become more realistic now.  We have now reached the stage where people are looking for a change.  There were certain standards in the past which I never liked.  There were several reasons I did not approve of censorship.  One was that you cannot enforce it.  It just cannot be done and, therefore, it is humbug to try to enforce it.</P>

      <P>May I speak as one the drudgery of whose routine work is relieved to some extent by almost daily contact with literature of one kind or another?  I should like to join with the other Senators who welcomed the Bill and I should like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of a measure that is at the same time right-minded and considerably overdue.  In doing this, I am painfully conscious of the violence that has been done to the good name of literature and literary artists in the past under this very roof.  On reading through the Official Report of the discussion that took place in Dáil Éireann, as this Bill passed through its various Stages and having listened to the speeches made up to the present in this House, I cannot help noticing with some satisfaction the concern for good <Col N="413" /> literature that animated most of the speeches.  It is with no less satisfaction one notices the almost total lack of suggestion that literary artists are any longer suspect or are classified in the minds of legislators as rogues, pimps and vagabonds.</P>
      <P>I mention those points because they seem to indicate we are on the point of officially recognising the true function of artists in the community and because on more than one depressing occasion in the past, when matters of this kind were being discussed, both the Upper and Lower Houses of the Oireachtas, to put it bluntly, disgraced themselves.  One has only to go into the Library of the House and read certain Parliamentary Reports for the years 1929 and 1946 to appreciate the degree to which the spirit of inquisition has taken precedence over commonsense. Perhaps the most regrettable degree of obscurantism was reached in that famous, or should I say infamous, debate in the Seanad on <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> in the autumn of 1943 when discussing a motion by the late Sir John Keane.  It was then decreed that quotations from the book read out in the Seanad should be struck from the record lest they corrupt the youth of the nation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the Seanad.  Speaking a few years ago on Radio Éireann, Mr. Benedict Kiely said that to read the report now was &ldquo;to be staggered utterly with a nuthouse feeling of unreality.&rdquo;  As a Member of this House it is no pleasure for me to have to recall things like this, and that there are passages here and there in the records of the House that could be incorporated in a work of science fiction by somebody like George Orwell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In criticising the attitude taken by Deputies and Senators in the past, a word might be said by way of explanation if not justification.  Many of the people who came to positions of power and influence in the early years of the State had a background of such a nature that they had very little interest in or contact with artistic expression of any kind.  That is generally <Col N="414" /> true, but, of course, there were notable exceptions.  To say this about them is not necessarily an indictment of them.  It is merely an expression of fact.  Seán O'Faolain was probably near the mark when he described them as &ldquo;ordinary decent kindly self-seeking men who had no intention of jeopardising their new found prosperity by gratuitous displays of moral courage&rdquo;. In other words, it was far easier for them to condemn out-of-hand the writer or the intellectual in quest of free expression than to try to understand him and to be branded as pseudo-intellectuals if they championed his cause.  Even yet in certain quarters it is felt that an intellectual approach in matters of this kind is inferior to the aggressively chauvinistic and unreasoning one.  This attitude in the past was particularly unfortunate in view of the fact that so many of the men who won us our freedom were themselves intellectuals.  When the gun was laid aside and the pen might have been taken up to win us a greater measure of intellectual freedom&mdash;indeed, it was taken up with conspicuous courage by some writers&mdash;the crushing code of censorship prevented us from hearing many things about ourselves that might have been of benefit to us.  In an effort to exclude ideas that gave us an uncomfortable feeling, especially if expressed by Irish writers, and if they came too near the bone, we set up a censorship machinery with full legislative approval that sometimes banned books, as the late Francis McManus wrote, &ldquo;with a savagery that seemed pathological.&rdquo;  Now in a rather belated attempt to catch up with public opinion, and because it is becoming more difficult, if not impossible, to exclude or to censor ideas, we are in the process of liberalising our censorship code and giving <i>post factum</i> legislative approval to the increasing commonsense of our censors and to the increasingly mature judgment of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that his reason for doing this was that the law was being brought into disrepute.  As Minister for Justice, he must, of course, be concerned primarily with the legal aspect of the matter, but one <Col N="415" /> would like to feel also that the present Bill has come before us because in the past we have so often unjustifiably charged writers with indecency and obscenity when, in fact, they were merely attempting to mirror society as they found it and were being true to themselves and to the discipline of their craft.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill first came before the Houses of the Oireachtas only one commentator, to my knowledge, has publicly reaffirmed the writer's commitment in all this which is to delineate the world as he finds it, not as we would like him to find it.  As long as writers are true to themselves and feel a responsibility towards the society they live in they must sometimes rub our noses in the mess that we make.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the content of the Bill that we have before us but the spirit that animated the Minister in introducing it that convinces me that we have now come to realise that there is no area of life that is unfit to be explored by the writer provided he illuminates it with the light of artistic truth and provided he surrounds it with such decent reticence as would be imposed on him by the subtlety of his art.  Perhaps, too, it is safe to assume, and we have come to accept, the fact that the writer is necessarily anti-establishment or at least he cannot afford to be pro-establishment if his work is to be of any significance either as art or as social comment.  He is committed to the truth as he sees it even if he treads on the toes of people who may imagine themselves to be above criticism.</P>
    <P>While the Bill makes some recompense to the many fine and conscientious writers we have labelled indecent or obscene in the past, and at the same time ensures that we will still be spared the horrors of actual and wanton obscenity, it does nothing, perhaps because it can do nothing, to wipe out the many forms of unofficial censorship that exist in Ireland.  I have in mind the type of thing that Senator McQuillan referred to here on the last day.  Neither, of course, does it deprive the customs officers of what is, in effect, the power of censorship granted <Col N="416" /> to them under the 1946 Act.  I do not propose to enter into any criticism of the mechanics of the censorship process, except to endorse the view expressed by a number of Senators both last week and today that the confiscation of a book from an individual at the customs point who is exercising his mature judgment in the selection of reading matter is to my mind a gross violation of the individual's right.  After all, bringing a single copy of any book into the country cannot involve any significant threat to the morals of the country, and I will join with the other Senators in asking the Minister to take the necessary steps to eliminate this practice.</P>
    <P>My main concern here, however, is to make a plea for a fuller and more healthy recognition of the creative literary artist in society in our approach to the problem of censorship.  I consider that this recognition is quite compatible with adequate regard for the morals of citizens.</P>
    <P>At no time in the framing of censorship legislation does consideration seem to have been given to the claim to freedom of the literary man to express himself, to castigate society if he has fault to find with it, to expose the evils that obtrude themselves on his attention or to describe life as he finds it.  If by virtue of this debate or through the medium of this Bill we can divert the attention of the censors even momentarily from the sole consideration of the protection of the adolescent to the wider recognition of the fact that the literary man has a major contribution to make to the moulding of society we shall have done useful work.</P>
    <P>In the comparatively short span of time since censorship legislation was first introduced in 1929 there has been, as has been noted by many speakers, a tremendous change in moral attitudes, or as it has been put elsewhere, in community standards.  The tendency is all towards liberalisation, towards the wider acceptance of the unconventional. If that tendency is maintained, as it is likely to be, unless a violent reaction sets in, which is not now foreseeable, we shall again be legislating at some time in the future to bring our censorship <Col N="417" /> laws into conformity with the new community standards.  The improved all-round standards of education are undoubtedly responsible in a large measure for the changes that are taking place.  Would it be unreasonable, or would it be discounting original sin too much, to hope that we would one day reach a point where censorship would no longer be necessary, where every Irishman would have attained that degree of sophistication and maturity that he would say as the Roman writer, Terence, was able to say of himself some 2,000 years ago: &ldquo;I am a man and reckon nothing human alien to me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I regard this as an insignificant Bill which, surely, does not merit the praise given it because of a simple change.</P>
      <P>First of all, when the Minister introduced the Bill in the Dáil he mentioned a period of 20 years for the banning of publications.  Now the Dáil has changed that to 12 years and the Bill comes here with a period of 12 years as the length of time during which the banning of a publication should last. To my mind, that is very insignificant even after discussion of the Bill here or when it becomes an Act.  Despite what has been said by speakers who, mainly, have spoken against censorship, I refer to the discussion, mentioned by Senator Ó Conalláin, which took place in 1942.  I spoke at that time, and I want to say now that when this Bill becomes an Act, when the Act becomes law and when a period of 12 years has expired books are allowed for publication and circulation, and all that entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, how does that fit in?  Has a citizen the same right which he previously had and to which I referred in the debate of 1942&mdash;it was not 1943 as Senator Ó Conalláin said&mdash;to bring a complaint to the Censorship Board having read a book which he considers unfit for himself, his children or the public to read?  The Board in their wisdom say that this book shall be censored as not fit for publication. Consequent on that, the publisher, the author or four or five Members of the <Col N="418" /> Oireachtas have the right to appeal against the decision to the Appeal Board.  I understand that formerly we had clergymen of several Christian denominations on the Appeal Board. I do not know who is on it at present. However, you have a citizen bringing to the notice of the Censorship Board a book in circulation which he thinks is not fit for circulation.  Then an Appeal Board reconsiders that if appeal has been made.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator O'Quigley on the figures he gave the last day.  To my mind, they were very enlightening. They show that some writers are anxious that some of their, books should be censored and not allowed to be sold here.  Let them have it.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the debate on the motion of Sir John Keane in 1942 I pointed out that we had higher standards and I even boasted that our standards were higher than standards elsewhere.  I still maintain that view. Myles na gGopaleen, God rest him, referred to my remarks in verse in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the fact that I claimed that our standards are higher than standards elsewhere.  I claimed they were and I claim they are and I claim that we should have censorship of publications.  I claim, too, that the discussion in 1942 revolved around three publications.  One was <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> which depicted people in Cork to which I objected as a West Cork man.  I recommend the discussion to Senator Garret FitzGerald whose father spoke, as Senator Garret FitzGerald would speak, at great length.</P>

      <P>It is a scandalous production about a nun in a convent. It is the only one of the books that I have read in detail.  Any young girl reading it will ask: &ldquo;What is at the back of this?  What are they talking about?  What are they thinking of?&rdquo; It pervades the whole book down to the two lines.  It has been said that there were only two lines in the book that caused its banning.  Somebody said that sodomy was mentioned in the Bible but this was sodomy from beginning to end.  Then it transpires that one of the parents of this unbeginning to end, when it transpires that the parent of this unfortunate nun was a homosexual and that finished it.  It is a scandalous thing. I have seen Members from the universities in this present Seanad stand up for lawbreaking&mdash;five out of six of them.  There are six representatives of the universities here and five out of six of them voted for lawbreaking. Therefore, I do not mind what they say.

    <Title>Private Business. - Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1967: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a Bill to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide that some authority or person who is concerned not merely with private profit and private gain will, in the interests of the community, have a look at a proposal to demolish certain types of buildings in our cities and towns.  The type of buildings that we propose in the Bill should be the subject of this objective consideration are buildings of aesthetic, historic and architectural interest.  We do not say that every building should come within the ambit of this Bill. What we do say, however, is that buildings of the kind to which I have referred and which are what one might call the ordinary buildings one finds in the streets of our towns and cities should not be demolished upon the say-so of some speculator or some company who want to demolish these buildings for the purpose of building offices and gaining from such a transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second purpose of the Bill is to prevent the demolition of buildings which are habitable.  We are all aware of the dimensions and severity of the housing shortage all over the country. I believe it is not right or proper, when there is an acute housing shortage, when many people are living in cramped housing conditions, and when young families and young married people suffer the tensions and anxieties of living with in-laws or in unsuitable <Col N="423" /> accommodation, to allow the indiscriminate demolition of buildings that can be made habitable.  I have seen around the city of Dublin shacks which have been constructed by Dublin Corporation for the purpose of housing our citizens and, at the same time, we have seen in various parts of the city of Dublin perfectly good houses which have been inhabited by families, by one family or as multiple dwellings, converted into flats or bedsitters, which have been demolished.  Of course the effect of every demolition means further pressure upon our limited stock of suitable houses.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should express its concern for those who are living in bad housing conditions by enacting this Bill to prevent the indiscriminate demolition of houses which could otherwise be made available for human habitation.  I think it is quite true to say that it is the person whom the shoe pinches who really squeals and I feel that the present Government, and perhaps it is true to say the country as a whole, do not realise the continuous suffering, privation and mortification which far too many families undergo because of the acute housing shortage. It seems to me a scandal and almost criminal that on the one hand, we have a housing shortage and on the other, that perfectly good habitable houses are demolished upon the &ldquo;say-so&rdquo; of some foreign or Irish speculator. It does not matter what his nationality is.</P>
    <P>In this country we do not possess a great deal of material wealth but we do have some things to offer.  We have some fine buildings that have commanded the admiration of our own people and of foreign visitors.  We have seen in various parts of the city of Dublin that private interests and private greed have demolished buildings. We see the yawning gaps that have been created for the purpose of forcing the town planning authority to give permission to build other kinds of buildings in order to fill up the gaps.  The <i>modus operandi</i> at the present time seems to be that you may not be able in advance to get planning <Col N="424" /> permission for the type of buildings you want to build but you will certainly get it much more readily if you demolish the buildings because you cannot leave the yawning gap in a street or terrace indefinitely.  In this way pressure is put on the planning authority and on appeal, on the Minister for Local Government, to give permission to erect the type of building which the demolishers have in mind.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Planning and Development Act of 1963 is an Act which has the most far-reaching consequences for virtually every citizen in this State.  It applies to anybody who owns any kind of property, whether it is snipe grass or property in St. Stephen's Green.  There is virtually nothing that one can do nowadays in relation to any property that does not require permission under the Act The wide scope of the Act was responsible for the insertion in the Long Title of a reference to the common good. There are so many restrictions placed upon the use of property, the development of property, even the change of use of property, by this planning Act that it seems that the draftsmen thought it well to invoke the common good as a justification for the kind of interference and restrictions that the Act would inevitably impose upon all property owners and those who wanted to acquire property.</P>
    <P>So it is that in the Long Title the Act is described as</P>
    <P>an Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas, whether urban or rural (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof).</P>
    <P>The common good required the intervention of this Act in the view of the Legislature and I insist that the common good requires that there should be some restraint on the licensed demolition which was subsequently provided under regulations made by the Minister for Local Government in accordance with the legal provisions of the Act but certainly not in accordance with the spirit of the Act.  It is for that reason that I say <Col N="425" /> that the Bill aims at getting some person concerned with the common good, with the interests of the community, to take a look at proposals to demolish certain types of buildings in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The Act in its operation has given rise to a great deal of unrest and criticism, and that among supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party no less than supporters of the Fine Gael Party or any other Party.  People have been surprised by the sweep and variety of powers which have been vested in planning authorities under the Act and have been dismayed to find that the individual citizen has so little recourse, so little recourse by way of appeal, to restrain the planning authorities in the exercise of their powers.  It is quite true to say that there is an appeal provided by the Act to the Minister for Local Government but it is equally true to say that no Minister for Local Government, however endowed with intelligence, however endowed with the virtue of hard work, could possibly devote his mind individually to the number of appeals that come before him in any year.  The Minister must necessarily act on advice tendered to him.  Equally one might say that that is the position in regard to the regulations which are made and which were made under the Act when it came into operation.  The present Minister can well claim to be exculpated from the charges which it is necessary to make about the planning and development exemption regulations which were made under the Act.  I shall come to those in a minute.</P>
    <P>In order to consider this Bill, it is necessary to have a look at the manner in which the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, is framed.  The Act is concerned with planning and development and any person wanting to find out what development meant would turn to section 3 which defines &ldquo;development&rdquo; as the carrying out of any works on, in or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.  &ldquo;Works&rdquo; is defined in subsection (2) as any act or operation of construction, excavation, demolition, extension, alteration, repair <Col N="426" /> or renewal.  It is significant that the description of &ldquo;Works&rdquo; embraces equally the construction, alteration or extension of a premises or property with demolition, so that in the eyes of the Legislature when it was passing the 1963 Act, I think Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would have regarded themselves as attributing the same importance to demolition as they would to extension, alteration or repair.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1963 gave power to the Minister to exempt certain developments from the requirement to obtain planning permission and again I think it would be fair to say that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas who looked at this would have thought that the exemptions concerned the fringe areas of development and that the fringe might be related to works but less important elements in relation to either construction, excavation, demolition, alteration or renewal. It would be fair to say that if anybody had directed his mind to the type of regulation the Minister would make, exempting certain works and developments, he would have said: &ldquo;It is a minor alteration or extension of a house.  That is the kind of thing that can be exempted.  If it is the construction of walls around a house to a normal level, again there would be no requirement to seek planning permission and equally in relation to repairs, such as putting in a new window or doors or the erection of a chimney stack, it would be right, proper and sensible that such construction work or repair would not have to be made the subject of an application to the planning authority for permission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But I am quite certain that nobody in either House of the Oireachtas would have thought that one whole aspect of development included in the term &ldquo;works&rdquo;, that is to say, demolition, would have been the subject of a complete exemption as is provided for in the statutory instrument, the regulations made under subsection (4), which has this horrible title &ldquo;Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (Exempted Development) Regulations, 1964.&rdquo;  Nobody would ever have <Col N="427" /> thought that the extensions, for instance, could be the subject of an exemption regulation because extensions are equally as important as alterations; but what, in fact, has happened is that while the legislature and both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1963, when the Act was being enacted, specifically provided that demolition of premises, equally with extensions and alterations, was a proper matter for planning and development permission, nobody could have thought that the whole area of demolition could have been the subject of exemption as was the case under the regulations to which I have referred, it would have been such an enormous error to have included demolition in an exemption regulation, but what, in fact, we find is that demolition, which is the subject of a specific definition or is part of a definition in the Act, is concealed in a regulation where nobody would expect to find it; and I think it must be said that this concealment was deliberate, and if not deliberate, was the worst possible form of drafting that anybody could be guilty of.</P>
    <P>Nobody looking at these planning and development regulations and seeing that there was a schedule with small print would ever have thought that in these regulations demolition was provided for in one of the classes in the schedule.  The schedule is brought into operation by Article 3 of the regulations:</P>
    <P>Subject to sub-article (5) of this article, development of each class specified in column 1 of Part I of the Schedule of these Regulations shall be exempted development for the purposes of the Act, provided such development complies with the limitations specified in the said column 1 in relation to that class and with the condition specified in column 2 of the said Part I opposite the mention of that class in the said column 1.</P>
    <P>When one is thinking in terms of development, I rather think that is a positive act: one is thinking in terms of construction, alteration, renewal or improvement but reading an instrument of this kind, I personally would <Col N="428" /> be inclined to think of demolition as development.  It seems to be the antithesis of development or part of development. Under the Act it is included as development.  From the point of view of the layman, I think nobody would regard demolition as not being development, but what happens under the regulations is that the matters exempted from development are set out in various classes.  The first one concerns the extension of a dwellinghouse by any addition to the rear thereof, provided the original floor area is not exceeded by more than 120 square feet and that the height is not exceeded. Straight away one would think that was a reasonable exemption.</P>
    <P>There are others in relation to construction of walls, television aerials and things of that kind and then in class 7 we read:</P>
    <P>An alteration consisting of the plastering or painting of any external part of any building.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>or the demolition of any building.</P>
    <P>One would certainly think that the demolition of any building would be put into a class of its own, that it would not be included in a class that dealt with plastering or painting any external part of the building and that the manner of phrasing in relation to this class was especially misleading&mdash; whether deliberate or bad drafting I do not know but whoever is responsible for it can take his pick.  The wording continues:</P>
    <P>save where the preservation of such building is an objective of any development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
    <P>That is the warrant.  Class 7 of this regulation is the warrant of any speculator to demolish any building he likes, no matter how much the public may wish to have it preserved or how much it ought to be preserved in the interests of the community and I think it was a mistake and a grave error to have put it into the regulation in that <Col N="429" /> way.  I know the Minister will say that under the new town plan provided for Dublin and other cities and towns which will come into operation on 1st October, 1967, certain buildings will be isolated as being necessary and desirable to preserve for the purpose of the plan.  That may be so.  That is again as far as the type of building we are talking about is concerned but there is a whole range of other buildings which will not be the objective of any development plans made under this Act of 1963.  There are a lot of those buildings which ought to be the subject of an objective appraisal as to their worth and value before they are demolished.</P>
    <P>As I said already, there are some buildings which in any event because of the present housing crisis ought not be demolished pending an increase in our stock of houses.  Therefore, this Bill while its effect will not be very great to some extent in the case of those buildings that are objectives of preservation in the development plans made, will continue until such time as the housing crisis has been resolved.</P>
    <P>Let there be no mistake about this, that the threat to most of the buildings and most of the houses comes from those who want to build big, expensive luxury blocks of flats and big office buildings.  As far as my information goes, there are blocks of luxury flats in this city which have not been inhabited because the economic rents are so high.  There are just no tenants prepared to pay the high rents the speculators find it necessary to charge in order to get the returns they want on their investments.  There has been altogether too much development of that kind of luxury flats and office buildings and too little of the development of flats for the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed in a manner, let me say quite frankly, I would not approve of.  I do not like, and I condemned it before, the drafting of Bills by reference to other pieces of legislation, but I have not got, nor has any other Member of this House got, the resources which are available to Ministers of State.  I would have this Bill drafted, if I had available <Col N="430" /> to me the resources which a Minister of State has, in a manner which I would like.  The Bill certainly is quite clear in what it does.</P>
    <P>Under the Exempted Development Regulations, to which I have already referred, certain classes of buildings are defined.  The first is an industrial building which means a structure, not being a shop, or a structure in or adjacent to and belonging to a quarry or mine used for the carrying on of any industrial process.  We do not intend that the demolition of those buildings should be subjected to planning authorities.  There are light industrial buildings which mean, industrial buildings, not being special industrial buildings in which the processes carried on or the machinery installed are such as could be carried on or installed in any residential area without detriment to the amenity of that area by reason of noise, vibration, smell, fumes, smoke, soot, ash, dust or grit.  A general industrial building means an industrial building which is not a light industrial building or a special industrial building.  A special industrial building means an industrial building used for one or more of the purposes specified in classes 5, 6, 7, and 8 in Part IV of the Schedule to these regulations.</P>
    <P>We are saying in the Bill, and we say it quite clearly in paragraph 2, that the Minister should not be entitled to make regulations exempting from the necessity to obtain planning permission if those buildings are buildings other than an industrial buildings, light industrial building, general industrial building or special industrial building. In other words, you exclude from the scope of the Bill, or rather you include within the Bill all buildings except those industrial buildings, light industrial buildings and so on and these in the main will be the ordinary houses in our streets, towns, squares, promenades and terraces and will, I think, meet the purposes which I and the other sponsors of the Bill have in mind in trying to preserve for our own enjoyment and for posterity those buildings of an architectural and aesthetic quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> It is also correct to say that the wholesale demolition of buildings which has been going on without any let or hindrance from any public authorities has caused a great deal of public concern and there has been a good deal of correspondence in the papers about it.  There has been a good deal said in speeches by different societies condemning this unbridled or permitted demolition of buildings in the manner in which it has occurred.</P>
    <P>A good test oftentimes of people's sincerity is the extent to which they are prepared to suffer financially for the views they hold.  In this connection it is right and proper to refer to the fact that a group of architects in the city of Dublin&mdash;I am not certain I can lay my hand on the reference at the moment&mdash;but certainly quite a number of responsible and respectable architects in this country have recommended to their members that they ought not be a party to any assignment which involves the demolition of the type of buildings which we say ought to be preserved.  When you get professional people whose incomes are going to be affected by a voluntarily imposed ban of this kind doing this it is a test of their sincerity and a test of the rightness of the cause which they and others are espousing.</P>
    <P>I hope that what is becoming fashionable nowadays, in my experience, the practice of bringing over from London Sir Somebody, who is an architect, or some foreign architect, to lend some authority to proposals to demolish certain buildings and to erect different kinds of offices and blocks of flats, will not be adopted by companies in this country who have to demolish buildings.  I hope that the commendable professional integrity displayed by architects will not result in an influx of foreign architects to the detriment of the way of life of Irish architects.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Local Government has been anxious to be present at this debate.  Personally, I think he is free from any blame for the regulations which have been framed.  As I said, I know of his <Col N="432" /> interest to be present at this debate. I trust that he will urge the House, or will join with us in urging the House, to accept this Bill.  There may be amendments which will require to be made.  I do not think these are likely to be very far-reaching.  Certainly if they are necessary, I am quite sure we will be quite anxious to accept them.  I also hope that if it comes to that we will have available to us the expertise and skill of the Minister's staff in the framing of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill which we have put down for what I think is a good purpose.  The purpose is obvious &mdash;the preservation of buildings from demolition, contrary to the public interest on one of several grounds: the loss of housing at a time when housing is particularly needed, or the loss of amenity provided by buildings of historic or architectural interest. Senator O'Quigley has said something about the origin of this problem and the way in which under these regulations demolition has gone on as an exempted activity.  I do not want to go over that ground again in any detail, but I should like to say that there is, in fact, a quite strong legal case for these regulations being <i>ultra vires</i> in this respect.  This has not been decided in the courts, and to do so would require some individual citizen to put his own money at risk.  In the absence of such a test the correct and appropriate remedy is either a motion to annul the regulation or a Bill to annul the power to make regulations of this kind.  In order to make doubly sure it is this latter course that we have chosen.</P>
      <P>The case for these regulations being <i>ultra vires</i> takes the following form. First of all, as Senator O'Quigley said, exempted developments are of two kinds.  In section 4 (1) of the Act there is a long list of operations which are clearly defined and obviously in the public interest and of administrative convenience.  Section 4 (2) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations provide for any class of development <Col N="433" /> being exempted development for the purposes of this Act and such provisions may be either without conditions or subject to conditions and either general or confined to a particular area or place.</P>
    <P>I emphasise &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo; because the Act tells us what it is for in its Long Title, which is admissible in construing it&mdash;</P>
    <P>To make provision, in the interests of the common good, for the proper planning and development of cities, towns and other areas, whether urban or rural (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof)...</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; on any reasonable construction includes amenities such as existing, physical features, or objects which are of historic or artistic value.  It is clear that this was the intention in using the word &ldquo;amenities&rdquo; because the White Paper that accompanied the Act made this quite clear. So we have this Act stated to be for the purpose of the preservation of amenities, and amenities are clearly intended to cover physical features of artistic or historic value.  The Minister is given power, after a long line of specific minor exemptions, to make further exemptions for the purpose of this Act, which is designed to preserve and improve amenities.  The regulations which have caused this trouble are grouped under the heading&mdash;and this alone is evidence of a mistake, to put it at its lowest&mdash;of &ldquo;sundry minor works.&rdquo;  Class 7 refers to:</P>
    <P>An alteration consisting of the plastering or painting of any external part of any building or the demolition of any building, save where the preservation of such building is an objective of any development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
    <P>Class 7 itself is hidden among other minor exemptions designed for public and administrative convenience and <Col N="434" /> headed &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;, which could scarcely be more misleading. There is hardly a more major work that could be done on a building than its complete demolition.</P>
    <P>There are two grounds for saying that in the light of this background the section is <i>ultra vires</i>.  The exempted development contemplated by section 4, some of which are specifically listed in section 4 (1) clearly are intended to be all of the same minor kind; the conferment of regulatory powers on the Minister in section (4) 2 after rather than before the nine cases specified in the exemption clause, implies&mdash;and I have been given good legal authority for this&mdash;only a Ministerial power to extend the exemptions by making regulations of a similar character <i>ejusdem generis</i>.  Clearly, therefore, the regulation regarding demolition which is so different in character and which is so opposed to the objectives of the Act can hardly be described as being of the same kind or <i>ejusdem generis</i>, and consequently an attempt in this way to provide power of exemption for demolition, it is argued, is <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Moreover, these regulations were published on the 2nd October, 1964, the day following the coming into effect of the Act.  By that day no planning authority could have made regulations about individual buildings and no area plan could yet have been made.  Consequently, in those circumstances, in the absence of either any development plan being in existence or any possibility of that, and in the absence of any possibility of a resolution by an individual planning authority, the effect of this regulation at the time it was made was to make possible the demolition of every building in the country whether of artistic or historic importance or not, without the permission of any planning authority.  That clearly would have frustrated from the outset the expressed principal purpose of the Act, the preservation of these amenities. Consequently, on this ground also, and in the light, I am told, of the Supreme Court view on the Petty Sessions Act, 1851, in the Quinn case the regulations are, I am advised, <i>ultra vires</i>.  It would be open to any <Col N="435" /> citizen resident in this country to challenge these regulations by injunction or declaratory action.  Since the law was passed for the benefit of all citizens equally and refers itself in its Long Title to the common good, any citizen resident in this country is damaged by the abuse of the functions conferred by the Act and would, therefore, have power to challenge it, similar to the power to challenge the constitutionality of a statute.</P>
    <P>These are the legal grounds on which this regulation could be over-ridden as <i>ultra vires,</i> but it has not been over-ridden. Meantime with these regulations still there unchallenged serious damage has been done, is being done and is being threatened to be done to the amenities in particular of this city. How serious this is we can now see, because we know of the intention of the planning authority, or at least of the officers of the planning authority, in this instance endorsed by the planning authority and put on display in the Black Church&mdash;an excellent display which indeed every Member of the House should have an opportunity of seeing if he is concerned with the city and county of Dublin.  We know from this display which buildings the planning authority intend to preserve either absolutely or at least to the extent of examining and considering any proposal to change or destroy them with a view to considering whether they would wish to preserve them.</P>
    <P>Examination of these proposals which are mapped out there and listed in the Dublin city development plan shows that in many instances where buildings have been destroyed in the recent past, and certainly in St. Stephen's Green in three instances, these are buildings which would have been preserved in the plan had they not been demolished under this regulation. I say that because the buildings demolished were of similar character to the buildings on either side of them, and these buildings on either side of them are subject to either clause A or clause B of the list devised of preservation proposals in the Dublin plan. List B covers cases where it is stated <Col N="436" /> to be the objective of the planning authority in the interests of amenity to secure the preservation of buildings or other structures and groups of buildings specified in the list, and List A covers cases where it is the intention of the planning authority in the event of an application being made for permission to alter or demolish buildings or other structures to consider the preservation of such buildings or groups of buildings.</P>
    <P>The three instances in St. Stephen's Green which have been demolished in great haste in advance of the coming into force of this plan were quite clearly of buildings which would have been preserved, as they were of the same character as buildings on either side of them which, in fact, it is proposed to preserve.  The existence of this demolition exemption unqualified in any way has already seriously damaged amenities which the planning authority seek and intend to preserve. The cases in question are Nos. 47, 48 and 49 St. Stephen's Green, and Nos. 69 and 76 St. Stephen's Green and Nos. 35 and 38 St. Stephen's Green. In regard to the first case, following the demolition of Nos. 47, 48 and 49 it was clear that other buildings on either side were in danger, buildings the property of the Government. Fortunately, a public spirited group agitating on this matter eventually secured the belated and not entirely wholehearted disavowal by the Government of any intention to sell these buildings and to enable them to be demolished.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these other buildings in the immediate neighbourhood of Nos. 47, 48 and 49 are the subject of proposals for development and the developers are the Green Property Company and their architects Messrs. Stephens and Gibney.  Proposals are put forward which involve quite a considerable stretch.  This company control No. 2 Hume Street, 46 St. Stephen's Green and the demolished buildings Nos. 47, 48 and 49 and Nos. 18 and 19 Hume Street as well as Nos. 44 and 45 St. Stephen's Green. They do not own No. 1 Hume Street <Col N="437" /> because that is in the possession of the Government.</P>
    <P>The intention of this company is, in fact, to proceed to demolish these other buildings, in so far as they are within their control, and to rebuild. There is there an immediate and serious threat.  The threat lies in the fact that they have not put forward any positive proposals as to what will be put in the place of these buildings. They can demolish them and having demolished them, there is no use in anybody saying that they should be rebuilt as Georgian houses, for our desire to preserve the character of the city does not go so far as that concerning the Communist government of Poland which rebuilt so much of Warsaw after the war in the character of the pre-war and mediaeval parts of the city.  If certain buildings in Dublin are demolished they are gone for good. The whole character of the area is changed.  Once a company like this company have power to demolish and once they get ownership there will be no control over the buildings.  What they put in their place will be the subject of planning permission later on. It would be inconceivable in practice that the planning authority would require the buildings to be restored in the form in which they were previously, so that once demolished the character of the area is destroyed.</P>
    <P>A similar situation has existed in regard to Nos. 65, 68, 69 and 71 where two new buildings exist in the place of buildings which clearly would have been preserved if this demolition order without any control by the planning authority had not existed thereby frustrating the intentions of the planning authority as now disclosed.  In that instance the property on either side is on the A list, whereas in the case of Nos. 47, 48 and 49 the property on either side consists of Government-owned buildings which are exempt from control and buildings on the B list.</P>
    <P>Again, Nos. 35 and 38 have been demolished and rebuilding is taking place although buildings beside them up to No. 34 are similar in character and on the A list.  Nos. 35 and 38 would also have been subject to a condition of preservation if they have not been <Col N="438" /> demolished in time.  Many other buildings are threatened.  No. 52, St. Stephen's Green was previously owned by a representative church body.  This is a building in respect of which several applications were made for outline permission. One, which sought to destroy the building, has been refused. Another, I think, is still with the planning authorities.  I am not sure of its present status.  This is one which would make the end of the sixth storey obtrude on Ely Place.</P>
    <P>Nos. 65 and 68 are also now on the list for preservation.  I should add that No. 52 is on the B list, that is, where the objective of the planning authority is to preserve it.  Nos. 65 and 68 are on the A list, that is, the planning authority have stated their intention, in the event of an application being made for permission to alter or demolish any of these buildings, to consider their preservation. In that instance outline planning permission has to be granted to the owners of Hainault House next door.  If these are destroyed the whole view of the east side of the Green would be completely changed.</P>
    <P>Nos. 75 to 100 St. Stephen's Green are believed to be endangered by the stated intention to build a hotel on the site of Wesley school.  These are on the A list.  In other words say, if not frustrated by the action of these developers in getting in before next October in order to have these buildings destroyed in time, using for this purpose this regulation under the heading &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;, the planning authority intend to consider the preservation of these buildings.</P>
    <P>Other premises in St. Stephen's Green in respect of which demolition is threatened are Nos. 18 to 21, the development of which has been mooted for some time past but where development has been held up because of difficulty in removing tenants&mdash;tenants standing in the way of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; in this instance.</P>
    <P>St. Stephen's Green is not the only area in which this problem arises. There is the case of Mountjoy Square, where, on the one hand, you have public-spirited people seeking to preserve and recreate some of the houses.  The Irish Georgian Society are <Col N="439" /> working on Nos. 47 and 50, reconstructing them so that they will be open to the public and provided with proper furnishings and fittings.  While this public-spirited group are operating in this direction, others are letting buildings decay so that they can become dangerous and so that these people can claim the right to destroy or, in fact, demolish them.  Consequently, Mountjoy Square is already half-wrecked because of the actions of these people operating under this regulation.</P>
    <P>One could go on with the list indefinitely. There is the threat to Mespil Road, after what remains following the building of the Irish Life Insurance building.  This is an excellent building in its own right, but I wish it had not intruded into the terrace.  You have Wilton Place where the houses have gone.  There is a case in Ballsbridge referred to in <i>Business and Finance</i> where a group of buildings the future of which was actually under appeal by the Minister for Local Government was summarily demolished by their owner so that the appeal to the Minister became pointless at that stage in regard to development once the houses were destroyed. Dr. O'Driscoll of Bord Fáilte in an article is quoted as saying that when such demolition takes place it rapidly removes the future of the building from the sphere of argument.</P>
    <P>An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland, which has a function in regard to the whole question of planning and development in a notice issued not long ago said that the corporation development plan is due to appear very shortly &mdash;we now have it on display in the Black Church&mdash;and that it may contain reasons for preservation which should not be compromised now by demolition of properties which are thought to be worthy of preservation.  An Taisce also points out that Dr. Myles Wright made a strong appeal for the preservation of the best parts of Dublin within the canals.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Bill I had correspondence with An Taisce who welcomed the promotion of this Bill by those of us who support it.  I would emphasise at this stage&mdash;and I shall <Col N="440" /> come back to the matter later&mdash;that this Bill is not put forward as a Party Bill.  We have sought support throughout these benches and we welcome support from the other side of the House.  We do not seek any particular credit from any one side of the House or any one Party in this regard.  If we can all work together on this&mdash;perhaps the Bill requires some amendment&mdash;we can all share the credit of preserving what remains or what has not already been destroyed of the city of Dublin and, indeed, of the other cities and towns in our country.</P>
    <P>Various arguments could be put forward on this Bill suggesting that it may, in some respects, go too far, or criticising it in various ways.  First of all, as Senator O'Quigley has said, the argument may be put forward that there is no problem now; the plan has been published.  This merely highlights the danger.  We know now precisely what we could only guess at before but could not state with certainty, the areas in Dublin which the Dublin Planning Authority seek to preserve. We know where these areas are and, what is more, the developers know where they are.  The developers have been served notice that unless this Bill is passed or equivalent measures taken by the Government in the near future &mdash;and the Houses of the Oireachtas will adjourn in the near future&mdash;unless that is done, they can achieve their purpose if they get these buildings demolished during the summer months before the Dáil and Seanad resume.  If they fail to do so, then they will be subject to planning controls in regard to the demolition of these houses or anything they wish to put in their place.  It is, therefore, a matter of great urgency that this Bill be passed and the fact that the plan has been published enhances that urgency, pinpoints the danger and serves us with notice that we must now shoulder our responsibilities and take action to save the situation in the months ahead, and prevent irreparable damage being done by those who seek to secure financial advantage out of the destruction of parts of our cities and the replacement of buildings by others, some of which may <Col N="441" /> be buildings of distinction but many of which are not.</P>
    <P>It would be tragic and unforgiveable if we did not take the minimum action necessary to save the situation before it is too late.  It might be argued that if this is the purpose of the Bill, could it not put a time limit on this restriction, on the power of exemption of demolition.  I am open to the Minister's arguments on that.  I should like to hear him on that point.  My main concern is with this dangerous interval over the next few months but I do not think the problem is confined to that. I think demolition should in any event, be the subject of planning and control, even in respect of buildings which are not specified as worthy of preservation by a planning authority.  First of all, a planning authority can make mistakes. I must say that, having examined fairly briefly the plan as set out in the Black Church I was impressed at the care taken to select those parts of the city which ought to be preserved because they have a character of their own, because the buildings concerned have particular architectural merit or historical interest.  But it was not possible for me to examine it minutely, building by building, all the buildings; nor would I have the knowledge of Dublin, or the architectual or historical knowledge to do so adequately, in any event.  I can only say that at first sight they seem to have done a remarkably good job.  But they may have made mistakes; there may be omissions.  There may well be buildings which now or later we would wish to preserve and which, simply because they have been omitted from the plan, should not be opened up to destruction without a second look by the planning authority when the proposal for demolition comes forward. On these grounds alone, I feel we do require to have a Bill of this kind enacted, not just until next October, but running beyond that.  Another reason for leaving the Bill open in its application as regards time is that the Minister has power to exempt a planning authority from the requirement to have a plan made by next October. The Minister may well find it necessary to exercise that power in cases <Col N="442" /> where plans are not ready or where the number of objections to them is such that it has not been possible to deal with them in the time.  Therefore, to put a time limit to next October on the Bill would, for that reason alone, be dangerous.</P>
    <P>Again, on a matter of general principle, people should not be entitled to demolish houses where they have not got plans ready to replace them.  This city is a mass of ugly gashes and gaps in rows of buildings where buildings have been pulled down with nothing to replace them.  In some cases, this was necessary.  The buildings had become dangerous either through the neglect by their owners or because they were badly built in the first instance and time has taken its toll but, in many other cases, buildings have been pulled down which were perfectly sound and a gap left which has not been filled.  As a matter of good planning, I think any demolition should be the subject of a plan submitted to a planning authority, accompanied by proposals to rebuild, because the only purpose of demolition is to rebuild; unless, perhaps, it is to make a car park.  In any event, a proposal to demolish should be accompanied by plans for the alternative use of the site.  A demolition can be of no value to a developer unless he can rebuild or use the site for another purpose.  He cannot use the site for another purpose or rebuild until he has got permission. Therefore, he might as well get permission for the demolition as well as for the rebuilding.  It would impose no hardship on him to do so but it will save us from the ugliness which mars not only this city but other Irish towns and cities where buildings have been wantonly pulled down because, perhaps, of some vague expectation of rebuilding, but no plans being ready to do so.  For that reason, there should be some permanent control on demolition.</P>
    <P>However, having said that, I should like to hear the Minister on this point. The Minister and his Department have great experience and knowledge of this problem.  They may well have reasons for feeling that the Bill, as drafted, is unduly wide, that it attempts to do too much, that by seeking to preserve <Col N="443" /> everything except industrial buildings more or less indefinitely, or until the planning permission is sought, it goes too far.  If the Minister has good reasons for seeking to narrow the Bill in some respects, we on this side of the House are open to his views and, on Committee Stage, we will be open to consider any amendments he may suggest.  Indeed, we may put down amendments to meet points he makes on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I would not wish the Minister to feel that, by accepting the Second Stage of this Bill, he is committing himself to this absolute ban on the exemption of demolition.  We would be entirely reasonable on the question of any amendments he may wish to put forward which will modify the operation of the Bill so as to prevent it doing more than it needs to do or more than it is desirable to do.  We, in drafting this Bill, have not had the full knowledge of the problem which the Minister and his Department have and it would seem right to us that we should, therefore, bring in a Bill couched in wide terms.  Then, in the light of the debate on Second Stage in the light of the views which he and others in the House may express, we could narrow it down or modify it slightly.  He can be assured of our goodwill in any proposals of that kind which are reasonable.</P>
    <P>One argument sometimes put forward in regard to the question of control of demolition is that the cost of preserving vast areas of our city would be enormous and that the public authorities cannot be expected to pay this.  This is, first of all, irrelevant on this Bill because the Bill does not require that anything be preserved indefinitely, but merely requires that planning permission be sought before a building is demolished, and it is up to the planning authority to decide whether or not it is reasonable that the building should be demolished and whether or not it should be replaced in a particular way.  In any event, this argument is one I am suspicious of because most of the parts of the city which bodies like An Taisce, the Dublin Civic Group, the Dublin <Col N="444" /> Georgian Society have sought to preserve are areas which, in fact, are improving in value, becoming more fashionable, where private individuals or companies are putting money into the preservation of houses and, if left alone to do so, and if the lure of large profits from redevelopment were removed, they would be happy to continue this work.</P>
    <P>I have heard of one case in one of our Dublin squares where a private company purchased a building, a normal house in one of these squares, as an office building, and spent&mdash;between the price of the house and the repair and improvement of it&mdash;a sum of well over £50,000.  They were willing to do so because they felt it worth their while to have an office which they regard as a prestige office in that situation in a Georgian building, with the interior improved and preserved and modern fittings put in, not in any way damaging the character of the house. The fact is that in many of these areas it would not be necessary now or for a long time to come for any public money to be put into preserving these buildings if it were made clear that they are to be kept.  This is the intention of the planning authority and they will, in fact, preserve the external character of most of these buildings under this plan when they are in a position to do so next October.  If that action is taken and if they decide to preserve them, then private interests will be prepared, in most of these cases, to put the money into these buildings to preserve them. They are not asking any taxpayer to put his hand in his pocket for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this respect is clear enough if we look at the particular areas most involved. If we look along lower Fitzwilliam Street we see how buildings there which had gone down the hill are being retrieved and recovered by private interests now.  The same thing is happening in Lower Pembroke Street.  Spreading out from the squares now is an area of restoration where <Col N="445" /> buildings are being improved, preserved, raised in value as property but preserved as far as their character is concerned.</P>
      <P>However, in this Bill we do not require that such action be taken in respect of any building.  We merely require that before its demolition, the planning authority should have the opportunity of taking a decision in regard to this building which they want to take and in respect of which they have given notice of wanting to take. We merely want to ensure that the planning authorities are not frustrated in this respect.</P>
      <P>We hope for a constructive debate on this Bill.  We believe we will have it.  We hope that from the other side of the House we will get support for this proposal.  We believe it is one that will command the support of public-spirited people in all Parties. We have no monopoly of public spirit on this side of the House.  We hope also for a speedy debate because unless this Bill goes through in the very near future and passes through this House before the Dáil adjourns and in time for the Dáil to put it through all stages we will be in the difficulty that in the crucial months ahead there will be no protection for the buildings which our planning authority are seeking to preserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any of us wants on our shoulders responsibility for any more destruction of this kind.  I do not think any of us wants to be in the position that people can point to us and say: &ldquo;Because of their neglect, because they did not do their work of legislation, parts of the city of Dublin or other cities and towns of Ireland which would have been preserved for future generations have been destroyed&rdquo;.  We have a duty in this respect.  We have now an opportunity to exercise this duty.  I hope the Minister will work with us on this.  As I said, he may have difficulties about the breadth of the Bill. He may have good reasons for wanting to narrow it.  We will listen to these reasons and consider them and we will consider any amendments he wishes to put forward or any points on which he thinks we should introduce <Col N="446" /> amendments but we must have regard to our heritage and to our reputation as a country.  In the earlier part of today's debate and last week, a number of Senators, myself included, spoke of the damage we have done to our reputation throughout the world by the way in which we have, over the decades, operated our censorship system.  Many Senators felt this, and felt it deeply.  In the last few months we have done ourselves damage, too, outside this country, because people think that we must not care for our country that we should allow it to be pointlessly and thoughtlessly destroyed in the way that has taken place in recent months.  We have the opportunity now to stop this and I hope that out of this debate will come not necessarily this Bill in this form but a Bill in some form enacted by the Oireachtas before it adjourns for the summer that will ensure that no more of our historic buildings or buildings of architectural merit will be gone and that when we come back from our summer holidays there will not be further huge gaps in the squares and streets of Dublin or other cities of this country.</P>

      <P>I rise to support what has been very ably and fully put by the proposer and seconder of this measure and to add my voice to an appeal to the Minister and to the rest of the House to accept this Bill, the aim of which is to ensure that the demolition of buildings shall not any longer be exempt from the necessity for seeking the permission of the local planning authority.  It is quite clear that if a building can, from the community point of view, be legitimately demolished, then the permission of the planning authority will not be withheld. Consequently, to place the obligation on those who wish to demolish buildings or seek authority to do so from a planning authority is not to place an unreasonable requirement on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Development&rdquo;, of course, has become almost a dirty word today.  It ought to mean something that is related to the embellishment of a city but I think we would find it difficult today to look about Dublin and find 1966 and <Col N="447" /> 1967 buildings which would be considered worth preserving.  I feel that there are very few of the newer buildings which even today might be considered worth preserving.  What will be thought of them in 50, 60 or 100 years time?  My guess is that they will not be regarded&mdash;most of them, there are exceptions&mdash;as buildings of outstanding merit.  However that may be, development as mentioned by Senator O'Quigley in relation to the making of material changes in structures and amenities, roads and so on is an important factor in our urban life today.  It would be wrong to place all the emphasis on Dublin.  Other cities and towns in Ireland have their proportion of architectural beauty and it, too, deserves to be considered at least before demolition is carried out as it can now be without permission from anybody under this statutory instrument which is the object of criticism, Statutory Instrument No. 236 of 1964 which refers to &ldquo;exempted development&rdquo;. The aim as Senator O'Quigley has mentioned is to prevent indiscriminate demolition.  Nothing could be more reasonable.  Senator FitzGerald pointed out that the heading under which class 7 which we are asking in this Bill to have deleted falls is &ldquo;Sundry minor works.&rdquo;  We have a number of categories in Part I of the Schedule to the Statutory Instrument. Column I is &ldquo;Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse.&rdquo;  Then we have &ldquo;Sundry minor works&rdquo;, &ldquo;Changes of Use&rdquo;, &ldquo;Temporary structures and uses&rdquo;, &ldquo;Development for Industrial Purposes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Development of statutory undertakers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Development for amenity or recreational purposes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;. One cannot stress too much the fact that all demolition becoming exempt falls within class 7 which is referred to under &ldquo;Sundry minor works&rdquo;.  Not only that, but as Senator O'Quigley pointed out, the notion of demolition itself is thrown in almost as an afterthought in class 7 which refers to the type of development that will be exempted under this statutory instrument:</P>
    <P>An alteration consisting of the <Col N="448" /> plastering or painting of any external part of any building</P>
    <P>This is the way in which the Clause starts off.</P>
    <P>or the demolition of any building, save where the preservation of such building is an objective of any development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
    <P>I underline the fact that the six words &ldquo;or the demolition of any building&rdquo; are thrown into this paragraph about painting and plastering which, in their turn, are in the category of &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;; and the only basis for the extensive demolition of buildings&mdash;buildings of value which should be preserved and for which at present, unless this Bill is passed, no planning requirement is necessary in relation to demolition.  Planning permission is required after the demolition, when it is being decided what to do on the site but they can destroy, under the provisions of this statutory instrument, in this most peculiar way.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister will be most reluctant to justify this introduction of these six words into a long paragraph primarily concerned with plastering and painting of any external part which in turn is included in &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo;.  How could the Minister say that sundry minor works will include the possible demolition of every building in the country, because that is what it amounts to?</P>

      <P>I am making <Col N="449" /> the point&mdash;perhaps I am wrong in putting it so sweepingly&mdash;that demolition can be carried out under this statutory instrument in a very wide number of cases, and has been so carried out in the heart of Dublin city in the case of buildings the demolition of which, no matter what the Minister said, could not in any circumstances be called minor works, whether sundry or not.</P>
      <P>A town in France which I know very well, the native town of my wife, Amiens, was pretty well destroyed in the last war.  Something more than one-third was flattened, including the centre in which there was a very beautiful old theatre.  It was not left standing, only the facade.  It was an eighteenth century building and only the facade remained after bomb attacks and incendiary practices immediately before the withdrawal of the Germans.  It was decided by the town council of Amiens to rebuild, and it was deemed necessary to widen the main street where the theatre was.  The query arose about the beautiful facade behind which there was no building left standing. They decided (a) that the facade in itself was worth preserving and, (b) that it was essential to widen the street. With a good deal of ingenuity they moved the facade on rollers back four feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this as an example of the lengths to which municipal authorities of taste will go for the purpose of preserving something which they regard as worthwhile, solely from the point of view of beauty.  I am afraid that in Ireland, though there is quite a highly developed visual sense&mdash;visual arts are arts in which many Irish people excel &mdash;nevertheless, local authorities tend to be indifferent to questions of visual beauty.  I notice in Paris&mdash;I do not speak about the oldest part&mdash;the island in the middle behind the island on which Notre Dame stands, the second island in the Seine, the Ile Saint Louis, contains dozens of seventeenth century dwelling houses virtually intact as they were in the seventeenth century.  They most certainly might have fallen down if they had not been propped up, but now one can walk through the Ile Saint Louis, in the heart of a big modern <Col N="450" /> city, and enjoy the seventeenth century buildings.  The Musée Carnavalet, which contains many of the souvenirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, the town house of Madame de Sévigné has also been beautifully preserved by the municipal authority in the heart of Paris.  I might mention also that the palaces which housed many kings who were regarded as being just as tyrannical as ever the British were regarded here have not been blown sky high as a gesture of defiance against dead tyrants. The Louvre is no longer regarded as the palace where a tyrant lived: it houses one of the finest collections of paintings and sculpture in the world.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should try to take an example from that.  As a Dubliner, I was sad when Nelson Pillar was blown to bits by a person or persons unknown plus the present Government, one half by a person or persons unknown and the other half by the Government with indecent speed.  Presumably this was done because shopkeepers in Dublin in the early nineteenth century had placed on top an Englishman who I do not think ever did any harm to this country, but indeed turned a blind eye to many things, which might be a practice we may have adopted from him.  After 45 years of independence we did nothing about replacing him, with the result that this monument of the early nineteenth century was stupidly destroyed.</P>
    <P>It was not a monument of very great beauty but it lent character to a street which, with its disappearance looks more and more every day like a street in Nottingham or Birmingham. The nationalists who blew up this nineteenth century monument, in fact achieved the opposite of the purpose they professed&mdash;they made Dublin look more like any city in Britain today.  No one looking at O'Connell Street and the ghastly array of advertising matter and the buildings, with the single exception of the GPO, would recognise that we lost something with the loss of this picturesque pillar which, in childishness, we destroyed.</P>
    <P>The beauty of Dublin consists of many different aspects but much of <Col N="451" /> the beauty of building is eighteenth century Georgian building.  Not everybody can see beauty in that; not everybody can see beauty in the various squares or in a place like the beautiful curve of Harcourt Street. The beauty that is preserved, in the proportion of the building, the harmonious size of the windows and their panes, is something which one can learn to enjoy&mdash;the harmony and simplicity, the simple elegance of these buildings, in contrast to the over-adornment of many modern buildings. These represent a very precious heritage which has been well illustrated by the exhibition recently put on by An Taisce which showed what could be preserved and should be preserved, what could be improved, and what fresh amenities could be added to Dublin.  They directed their attention first of all to Dublin but the same attention can, of course, be directed elsewhere and has been implemented in many other towns besides Dublin. In Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny, Drogheda and even in a little town such as Birr, there are buildings of outstanding merit in which we can take legitimate pride, which it would be horrible to see demolished and which will be abolished if the statutory instrument which contains this class 7, the right of demolition is maintained.  Consequently, in supporting this Bill I am not opposed to legitimate demolition but to the insistence by those who want to demolish certain buildings of artistic value on being released from the requirement to seek permission from the responsible planning authorities. I cannot see how anyone in this House could be opposed to such a suggestion.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation at all in supporting this Bill. It is true that Dublin has taken on a very ugly appearance with the great demolition gaps grinning like toothless spectres at the citizens.  It is also true that many perfectly sound, habitable houses, capable of conversion into good flat accommodation have been pulled down and the sites either left derelict or converted into office blocks, amusement centres and such like.</P>
      <P>Recently, I noticed a fine specimen of a solid, well-designed, red-brick house in the Baggot Street-Waterloo Road area being bulldozed to ground level.  I do not know what is to take its place.  I have made inquiries and I am informed that it will be turned into a bowling alley.</P>
      <P>Throughout Dublin in the very area, where this particular house was demolished, many young married people occupy flats for which they pay around £6, £7 and upwards per week.  The accommodation which they have comprises kitchenettes, bathrooms and even bedrooms with no windows or other outlet to daylight or fresh air. Good houses in Northumberland Road and Pembroke Road have been razed to the ground.  It is tragic in a situation where there is such a grave and increasing housing shortage that the demolition of sound houses should be permitted.  This is making more acute the already heart-breaking situation of those young people who are seeking to set up homes.  Some of them are in quite good jobs but are not able to buy houses at the very excessive prices charged nowadays.  They are very anxious to bring up their children in healthy, wholesome surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The destruction of good houses is apparently not confined to Dublin city alone.  A few weeks ago on the Stillorgan <Col N="453" /> Road a great gap appeared in a wall exposing to the view a very large and lovely old house set in a fine garden&mdash;a type of house very rarely seen nowadays.  A few days later a large bright yellow crane appeared in front of the house and it looks as though another beautiful specimen of house-building is about to disappear.  I do not know what is the state of preservation of the house or the condition of the structure but the Bill before us would ensure that it is examined before the demolition demons move in for its destruction.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill would make it impossible, or at least more difficult, for money-grabbing speculators to exploit the home seekers I have very great pleasure in supporting it.  In doing so, while it may not be quite in order, I would ask the Minister to consider suggesting to local authorities the wisdom of having flats inspected before landlords are entitled to offer them to the public for renting purposes.  I have, therefore, great pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support this Bill, too. Its aims are clearly most desirable. They are to protect the houses of our city and to preserve buildings of historic and aesthetic importance.  We have only to walk across Leinster Lawn and Merrion Square to see the kind of appalling damage done even by so responsible a body as the ESB. At the far side of Merrion Square we have an architectural vista, which is possibly one of the finest of its kind in Europe.  It is quite irreparably ruined by the gap which the ESB have made in it.  When passing that vista and when introducing visitors to our lovely city it is sad to have to say: &ldquo;This is one of the melancholy things which happened in the last few years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, one must not forget, as Senator Miss Davidson emphasised, the need for houses among our citizens working in the city. In other words, the aims of this Bill are clearly desirable.  As Senator FitzGerald pointed out, the matter is urgent.  Within the next couple of months more of those appalling gaps <Col N="454" /> may appear in our noblest architectural sites so I sincerely hope that the Minister will be sympathetic.  I hope the House will give the Bill, after amendment if necessary, a speedy and favourable passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the motives or at least some of the motives which prompted the introduction of this Bill.  As a Dublin man myself, I hate to contemplate the distinctive architecturally attractive areas of the city being replaced by the type of buildings which are likely to replace them. I doubt if there is anyone who is more disgusted than I am to see some habitable houses demolished to make way for massive office blocks.  I appreciate the importance of the tourist industry to the country's economy.  It is, however, completely unrealistic to pretend that the problem with which the Senators who sponsored the Bill are concerned is a simple one which can be effectively dealt with in this seemingly simple way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say &ldquo;seemingly simple,&rdquo; because while this is a simple Bill the confusion and the volume of unnecessary work which it would create for my Department would be very great while it would not effectively achieve what is, in fact, desired.  When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, was enacted it was never contemplated that development control would be applied merely for the sake of control.  The fundamental purpose of the Act was to secure the working out of practical and coordinated planning objectives and to utilise the various powers available to secure those objectives.  It is clear that this applies to development control because of the specific restrictions written into section 26 and other relevant sections.  It was never the intention that works which had little or no planning significance should be subject to control.  Section 4 of the Act exempts certain works of this kind and enables regulations to be made giving further exemptions.  It was in <Col N="455" /> this spirit that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (Exempted Development) Regulations, 1964 dealt with the particular classes of development which this Bill seeks to bring under control.</P>
    <P>Class 7 of Part I of the Schedule to the Exempted Development Regulations relates to &ldquo;an alteration consisting of the plastering or painting of any external part of any building or the demolition of any building.&rdquo; The effect of this provision would be to allow such work to be carried out without the necessity for giving public notice, making application to the planning authority or obtaining planning permission. Class 7 goes on to make it clear that the exemption does not apply where the preservation of a building is an objective of any development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
    <P>It is not true, then, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington says, to say that the demolition of any building is, in fact, listed as &ldquo;sundry minor works&rdquo; because what is listed is the development of any building save where the preservation is an objective of any development plan, and so on.  It is presumed that other buildings which do not come into this category which is mentioned here, and which was omitted by Senator Sheehy Skeffington will be considered by the planning authority not to be of any particular planning significance, so that, therefore, from the planning point of view the demolition of such a building is, in fact, a minor matter.</P>
    <P>It is clear that under class 7 as listed here in the regulations a planning authority can bring under control any building whose preservation appears to be desirable without having to regulate cases where there is no planning need for such regulation.  This seems to be a reasonable and practical approach, because even in Dublin where the preservation of large areas is being sought the number of such buildings <Col N="456" /> is still only a small percentage of the total.  Yet because of what has happened or what it has been alleged has happened in Dublin this Bill is introduced to apply control to all buildings of every type not only in Dublin but throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>What exactly has happened in Dublin?  What has happened is not, in fact, what some Senators said has happened.  The corporation did not immediately define by resolution those buildings where preservation might be warranted, but they have now done so under the draft Dublin plan which is now on exhibition.  Following their own investigations and having received specialist advice, they found it necessary to try to work out a comprehensive policy of preservation, and the complexities of this problem are well illustrated in Chapter IX of the Wright Report which deals with Central Dublin.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to everyone who studies the corporation's approach, as set out in the written statement which forms part of the development plan, that the control of demolition is only the first step towards preservation.  In the meantime a number of buildings were demolished in order to carry out redevelopment.  In some cases groups or individuals have protested that the buildings should have been preserved, but so far as I can see, and despite what some Senators have implied, in none of these cases was a building demolished until after permission or outline permission had been granted for redevelopment.  Consequently, it is difficult to see how control of demolition would have had any different effect in those cases, since, in fact, permission for redevelopment was given before those buildings were demolished. If permission for redevelopment was given permission for demolition would also, in fact, have been given in those cases and, in fact, permission for redevelopment implied permission for demolition.</P>

      <P>By the planning authority or possibly in some cases on appeal to the Minister.  I do not know if it happened in any single case that the Minister over-ruled the planning authority.  As far as I can ascertain, permission was granted for redevelopment in the case of all those buildings which were demolished, and that certainly was the position in the case of the houses in St. Stephen's Green to which Senator G. FitzGerald specifically referred.  It may be that certain properties were at some risk during this period, but the point I want to make is that apparently no developer was prepared to pull down a substantial building until he was assured that it could be replaced profitably.</P>
      <P>That period is ended now with the publication by the corporation of proposals which I imagine will be accepted as reasonable by most persons interested in preservation.  In my statement to the Dáil on the 15th February last I indicated that I wished to have the corporation's preservation objectives before deciding what amendment of the exempted development regulations was necessary.  Now that the form of the objectives has been settled, I propose to bring the regulations more closely into line so that demolition will be controlled to the extent necessary to underpin the corporation's proposals. In other words, now that I know what the planning authority desire to preserve, I am in the process of amending the regulations to cover the period until the development plan is actually adopted.</P>

I presume that it is not necessary for me to quote from the draft development plan.  Senator FitzGerald certainly has studied it.  It refers to three lists of buildings.  The first is buildings in respect of which the corporation consider preservation should be considered.  In the second case they <Col N="458" /> have made a definite decision that they should secure preservation, and demolition is to be controlled so that preservation might be considered.  The third is a list of buildings owned by the State the preservation of which it is considered should be secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being drafted now and its drafting is probably almost complete.  My Department have had consultations with other county boroughs as well as Dublin, and we believe that this approach would suit them also and, consequently, would be infinitely more preferable than a general control of all demolitions of all buildings whether they have any planning significance or not.  This Bill which we have before us would remove from me the power to make the amendments I propose, and the effect of the Bill would be to bring under control a great deal of alteration, clearance, and demolition work without serving any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>Property owners and developers would have to apply for permission to carry out works which have little planning significance, or which might be desirable or essential in the public interest.  Some expense, delay and inconvenience would be imposed unnecessarily. In addition, planning authorities would be burdened with extra work in dealing with these applications.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill would have the effect of bringing even external plastering and painting under control. This particular exemption followed an undertaking given in the Dáil when the Act of 1963 was in Committee Stage. I am at a loss to see why it should now be removed, even in the case of buildings which are not likely to rank for preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards demolition, there are several classes of such work which would be affected by the Bill.  First of all, there is the removal of any structure in pursuance of a requirement <Col N="459" /> under any enactment&mdash;for example, a dangerous building notice.  This is exempted under Class 26 (d) of Part I of the Schedule to the Regulations, and I think it would be nonsensical to require permission to be obtained.  The clearance of derelict sites which is also mentioned would be brought under control.  If this Bill were passed, such control would impede this very desirable work.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, demolition which has no planning significance and which occurs every day in the course of building alterations, renovations and reconstruction would be subject to control. There is an exception under section 4 (1) (g) of the Act where the external appearance of the building is not materially affected but much of such work is exempted under class 7 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Regulations and in this case I think other control would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Site clearance for redevelopment is also exempted under class 7.  The case for control depends on the objectives of the planning authority. In my opinion, control serves no useful purpose where it is desirable that redevelopment takes place and there is no preservation objective.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have considerable sympathy with the underlying purpose of this Bill, but I am satisfied that the amendments are misconceived. The Bill seeks to deal with a limited objective by employing provisions of an unnecessarily wide scope.  I have already considered whether the general control of demolition would enable us to secure the preservation of habitable houses as such but I am advised that this problem would require to be tackled in another way.  I am, as I said, concerned with the desirability of controlling the demolition of habitable houses, and <i>ad hoc</i> legislation may prove to be necessary since the planning legislation is not appropriate for this purpose, but the present Bill deals only with preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is not appropriate to enable us to secure the preservation of habitable houses.  I am satisfied with that and I concede that it may be necessary to bring in special <i>ad hoc</i> legislation for that purpose, and I am considering doing that. Since the case for preservation rests largely on the fact that such houses are relatively few in number there can, in my opinion, be little justification for removing exemptions given in relation to other properties.  The only exception for which the Bill before us provides is the demolition of buildings in industrial use.  It would not prevent the demolition of any other building in whole or in part.  This would interfere with much necessary or desirable work of reconstruction, alteration, extension or redevelopment, and I believe it would do so unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>The preservation of the Georgian areas of Dublin or any other buildings or group of buildings is something that is not easily attainable.  In considering this question, which is a difficult and complex one, there is no point whatever in ignoring such inconvenient, but, unfortunately, very relevant, details as the cost of preservation and the question of who is to finance such preservation. It is all very well for Senator Garret FitzGerald to say that the question of cost is irrelevant but if preservation is costly and if the expense cannot be recovered by the owner of the building then someone must find the question of cost a very relevant one indeed.</P>
      <P>The Planning Authority can and has now in the draft development plan listed buildings and areas for preservation, and demolition may not take place in these cases without permission or at least as soon as the plan is adopted that will be the position.  As I said, I intend to cover the intervening period by amendment of the Regulations. This in itself does not secure the objective with absolute certainly because the question of cost has not been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When buildings grow old the cost of maintenance increases, and if the income obtainable from the buildings does not keep pace, and if the cost of <Col N="461" /> preservation is to be borne by the owner, then compulsory preservation will be difficult to enforce, if, indeed, it would be consistent with the Constitution. If preservation is to be the liability of local or central government, then this objective of preservation of old buildings will immediately be in competition with urgent social problems such as housing, roads, water and sewerage services, swimming pools, libraries and other amenities for which public pressure is developing.</P>
    <P>People who are adequately housed, perhaps adequately housed in different locations to suit the seasons of the year, who are in a position to live graciously, who can appreciate the distinctive character of Dublin because their resources have made it possible for them to become familiar with other capital cities, and who can say from their own experience that there is no other city like Dublin, may understandably consider it more important to preserve this distinctiveness than to provide minimum standards of housing accommodation for people at present living in grossly overcrowded and insanitary conditions, but those who have to consider social as well as aesthetic problems and who have to face the task of financing the solutions to them will find the choice a more difficult one.</P>
    <P>I have to suggest, then, to the Senators sponsoring this Bill that they must say unequivocally how the preservation which I think we all agree is desirable is to be financed.  If these houses are to be preserved, what is to be their future use?  Can a person who may be of modest means be compelled to be a public benefactor by maintaining a building at a cost which may well exceed the income obtainable from it? If he does not do it, what will the penalty be?  If the cost of preservation of these buildings of artistic and architectural merit is to be at the expense of the taxpayer or the ratepayer, if the preservation is to be at the expense of the taxpayer or the ratepayer, again the question of the use of the buildings arises.</P>

      <P>If it is going to involve somebody in cost, then the question of the cost is of very great relevance indeed.  It may prove to be beyond the resources of the community to retain everyone of these old buildings which, either individually, or as a group, is of architectural merit, merely as show pieces&mdash;as museum pieces, if you like&mdash;and as reminders of days that are gone.  If a practical and economical use cannot be found for them, then we may have to face up to the fact that the number which can really be effectively preserved will have to be comparatively small and, regrettable though it may be, we will have to accept as a fact that eventually it may be possible to visualise old Dublin only through such means as paintings and photographs.  I appreciate the feeling of satisfaction Senator Sheehy Skeffington experiences in being able to walk about what is in effect 17th century Paris&mdash; which has been preserved&mdash;and I should like to think we could enable him&mdash;during the periods he spends in this city&mdash;to experience the same satisfaction of walking about 18th century Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am aware of the difficulty involved in securing from our community the necessary resources to provide reasonable living accommodation for families living in overcrowded conditions, and to provide the essential modern amenities of piped water and sewerage in rural areas.  I appreciate that the Senators sponsoring <Col N="463" /> this Bill will brand me as a Philistine for saying so, but the fact is, that faced with the choice of ensuring that Senator Sheehy Skeffington can continue to visualise 18th century Dublin as he walks around the city, or providing houses and amenities for the 20th century inhabitants of the country, I feel I must choose the latter, if that is the choice that has to be made.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief, and I hope there will not be as many interruptions as there were before we adjourned.  As I see it, we had an Act of the Oireachtas in 1929, which provided for a Board only.  Subsequently, in 1942, there was a debate in the Seanad initiated by Senator Sir John Keane who was supported by many Members, at least as far as their speeches could be interpreted.  It is interesting to note that there are three Members here in the House now of the 60 who were Members of the Oireachtas at that time.  You are one, a Chathaoirleach; I am another, and Miss Pearse was here also.  There are three of us left, three of those who were in 1942 Members of Seanad Éireann. When they came to vote on the motion proposed by Senator Sir John Keane&mdash; there is no necessity to read it; it sought to censure the Board for what they had done in the years that had passed&mdash;the Seanad in its wisdom on that occasion, by a vote of 34 to 2 rejected it.  There were two supporters for the motion, the Senator and Senator Johnson of Trinity College. These were the two supporters, the two tellers and 34 Members of the Oireachtas voted against them.</P>

      <P>The substance of my address to Senators here today is that the things that were required then are required today.  I am unquestionably in favour of the Act now because the Act of 1946 amended the previous situation to the extent that it provided an Appeal Board.  I understand that clergy as well as ordinary public representatives were on that appeal board.  That is a splendid arrangement for any country like Ireland and I repeat what I said on that occasion, that I believe our standards are higher and we should maintain them.  I do not give a hoot what people outside say.  Senators may say that we are a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.  We are not and will not be, please God.  That is the history as far as I understand it up to the present.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us does not alter the situation one iota as far as I am concerned. I have read only one of these books in detail for the specific purpose of seeing whether, as people had said, there were only two lines in it that were immoral.  The whole book was immoral, and if it is allowed to be published again, I will regard it as my duty to bring it to the attention of the Appeal Board or whatever machinery exists in the new circumstances.  I would oppose the release of that from censorship and allow free circulation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the substance of what I was trying to say when I was forced to deal with something extraneous, and which was out of order, I thought.  I was surprised, and I congratulated Senator O'Quigley on the figures he gave which showed how few appeals there have been to the Appeal Board against decisions of the Censorship Board.  They were extraordinarily few. The argument is that authors and publishers of these banned books utilise this for publicity.  I cannot help it if they do so.  I maintain that we as a nation should not agree to any alteration <Col N="466" /> or any lowering of our standards in relation to the literature that is made available to young and old, to university graduates or any others.</P>
    <P>One thing I did not refer to is my wish to see an opportunity afforded to young people of education in the facts of life.  I think there are lectures in the social science curriculum in the universities covering anatomy, physiology and possibly pathology.  I should like the people growing up to have a knowledge of the dangers consequent on immoral actions, even to the extent of appreciating the danger of contracting venereal disease.  Some people say we are dealing with sex only and that there are six other deadly sins as well.  I think the three remaining Members of the 1942 Seanad will be adamant in their endeavours to maintain the standards they helped to maintain in 1942.  While I am in this House, or on earth for that matter, I shall insist that we in Seanad Éireann will exercise proper supervision, through the Censorship Board, whether there be an Appeal Board or not, so that there will not be indiscriminate circulation of undesirable literature. In that view I am adamant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become fairly evident, in this House and elsewhere, that the general concensus of opinion among those responsible for the supervision of literature circulated in this <Col N="467" /> country is that, if possible, censorship would be implemented as little as possible, that the reading public would have sufficient enlightened and informed views that we in the Legislature would not have to impose restrictions and directions in relation to their reading tastes.</P>
      <P>One of the most urgent things we should undertake in regard to directing enlightened and proper reading tastes is guidance at the basic stage in our secondary schools.  Now that post-primary education will be and should be available in a short time to all the children who wish to avail of it, one hopes that many children who in the past never had an opportunity of, one might say, broadening their point of view, of becoming aware of the good and beautiful in life, will be reading matter which would never affect them in their normal experience.  Many students will have that opportunity and I hope that our secondary schools will henceforth pay special attention to developing proper reading tastes and offer the facilities of good libraries to all their students.</P>
      <P>It may be evident from contributions made here and in the other House that those Senators who may have, one might say, expressed rather enlightened views, have had the benefit in their own domestic environment or school training days of such enlightenment and positive recreation but there are many, and I include myself among them, who in their early education, at least, did not have this opportunity largely because apparently secondary education up to now has been regarded as a means towards equipping one for a job as soon as possible after the leaving certificate, or due to economic circumstances.  In many cases students had not the time or the facilities for broadening their attitude and outlook and it is unfortunately true that many of our secondary school pupils and, indeed, many of our university graduates confine themselves to the subjects in which they specialise&mdash;I do not include Trinity College in this&mdash;and thus may not develop the enlightened attitude to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every secondary school should <Col N="468" /> make a very determined effort to provide, as an essential facility, a proper and well-equipped library under reasonable direction.  As well, the Department of Education should offer every financial inducement towards the establishment of such libraries because many of the people leaving school have not any acquired taste and it is such people who are most endangered by the filth, the trash, the unworthy literature available to them through various channels.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is to be hoped that our schools will, by providing guidance for pupils, in future obviate the necessity of restricting the general reading tastes.  Having said that, I wish to point out that during the debate it was suggested that we here, for all that, have no function to legislate, as it was said, for virtue and morality, that because these things are almost impossible, therefore, they should not and do not concern us, that we are imposing virtue on the people.  Of course, this is perfectly true but I think we can at least encourage standards.  I feel it should be said here that although we do not, with our human failings, pretend to be men of great and absolute integrity, possibly we may not always be as bad as some enlightened views would take us to be, at the same time we should make it perfectly clear that as Members of the Oireachtas we are very much concerned with the morality and even, let it be said, with the virtue of our people.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with and commend the Bill.  It does show at least that we have the confidence as a people of now reading and allowing to be read, books that apparently in the early stages of our national development we felt our nation was not ready for.  It is obviously a positive sign of advancement that one can trust the intellectual integrity of our people but we must not let it seem that we do not appear to be concerned with morality.  We are concerned with morality in every piece of legislation which comes before this House.  Although we are offering ourselves as standard bearers, it should be made perfectly evident that <Col N="469" /> we will always have regard to the standards of decency which prevail in any sphere.</P>
    <P>The debate here and elsewhere has got quite a lot of publicity&mdash;I think, in fact, has caused a positive rethinking around the country&mdash;but I should like to think that there should be an appreciation of the fact that until such time as we have developed a sufficiently discerning reading public, at least among those people who have not been so properly trained, through no fault of their own, as to be aware of it there are certain types of books that even after the 12 year period has elapsed, could well be re-banned under the particular section. Beyond that, I think what could reasonably be said about it has been said but I should like finally to add this.</P>
    <P>We are a Christian nation and even though we are a Christian nation there may be those among us who may not adhere to any Christian faith and they may be more enlightened in their adherence than we are.  At the same time, we should remember that there have been many civilisations before ours.  Many a pagan civilisation, such as the Roman civilisation, who showed little or no regard for standards of decency of any kind, had censorship.  Even they would have had their guardian of public morality.  Are we now to decide that this State does not require this?  It would be a very retrograde step if we were to do that.  We hope that the provisions of this Bill will be implemented as infrequently as possible.  As I said, my main concern is that our secondary schools would offer this enlightenment to their pupils, and when that is so, we will not be so concerned with the type of literature that would now endanger and poison their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very constructive debate here in the Seanad as we had in the Dáil on this matter. Indeed, it has tended to widen out into a full debate on the whole question of censorship, which is beyond <Col N="470" /> what I intended in the Bill as is apparent from its Long Title.  I would not agree with Senator Ó Donnabháin that the Bill makes an insignificant change in the censorship code.  The changes are significant enough but do not affect the basic principle which is incorporated in the Acts of 1929 and 1946.  The general consensus, with the one exception of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, in both the Seanad and the Dáil, is that some form of censorship is necessary in any community.</P>
      <P>Laws should not enforce morality. Laws should seek only to enforce the very minimum standard of morality that is necessary for the common good of the community.  Every community in the world, whether it is democratic or totalitarian, operates censorship in one form or another.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald raised a very important point which concerns the method of censorship, that is, whether we should have a system of censorship through a board or whether we should have it as in Britain, through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which I considered very closely when studying our censorship system.  I went into it in some detail and I came down&mdash;the Government agreed with me on this&mdash;against a system on the lines of the British system.  There are certain very practical reasons for this.  First of all, provided the board is a reasonable board, it can operate more effectively in coming to a decision as to whether or not a book is indecent or obscene than a court, for this reason, that you get from such a board a consistent interpretation of the Censorship Acts, of what is or is not indecent or obscene, so that if one is involved in the book-selling business, as a writer, a publisher or an editor, one knows fairly precisely what to expect.  There is a consistent interpretation and a consistent application of standards from a board.  One cannot expect to get this from the courts, because, naturally enough, district justices, being human, magistrates in Britain being human and juries being human, variations in interpretation between one court and another are only <Col N="471" /> to be expected.  Informed commentators in Britain are beginning to look at our system.  In Australia there have been changes to a system akin to ours, largely because of the reasons I have mentioned.  It has been the experience in Britain that there have been tremendously varying interpretations and attitudes on the part of prosecutors, of magistrates and of juries.  These variations would manifest themselves here also if the control on books were left to the courts and, to take the concrete situation, Garda Superintendents would have a very invidious task and would be subject to all kinds of pressures.  I could see tremendous difficulties in our circumstances, but generally and in principle, I think it is much better to have a uniform interpretation by a board that adopts certain standards that everybody directly involved recognises.</P>
    <P>I know that ideally control should operate through the courts, but I feel that, having regard to the delicate and sensitive nature of this matter, on balance our system is better.  But, again, this is a point that is open to argument and discussion, and I am glad that Senator FitzGerald raised it, because it is an aspect of the matter which I did consider closely.</P>
    <P>Our system did incur a certain amount of odium over the years.  It has to be acknowledged that a number of the decisions made in the 1930s and the 1940s were, to say the least of it, unfortunate.  We are seeking to rectify that position in the Bill, and the Bill is a significant contribution in this respect.  Indeed, one of the main sufferers under the system operated in the 1930s and in the 1940s was Mr. Seán O'Faoláin, the distinguished Irish writer, who is on record on several occasions over the past few years as advocating what we have in this Bill as about the right thing to be done to make our censorship system more sensible.  He did not go any further.  He has delivered radio and other lectures on this matter over the past few years, but he has not advocated any further reform of our censorship <Col N="472" /> code than what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that a prohibition order made in a particular age could last for ever is blatantly indefensible and that is what we are changing in this Bill. We recognise that while basic morality will always remain the same, community standards and attitudes tend to change.  Every one of us here is well aware of that, so that it is not necessary for me to elaborate on it.  It is a commonsense proposition, and the only question seems really to be what is the period of years one should allow for this sort of evolution.  I took the cautious figure of 20 years and allowed myself to be persuaded that 12 years might be a more appropriate period. I feel that what our people are rightly concerned about is to keep out really obscene and indecent matter, and I, as Minister for Justice, have a function to ensure that such matter is not allowed in.  I feel that people that share that point of view, and that is the preponderant majority, should be fully satisfied by section 3, which allows the board to make a further prohibition order in respect of any book.  Of course, this re-banning process can continue.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the present board.  Since Judge Conroy of the Circuit Court became chairman in 1957 a very sensible attitude has been evidenced and the other members of the board are equally to be commended. Some Members of the Seanad have mentioned the fact that the board in recent years showed much commonsense. From my position, being closer to the operations of the board, I can fully endorse that point of view.  The whole approach has been one of commonsense and betokens an appreciation of the fact that changes in attitudes and in standards do take place in the community.  The fact that literary and artistic merit is a very important consideration and that the over-all impact of the book is good, the presence of some obscene or indecent material should not automatically condemn it.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention a few figures, to which I referred in my reply on the Second Stage in the Dáil.  They show the sort of pattern that has taken place.  In 1963, the figure was 442; in 1964, it was 353; in 1965, it was 288; in 1966, it was 158.  Therefore, in the three years the figure has fallen from 442 per year to 158 per year.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald also raised the point of the need for a more appropriate definition of &ldquo;indecency&rdquo;, if that is the proper word.  One has to be very careful here. He referred to the 1929 Act and the 1946 Act in this context.  I mentioned this in the Dáil also when Deputy M. J. O'Higgins raised the point.  Definitions in this context do not amount to much.  It is largely the subject matter that is involved and no matter how one gets down to define the law, no matter what the definitions are of obscenity, indecency, literary and artistic merit <i>et cetera,</i> you are dealing largely with subjective opinion. No two people will agree on what indecency or obscenity is or on the definition of &ldquo;artistic merit&rdquo;.  It all depends on the commonsense of the board appointed in a given period. This, I feel, is the all important thing and I would relegate definitions in a matter of this kind to a comparative unimportant role.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I want to refer to the fact that the cause of much of the difficulty in the past was the fact that there were people on the board who had very conservative views.  I shall not say more than that.  We have had in the past few years on the board, commonsense views.  The Government of the day should ensure that we have a board that has commonsense, a board who reflect the best of the current opinions of the day and the best of the current attitudes and views.</P>
      <P>This is fundamentally why we brought in this limitation period of 12 years: the board will be enabled every 12 years to take a further look at books and assess the current views and opinions of the community.  They will have another look at a book to decide whether it is admissible with regard to the particular views obtaining and particular attitudes and general standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents what might be called a middle course between a liberal view and a very conservative view on this matter.  The principle of censorship is right.  Our system of having a board that can give consistent judgments is good, although argument <Col N="475" /> can be made for the other system operating through the courts.  The great anomaly that existed up to now was that when a bad or obscurantist decision was made, nothing could be done about it and the author concerned was condemned for ever.  This was the main feature that brought the system into disrepute.  The fact was that if a wrong decision was made, there was inadequate machinery to review it.</P>
    <P>The second text in the Bill is also relevant.  We are eliminating the 12 months' limitation for appeal.  Up to now if an appeal were not taken within 12 months of the prohibition order, the author was left in Limbo for ever.  We have now provided that there is no time limit on the appeal.  This is important, because where a book is revised and a new surge of interest taken in it some four, five or six years after publication, the possibility of an appeal at that stage will exist.</P>
    <P>The point was made that a writer should be appointed to the Censorship Board.  I see no objection to that, provided the writer is a suitable person to be on the board.  I have no set views on it.  This applies to any body of this kind.  I do not believe in appointing representatives of sectional interests.  If a writer is a sensible person, by all means let him be on the board but I do not think that we should appoint a writer <i>per se</i>.  Whether a writer might be a suitable member of the board will depend on the merits of the person as a man rather than as a writer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>In making appointments to the board&mdash;I made two of the appointments in the past two years&mdash;I took particular care to ascertain that the people concerned were people genuinely interested in books and that they were readers in a real sense, readers of literary works who took an interest in literature generally. That sort of person should be appointed <Col N="476" /> to the board, other things being equal. That is the right sort of person to appoint, a person with an appreciation of literature generally be he a writer or a non-writer.</P>
      <P>Another point was made by Senator Ryan and other Senators.  Senator Ryan was keen on the question of giving the writer or author the right of appearing in person to make his case before the Appeal Board.  I want to say in regard to the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board that each board has the right to call the writer or author or publisher, if they wish.  The author has not the right to be heard by the board.</P>

      <P>There have been one or two instances.  I shall put a very strong argument against doing it.  This is not a court of law, which is seeking to have an author's point of view fully vindicated.  This type of board is a board representative&mdash;provided, again, it is a commonsense board&mdash;of the ordinary commonsense opinion of the day, of people with literary knowledge and appreciation, but, at the same time, as it were, a jury of readers.  They are representing the readers of the country, and are able to appreciate what a person reading the book will take in from his reading of it.  It is not necessary for the proper discharge of their function to look into the author's mind, or intentions or to ascertain what was his particular line of reasoning in a particular passage.  This is not really what is involved.  It is not a question of the author, publisher or editor being involved in a court trial, in which issues are being decided between the author and the public.  It is not quite that situation, but a situation in which both the board and the Appeal Board are representing those who might read the book.  It is the impact of what they read on them that is the real factor in their coming to a decision on whether or not such a book is suitable for circulation.  When you look at it in that way, I do not think the case for having the author, publisher or editor present is as valid as it might appear at first sight.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is incorrect in saying there is nothing of a procedure of trial about it.  The fact is that an author is publicly found guilty of pornography in the eyes of the world, and if his book is banned, he ought to have the right to present his viewpoint.  This is something about which writers feel very keenly.  There are writers, like Seán O Faoláin, who have felt very aggrieved at having their books banned, which were honestly written.</P>

It is purely a matter as to whether a particular book does or does not, in the view of a group of people reasonably representing the community at the time, come within the meaning of indecency or obscenity, having regard to the other relevant factors of the code.  If you look at it in that way, there is no question of the author himself being involved, no question of the author being indicted for pornography.  It is purely a matter for a decision of the board, representing reasonable opinion of the time, as to whether or not a book should be banned.</P>

      <P>The question of customs and excise officers acting in the matter of censorship came up for discussion.  There appears to be a certain confusion as to what exactly is the legal position.  I think Senator Stanford in particular requested this information, so I had better give the hard information on it. Any banned book can be seized, no matter how it is being imported, under section 18 of the 1946 Act.  Only books being imported otherwise than as part of the personal luggage of an incoming traveller can be seized for reference to the board.  In other words, if it is part of the personal luggage of a traveller coming in, it cannot be seized for reference to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, that is an Act for which I am not responsible.  I understand the Minister for Finance at the moment is examining the whole customs and excise code with a view to deciding what should or should not be done with it in the context of the situation today.  I should say here that the customs and excise code stretches back over 150 years and is fundamentally the same code as operates in Great Britain as well.  However, I will set out here the exact position under the 1876 Act: any book forming part of the personal luggage of a traveller may be seized under that Act.  Section 42 of the Act speaks of &ldquo;indecent books&rdquo;.  It is a very global provision in regard to <Col N="479" /> seizure.  I agree with the Seanad there. It is a good defence for a person charged with evading the customs control to prove that the book was imported otherwise than for sale or distribution.</P>

      <P>This, of course, does not mean that the book may not be seized, or that having been seized, it must be returned.  I understand this is only one of the small matters amongst many others in the customs and excise code being considered by the Minister for Finance at the moment.  But, as I have said, it is relevant to an amendment of that code, rather than to an amendment of the code with which I am engaged in the Seanad at the moment.</P>

      <P>Criticism has been made that we did not go far enough, that there could have been a more thorough examination of the code and that a more far-reaching Bill should have been introduced.  My answer to that is that (a) I believe in censorship, (b) I believe in having a board of this kind, a properly constituted board and (c) I think there were anomalies in the code which, as I said, brought it into disrepute and left it open to all this criticism particularly having regard to decisions made in the past which are still in force so that the board and the whole system incurred an odium which I think should not attach to it.  Provided the system is a sensible system and is seen to be a sensible system, provided there is a sensible board, provided there is room for review every 12 years, then I think censorship in that context does make sense and does appear to make sense.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think there was any need for a fundamental revision of the code and no need for any sweeping proposals.  My main objective in this Bill is to get a system which I think is intrinsically defensible, to make it defensible in every sense of the word by ridding it of anomalies which led but to constructive and destructive criticism. The system I think is sound but what I want to do is to make the system even sounder and, what is almost as important in this public relations age, to appear to be a commonsense system.</P>
