      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House whether it is proposed to sit tomorrow to continue the motions and when it is proposed to conclude the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one minor point here.  May I take it that there will be three replies, as it were; one on behalf of the amendment, one on behalf of the Fine Gael motion, and one on behalf of the original motion?  It might be appropriate if the replies commenced at, say, 2.30 p.m., in which case we would not run very much past 5 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Quinlan wants an hour to reply and Senator Garret FitzGerald an hour and a half, so that if Senator FitzGerald were allowed in at 2.30 p.m. and Senator Quinlan at 4 o'clock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We are quite agreeable to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of <Col N="936" /> the House tell us when it would be possible to allocate time for discussion of motion No. 6 which has been on the Order Paper a considerable time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has indicated he would be agreeable to come in within the next couple of weeks to deal with that motion.  I do not think we will have an opportunity of dealing with it next week because we will have a number of Bills with which to deal but I am hoping it may be possible to fix it for the following week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House look again at the possibility of dealing with it next week because, from the Bills we have on the Order Paper and what we are likely to get, it would appear we could do the Bills next week in a day and we could devote the second day to starting on this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, at the latest, it would be in a fortnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said he was agreeable, in principle, to take this motion within the next few weeks. I have not found out whether he will be definitely available this day fortnight, but it will be either this day fortnight or, possibly, next week; or, if not, within the next three weeks, whichever of those three Wednesdays or Thursdays is suitable for the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Report on Investment in Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Report on Investment in Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the debate last week I was briefly discussing the points of the Fine Gael motion, as placed before us.  I do not want to say a great deal more about it because it is not so much the points in this motion which, in theory or in practice, we can agree with; it is rather what is left out of the motion we object to more than what is in it. However, I should like to make one more point&mdash;that is in relation to the question of a committee, independent of the Department of Education, to deal with curricula, examinations and so on.  Senator FitzGerald pointed out the other day that such a committee is at present in being in Northern Ireland. That, of course, is correct but the situation in relation to education is very different in Northern Ireland to what it is here; in many ways much better.  But there is a very definite distinction between the various branches of education, between secondary (intermediate) schools and the grammar schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to get away from that here, with considerable success recently.  We have achieved, for example, the common intermediate certificate which can be done in both the vocational and secondary schools. Until very recently in Northern Ireland there were not even any representatives of the secondary (intermediate) schools on the Committee but only those of grammar schools and, of course, it does not deal at all with primary education.  I still adhere to the point I made the other day that the establishment at this stage of a committee of this kind to deal with primary, secondary and vocational education could lead only to delays in the work of integration which is being carried on at the moment.  Some of the other points we could agree with, in theory, at any rate.  Undoubtedly, we should have a university trained teaching force.  This would take a number <Col N="938" /> of years to achieve.  There would be no immediate benefit coming from it, but I hope it will be possible to achieve it in the future.  Number 6 states: &ldquo;That improved promotional opportunities be provided for teachers.&rdquo;  I am sure we would all agree with that.</P>
    <P>The really vital point in this motion is made in No. 3 but before I come to that I should like to say a few words about No. 2: the question of the establishment and growth of parents' committees to assist in the running of national schools.  Before I deal with that I should like to mention a point made by Senator O'Quigley in regard to national schools.  He went on at some length about the deficiencies in our national schools.  He pointed out that there were a number of national schools which had not proper amenities in the way of sanitation, electric light, heating and so on, and he suggested that there are a number of national schools which have not been properly maintained, to put it mildly. I am sorry he is not here because I do not often have occasion to say that I agree with him entirely.  I think he was entirely right.  I am sorry he did not come to the obvious conclusion about this situation.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his remarks he suddenly switched around and said he hoped the enemies of the managerial system would not take up his point. &ldquo;The enemies of the managerial system&rdquo; is a phrase that struck me as suggesting that some people were engaged in a form of Marxist conspiracy. My personal view is that the managerial system, so far as it was ever an efficient system for dealing with our primary schools, has long since ceased to be an efficient system. Speaking personally, I think there are excellent managers and that there are managers who are not good.  From the point of view of the efficient running, management and maintenance of our primary schools I do not think anyone can suggest that it is an efficient method.  I think that many of those schools would be in a far better condition, would have far better amenities, and would be better able to serve the needs of the community if some other system of management <Col N="939" /> had been devised over the years.  The Minister has quite enough on his hands without having to deal with a problem of that kind, but I hope that some day he will be able to consider this question and perhaps achieve some sort of an agreed arrangement with all concerned so that a more efficient method of dealing with our primary schools can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The establishment of parents' committees to assist in the running of national schools does not seem to me to be the answer.  It does not seem to me that this would help matters at all. We all agree that the parents should have the closest possible relations with the teachers, and in many cases they already have.  As for parents' committees assisting in the running of these schools, I do not think that is in any way the answer.  That is an example of the rather excessively theoretical approach which one finds in the Fine Gael policy document. There is a certain reliance on academic theory in it, but when it comes to practice it falls down considerably.</P>
    <P>The really important point is made in No. 3, but I think No. 3 is entirely inadequate to deal with the situation as we see it today.  The Minister's amendment which we intend to propose and support is far more effective, more practical, and more in tune with present day needs than all the rather waffling verbiage which we find in the Fine Gael policy document.  The Government intend that schools with fees of approximately £30 or less will be enabled to provide free education from next year on.  That covers not merely secondary schools but vocational schools, comprehensive schools and secondary tops as well.</P>
    <P>One obvious defect in the Fine Gael policy&mdash;and perhaps this is through inadvertence&mdash;is that vocational schools are not covered at all.  There is a mention of vocational schools but it is rather short and inadequate.  There is nothing which I can find in this document which suggests that fees in vocational schools are not to be payable.  It is the same in regard to comprehensive schools&mdash;again this may be through inadvertence.  More important still, the <Col N="940" /> secondary school provisions, to my mind, are not merely inadequate but also in certain respects very undesirable.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the provision for paying increased grants to secondary schools would enable only those with fees of £20 or less to get entirely free education as against the considerably higher figure of £30 in the Minister's proposals. Only about 43 per cent of our children would be covered by that particular section of the Fine Gael proposals.</P>
    <P>They go on and say that schools with higher fees, that cover perhaps 60 per cent of our children, should be given increased grants on condition that they reserve certain numbers, at least one-third, for children not paying fees.  The grounds for this are allegedly that they would reduce the class divisions within the secondary school system.  It seems to me&mdash;I have spoken to various people about this and they also agree with me&mdash;that the worst possible way of dealing with a matter of this kind is to have in the one school some children paying fees and others not paying fees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position in every school at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Not officially.  It is a matter for the school authorities.  In many cases they do not ask some parents to pay fees when they know they cannot pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The school authorities.  It is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new system proposed by Fine Gael a number of difficulties arise which are not at all satisfactorily dealt with in the Fine Gael proposals.  How will a school select the one-third or more who are admitted without paying fees?  I am told that the school authorities will deal with this.  Obviously they are the only people who could.  Further, we are told there will be some sort of means test.  They will have to ensure that the parents of children who are admitted free are unable to pay.  I do not know how they will divide <Col N="941" /> parents into this category.  In addition, there will presumably be some sort of academic entrance examination. There is a very widespread system of scholarships in operation at the moment.  One of the great benefits of the Minister's scheme is that scholarships are out and that the cramming that takes place at the moment need not exist any longer.</P>
      <P>One of the great blessings of the Government scheme is that there will not be any means test any longer. It seems to me that in the Fine Gael proposal there are all sorts of undesirable matters arising which need not and should not arise.  One further point is that the non-fee paying children in the environment of expensive schools would constantly find themselves in difficulties regarding matters such as clothes and all sorts of amenities which children of those schools expect and which they get their parents to provide for them.  Children admitted to those schools who are not paying fees would find themselves having to do without such things or the parents would have to try to find some way of providing them for their children. Those sort of difficulties need not and should not exist.  This would put many of the children who are introduced into those sort of schools without paying fees in a very invidious position.  It is far better to have all the children in the school in the same category. There is nothing a child dislikes more than finding himself set aside from his colleagues in the way he would be set aside under the Fine Gael system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other undesirable aspects in the Fine Gael policy.  There is the question of travelling expenses, the payment for the cost of transport.  This is, of course, not mentioned at all in the Fine Gael motion.  Perhaps they have not done so because they felt rather ashamed of the rather inadequate proposals in their policy statement.  They provide that children living more than five miles from a secondary school are to be provided with free transport, subject to a means test.  The Minister's proposal is much more sensible and much more in keeping with the actual needs.  It provides <Col N="942" /> that children living three miles or more from a school will be provided with free transport, not subject to a means test.  The difference between three miles and five miles is not a lot but it is quite a lot where children are expected to travel five miles to school and five miles back.  The main thing is that in the Minister's proposal there will not be a means test.</P>
    <P>How do you work a means test? Would you have children going to school every day and some of them with cards entitling them to free transport and others paying 6d or 1/-?  That seems to bring in all sorts of class distinctions which we all want to avoid, apart from the widespread investigation of means that would have to take place.  The Minister's proposal in this regard is far more in keeping with what is required in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the Fine Gael policy statement mentions the question of the cost of books as one of the expenses which parents have to meet and which is likely to reduce the number of children able to take advantage of post-primary education.  Yet as far as I can see there is not any provision at all made in their policy statement for paying for books.  Here, again, the Minister's proposal is much more realistic.  He provides that in about one-fourth of the cases of children taking part in post-primary education they will be provided with free books. The system of allowing the school authorities to provide books free, where they feel it is necessary, is the best way of dealing with the matter.  That is a very serious omission in the Fine Gael policy and one of the places in which I think the practical, progressive aspect of the Minister's policy is most clearly to be seen.</P>
    <P>The Government scheme will undoubtedly result in a very big increase in the number of children able to take part in post-primary education.  It is a very vital step forward in our educational system.  It has come about, not out of the blue, not as a sudden leap forward, but as a natural result of the progress which has been made over the past ten or 12 years.  There has been a steady progress in the Irish educational <Col N="943" /> system and, in particular, there has been a steady increase in the numbers engaged in secondary and vocational education in this country.  It comes also at the end of a long line of improvements in all aspects of our educational system.</P>
    <P>We tend sometimes to run down our education system.  Many things need to be improved; there is no doubt about that.  In criticising our education system we tend to forget the considerable progress that has been made in recent years, particularly in the past five, six or seven years.  It is no harm to mention some of these matters here. For example, in the case of primary education, we had a very big increase in the building of national schools.  A great many, as Senator O'Quigley points out, are still inadequate in a variety of ways but it is only fair to point out that over the past ten years the number built each year has gone up from 46 in 1957, which was fairly representative of the average rate of building at that time, to 130 last year. That is a very considerable increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the average increase since 1957?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a steady increase since 1957.  It started at 46 and there has been a steady increase of 60, 70, 80, or 90 up to last year when it was 130.  There has been a steady increase all the way up.  I am not saying it is sufficient but it is at least three times what it was, which is progress. If you want to take the number extended or reconstructed it was 120, so that 250 schools in all were dealt with last year.  The number actually constructed was 130.  It is, at any rate, three times what was done ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with that, the important step has been taken to close down many of the smaller schools.  I notice with interest in the Fine Gael policy document that they agree with this closing of schools.  They are saying that at long last Fianna Fáil are following what they have already said.  That is surprising to me remembering how in 1965 <Col N="944" /> when this policy was first announced pressure came on and we had a very well publicised debate in Dáil Éireann in which the entire Fine Gael Party set off like hounds after a fox pursuing and assailing the Minister for daring to close down those schools.  Senator Garret FitzGerald shakes his head, but the Fine Gael Front Bench as a whole took a very strong line on this.  I would, had I known the Senator would be shaking his head here, within the rules of order, have read out the debate, but it is there anyway.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil not alone got very little support from the Opposition but considerable opposition from them.  It is a little eccentric at this stage to say that Fianna Fáil are closing down these schools as Fine Gael always told them.  They are still doing what they were told not to do as far as Fine Gael are concerned.  That one step to close down these small schools will undoubtedly result in an improvement in the type of primary schools we have in rural Ireland: there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which there has been considerable improvement, although not as much as some of us would like to see.  There has been a steady improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  There are far too many large classes in primary schools and I am quite sure the Minister as well as everybody else wants to see this remedied.  In recent years there have been several improvements in the ratio of teachers to children in our primary schools.  Along with this, and enabling it to take place, there has been a considerable increase in the output of primary teachers.  In 1958 we were able to put a complete end to the recruitment of untrained teachers.  I am not bringing these matters up in order to say that all is well.  All is not well but things are to a considerable extent better than they were.</P>
    <P>The library scheme in primary schools has been established in recent years.  The House will agree that one of the most vital things in the education of any child is that books should be made available to him and that he should acquire the habit of reading for pleasure.  Many young children do <Col N="945" /> not read.  There are a great many schools still without libraries.  The last figures I saw showed, however, that more than 2,000 had been provided.  I hope it will not be too long before all our national schools have libraries for children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were libraries 40 years ago in the national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows how little the Senator knows about rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There were, at any rate, 2,000 that did not have libraries because in the past three to four years 2,000 libraries have been provided.  It should have been 4,000.</P>
      <P>We also have a scheme now for the provision of audio-visual aids in our national schools.  The Minister is interested in this and I hope it will not be too long until the great bulk of our national schools will have these aids available.</P>
      <P>There are other things such as heating and cleaning grants which have been doubled since 1957.  There are new grants for painting and the number of schools for handicapped children has been doubled.  These are not yet sufficient for handicapped children but at any rate progress is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to post-primary education, the most remarkable thing that has happened in the past few years is the increase in the number of children attending post-primary schools.  Since 1955 the number of children has almost doubled.  In 1955 there were 56,000 in secondary schools and this year there are just over 100,000.  With regard to vocational schools, the number has gone up from 20,000 to 23,000.  We sometimes forget the progress that has been made in the proportion of children who now get post-primary education in Ireland.  I was surprised, having heard so many complaints about the number of children who were leaving school at 14 without any post-primary education at all, to see in Table 1.5 in the Report Investment in Education that of children aged 15, 51.5 per cent are still at school receiving full-time education in Ireland as against 42.2 per cent in England and Wales and 39.3 per cent in Northern Ireland. <Col N="946" /> In the same table for children aged 16, there are 36.8 receiving full-time education in Ireland as against 22.4 in England and Wales and 22.7 in Northern Ireland.  These figures are not high enough and I hope that under the Minister's scheme they will be nearer 100 per cent in the years to come.</P>
    <P>We are entitled, however, to congratulate ourselves on the fact that a considerably higher proportion of children aged 15 and 16 in this country are in schools than in Northern Ireland and England.  In the field of post-primary education we also have the new grants scheme for building schools. There have been complaints that these grants are not big enough, that progress is not going ahead, and so on. The Minister gave figures in the Dáil which showed that to date applications which have been made to the Department for building costs for secondary schools amount to £13,500,000.  This is a considerable figure and it seems to show that the building of secondary schools in the coming years will be on a very large scale and it suggests also that the provision of the necessary accommodation for the additional children who will go to school under the Minister's new scheme will be going ahead fairly rapidly.  We have also had considerable improvements in our examination system with the new mathematics courses and the new intermediate course.  The new intermediate course is a very important step forward particularly in that we now have this joint intermediate examination which covers both vocational schools and secondary schools.  This, I think, is a very desirable step.  I hope it will not be long before we have this joint course right up to leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>We have also had grants for laboratories introduced in recent years as a result of which there has been a very rapid increase in the numbers taking science.  The number in science classes in the past few years has nearly doubled, from 2,400 to 4,300.  This is a fairly heavy increase and it is certainly very desirable.</P>
    <P>In the more general field of education <Col N="947" /> we have had considerably improved conditions for teachers over the past few years.  Salary rates have been improved and I am certainly very glad to see it.  It is a sign of the new atmosphere which has been increasingly brought into our educational system.</P>
    <P>We have the establishment in accordance with the recommendations of the Investment in Education report of a new educational development unit in the Department.  In regard to the teaching of languages we have the new systems based on the report of <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i> which not merely covers the Irish language but will be introduced into the teaching of all foreign languages.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reforms which have been taking place in Irish education and the fact that I mention these will not I hope be taken as a sign that I personally am satisfied that all is well with Irish education.  Obviously, all is not completely well but I think we are entitled to say that there have been very big and widespread improvements in recent years.  We have had a succession of extremely able, progressive and energetic Ministers for Education who have done a great deal to bring a new spirit into Irish education.  I feel that under the Minister's scheme which we welcome in this amendment the future will be very bright in the whole field of Irish education, particularly post-primary education.  The amendment which we will be proposing is a practical step in that it welcomes the practical measures which have been taken by the Minister and it is vastly to be preferred to the somewhat theoretical waffle&mdash;if one can use that word&mdash;which is contained in motion No. 7.</P>
    <P>We are taking practical measures which will in the next three or four years bring about a complete change in the whole picture of Irish education. I have great pleasure in recommending this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear Senator Yeats say that there is still a lot to be done in the cause of <Col N="948" /> improving education in this country, but I do not think that the motion he is proposing is as well adapted to achieve this as is the motion that he has been speaking against.</P>
      <P>I have a number of things to say on the motion on Investment in Education, and I propose to make my points on that motion rather than on the other one.  In the first place, I agree with a point Senator O'Quigley made the last day about the dates on documents such as this.  It is a small point but it is very difficult to find in this document on what exact date it was produced. There are some small printer's symbols at the end which, if you look, show you that it came out some time in the year 1966 but I cannot find anywhere else a direct statement of the date at which it was produced. This should appear prominently on all documents.</P>
      <P>This document, Investment in Education, makes two things clear.  First of all, at present our investment in education is very low compared with other civilised countries or other countries in these regions.  The second point is that there is an urgent need for us to increase that investment.  In that regard the report makes one statement which in itself is the key to the whole thing.  It says: &ldquo;the educational system in all its branches may be regarded as one of the biggest industries and certainly one of the most important in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is all that important surely like any other industry we should invest in this on the three usual levels that any industrialist would take into account; first in planning, secondly in personnel and, thirdly, in accommodation and equipment.  These, for the purpose of education, are placed in the proper order of priority I think. They are not the order in which we have made such investment as has been made up to date.  As Senator Yeats has said we have made a certain amount of investment in accommodation. A certain number of schools have been built in the last forty years though I do not think any of us would claim that this has been anything like as much as should have been made.  There has been a little investment <Col N="949" /> in personnel, a little expansion of training facilities, a little expansion in the facilities afforded for higher education of teachers but this is minimal. So far as I know, the amount of investment, actual investment, in planning is nil.  I may be wrong in that but if there is investment in planning in education it must be very minute or very carefully concealed.</P>
    <P>The report points out that we have inherited our system of education and it is a good one from various points of view.  From the point of view of the general level of social and economic development at the time when it was devised it was all right, and it was also all right and even desirable from the point of view of those responsible for the political administration of this country at the time.  It does stress much more the acquisition of factual knowledge than it does the development of a faculty of criticism and independent thought. If you are at a low level of economic development it is probably important that you should have a lot of people around with a certain level of factual knowledge and you do not need such a lot of planning and critical development at that stage.  Similarly, if you are administering a country it is sometimes even disadvantageous to have too much independent thought, particularly if that country is not an integral part of your own set-up.</P>
    <P>But these conditions no longer obtain.  We are now in 1967, in the middle of a scientific age in which there is an extensive demand by scientists and for critical ability and independent thought.  The same is true in administration.  We no longer have so much use for those people who have just a lot of facts in their minds and no idea of how to develop things independently.  We are also in charge of our own destinies, and surely at this stage and from this point of view also we should be looking for people with that kind of contribution to make.</P>
    <P>We need from both these points of view to look at our educational system and plan it anew, and consequently the section of this report <Col N="950" /> which made the greatest appeal to me personally was section 13 in which it is suggested that a development unit should be set up.  I think that this is long overdue.  I do not, however, agree with the way in which this report suggests that this development unit might operate.  It suggests that it should be a section of the Department of Education.  I believe that this unit should be independent of the Department of Education.  It should, of course, have the closest possible contact with that Department and have representatives from the Department amongst its members, and it should be able to make use of the enormous amount of information which the Department has about educational affairs in this country, but I think that it cannot function properly as a planning organisation unless it is independent of the Department.  I have the greatest possible admiration for the work of the Department of Education and indeed for the work of any Government Department with which I have been in contact, but in a sense I am an administrator myself and I know that you cannot be an administrator responsible for planning an organisation without feeling committed to a certain extent, and to that extent being rather unwilling to change the organisation.  I think that we should make fundamental changes in our system of education, and therefore, we must have these changes worked out by a body which has no kind of commitment to the existing system.</P>
    <P>In this section dealing with the question of planning there is a discussion on the kind of person who might be the head of this development unit.  This is the specification for the head of this unit according to the report.  He should have &ldquo;an independent, inquiring, critical and creative mind,&rdquo; capable of viewing the problem &ldquo;with detachment and without commitment to the <i>status quo</i>&rdquo;.  I do not think that anybody could possibly have made out a better series of attributes to be expected from somebody as head of a development unit for an educational system.  This report goes on to say that he should be an <Col N="951" /> assistant secretary in the Department of Education, that he should have that status.  It does not say whether he should be selected from amongst the existing officers of the Department or selected independently, from outside, and brought into the Department at this level.  I am not going to say which process I would prefer, but I would just say this, that the Minister when he is making this appointment should insist on the qualities which the report has laid down for this person, no matter where he finds him, and he should then put him in charge if he is satisfied about these qualities, and nothing but good could come from that.  I would make a further suggestion, though it may not be very easy to work out in practice, that it would be desirable that the appointment should be for a limited period in the first instance, perhaps three, four or five years, so that the Minister may be quite certain that he has got the right man and that he is doing the job in the way that it should be done.</P>
    <P>This development authority should not have too narrow objectives.  In this report and, indeed, in the other one to which we referred at a recent meeting of the Seanad, the report on Science and Irish Educational Development, I sense a certain amount of concern for the immediate economic objectives that we should try to reach. I do not think we should look at the problem too narrowly from that point of view.  Certainly, you cannot disentangle the means from the end.  We want to develop the country, of course, and if we do we must have educated people to do that.</P>
    <P>The greater degree of development the more we can afford to invest in education.  But when we are laying down the lines of our educational system we should think of other things than just the immediate economic objectives.  We should also look very widely for any models on which we should construct our future plans.  We tend to look to our nearest neighbours, and this is very understandable, but there are other countries in which we might also find helpful ideas from many points of view, such as certain <Col N="952" /> parts of the United States which present social conditions nearer to those in this country.  We have plenty of contacts and friends there and it should not be difficult to find out if we could use their experience to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Again, in planning an educational system an important factor is provision for research.  You cannot design a system just by sitting down in an office and trying to think out what might be the best, the most easily feasible, and so on.  You must be able to put the thing to the test at some point and to find out if, in fact, there is anything to be learned from the existing system. The new body, therefore, should be given authority to undertake research. It should have the personnel required for doing this and arrangements for processing any information that this group might obtain.  I do not think that we in this country have paid nearly enough attention in the past to the advantages to be gained from independent inquiry of that sort.  We tend to put a system into operation and let it go on and on and on, to look at it perhaps from time to time but not with any real desire to change it.</P>
    <P>I know, in other spheres, considerable benefit has accrued from having research, as it were, attached to or associated with a particular section of the country's activities.  It is 30 years ago now since the Medical Research Council was set up and I am quite certain the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Health formerly, was not unaware that his Department got some help from that council from time to time.  More recently we have an Economic Research Institute and a Medico-Social Research Board and the business of the Institute of Agriculture is also heavily concerned with research. We have no provision, as far as I know, for this in education.  Why cannot we have an Educational Research Board?  I am not very conversant with the literature on research in education in general, certainly not in this country, but I was very interested to see a book recently entitled <i>Bilingualism and Primary Education</i> by Father John <Col N="953" /> McNamara.  It is a critical and objective study of one of our most important problems in this country.  A study like that on other educational problems would be very helpful, and that sort of thing could be sponsored by an educational research board or council, by making funds available for carrying out such studies.</P>
    <P>Another development that might be envisaged in connection with this new planning for education is the need for some experimental work to be done. This could be done in association with the research development I have just mentioned.  I have said it in this House before but I do not think it would be amiss to say it again&mdash;until 10 years ago medical education in these countries was in a straitjacket. The bodies that manufactured this jacket and sewed up every seam most carefully were the General Medical Council in London and, in this country, in the last 40 years the Irish Medical Registration Council.  The number of hours each student had to spend on each subject in the medical curriculum was carefully laid down. The number of subjects to be done, of course, and the number of specialist branches to be taken care of were all laid down very carefully, so that no matter what school you went to you saw exactly the same thing going on.  It was realised about ten years ago that there were many roads to Rome and, unless you tried out more than one of them, you would never know which was the best.  Therefore, it was decided that medical schools be given some freedom to design their own methods of teaching medical students.  The result has been most encouraging; it has brought new life into medical education.  I think it has even brought new life into some medical students and teachers.  In this kind of context, the same thing should be tried in education, in general.  Of course, we would have to have close supervision by, say, the Department of Education but the results of this, from the point of view of stimulating the students and teachers, would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>The second function of a planning <Col N="954" /> authority is to look at personnel.  The personnel of the teaching set-up are, of course, the teachers and you have to look at them from the point of view of their numbers and quality.  The quality of the teachers is of equal importance to the numbers.  Some people might think it was even more important but I think they both probably go closely together; if you have too few teachers, even a good teacher cannot do his work properly.  There are not enough teachers in either primary or secondary education in this country.  In this report we find that the average number of pupils to a teacher in primary schools is 45; 45 pupils to one teacher.  Senator Yeats deplored the existence of large classes.  He suggested, somehow, there were not many large classes but an average of 45 suggests there are a great many large classes.  There may be some smaller than 45; if there are, there must be others larger than 45 and I certainly know there are classes of 50 and more in primary schools. That is bad enough but it is worse when we know that the largest classes are those in the smallest and the youngest sections of the schools.  In these sections it is not uncommon for two or three years to be put together in one class, so you might have 60 or more students in a class.  It is just at this point of a child's development he or she needs a certain amount of individual attention and he cannot have it if he is one member of a class of 50 or 60.  I sometimes pass a national school and hear the sound of children of seven, eight, or nine reciting the addition or multiplication tables in unison.  It is one of the most depressing sounds I know; this mass learning of facts and we cannot avoid it unless we have more teachers.</P>
    <P>We want also more teachers in the secondary schools.  The problem is slightly different there because what we need in that respect are teachers of specialist subjects, particularly mathematics and science.  We probably can get teachers of ordinary subjects at a pass level, provided you are prepared to pay them a reasonable salary but teachers of specialist subjects are <Col N="955" /> very difficult to get and this is true in other spheres in this country's activities.  When this situation arises, you usually look to some sort of pool where, perhaps, a teacher for a particular subject might be recruited at a particular time.  We do not need a lot of specialist teachers; it would not pay us to set about producing, for this purpose, say, a number of teachers of mathematics or a number of teachers for honours science classes, but the position is made difficult because we have no pool from which we can draw for our occasional needs.  I am convinced there is a pool we could use if our arrangements permitted us and that is the pool of specialist teachers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is not a large pool and I do not say that if we were able to make use of it, our problems would be solved overnight but there are teachers I know both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland who would be good in our mathematics and science classes if we could entice them back.  Not only can we not entice them back; we are actively preventing them from coming back, because our conditions here are such that they cannot get their full incremental salary until they have been back here for one or two years.  This is a point I and many other Senators have made in other connections before but, from the point of view of developing our educational system here and trying to entice back our specialist teachers from other places, some solution of this basic difficulty is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>The other thing which makes it difficult to improve our secondary educational system is the conditions for the Higher Diploma in Education. At present that is a part-time diploma. I do not know what happens in other places but in Trinity College nearly all of the instruction for this diploma is given between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the afternoon.  It has to be like that because the people who are taking this course also have posts in schools.  They have no means of sustaining themselves while they take the <Col N="956" /> course unless they have a job.  Therefore, they must get a job, and they must get it in a school close to Dublin to enable them to come in for these classes.</P>
    <P>I do not think it often happens, but it sometimes does, that schools take advantage of this.  Here are teachers who must take a job in such and such a school because otherwise they could not attend the diploma classes.  Therefore, they take these jobs at a much lower salary than the ordinary market value for such a person.  That is one of the undesirable effects of this system.  The other undesirable effect is that the teachers doing these diploma classes and the professors of education who organise them have no freedom in which to operate.  If they were full-time courses each teacher could be given a much more worthy course and a better preparation for the task of teaching as a career.</P>
    <P>We come now to the training of primary teachers.  I have dealt with the number of primary teachers.  We have too few, but I am quite certain we could have more if we were prepared to make more established posts available.  This would cost a certain amount, but if more posts were created we could fill them.  Apart from the number of primary teachers, I should like to say a word about the method of training primary teachers. At the moment they are trained in teachers' training colleges.  This report gives some indication of the way in which these colleges work.  It is fundamentally wrong, in my view, to segregate this particular group from people preparing for other careers at that period of their training.  I do not think it happens in any other section of the lay community.  That is why I find it difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>I believe the training of primary teachers, as is the training of people for other professions, should be based on the university.  I believe there should be a broad training in the university for people who are preparing to become primary teachers to give them the necessary breadth of outlook, the necessary contact with the economic and sociological problems with which <Col N="957" /> they will be intimately concerned in their capacity as trainers of those who will run the country in the future.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is true that primary trainee teachers have got some opportunity for a university affiliation. In the case of the National University of Ireland any student who has passed the final examination of his training college can be excused, I understand, the First Arts examination of the university.  I understand from this report that about 25 per cent of those starting off as teachers take advantage of this facility, but I do not know how many complete the BA course. In the case of the Church of Ireland Training College in Kildare Street students can take certain courses in Trinity College during their period in the training college, and they get certain concessions in the Arts course by virtue of having taken courses in the college.  I understand that about 30 or 40 per cent of teachers who have had this concession then proceed to take the BA of the University of Dublin. But here again there are great difficulties. They could do this more easily if they were in a school near Dublin from which they could attend the courses in Trinity College.</P>
    <P>This again makes for undesirable separation amongst the primary teachers of the country.  It gives those who get posts near Dublin a better opportunity than those who have posts further away.  Therefore, it tends to bring the more ambitious and the more able into schools near Dublin, leaving schools further away, where the better ones are probably needed more, to be taken care of by those who are less ambitious and possibly even less able. However, it has to be like that because these teachers have to live.  They are under an obligation to begin their teaching immediately they are qualified. They cannot get paid until they begin to teach, and if they are to carry on a university course they must try to make proper arrangements to be as close as possible to the university.</P>
    <P>The present arrangement is unfortunate from that point of view.  This gives us two classes of teacher.  There is the secondary teacher who has <Col N="958" /> been trained in the university and the primary teacher who has been trained in a separate institution.  One has had all of the advantages of the university education: mixing with people in the other faculties and all the other advantages which are usually claimed. The other has had none of those advantages except in a very, very marginal sense.  The new development authority should take this point into account at the earliest opportunity and try to devise some means whereby all the teachers would be given the same kind of training and the same kind of stimulus to bring out the best in their pupils, and to enable them to make the best possible contribution to the life of the country.</P>

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht spéisiúil thábhachtach againn.  Breis agus dhá mhíle bliain ó shoin bhí meas ag na Ceiltigh ar an oideachas. Bhí scoileanna ársa acu agus léinn agus scríobhnóireacht iontu.  Bhí feiseanna móra acu agus comortaisí léinn. Bhí ard-chlú ar na draoithe agus ar lucht leighis.</P>
      <P>Lean an scéal amhlaidh nuair a tháinig an Chríostaíocht agus bhí ainm na hÉireann in airde maidir le léinn agus foghlaim ar fuaid Mór-Roinn na hEorpa.  D'imigh na manaigh go hAlbain, go Sasana agus go dtí an Mór-Roinn agus bhunaigh siad coláistí agus scoileanna sna meánaoiseanna. Fiú amháin sa lá atá inniu ann tá siad le fáil in Ameiriceá, san Astráil, san Afraic agus san Áis féin.</P>
      <P>Ní híonadh mar sin go bhfuil suim ar leith ag Éireannaigh i gcúrsaí oideachais. Cuireann siad fáilte roimh phlean nua seo an Rialtais mar tá a fhios acu go dtugann sé seans do gach duine go bhfuil dúil sa léinn aige oideachas a fháil ní hamháin sna bun-scoileanna ach sna hárd-scoileanna agus na hiolscoileanna chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Cuirfear fáilte fé leith roimh an bplean seo i gContae an Chabháin áit nach raibh ach cúpla meán-scoil go dtí le déanaí.  Ní hamháin gur rud fónta é don chontae sin ach don tír ar fad mar beidh deis ag an ngnáthdhuine úsáid a bhaint as an gcóras oideachais ar gach céim anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Maidir leis na bun-scoileanna sílim gur plean maith atá beartaithe.  Ba cheart gach deis a chur ar fáil do na daoine sna scoileanna seo&mdash;tithe maithe chun teagaisc iontu, seomraí compórdúla, léirscáileanna, pictiúirí reatha, gléasanna teilfíse chun cabhrú leo.  Siad na scoileanna seo bunchloch an oideachais agus sna blianta atá imithe, agus anois féin, tá sár-obair á déanamh acu.  Ba chóir go mbeadh na páistí sásta agus compórdúil chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh.  Rinne an Rialtas a lán le deich mbliain anuas. Thóg siad a lán, lán scoileanna&mdash;46 sa mbliain 1956.  Mhéadaigh an líon gach bliain go dtí gur tógadh 130 sa mbliain 1966.  Chomh maith leis sin, do chuireadar feabhas ar a lán eile acu agus do dheisíodar roint mhaith eile.  Tá siad chun dul ar aghaidh leis an obair sin go dtí go mbeidh a ndóthain scoileanna tógtha acu.</P>
    <P>Tá mé sásta maidir leis an bplean chun scoileanna beaga a dhúnadh fosta mar is minic go raibh sé deacair oidí a fháil a d'fhanfadh i scoil bheag.  Measaim gur plean maith é ach é a láimhseáil go réidh, mall.  Fáiltím roimh an scéim iompair agus taistil freisin.  Céim eile chun cinn isea an cóimheas idir na hoidí agus na páistí i ngach rang a laghdú.</P>
    <P>Fosta, is maith an rud é go mbeidh na hoidí uilig oilte anois agus go bhfuil cead ag oide oilte a phósann fanúint ag múineadh.  Cabhraigh an tseirbhís leabharlann leis na bun-scoileanna mar do rinne na deontais nua maidir le glanadh.  Ina theannta sin, is rud maith ar fad é an deontas a cuireadh ar fáil chun na scoileanna a mhaisiú agus a phéinteáil.</P>
    <P>Nílim sásta go bhfuil gach rud ceart ach is léir go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh mór déanta le deich mbliain anuas. Measaim go mbeidh a lán múinteoirí ag teastáil agus sílim gur ceart seans a thúirt dóibh céim iolscoile a bhaint amach sna coláistí oiliúna.  Tá caighdeán sásach árd acu é sin a dhéanamh cheana féin ach chuir easpa airgid isteach orthu go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an scéim iar-oideachais, <Col N="960" /> is dul chun cinn an-mhór é.  Uaidh seo amach beidh seans ag gach duine fiú amháin má bhíonn sé bocht an cúrsa meán-theistiméireachta agus árdtheistiméireachta a dhéanamh.  Ní bheidh deifir ar bith idir na cúrsaí seo sa ghairm-scoil nó sa mheán-scoil. Bhí sé in am é sin a dhéanamh. Cuirfidh sin deireadh leis an éiri in áirde a bhí i measc na ndaoine a ghlac páirt sa chóras seo.</P>
    <P>Cabhróidh an plean taistil go mór le páistí agus le tuismitheoirí.  Tiocfaidh an plean i bhfeidhm ar an 1 Meán Fómhair, 1967.  Sin dáta deimhneach agus tá súil agam go mbeidh na scoileanna, na múinteoirí agus na páistí réidh fá na choinne.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na hiolscoileanna, taobh amuigh de chúpla scoláireacht, is iad na daoine saibhre a bhí ag freastail orthu go dtí seo.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an bplean chun an gnáth-dhuine a ligint isteach iontu.  Measaim go mbeidh na hiolscoileanna níos náisiúnta uaidh seo amach agus go mbeidh na mic-léinn bródúil as a dtír féin agus as a cultúir, idir cheol, rince agus teanga.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is debating three motions and one amendment and there has been so much material published, as someone said, about education that it is a bit difficult to know where to start on this whole subject.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the importance of education it might be no harm if we continued to remind ourselves of what we mean by education because too often in recent times the suspicion has grown in some people's minds that when we advocate more and better education we are, in effect, advocating it to make people more efficient producers. Of course, this is not the whole idea behind all the Parties' policies in regard to education.</P>
      <P>I have been struck by the explanation or definition of education in the comments on Investment in Education of the NIEC.  Those comments attached certain orders of importance to education.  They say:</P>
      <P>The first and by far the most important objective of education is the development of the individual person. The educational system is a mechanism by which one generation transmits to the next the basic elements of the ever-increasing fund of human knowledge, the common culture of the society, the social habits, customs and national attitudes on which the health and cohesion of the society depend, and its religion, morality and ethics which in a fundamental sense determine the essential quality of the society and of the people who constitute it.</P>
      <P>They go on further but their second point is that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational system can develop a receptiveness to new ideas, and a capacity to organise, assess and apply them in all schemes of human endeavour.  It can develop the capacity <Col N="962" /> to think clearly, creatively and critically, rather than the mere facility for remembering mechanically.</P>
    <P>They say the third function is:</P>
    <P>To enable the individual to realise the potential he has within himself by giving him the facts, arts, skills and attitudes that he will require to make his work productive.</P>
    <P>This is the third one but, nevertheless, it is important.  It is not the over-riding one.</P>
    <P>That is what the NIEC had to say on the functions of education.  I have been struck by a rather shorter definition in a report of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress away back in 1925.  The Labour Party tend to be a bit repetitive in regard to education and perhaps a bit boring to people.  At that time there was a report of a committee presided over by the late Mr. Tom Johnson of which Mr. Tom O'Connell who was a member of this House for a period was Vice-Chairman. Assisted, I am sure, very much by the INTO they produced a report on policy in regard to education, as I say, away back in 1925.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to what they had to say about the aim of education, and it is this: &ldquo;The aim of any national system of education should be, in our opinion, to produce men and women who are governors of themselves, whose object in life would be to become civilised Christian human beings, to be healthy, clean, alert and responsible citizens of an Irish commonwealth, who will be efficient wealth producers&mdash;not because, as the prevailing school of economics will have us believe, the production of wealth is the essential object of all human endeavour, but because the production of more wealth will increase the comfort of all the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is against that background of this definition of the function of education that I want to approach the subject of the motions and the amendment that we have before us today.  There is another point which it might be worth making, a very obvious point which <Col N="963" /> we tend to overlook, and that is the right and duty of parents to provide for the education of their children. You can say that and let it finish there, but in society as it exists at the moment it is just not possible for parents to carry out that right and duty unaided.  The community, represented by the State, has to come into it, and that is why for many years we have had free primary education and we are now increasingly talking about free secondary education.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this debate has tended to be on secondary education, and the inference may be drawn that people think that what we have done and are doing in regard to primary education has solved the problem there.  Of course, I am in complete disagreement with this.  I think that in regard to primary education we have not been doing enough.  We have the shocking position that one-third of the people depend upon primary education alone&mdash;in other words, that the only education some people have is primary education, and many of them leave primary education at the sixth year level and have not sat for or qualified for the Primary Certificate and, frankly, are unfitted to face the complications and the rigours of modern life.  I looked at this from a rather personal point of view recently. One of my youngsters was finishing primary education&mdash;no genius but no dullard either&mdash;and I was thinking that if that was the extent of the education that youngster was going to get what chance would she have in life?  She told me that, in fact, quite a few in her class in the national school were finishing at that point and not going on further.  Furthermore, there were girls who either were not sent to school very regularly or were not sitting for the Primary Certificate. The head teacher was worried about the position.  I could quite appreciate the worry of that head teacher.  There were hurried consultations trying to get those girls in to talk to them to prepare them for the adult life into which they were stepping with an educational level, in a very good <Col N="964" /> national school, quite unfitted to face the rigours and difficulties of modern life.  That is the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats referred to Table 1.5 in the Report on Investment in Education even though the committee themselves warned about the interpretations we should take from this table.  I have mixed feelings about it. My first feeling is depression at the number who have left education at the age of 13 but I have also a sense of pride when I see the comparison of people still in full-time education at the age of 16.  These figures show the comparison between Ireland, England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, if we are to confine it to English-speaking countries, if Senator Dolan does not mind my using that term.</P>
    <P>In England at the age of 13 100 per cent are still in full-time education. In Ireland already it has dropped to 94.6 per cent.  Indeed, the survey team admitted that they were puzzled by that figure and could not explain it. The figure for Northern Ireland was 94.8 and for Scotland 99.8.  Already here at the age of 13 we compared un-favourably with those other countries.</P>
    <P>The comparison at age 14 is even worse so far as we are concerned. For England and Wales it was 100 per cent, and Ireland had dropped to 66.4.  The one-third I have referred to had already gone out of full-time education.  In Northern Ireland, our nearest neighbours across the border, 92.4 per cent were still in full-time education at 14 and in Scotland 99.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>At the age of 15 England and Wales surprisingly dropped to 42.2 per cent and Ireland is now better at 51.5. Northern Ireland was 39.3 and Scotland 35.3.</P>
    <P>At 16 the picture is the same.  We have still a higher proportion in full-time education than in those other countries&mdash;England, Wales, Scotland and the Province of Northern Ireland. Part of the explanation is that the school-leaving age with us is still 14 and in those other territories it is 15 and going up.  We are told that ours <Col N="965" /> will go up in 1971 or some time in the future.  Strangely enough the Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress were talking away back in 1925 about the school-leaving age and were stressing that it should be raised to 15 years immediately and to 16 years after a period sufficient to have provision for increased school accommodation.  That was only 42 years ago.  A generation has come and gone and another generation is coming.  I wonder, when history comes to be written, what it will think of the waste and lack of effort of the generation which succeeded those who won freedom for this part of the country.  We shall have a lot to answer for.  Therefore, we have a situation that in regard to a big proportion &mdash;one-third of the children&mdash;the only full time education they get at the moment is up to primary level.  They get no further full time education, whereas, after that&mdash;when we come up to age 16&mdash;we find we have a bigger proportion in full time education than in other comparable countries.  Therefore, the principal shortcoming appears to be in regard to primary education&mdash;in other words, primary education does not go far enough, is not sufficient; the school leaving age is too low and it is at this point I think the first and the greatest emphasis should be laid.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the extraordinary comparison.  We have a greater proportion in full time education at age 16 than those other places.  Here we must acknowledge&mdash;and I do gladly&mdash; the contribution the teaching orders have made; not we as a people, not we as taxpayers, the contribution the teaching orders have made towards providing a secondary education, when the State, up to now, has failed to do so.  What secondary education I have got was from the Christian Brothers and if I left before being properly educated it was not because the Christian Brothers would not educate me because there were no fees available but, on the other side of the coin, the need to go out and earn a few bob.  It is fair to say that these teaching orders, particularly the Christian Brothers, have never turned away a <Col N="966" /> pupil who could benefit by secondary education because the fee was not available for him.  In effect, these people have been subsidising education. They are paid for their work as teachers but they plough it back into further education and the proper word is &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; by those people who devote their lives or who have a vocation for this.  But, even so&mdash;it is underlined by the report of the survey team &mdash;there is an unevenness throughout the country; certain territories or places seem to be well served in regard to secondary education while others are quite inadequately served, there are no facilities available, and the problem is how to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have wandered on to secondary education while criticising the fact that the emphasis has been placed on secondary education up to now but that may acknowledge that it is in secondary education the greatest problem lies in regard to finding a solution, or a policy for education in this country.  The Labour Party in their policy published in 1963&mdash;which came before the Fine Gael one, with respect&mdash;acknowledged again that there was this great difficulty of dealing with post-primary education.  The difficulty is that in this country a system of education has grown up because of our failure as a community, as a State, to do anything about it, except to give some degree of subsidy by capitation.</P>
    <P>How are we to deal with the question of secondary education?  I start off by saying: &ldquo;Look, there is the right or duty of all parents to educate their children&rdquo; but that is out in the modern context; it simply is not possible in modern society.  The community, as such, comes into it.  If the community comes into it, how are we to spend our resources in regard to education?  Are we to provide free education for everybody who wants it or are we to spend money&mdash;again having regard to our resources, which must be limited&mdash;on providing education for those people who will best qualify or best benefit by the education? My general approach to this is you must have the latter.  But, if we could possibly afford it, I would say: <Col N="967" />&ldquo;Look, free education according to the capacity to absorb it to everybody up to and including university&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know university education is not under discussion on this motion.  I am not bringing it into it, I am just giving my general approach to the problem that I would favour, if we could afford it, free education to everybody up to the highest level, according to the capacity of the individual to benefit by that education.  That excludes&mdash;let me underline this, because we are inclined to back away from it&mdash;people getting education simply because their parents can afford the money.  In effect, it means rationing our limited resources, spending them according to the capacity of the individual to benefit and not allowing other people into it simply because they may have the money.</P>
    <P>I think it is the Swedish system in which education is completely free up to the top level, with maintenance grants, where necessary, according to the capacity of the individual to benefit by the education.  The son of the rector or the prime minister, or anybody else cannot get university education unless he can benefit by it. It is a rationing of the resources according to the needs or according to the capacity of the individual to benefit.</P>
    <P>That would be my approach to the problem but I must recognise that in this day and age, with our capacity in economy it is hoped to develop, we simply cannot turn around overnight and say: &ldquo;Look, we shall have free education for all according to their capacity&rdquo;.  That is out.  I know the Minister is very good at handing out free medicine and free education but this brings me to a problem to which I referred in a recent debate&mdash;the absence in this Government of a social policy, of determining priorities, of determining, within the resources available to the nation, what they will do and in what order.  I criticised at that time the impression being given of Ministers battling for their own corner and the fellow with the strongest kick, as it were, coming out with <Col N="968" /> free medicine or free education, as we are led to believe is now available. This is meant to be a criticism and it is very easy to play politics with education in the sense I suppose Senator Quinlan meant.  It is very easy to get up and say: &ldquo;We believe in and we shall give free education to everybody&rdquo;. Of course, we cannot and it is ridiculous, anyway.</P>
    <P>We must devote the resources of the country in the best way possible. We simply cannot say that, because some individual would like to continue at a university, we should continue to send him and pay for him because he likes going there.  That is the type of ridiculous situation that we might end up in.  If we are putting the burden on the community of providing education, we must do it according to merit, and merit in regard to education is the capacity of the individual to benefit from spending by the community on him by way of education.</P>
    <P>I must say I find the Fine Gael motion very interesting.  I looked at the Labour Party policy in regard to these matters and I think we must agree with most of the detail in the motion.  The first part of the motion says that the primary responsibility for teaching methods should be in the hands of the professional educationists. I do not want to bore the House, but it may interest Senators to know that away back in 1925 this committee of the Labour Party and the TUC to which I referred had a proposal which quite frankly I do not understand. They suggested that we should have a council on education and that this council should be headed by a Minister who was not a member of the Executive.  I am sure the thought of that would alarm the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no explanation and I do not quite follow the reasons for this. Perhaps they were thinking along the lines that education should be taken out of strictly Party politics, that it was a matter that should not be left to the Department but should be dealt with by a Minister assisted by a council of which the Minister would be <Col N="969" /><i>ex-officio</i> the President.  They recommended that the council should consist, in respect of, say, two-thirds, of persons elected by all those engaged in the work of education in all its branches, and in respect of one-third, of nominees of the Dáil and Seanad &mdash;Senator Quinlan would love that&mdash; in such proportions as may be agreed upon.</P>
    <P>They recommended that the council should be consulted on all the major questions of educational policy and on all legislative proposals affecting education proposed by the Minister, and should have the right to initiate proposals of an administrative or legislative character for submission to the Minister.  It is quite interesting that away back in 1925 they had this idea of trying to take education out of a strictly Government Department and bring it to another level&mdash;whether higher or lower I shall not say.</P>
    <P>The second point in the motion is in regard to the establishment of parents' committees.  Of course, that is in the Labour Party policy published in 1963.  We are still awaiting something to be done about it.  I think a previous Minister for Education went so far as to say that he would encourage the setting up of parent-teacher associations.  I do not know that there has been any growth in that.  In the meantime, the Labour Party feel that parent-teacher associations should be recognised officially, should be placed on a statutory basis, should be registered and should have a consultative status concerning grants, etc.  In our present circumstances that is the only way to set up these parent-teacher associations.</P>
    <P>They should be brought into legislation and given some function under legislation.  They should be consulted and have a right to be consulted, because we shall not make very much progress on good wishes and expressions of views.  We all agree that there is need for progress and for very quick progress in regard to education. The question of parent-teacher associations may not be terribly important, but it is of sufficient importance to warrant encouragement, and the best <Col N="970" /> encouragement that could be given would be to give them a statutory function.  This would bring the parents more into association with the work of the schools, and create a better understanding of the problems faced by parents and teachers.  The parents would be treated as adults. Too often parents are regarded as children who have left school rather than as adults who have responsibilities and rights and whose voice should be heard and their views taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is on the third point of the Fine Gael motion that I find myself in difficulty.  I listened hopefully to the spokesman for Fine Gael proposing the motion, seeking elaboration, and explanation, and a real discussion on this point.  The motion says:</P>
    <P>Provision should be made by the State to enable all secondary schools to provide free education for some or all of their pupils in such a way as to minimise class divisions within the secondary school system.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator O'Quigley would spend some time on that point but instead he indicated that another spokesman for Fine Gael would go into detail on it.  I do not want to hurt Senator O'Quigley's feelings but I wonder was he as puzzled as I was by the Fine Gael explanation on this matter as set out in their booklet.  I have looked at it and I am still far from convinced that their proposal will, as they say, minimise class divisions within the secondary school system.  I think their proposal would tend to have the opposite effect, and we would then have the situation in which some schools who would opt in under their proposal would out of a sort of charity take in up to one-third of their pupils as non-paying pupils. They say quite a few things which seemed to me to be a bit contradictory. For example, in paragraph III of their policy they say:</P>
    <P>We believe that many of these schools will adopt one or other of these expedients in order to enter the scheme and for sound educational and social reasons to avoid being isolated in future as socially &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> There is an awful lot of snobbery in regard to education.  Recently I heard of a convent school in which part of the education is that the pupils have to dress for dinner.  That is true. It is one of the exclusive convent schools.  That is how they educate the children attending that school.  We turn around and we subsidise that sort of carry-on.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister will come out of this difficulty with regard to the secondary schools.  I have every sympathy with him in dealing with this problem.  The approach of most people to this problem would be that we would provide free secondary education with maintenance grants to every individual who wants to benefit from it.  That is the easiest approach to it but, quite frankly, I do not think we can as a community have that at the moment.  That is the ultimate policy which we should all like to see within the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>We have already a system of secondary education in this country which provides a measure of such education. It is uneven throughout the country but it provides a measure of secondary education.  You cannot sweep all that away and say that you are now going to build secondary schools all around the country and that every pupil who will benefit from that will have free entry into those secondary schools and that we will give them, where necessary, and the other schools, a subsidy by way of capitation grants.  Secondary education is a very thorny problem and there is no simple solution to it.</P>
    <P>As politicians, we tend to come up with crash solutions and say that we believe in free education.  It is so easy to say all those things.  Again, I am brought back to what Senator FitzGerald calls the discipline of planning when he criticises the Government for not being governed by their own discipline in this direction.  I suppose that we as a nation, if we want to progress, will have to face up to the fact that we have limited resources.  How much can we afford to spend on education <Col N="972" /> this year, next year, the year after and the year after that and how best can we utilise that money?  We should all like&mdash;and I am sure the Minister more than anyone&mdash;to be able to provide free education up to university level. In effect, the Minister cannot afford to do that, whether he knows it or not. The money simply is not there.</P>
    <P>I give the Fine Gael Party credit for giving a lot of thought to the problem of secondary education.  We already have secondary schools providing a limited amount of education, uneven, perhaps, throughout the country.  How are we going to deal with that problem? I would rather go back on the solution which the National Industrial Economic Council seem to favour&mdash; the provision of maintenance grants.  It is not simply a question of saying that you are going to pay fees for people. The real problem is to deal with children of families where, at the moment, they tend for a variety of social and economic reasons to leave school at 14 years of age, even though all of them need further education and some of them would benefit considerably as well as the community as a whole if they had some secondary education. The real problem is seeing how best we can help those people.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the NIEC approach of providing for maintenance grants, according to the circumstances of families, the distance from school, etc., might be in our limited resources the best approach to this problem at the present time.  We all agree&mdash;certainly the Labour Party agrees&mdash;that free education up to the highest level for all those who can benefit by it should be provided.  That is something very much in the future.  First of all, we have to provide the resources in this country to be able to do that.  I always take the narrow view, which would be open to criticism, of asking myself what is the problem which requires the most immediate solution in relation to the spending of our limited resources at the present time. I come back to the fact that people are in need of secondary education and the solution to that problem is what the NIEC envisages&mdash;maintenance grants for those people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The Minister has made no provision in his policy for maintenance grants. I fault him on that.  That is the greatest shortcoming in his policy.  It is not enough to say that you will provide education up to a certain limit.  The real problem is the people who are the victims of their own circumstances and who are not adequately dealt with by saying that you will pay fees up to a certain limit.  The question of maintenance should be gone into in view of what has been the underlying part of the report of the survey team regarding the uneven distribution of secondary education facilities around the country.  The provision of maintenance grants and the payment of these, where necessary, for those people is the best solution to that problem.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael at paragraph 4 in their motion say that the State should provide maintenance grants for pupils whose parents are in the lower income groups.  That is in conformity with Labour Party policy.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister when tackling the problem of our secondary educational system.  The fact that you have so many schools with different levels of fees makes it very difficult.  This will not be solved by simply saying that you will pay fees up to £25 per annum.  I am sure the Minister will intervene in this debate and I should like him to say how many schools are, in fact, opting out of his proposal in relation to free education up to the intermediate standard as from September next.  I hope I am wrong, but rumour has it that the majority of schools are not in the least interested in the Minister's proposals and that they are, in fact, opting out.  What will the Minister do in the circumstances?  Does he think that this is the full solution to this problem?  Will the schools who are opting out still get capitation grants? They would then be subsidised if they opted out.  This is not an ideal solution. It is what the Minister proposes to do.  I should like to know how many schools will in fact co-operate and come into the system and how many pupils will be placed.  In fact, the most important fact is how many will opt <Col N="974" /> out and what will happen to these schools.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us in his reply something about the comprehensive schools.  Rumour has it that the fourth comprehensive school built will be the end of it; that these comprehensive schools which we hear a lot about and which seem to go some way towards a solution of the post-primary education problem are now washed out.  I should like the Minister to say whether other comprehensive schools will be built around the country.  They should and will go some way towards solving the problem of primary education. The State must take the initiative in this matter now.  There is nothing to prevent the State from doing this in 1967.  In the light of the attitude of the Churches now towards building schools and providing primary education, I should like clarification or information in regard to the comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not think I am trying to make trouble about this.  That is not my intention.  I have heard rumours to the effect that we have heard the last of the comprehensive schools.  I would be happy if the Minister could tell me whether I am wrong in this.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to come to arises out of the Minister's proposals for September next.  What the Minister intends to provide is long sought for. I could go back again 42 years ago, to 1925, and talk about the policy called for by the Labour Party in regard to free transport, heating of schools, meals, medical examinations and free books.  In talking about this the Minister finally has said that he will be providing a measure of free transport as from September next.  I understand that the Minister intends pupils up to ten years will have free transport from within two miles of their school and those between ten and 14 will have free transport three to ten miles from their school.  I do not like the differentiation in mileage. If a boy lives a mile or some furlongs <Col N="975" /> from school he gets no free transport. This reminds me of the old system in relation to the traveller.  The problems which the Minister will create revolve around whether these children are travellers or not.  The money will not be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Many children will be involved in this.  Again, I want to take a step back and look at it in another context.  I welcome it.  I underline that and make it clear in case there might be twisting of my words later.  At present many children go to school by the community or public transport system.  The fares they are charged are less than one-half the standard fares.  They are cheap but, nevertheless, they provide a source of income to the public transport organisation.  The revenue, I believe, is about £150,000 per annum.  The number of children travelling by free transport to school will be increased because of the arrangements made by the Minister. That will be affected by the reduction in the number of one and two teacher schools and will again be affected by the lifting of the school leaving age in 1971.  So we are talking not simply about the 20,000 pupils whom CIE estimate they carry every school day but about a far bigger number.</P>
    <P>The CIE services, and they acknowledge this, are not geared to deal with schoolchildren.  They form part of the service which CIE is by statute obliged to provide throughout the country.  They try to fit the service into the needs of the schoolchildren but they are not sufficiently geared to provide for schoolchildren.  I know that in Northern Ireland the public-owned transport organisation, in large measure, provides the service adequately. When they got free transport for schoolchildren, it was possible to gear the services to provide for them and to give a reasonable service.</P>
    <P>I am going back to the rather major point of the side effects of what is being proposed here.  I am informed, and CIE have informed their employees' unions, that the result of the <Col N="976" /> Minister's policy will probably mean that about 700 new mini-buses will go on the roads.  They will work in connection with the school service for about 15 or 16 hours per week.  This will mean that the public transport organisation will lose the present revenue they get from pupils travelling by the bus services.  That is the least important part of the problem.  It is, of course, a fair amount of money but what is worrying the unions and worrying CIE is that once you put these 700 new operators on the roads with mini-buses, they will not be content to work 15 hours per week on school services.  They will go into other services, provide hire which at the moment brings in a revenue of, I think, £250,000 per annum to CIE.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that there is a big element of cross-subsidisation in public transport.  In other words, private hire is a profitable business. There are services which can be used to subsidise other services which seldom or never make a profit but which are operated by CIE under statute to provide a transport service throughout the country.  The fear is naturally expressed that with all these other mini-buses going into operation the revenue of the public transport organisation will be affected.  My point is, and I must acknowledge I have an interest in it, that this will affect the employment of people at present in reasonably good employment in CIE.</P>
    <P>The provincial bus services at present number about 500 and they are reasonably economical and profitable. Of course, no big money is made out of them.  In fact, some services lose; others make a marginal profit but, overall, with the profits of private hire the provincial bus service keeps its head over the water.  The workers are concerned about having 700 new mini-buses going in for the school services. They will be provided by small time operators who will not be bound by the maintenance of trade union rates of pay and conditions of service.  These will enter into the business of private hire and the position of CIE will be made quite impossible.  It will affect the provincial services very drastically. <Col N="977" /> CIE are using those words in a considered way.  It will have a drastic effect on the finances of the provincial bus services leading to a curtailment of service around the country and a loss of employment.</P>
    <P>I have a vested interest in this.  I have a vested interest in the employment of people who, at present, have reasonably good employment with trade union rates of pay and conditions of service but I want to appeal to the House on a different level.  Here we have a public transport organisation which the community owns and to which we give £1 million per annum in order to operate the service for the benefit of the community.  It operates profitable and unprofitable routes.  It has an obligation under statute to do these things and we expect it to do them.  We expect it to maintain certain standards of service, etc. and Parliament also&mdash;do not forget this&mdash;ensures that it must maintain reasonable conditions for its employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister now proposes to spend about £1 million on free transport for pupils.  What we, in the Labour Party, are saying is that this could best be done by entering into a contract with CIE to provide a service around the country.  Already CIE have a nationwide organisation of service; they can provide for the maintenance of the buses.  They know the business of transport.  They build their own buses in large measure.  In that way they provide employment.  They know about safety requirements.  They have a management organisation throughout the country.  We, in the Labour Party, believe that it would be best dealt with by giving this business, this work, to CIE and putting the obligation on the community-owned service rather than creating what will be eventual chaos in the road passenger organisation in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, very naturally, looks at the problem from his own point of view.  He is concerned with education. He has said he is going to provide free transport.  I believe he has also decided to hand over that responsibility to each County Vocational Education Committee.  These committees will <Col N="978" /> have the responsibility of fixing school bus routes and standards of performance of the operators.  They will have the responsibility of the acceptance of tenders and the supervision of the services provided.  How that will add to the costs of the County Vocational Education Committees I do not know, but from previous experience of this sort of thing, you will have transport managers and directors organising themselves in all these counties and I suggest, apart from my vested interest, that this will be a wasteful way of going about business.</P>
    <P>If we are to spend £1 million on free transport for pupils and this is going to have a side effect of disastrous results for the community-owned service the possibility is there that we will have to turn around and increase the subsidy to CIE because of the loss incurred.  That seems to me to be a bad way of doing business.  I acknowledge that the Minister has his own responsibility.  He is not responsible for transport and power.  He is not responsible for finance, even though he may be responsible to Finance.  I suggest that a problem such as this is not simply a problem for the Department of Education.  It should be considered by the other Ministries involved, Transport and Power and Finance.  Indeed, I wonder whether it would be appropriate for consideration by the National Industrial Economic Council.  In other words, it is the use of resources which are limited and we would all desire that those limited resources should be used to give the best results to the community as a whole.  If we use resources which will cost us money and create other problems in their wake when there is an alternative, I think we are doing something which is wrong and not in the best interests of all of us for the development of the economy.  I wonder are we ever going to realise that we, as well as any country, have limited resources.  It is a question of using those to the best advantage so that they benefit the people as a whole.  You cannot, simply because it is good politics, lash out money on this or that and pay for it <Col N="979" /> later to the detriment of the economy and social progress of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Somebody said that if you do not speak for three hours on education you are a sissy.  I cannot speak for three hours on education.  I must confess there are so many papers and documents that I get quite lost in the whole matter but those were my general views on it.  I hope they will be helpful and that the Minister will have an opportunity of dealing with the questions I asked him, namely (a) in regard to the number of schools and the pupil places involved in those schools who are going to opt into the proposed scheme, (b) as to what is happening or going to happen in regard to the comprehensive schools and (c) whether he would take another look and go further back and have consultation with the other Departments involved in regard to the problem of school transport and the side effects it might have to the detriment of the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>In discussing the motion we have on the Order Paper we are dealing with educational policy as a whole.  It is inevitable, therefore, that we should tend to range over quite a field because if we wish to determine what our views are in regard to educational policy we must be clear, first of all, as to what are the fundamental objectives of our educational policy.  Having decided that, we must endeavour to reach agreement or, at the very least, achieve clarity in regard to the general means by which we might seek to achieve these objectives. Having discussed the general means we can go on then to the question of details.</P>

    <P>There is a third factor, which Senator Murphy mentioned and in regard to which I am in complete agreement with him, namely, the vital problem of how fast can we achieve these objectives. There is very little point in saying where we want to go and leaving it at that.  We all know that however much we may desire certain fundamental objectives of educational policy we cannot do it all at once, and, <Col N="980" /> therefore, our problem is all the more difficult in that we have to choose and select and reject in order to decide which of these various things which we want to do must be done first.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is very much fundamental disagreement about objectives.  Whether we think in terms of social objectives, economic objectives, or what we might call humanist objectives, there has been a growing realisation in the past five to ten years that these objectives can be harmonised and that we can, with care, achieve the objectives in all these directions.  I think that there is general agreement in this country&mdash;there certainly has been in the House&mdash;that what we are concerned with here essentially is with the educational process in so far as it promotes the liberation of the individual human spirit and at the same time achieves objectives in regard to culture and economic policy.</P>
    <P>As regards the general means we can take to achieve these objectives, when the Fine Gael Party set out to develop a detailed policy on education they had to reach agreement as to certain fundamental principles which would be the setting of that policy.  It became clear to them very quickly that one essential thing which had been lacking in many respects in our educational pattern in the past was a sort of integrity&mdash;not a moral interity but an integrity of organisation. It was clear that there was a necessity in any new educational departure to integrate the home and the school to an extent that certainly was not there in the past and perhaps may not have been as necessary in the past as it is today.  It is from that background of the necessity to treat the school no longer as something separate from the home that many of the details of the Fine Gael policy have sprung.  It was also very clear to us early on that the role of a Department of Education in the latter half of the twentieth century is not only different from the technical point of view of how it goes about its job but should also be different in regard to its relationship to the public.  This also underlies many of the detailed proposals of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>My contribution to this debate is to <Col N="981" /> try to explain how some of our detailed proposals are related to these general principles, and also to deal with the outline of these proposals themselves, in particular to deal with those aspects that were not dealt with in detail by Senator O'Quigley when he opened the discussion on the Fine Gael motion on behalf of the Party.  What is the position in regard to this debate?  The position is that we have a motion before us nothing the report on Investment in Education.  It is very gratifying indeed to notice in the course of this debate how well the report has been noted by the Senators who have contributed to the debate.  I think that it is a measure of the contribution the report has made to the discussion on educational policy in this country how it has helped us as a House to make the discussion of this sort more realistic and far more to the point than it otherwise would have been.</P>
    <P>When this motion had been on the Order Paper for some time and when the Fine Gael policy had been published the Fine Gael Party decided to put down a second motion in regard to education, and they put down a motion on eight particular points, since reduced to six.  That motion has been severely criticised by Senator Yeats as being completely inadequate as an educational policy.  He has criticised it as being something which should be rejected because it does not say everything. I want to make it perfectly clear that it was never intended to.  The full integral Fine Gael policy in regard to education is contained in their printed policy.  What was done in the Fine Gael motion was not to put forward all the things that Fine Gael sought to do, because if we had done that there would have been not eight points but something more like 48.  In putting down this motion Fine Gael sought to isolate the points on which there seemed to be a serious difference between the Fine Gael proposals and the proposals that were made in the Dáil by the Minister for Education. What we endeavoured to do was to put down points on which we felt strongly and on which we appeared to be at variance with what the Minister intended to do.  There was no point <Col N="982" /> whatever in putting down as the subject of a motion things on which we were in agreement, and we did not do so.  From the reaction of Senator Yeats to the points we have put down it does appear as if the selection was well made.  It does appear, due to the way in which Senator Yeats reacted to the specific six points on primary and post-primary education, that the Fine Gael Party was skilful in isolating the points on which there was real difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>What I want to do is to outline the Fine Gael policy and to indicate those points on which we are in substantial agreement with the Minister, and to deal with those points on which there is a real difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of Fine Gael to the function of the Minister for Education and the Department of Education in the formulation of educational policy for the future?  This is the nub of point 1 of the Fine Gael motion.  Let it be said straight away that the Fine Gael attitude is that the ultimate authority must rest with the Minister for the future as it has in the past.  We have no reason, and it would be unreasonable, to advocate otherwise.  But that is not the end of the story.  In the past the political theory has been that a Minister formulates policy and, having formulated it, it is put into practice on his behalf, and if the public are dissatisfied they can then at a general election reject this policy and decide that this was a wrong policy and that some alternative should be tried.</P>
    <P>In the leisurely days of the early twentieth century this might have been sufficient but we believe this is not the way in which important social policy such as education should be proposed and adjudicated on in the future.  We believe the public has the right to know what advice was available to the Minister on these points of non-controversial policy.  It would, of course, be ridiculous to propose the same thing in regard to any Department of State in which there were important security aspects but we believe that when the Minister <Col N="983" /> announces what he proposes to do in regard to education, the public has the right to know, at the same time, what are the views of educational experts on this.  On such vital matters, the public has the right to know what is expert opinion and has the right to know what particular advice the Minister may have adopted or rejected. It is for that reason Fine Gael have proposed the formation of two policy committees.</P>

      <P>Before business was suspended I was referring to the practice in the past whereby the decisions of the Minister on questions of fundamental educational policy were made in private, as they should be, but on the basis of evidence which was also private, and I was suggesting that from now on, in these days of a popular electorate which is entirely literate, in these days of mass communication media, and in the atmosphere of the involvement of the public in social matters, it would be preferable that the Minister's decisions, though still made by him as the ultimate authority, and still made in private, should be made on the basis of evidence which is available to the public, so that the public can immediately evaluate the Minister's decision against a background of evidence which is publicly available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this feeling the Fine Gael Party propose in their policy on education the formation of two committees which would work independently of the Department of Education, and would report to the Minister, their reports being made public either immediately or ultimately.  In paragraphs 13 to 17 of their policy the Fine Gael Party propose the setting up of an educational planning committee. This proposal is an elaboration of the proposal contained in the previous Fine Gael document, <i>Towards a Just Society</i> in which there is a general proposal in regard to the formation of planning committees.  At that time it was suggested that there should be committees dealing with such things as agriculture <Col N="985" /> and education which would be linked with the NIEC.  The Party have since repeated this proposal both in regard to agriculture and in regard to education. I understand that in another place the Minister for Agriculture has announced that he now concurs with the formation of a Council for Agriculture linked to the NIEC.  I trust that the Minister for Education will come to agree also that an education planning committee, something like that which Senator Jessop mentioned, might also be set up.  This, as I said, is something which Fine Gael have proposed before, that the physical planning and economic planning of education should be done by such a committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy told us this evening that such a proposal was made by the Labour Party and the trade union movement in 1925.  We are very glad to hear that but we are very disappointed that the Labour Party in 1963 were not as content to follow the Labour Party of 1925.  In 1963 the Labour Party proposed that a planning committee be set up but they proposed it should be part of the Department of Education.  This was a retrograde step. I hope the Labour Party will ultimately regress to their 1925 opinion of an education planning committee completely independent of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The second proposal of Fine Gael in this regard is contained in paragraphs 18 to 25 of its policy.  It concerns a professional schools committee. This is a point on which Fine Gael feel very strongly and for that reason they have made it point (1) of the Fine Gael motion which will be decided on at the conclusion of this debate.  It is proposed here that there should be a professional committee, independent of the Department of Education, which would examine and report on such matters as examinations, curricula and teaching methods and that this body would report to the Minister for Education, who would accept or reject this advice but that the findings of this professional committee would also be available to the public.  We accept that in matters such as this the public have a right to know.  Our economic and social policies are now <Col N="986" /> so complex that it is no longer sufficient for the electorate to only have to consider such matters on political considerations alone.  We believe the public have a right to know the expert opinion in regard to such things.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we propose the setting up of this particular committee. As this matter was dealt with by Senator O'Quigley in his contribution to this debate, I do not intend to dwell on it any further.  Apparently this is not acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Senator Yeats was most critical of this particular proposal of ours.  We feel this is the best way in which the alternative proposals to the Minister's can be laid down for his benefit and for that of the general public.</P>
    <P>If we go on further with regard to the specific proposals which the Fine Gael Party have made we find that in paragraphs 36 to 44 of the document a number of points in regard to curricular reform are mentioned.  In this regard, Fine Gael have pointed out a number of things which they consider are wrong with the present curricula but they have not set down hard and fast curricular reforms which they promise to implement when in office. Fine Gael, having already decided that we should have a professional schools committee, which would be largely composed of professional educators to examine those matters, feel bound by their own opinion.  They do not put forward any hard and fast recommendations, and we have not in our motion put in any of our ideas on curricular reform.  It is not part of our motion because we believe these are matters on which decisions should be made following recommendation by a professional schools commission.</P>
    <P>Another point on which Fine Gael have a definite recommendation, and on which the Fine Gael policy committee agree, is in regard to the abolition of the primary certificate.  There seems to be general agreement in all Parties that the present operation of the primary certificate is wrong.  We have proposed in paragraph 45 of our policy that the primary certificate should be replaced by a system of records and reports.  The Minister has <Col N="987" /> indicated that while he is dissatisfied with the primary certificate he does not feel this is the best way to replace it.  He seems to be in favour of some system of house examinations.  We look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister has to say on this. This is not a point on which we feel our hands are tied.  We feel it needs more discussion and if the Minister can turn up with a more workable system, we will be ready to listen and perhaps agree.</P>
    <P>Also in regard to primary education, the Fine Gael Party have set down clearly what their policy is in regard to the question of the size of schools. No matter what may be said about what took place in any debate in the Dáil or in any discussion throughout the country, the general attitude of the Fine Gael Party on the question of one-and two-teacher schools has been clear from the beginning.  The fact that the Fine Gael Party may at times have criticised the manner in which the Minister for Education carried out this particular policy does not mean that we are flatly in opposition to the policy which he was endeavouring to carry out.  We were critical of the fact that the Minister attempted to move quickly in this regard without consultation with local interests and particularly without consultation with the parents whom we feel are vitally concerned in this matter.</P>
    <P>Criticism was largely directed to the manner of the reform and not to the essentials of the reform itself.  Our position in this policy document remains as it was before.  In regard to one-teacher schools, while there will be the special cases in which it will be necessary to maintain one-teacher schools, our policy is that in general, one-teacher schools are inadvisable and we should try to get rid of them as soon as possible.  In regard to two-teacher schools we believe that the number should be reduced but that each case should be examined on its merits.  That has been the Fine Gael attitude and remains their attitude.</P>
    <P>The controversy that has taken place is a matter of controversy about details <Col N="988" /> and about the way the problem has been handled.  A point connected with the size of schools and which was linked with this matter in the Investment in Education report was the question of the number of primary teachers required.  Here we find ourselves in conflict with the Government's attitude.  We are firmly of the opinion that more primary teachers are needed, that a substantial increase in the number of primary teachers is necessary.</P>
    <P>In the Second Programme for Economic Expansion the Government seem to reject this view.  They appear to be satisfied that there would be no great need for an increased number of primary teachers.  We believe that mere rearrangement of schools will not solve the problem of teacher shortage.  We believe a substantially increased number of primary teachers should be trained and that they will be required more and more as we advance into the 1970's.  We have no fears that teachers trained in this way will ever go to waste in our educational system. Accordingly, since there appears to be difference between our point of view and that of the Government in this regard, we have in point 5 of the Fine Gael motion indicated that we are in favour of an increased inflow of teachers to the profession.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats, speaking from the Government side of the House, indicated that the Government are against our five points and they are, apparently, against this particular point.  If so, the issue is clear between us.  We believe more primary teachers are required and, so far, there has been no indication that the Government agree with us on this particular point.</P>
    <P>A point on which a large amount of controversy has arisen relates to the running of the primary schools.  This is dealt with at some length in the Fine Gael document on education and we have put forward a number of proposals. It may be said that the present system has on the whole worked well but I think there is a growing realisation that the present system of running primary schools is becoming more and more out of harmony with the needs of the country at the present time. <Col N="989" /> Changes in the life of the people, in transportation, and in our social pattern of life throughout the country make some adaptation, at least, of the present method of administration of schools necessary and we have suggested several things in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have suggested that there should be diocesan or regional school offices rather than everything being left to an individual manager, on an individual parish basis.  Those diocesan offices would take over responsibility for the planning of sites for schools, for the maintenance and cleaning of schools and, where the manager wishes, for the supervision of the actual running of the schools.</P>
    <P>This is something on which, after examining the position, the Fine Gael policy committee on education put forward their ideas.  This is something which would have to be a matter for consultation.  Because it is something which is a matter for consultation and because it is something on which we have not reached a firm and final conclusion it is not part of the Fine Gael motion as we are tackling it here but it, nevertheless, represents a firm recommendation from us as our feeling as to the direction in which the organisation of schools is moving and should move.</P>
    <P>When we come to the point of parent-teacher committees, however, we are so convinced that this is a direction in which we must move as rapidly as possible that we have made this a part of the Fine Gael motion.  It is point 2 of the motion which will be moved tomorrow evening.  We believe that parent-teacher committees are necessary in some form.  We believe the State has a duty to encourage them. Parent-teacher committees should not be merely advisory and informal but should participate in a real sense in the running of schools.  In rejecting this, as in rejecting the other points of the Fine Gael motion, Senator Yeats repeatedly said that what Fine Gael are proposing here is not practical.  He said it was theoretical waffle.  In regard to this point I can claim experience from being a member of a parent-teacher committee in a <Col N="990" /> national school which was not merely advisory but which actually ran the school.  I was a founder member and I was a member for a number of years of the Committee of Scoil Lorcáin in Monkstown, County Dublin.  This school was set up for a particular purpose and the school was, in fact, run by an elected parents' committee.  A guarantee was given to the manager that no charge would fall on the parish funds.  That committee was extremely successful.  The participation of the parents in the whole running of the school was one of the reasons for the success of that particular school.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Senator Yeats has such a real objection to parent-teacher committee running of schools because, if my memory serves me right, Senator Yeats' wife was for many years a colleague of mine on that particular committee.  I feel that she would agree with my opinion that we had not a case of theoretical waffle but that we had in this particular regard a valuable experiment in regard to the running of a school by the parents which in every way satisfies what Fine Gael are putting forward here.  It is all right for us to say: &ldquo;Yes, we are all in favour of a move in this direction of parent-teacher associations, it is a good thing&rdquo;. I believe they are so necessary for the involvement of the parents in the school life, that the State has a positive duty to encourage them and that is why in the Fine Gael policy we not only recommend the setting up of such parent-teacher committees but we propose positive financial incentives towards not just the setting up of the committees but the active working of committees.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party propose in their document that parent-teacher committees which are set up to run schools and parent-teacher committees which raise funds for such purposes as the provision of special library facilities, special playing fields and special extra curricular activities should receive matching grants from the Department of Education.  We believe that in this way the parent-teacher movement could be very much encouraged.  We are so storngly convinced <Col N="991" /> of this that we have it down as one of the points in our motion and we stand on this point as something which is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy indicated that the Labour Party were in agreement with this particular point and I hope the Labour Party have come a little distance further than they did in their policy of 1963 in this regard because when talking of parent-teacher committees in that document the word &ldquo;advisory&rdquo; occurs far too often for my personal liking.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that the committee is statutory and that this gives it a certain standing but as long as it remains merely advisory it is certainly not doing what Fine Gael hope can be done by the formation of such committees.</P>
    <P>There are of course a number of other points in regard to primary education. I think it is well that Senator Murphy drew attention to the fact that we must not concentrate on post-primary education and give the impression that everything is all right with primary education.  The question of school buildings, the special problems of the slow learners, the question of the non-aided primary school; something must be done in all these respects and in the Fine Gael policy there are specific recommendations in these regards. Nevertheless we have not made them a special subject of debate on this occasion because we feel that these are points in which all Parties are anxious to move as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of post-primary education is dealt with in paragraphs 71 to 125 of the Fine Gael Policy on Education. There are proposals in regard to the junior cycle, from 12 to 15 and the senior cycle, from 15 on.  A few years ago Dr. Hillery, when Minister for Education, came into this House and announced as the slogan of his policy in regard to post-primary education that there should be some post-primary education for all.  This is something on which there was complete agreement at that time and there is complete agreement still but what we are concerned with in this debate is not so much agreement on the fact that <Col N="992" /> there should be post-primary education for all but on discussing such points as what type of post-primary education, to whom should it be available, at what cost should it be available and where should it be available.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the decision to raise the school-leaving age to 15 is the decision to make post-primary education available and it is quite clear that if children are to remain at school until 15 that the average child would, in effect, be receiving for his last three years in school what would correspond to post-primary education in other countries whether it is given to him in a primary school, in the secondary top of a primary school, in a secondary school, in a vocational school or a comprehensive school.  In fact, the average child's primary education will be finished by the age of 12 because the child will then be ready for what we call post-primary education.  There may be quite a long transition between our present situation and what we would all desire.  What we have to do is decide how to start that transition and what is the best form of transition to make.  If we are to keep our children in school until 15 and if we are to keep our children not merely marking time in upper standards of primary school several things are necessary.  The first thing that is necessary is increased school facilities.  The Report on Investment in Education speaks in terms of doubling the facilities in post-primary education. This, of course, can be carried out in several ways.  The first obvious way is to seek a re-allocation of the use of the present post-primary space.  We read in the <i>Irish Press</i> of January 25th that a survey in this regard has already been undertaken by the Department. We look forward to hearing from the Minister what progress has been made in this direction because this, certainly, will be one contribution towards the provision of additional facilities even though there can be no doubt that this contribution will not bridge the whole gap.</P>
    <P>Besides re-allocating the existing space it will be necessary to encourage new building and in this regard the Fine Gael policy suggests that <Col N="993" /> there be an immediate review of the present capital grant scheme where 60 per cent grants are available for new secondary school buildings.  I am quite sure the Minister has been considering this point also and we are quite sure that he intends to do something in this regard because it would be impossible to have a realistic programme for post-primary education without it.  We would be glad if the Minister could indicate whether he has yet reached a decision on this particular point.</P>
    <P>We have a minor proposal also in the Fine Gael policy that arrangements should be made whereby people give covenants for subscription towards the building of post-primary schools, and that these covenants would be free from income tax.</P>
    <P>Another direction in which these facilities can be provided is one which is already well under way.  This is the provision of comprehensive schools but like Senator Murphy I am anxious in this regard to know whether the initial momentum is being kept up and what are the Minister's intentions in regard to comprehensive schools.  Certainly this scheme should not be let die without good reason and it certainly should not be abandoned to preserve a narrow classical tradition.  I use the words &ldquo;narrow classical tradition&rdquo; in order to distinguish between a narrow tradition and a broad one, for Senator Stanford's benefit, to indicate that there is also a broad classical tradition. We should like to hear from the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>They key point in regard to post-primary education, and the one on which there has been a distinct difference of opinion, is the question of the financing of post-primary fees.  The present position is that these fees represent about 20 per cent of the cost of this schooling.  Here we have, of course, one of the usual confusions in this country between economic costs and social costs.  We have these fees which do not represent the real economic cost of the running of these schools, and these low fees are then subsidised by grants from the central Government. We have in this as in other instances failed to isolate our real costs, and it is extremely difficult to <Col N="994" /> make correct decisions about such matters until we know the real costs that are involved.  The Minister is to be heartily congratulated on his initiative in regard to this matter.  It is quite true, as has been said in this House, that it is very much more difficult for the Minister to make a proposal in this regard than it is for a Party in Opposition. While we have made this proposal because we are convinced of it, nevertheless, we do feel that the Minister is to be congratulated on his initiative in this particular regard.  The difference between us is a question of how this should be done.  It is a difference between the scheme proposed by the Minister and the scheme as proposed in the Fine Gael policy. Again, we have a real difference here, and we find in this instance that both Senator Yeats and Senator Murphy found themselves unable to agree with the Fine Gael proposal and with the Fine Gael contention that this was the best way of avoiding social divisions in our post-primary educational system.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the two proposals?  The Minister proposes that there should be grants within the range of £15 to £25 on condition that all fees are abolished.  The Minister's hope is that this would cover 75 per cent of post-primary school children, so that we would have, if the Minister's hopes were realised, 75 per cent of the pupils paying no fees and being in no-fee schools, and 25 per cent paying fees of £30 and upwards in schools in which everyone would be paying a fee, and at the same time scholarships would be abolished.  We do not like this proposal, but I want to say quite frankly that it is very difficult to draw up a proposal of this type. This question of what to do in regard to the paying of fees and the financing of post-primary education was one of the points of greatest difficulty in the drawing up of the Fine Gael proposals. There is, as Senator Murphy said, no easy, no glib, solution to this point. Certainly, we in Fine Gael put forward our proposal as the best we can think of at the moment.  We believe it is better than the Minister's proposal, and nothing we have heard has caused us to alter that view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> What do we think is wrong with the Minister's proposals?  Actually, what the Minister is proposing is to divide the schools by a hard and fast line into schools in which no student will be paying a fee and schools which will have only fee-payers and not even scholarship holders.  Such schools would be actually more exclusive on the grounds of fee paying than the English public schools system, which allows quite a proportion of scholarship holders to enter that sacred system.  We would be confining those schools completely to fee payers, and we believe that this is a most undesirable thing.  We have proposed&mdash;and we make no claim that this is a perfect system&mdash;that all the schools would be divided into three types, that in the school where the fee was less than £20 all places would be free, that in the schools where fees were between £20 and £50 we would have one-third non-fee-paying and two-thirds fee paying&mdash;those are minimum figures&mdash; and that in the cases where the fees were over £50, which occurs for only 3½ per cent of post-primary school-going pupils, there would be either of two things&mdash;the school would either opt out of the scheme and maintain its present fee system, or it would come into it, one-third non-fee-paying students would be admitted and two-thirds would pay higher fees than heretofore.</P>
    <P>As I say, we believe that the Minister's proposal is a divisive one that will cut our Irish schools and the school children within them into two sharp groups.  We believe that it will make for a division between schools in which there is no gradation and no cross over.  We believe, on the other hand, that under our system we will have in the schools in the £20 to £50 range a mixture of fee-paying and non-fee-paying students.  Senator Murphy has brought forward the point that this will not work, that we have snobs in this country who will wish to remain outside such a scheme.  I agree with him that there are snobs in this country who would wish to remain outside the scheme, but I think that the point at issue here is how many <Col N="996" /> snobs do we have in this country.  The Fine Gael proposal allows for 3½ per cent snobs.  The Minister's proposal allows for 25 per cent snobs.  Indeed, Senator Murphy thought, and he is probably correct, that it would be 30 per cent.  That is why Fine Gael are dissatisfied with the Minister's proposal. Indeed, a proposal of this type was discussed extremely thoroughly by the Fine Gael Party before they reached the conclusion that it should be rejected and some alternative should be found. It is because we are quite prepared to allow 3½ per cent or 5 per cent to exclude themselves from our secondary scheme and we would not worry about that but when we see the line drawn with 25 per cent&mdash;and this is an estimate&mdash;excluded we feel that this is too large.  We feel strongly on this point, so strongly that this is one of the points which we have isolated in our motion as containing a difference between Fine Gael and the Government in regard to education policy.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, the paying of fees is not everything.  There is the question of transport and the question of maintenance grants, but here I think that the differences are differences of detail.  On the question of three miles or five miles we are certainly not going to fall out and argue forever that one of these figures should be accepted and the other rejected.  They are close enough together for us to say that we are substantially of one mind on it.  The Minister proposes a transport system without a means test and we have indicated that there should be a means test of some type or another.  We are here up against the difficulty which Senator Murphy mentioned.  We cannot do everything at once.  In this instance Fine Gael decided that it might be as well to maintain a means test.  The Minister may very well say, as has been indicated by other Senators, that this would be extremely difficult to administer, but this I believe to be true also of the proposal of the Minister in regard to school books.  In that regard I might say that the Fine Gael proposals, though it is not explicitly contained in them, have implicit in them the question of the provision of books.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Our proposal in regard to transport and maintenance is that pupils within five to ten miles of a school should receive transport; that students more than ten miles from a school should receive boarding maintenance, and this will apply to all post-primary students.  We must remember that all post-primary students will be attending school compulsorily once the leaving age of 15 is introduced.  We have a further proposal&mdash;that students who go on to the senior cycle, beyond the age of 15, will be allowed home maintenance. Here we feel that once parents maintain children at school beyond 15, in the senior cycle, there is a very strong case for home maintenance to be applied.</P>
    <P>I have gone into those points.  It was mentioned that Senator O'Quigley, in opening for Fine Gael on this, did not deal with those in detail.  I have endeavoured to point out what Fine Gael are proposing in this regard and the reasons we are proposing them.  If anyone still wishes to explore the matter further, this can be done in the further course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in their policy on education, have not forgotten the vocational schools.  In this respect, we are in some difficulty in making firm proposals about vocational education because we are awaiting the Minister's proposals in regard to the regional colleges.  It is extremely difficult, as indeed the Minister knows only too well, to lay out a scheme for vocational education until the definite proposals in regard to the functions, the curricula and the staffing of the regional colleges are available to us.  I hope the Minister, in the course of this debate, will be able to enlighten us about the decisions he has made in regard to the regional colleges, on the basis of the steering committee which has been working on the problem in his Department for some time.  It may be said&mdash;the point was mentioned&mdash;we had made no proposals in regard to the fees of vocational schools.  Let me say straight away that this is, in a sense. inadvertent. The problem is such a small one. It seems so obvious that, having abolished fees for secondary schools, you would, at the same time, abolish <Col N="998" /> fees for vocational schools, we did not bother to put it into the policy.  We are sorry if we have misled anyone in this particular regard.  May I say we believe in the abolition of such fees and, what is more, we do not believe in raising them before abolition?</P>
    <P>Another whole area of educational policy is that in regard to teachers. This is dealt with in the Fine Gael policy in paragraphs 181 to 192.  This is a point on which, again&mdash;having surveyed the whole problem&mdash;Fine Gael have come to certain definite specific conclusions.  We believe there should be more teachers.  We believe the teaching profession should be an integrated one and we believe that university training is desirable for all our teachers.  The Government do not appear to agree in regard to any of those three points and, accordingly, we have highlighted them again as a point of difference, and put them down in the Fine Gael motion on the Order Paper.  We believe that primary teachers, in future, should be trained as follows: they should follow a three-year university course for an Arts or Science degree, in the course of which they would do some work in educational theory and practice, the equivalent of one subject per year; that primary teachers who had taken this course, should then go for fulltime residence to the training college for one year, in which they would do their further educational theory, their psychological studies <i>et cetera,</i> which would fit them as primary teachers.</P>
    <P>In regard to secondary teachers, we believe they, too, should follow a primary university degree and, along with their fellow primary teachers-to-be, should do, in the course of their primary degree, one subject per year which would be directed towards educational theory and practice.  These graduates would then do a year's fulltime course in the university, a course which would be a very distinct reform of the present Higher Diploma in Education.</P>

      <P>There are a couple of reasons why we would not do this and the first and most obvious is there would not be room.  When we are proposing this, in no sense are we trying to promote divisions between them, because our whole policy is directed towards the integration of the different branches of the profession.  Of course, again, this is a point on which we have very firm views; we are firmly of the view that all our teachers should be university trained.  In regard to the point which Senator O'Reilly has raised as to the exact manner of their teaching, I have been giving what is the general Fine Gael view on the matter but since that, again, is something which would be the subject of consultation with teacher organisations, with the authorities of the training college <i>et cetera,</i> it is a point on which we are not finally committed.  We are not committed to this beyond changing after discussion.</P>
      <P>We propose many other points in regard to teacher training.  We propose there should be summer courses for the present primary teachers so that they could, by this course, bring themselves up to the level which will be the level of the common teaching profession in the future.  We have outlined in our policy the various recommendations which would lead to greater promotional opportunity for our teachers of all types.  We propose that there should be special posts in primary schools, other than the posts of principal and vice-principal, which would allow teachers to receive a degree of promotion.  Teachers who undertook special work in regard to the running of school libraries, the running of games <i>et cetera</i> should be recognised, and we make recommendations in regard to post-primary teachers of the same type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go at any further length into the various proposals but there are one or two points I want to make before concluding.  Having made out these proposals, having reached certain conclusions about the basic way in which educational reform should be tackled.  Fine Gael then proceeded to do what is not normally done by Parties in opposition&mdash;they <Col N="1000" /> proceeded to cost those proposals.  This is discussed in paragraphs 196 to 201 of the Fine Gael policy.  It is made quite clear in paragraph 196 that this costing is intended to indicate what would be the order of magnitude of the cost of these particular proposals. This works out that if these proposals were implemented in 1967-68, the rise in current expenditure would be of the order of £2,500,000, capital expenditure £500,000, giving a total additional expenditure for the year of £3 million. It was also calculated that the following year £3,500,000 extra would be involved and from there on there would be involved an additional £1 million per year.  The remark was made in the course of this section of the report that if we look at this particular amount, it is an amount which is less than the buoyancy of the revenue of this country.  Fine Gael have been sneered at for making this particular remark but nevertheless, this is the simple truth; the position is that if this country were going in accordance with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion the buoyancy would be over £10 million per year.</P>
    <P>The position is that with our national income running over £1,000 million a year, with the State taking 25 per cent of our gross national product in taxation, and with a growth rate of four per cent per year, we would get an increased taxation income of £10 million per year.  I am relieved I got no correction from my right-hand side, and I take it that my calculation is correct.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Fine Gael proposals would cost £3 million in one year.  At a four per cent rate of expansion, which was the target of the Second Programme and which would be the target of any Government's economic programme, this would be only 30 per cent of the <Col N="1001" /> buoyancy of revenue in a given year. Of course, when we have a year like last year in which we had virtual stagnation of the economy the position is that buoyancy in revenue amounts to only £1 million per year.  If Fianna Fáil insist on saying that in the future it would not be possible to finance such proposals as these out of buoyancy they are, in fact, predicting continued stagnation of the economy.</P>

      <P>I have tried to summarise what our position is and to outline it for the House.  We have a reasonable agreement on our educational objectives but there are differences both in broad principle and in detail in regard to means.  We believe that teachers, professional educators, should have more say in policy.  We believe the public have a right to know what is the expert advice on which the Minister makes his decisions.</P>
      <P>We believe that parents should have more say in practice in regard to what goes on in the schools.  We believe that in all matters in regard to education there should be more communication and more discussion.  As a result of our proposals, there has emerged a divergence of opinion between ourselves and the Government on certain matters.  As I mentioned in the beginning, we have highlighted in the motion we have put down that we believe that the primary responsibility for teaching methods, curricula and examinations should be transferred to and reported on publicly by a professional body independent of the Department of Education.  Apparently the Government disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that there should be the establishment and encouragement of parent-teacher associations which will not merely be advisory but will take part in the running of primary schools. Of course, we believe in the same thing in regard to post-primary schools.  We believe that the Minister's solution in regard to a scheme for the payment of fees in the post-primary schools is not the best solution.  We believe in the payment of maintenance grants to post-primary pupils.  We believe that teacher training needs to be reformed. <Col N="1002" /> We believe in particular that we must have a university trained teacher force, that we must have an integrated teaching profession, and that we must have increased numbers of teachers.</P>
    <P>This is not mere academic theory. This is not mere theoretical waffle, as Senator Yeats has characterised it.  This is a summary of the proposals made after consultation with teaching experts. These are firm proposals on which we stand until we are convinced by reasonable argument that there are better solutions to the problems.  We are open to conviction on many of these points, but we are not open to abandoning them merely on the basis of vague arguments.</P>
    <P>We have put forward in this motion these points on which we differ from the Government.  We believe it is theoretical waffle to say that these are inadequate points.  Fianna Fáil should state clearly what their opinions are on these points rather than saying: &ldquo;We welcome the Minister's proposals and see them as far-reaching and progressive steps.&rdquo;  If the Government Party disagree with the six points in our motion, for goodness sake let them put down an amendment saying what they would do, and what they are for or against.</P>

      <P>We have put down these six points on which there is disagreement. The function of an amendment in a parliamentary debate is either of two things: to avoid a decision which has a real meaning, or else to make the meaning clearer.  I do not think the Fianna Fáil amendment clarifies in any respect the points which have been carefully highlighted in the Fine Gael motion.  We can only conclude that the amendment is being moved because they want a vague sponsorship either of what the Minister has said or what he is going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they differ from us they should <Col N="1003" /> be quite clear.  Fine Gael have highlighted all these differences in this document.  We have said we feel strongly on many of these points, and that on others what we propose is the best we can arrive at.  On all these points we think this policy deserves more than the vague wording in the Government's amendment.</P>

      <P>I am one of those who propose the amendment to motion No. 7 and I propose it because I am satisfied that the Minister's proposals on education are adequate, progressive and far-reaching proposals which will meet most of the needs in education for the next few years.  It has been suggested by Senator Dooge that the motion put down by Fine Gael was a very skilful one in so far as it pinpointed the difference between the Minister's proposals and what Fine Gael believe in.  In fact, that is not so, because on one of the proposals mentioned in this motion&mdash; the one dealing with parents' com-mittees&mdash;there is nothing on record so far as the Minister is concerned to show that he disagrees with this in any way.  As a matter of fact, so far as it arises at all, the evidence is that Fianna Fáil agree with this proposal.  Some of the other proposals in the motion&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;that improved promotional opportunities be provided for teachers&rdquo;&mdash;are little more than pious hopes with which everyone agrees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>They are hopes which have not been realised for teachers yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which cannot be regarded as pinpointing any essential difference between the Minister and Fine Gael.  Senator O'Quigley in his speech was more than a little provocative in the sense that he outlined each of the proposals made in his motion.  He outlined them in very glowing terms and ended each summing up by saying that the proposers of the amendment were asking the House to reject those proposals.  We do not ask the House to reject all of those proposals.  We would not ask <Col N="1004" /> the House to reject some of them at all.  With regard to some of them we merely say that in the proposals made by the Minister for Education we have a better way of achieving the same object.  As Senator Dooge said in his speech all of us in this House are more or less agreed about what the aims of education should be. Consequently, the only discussion that has taken place here, fundamentally, is how we differ in achieving those aims.</P>
      <P>We have confidence in the proposals which have been made in some detail by the Minister in his Estimate speech. We have confidence that from the point of view of fiscal terms the way in which he would go about these proposals is a better way than that proposed by Fine Gael.  One of the important factors which must be taken into consideration in assessing the relative merits of the two schemes is the question of finance.  This has been touched on by the last speaker.  It amounts to this.  Fine Gael believe that they can introduce a scheme&mdash;I am sure they consider their scheme just as effective and just as far-reaching as the Minister's&mdash;relying entirely on the buoyancy of the revenue.  They believe they can get all they want out of the buoyancy, assuming, of course, that the buoyancy remains at a certain level only for what is devoted to education. That is a very unrealistic proposal.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have faced up to the fact that to introduce a far-reaching scheme such as this to provide free secondary education for everybody who wishes to avail of it will inevitably cost many millions of pounds which will have to be raised by taxation.  The very most that can be expected from a buoyancy of the revenue would be just enough to pay the ordinary increases in education, the increased cost that is there now because of increased need for accommodation, increased need for equipment, increased payment for teachers.  It is essential to have extra taxation for the new proposals which will cost something between £2 million and £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a measure of the difference between the two proposals.  The <Col N="1005" /> Government are realistic about this. They believe it will cost more money. They believe it will necessitate extra taxation and they are willing to face up to the fact that it will.  Fine Gael, as in many other aspects of their programme, like to try to have it both ways.  They are going to have a better plan than Fianna Fáil but there will be no extra taxation.  It is a measure of the wishful thinking which has gone into many aspects of their scheme.</P>
    <P>The first proposal in their motion is that which deals with the responsibility for teaching methods, curricula and examinations.  Of course, in respect of this it is a matter of how far you want to go.  It is a matter of how you approach it.  The difference between what they propose and what exists at the moment is not, fundamentally, very great.  I agree fully that the Department of Education and the Minister should get more advice, that the Minister should take advice from practical and theoretical aids.  I believe that not enough has been done in this respect in the past.  The question is at what point do the advisers hand over to the people who make the decisions?  Is there any great difference between the Department of Education taking advice from all the people who are qualified to give advice and then the Department making the decision as to what the curricula and the examinations should be? It is proposed by the movers of this motion that the experts, the advisers, the people who would be advisers in those committees, make the decisions and hand them over to the Minister who, in any event, will have to make the final decision as to what is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the Department of Education and the Minister for Education have taken a good deal of advice but I agree that they have not taken as much advice as they should have taken.  I believe there will be an improvement in this respect but I am not convinced that the whole question of the curricula, examinations and so on, should be handed over to an independent board.  I do not see that a case for this has been made in a convincing way because in the long run this may mean that there will be a great deal of difficulty and a great deal of controversy because the independent board, if it is not acting in close liaison with the Department of Education, may end up with recommendations which would be quite unacceptable to the Minister and the Minister would have to have them re-drafted.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the present system of letting the Department make the decisions, having taken advice, and perhaps acting on that advice, is the best one.  I do not think it is a matter of principle.  I do not think the final word has been said on this.  I have an open mind on it.  I might, in the future, hear arguments which would convince me that the suggestions made by the proposers of this motion constitute a better way of doing it but, from the arguments I have heard so far, I see no reason to change the present system other than that more advice should be sought and more taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, in this respect, refer to Senator Murphy's speech in which he mentioned that in 1925, I think it was, some committee of the Labour Party suggested that the question of education, the question of framing curricula, the question of framing courses, examinations and so on should be carried out by an independent body.  In view of the fact that the Labour Party seemed to have been in favour of this means of approaching the problem so long ago, it was a pity that during the two periods of office of the Coalition Government they did not suggest that this should be done because it appears now that they would have had willing allies in Fine Gael during those two periods of office.  However, it is something that was not done at the time. <Col N="1007" /> We are only discussing now what should be done for the future.  I believe that as a result of the publication of Investment in Education and the very widespread interest aroused in education in recent years, together with the many contributions from various experts on education and various people who think they are experts on education, the Department will inevitably be encouraged to adopt a very flexible approach to this in the future.  I believe they will take more advice and will profit from it.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of motion No. 7 deals with parents' committees. Here, of course, there is no real conflict and certainly no objection from those who oppose the amendment to the motion.  This question was debated in the House some years ago.  Senator Sheehy-Skeffington put down a motion advocating parents' committees in July, 1961.  On that occasion I spoke in favour of the proposal because I believed it would ease the lack of harmony which often exists between teachers, managers and parents in many schools.  I thought all three would benefit from having such a committee.</P>
    <P>At that time the then Minister for Education, Deputy Dr. Hillery, although he said he did not think it would be proper for the Minister to introduce rules and regulations laying down that such committees should be formed, certainly spoke in favour of the proposal and hoped that these committees would be formed.  He believed they would do a lot of good.  At that time, if I remember rightly, a number of Fine Gael Senators spoke and voted against this proposal.  I am very glad we now have the assurance that Fine Gael Senators have come round to our point of view on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the third paragraph of the motion, this of course gets down to the kernel of the debate&mdash;the question of free post-primary education.  Here all of us are certainly in agreement with <Col N="1008" /> the aims but there are very distinct differences of opinion as to how these aims should be achieved.  The Minister in his speech on the Estimate laid down in very considerable detail the way in which he proposes to achieve this objective and provide free post-primary education for all who wish to avail of it.  His proposal means that approximately 75 per cent of those who wish to avail of secondary education would be able to do so free.  Under the system there is a choice of schools opting for or against. The difference is that this motion wants all schools to opt in to some extent.</P>
      <P>The principal reason why the Minister's scheme is objected to is because it will cause class distinction.  This is apparently the most important objection so far as the movers of the motion are concerned.  I am not at all convinced that this gives rise to objection to the scheme.  I am not at all convinced that it will have the effect which the movers of the motion say it will have.  It must be remembered, first of all, that all education is subsidised to a considerable extent so that even if you have the position of some 75 per cent of the schools opting for providing free education you will have a position in which they are giving it completely free but the other schools, although they will be charging fees will, in fact, also be quite heavily subsidised, so that nobody who wants to analyse the position can say that one is getting free education while another is paying entirely for his education.  I do not think, in any event, that this kind of pinpointing or this kind of highlighting of children will occur&mdash;people saying that this child is going to a free school and that child is going to a school where his parents pay.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose for a moment that there is some danger of this.  Class distinction, embarrassment and so on, are far more likely where you have in the same school some children paying their way entirely and others free.</P>

      <P>This will be highlighted where two children in those two categories sit side by side, whereas in the other scheme all the children are in the same school in the same category.  The argument made by the movers of the motion is utterly unconvincing. The opposite, in fact, is the truth.  If you have all the children in the one school on the same basis there will not be any embarrassment or class distinction as there would be the other way.  Let us take a present-day example.  Some children attend national schools while others attend secondary schools where they have to pay fees. Does anybody believe this causes class distinction?</P>

      <P>Children go to a national school if it is near them or they go because there are better teachers there than in the other schools.  Whether it is a national school or whether they have to pay or not does not cause any real difficulty or create social or class distinction. Many people who can well afford to send their children to secondary schools much prefer to send them to the national school if it is convenient and if it is nearby or they often prefer to do so because the national school gives a better education.  The class distinction there is because one child is going to a national school and the other to a secondary school is negligible at the moment.  It can apply if we have in the future schools some of which provide free education and some of which will not.</P>

      <P>Putting it at its worst, even if we are to assume that free schools, as opposed to schools where we would have to pay, will create class distinction we must face up to the reality of the situation and the real underlying fact.  The important fact is that we are trying to provide equal education for all, so that all children at the end of their education will have the same opportunities of getting employment and equal standards of living. Were it to be conceded that these two kinds of school will have a temporary atmosphere of class distinction, it will still have the effect that, when educated, children will all be able to enjoy equal standards of living when they have grown up.  Thus class distinction will be eliminated in their adult life which, after all, is the fundamental objective of the educational system, whether we do it one way or the other.</P>
      <P>All will agree that the fundamental objective is to arrive at a position where people become adults with equal opportunities and where there will be no class distinction for the future. Were I now to concede that there is some danger of class distinction, the scheme proposed by the Minister is still an effective one because it will give adequate education and eliminate any class distinction when those children grow up.  It is the best scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Conallán in the course of an excellent speech, one of the best speeches I think made in this debate, criticised the system of free schools, criticised the proposal that £25 should be given in the case of some schools and £15 in the case of others.  I find it difficult to understand the logic of his objection to this principle because there can be no doubt whatever that some schools cost more to run than others. Some schools have higher overheads, some schools have debts to clear off and so on and I cannot understand why he should have such a strong objection to the fact that different sums will be given to different schools.  This seems to me to be a practical way of approaching the matter.  It seems to me to be logical and I think that any scheme should recognise the fact that <Col N="1011" /> some schools cost more to run than others and that if you are paying a sum of money to enable them to provide free education some would need more than others and should get more than others.</P>
    <P>He was also very critical of the system of providing free books.  He was critical of the fact that the system would be administered by the teachers. He described, I think, as an indignity that the teachers should have to pick and choose between students, should have to decide who needed free books and who did not.  Very shortly before that, when he was dealing with the schools and the different fees charged in some of the smaller schools and the fact that in some cases a very small fee or no fee is charged, he made it quite clear that under the present system the teachers have no difficulty apparently and no objection to making distinctions between the means of various students attending these schools in deciding what fees they should pay.  I find it difficult to understand why the same teachers who have to make this far more difficult decision, involving a far bigger amount of money, should baulk at the problem of deciding which pupils should get books and which pupils should not.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conalláin also touched on the question of the funds the Minister proposed to give to diocesan and Protestant schools.  He raised the question of whether the Minister had adverted to his responsibilities under the Constitution and whether, by giving different amounts, he might not be doing something which would be repugnant to the Constitution.  I feel he was wrong in thinking that the test as far as the Constitution is concerned is how much you give to each student. I think the proper test under the Constitution is that all children should benefit equally and that the Minister is quite entitled to give more to one child than another to ensure that each child gets approximately the same benefit.</P>

      <P>If this were not the case it would be quite impossible, for instance, to provide transport for some children and no transport for others. It would be quite impossible to keep the smaller school open as opposed to the bigger school because the cost per pupil in a small school is much more than that in a big school.  Therefore, I feel that the argument that by making special arrangements for special categories one is in danger of infringing on the Constitution does not, in fact, carry any weight and is not a thing which the Minister need be unduly concerned about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this question of providing free post-primary education, I am quite satisfied that the scheme proposed by the Minister in his Estimate speech is the one that is most likely to work, that it is the most flexible and will most likely lead to an expansion in educational opportunities for children.  For that reason I have supported the amendment welcoming the proposals of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of small points which I should like to mention.  There is the question of maintenance grants. Maintenance grants in the course of this debate have been given two meanings. What I am talking about at the moment is the question of, in certain cases, providing the means of sending a child to boarding school if he lives too far away from a day school.  This is something which is an essential provision in any scheme of post-primary education.  I agree fully with the necessity for doing this.  I think it would be quite inequitable and completely contrary to all social objectives and to the efforts which we are making to provide equal opportunities for people in no matter what part of the country they live, if they were deprived of the opportunity of getting a proper education <Col N="1013" /> because of their geographical location. Although the Minister has not given the details of exactly what he intends to do in this regard he did mention it in his speech as something that would have to be dealt with and something which he was preparing some scheme for.</P>
    <P>As regards the parts of the motion dealing with the training of teachers, of course nobody will disagree with the proposition that we need more teachers and that we need better qualified teachers.  There is no doubt that some of the teachers we have at the moment, through no fault of their own, are quite inadequately trained.  This occurs principally in some of those primary schools where the teachers seem to have little or no training whatever for their profession.  It is a very serious matter for a child in a primary school to spend some years in a particular subject under a teacher who is not qualified to teach.  It can have a very long-term effect on that child.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that this is a very serious problem and that a very critical decision has to be made by any Minister for Education, the balance between quantity and quality.  The question is that we have big classes at the moment, far too big, and on the other hand we have, as I said, teachers who are inadequately trained.  Do we want a big number of semi-qualified teachers soon or do we want a limited number of well qualified teachers later on?  It is not a problem that can be decided by making a snap decision one way or the other.  The two requirements have to be weighed one against the other, and it cannot be easily solved.  In 1958 the Department of Education made a very proper decision as far as national schools are concerned when they stopped recruiting teachers who were not fuly trained.  I think that this fundamentally is and must be the decision, but there will have to be all the time a Minister who will have to bear in mind that no matter how much he would like to have extremely well qualified teachers they are going to take time to get and there will have to be some compromise, unfortunately, accepting teachers who are inadequately trained because <Col N="1014" /> they can be got somewhat quicker.</P>
    <P>As regards university training for teachers, this again is something which in principle nobody is going to object to.  I fully agree that the training of teachers should be based on the universities.  I should like to see every teacher in the country the product of a university, but whether this can be achieved within the next five or ten years I doubt very much no matter what efforts are made.  Whether we can achieve anything like this all at once, we can aim towards it.  We can do everything possible to achieve it in due course, but it is not a thing which can be done overnight, and apart from subscribing to the desirability of this aim I do not think that we can say very much more about it at the moment.  There has, of course, been a good deal of improvement made both in the training of teachers and in providing an increased flow of better qualified teachers in recent years.  I have no hesitation in saying that I believe that this improvement that has taken place will increase still further in the future and that it is one of the aspects of the problem of education which the Minister has very much in mind, and I am quite sure that he will improve the position very much further in the future.</P>
    <P>For these reasons which I have mentioned I am of the opinion that we can, for most of the problems which have been touched on in the course of this debate, look to the proposals of the Minister for Education to solve most of them.  There are differences of opinion about how some things should be done.  There have been some things mentioned which, as I have said, are not capable of being realised immediately.  Some of them possibly cannot ever be realised.  But what I do say and what I am confident of is that we have in the Minister's proposals a set of proposals which will in the next few years go a long way to meeting the needs of education.</P>

      <P>I am glad to notice as I rise that Senator Quinlan is behind me, geographically at any rate if not spiritually, because I want <Col N="1015" /> to start by mentioning two or three points which should be commented on in his opening speech.  He said that there had recently been criticism in the <i>Irish Times</i> of various colleges of the National University, but that Trinity College was &ldquo;exempt&rdquo;.  I am afraid that Senator Quinlan must not be reading his <i>Irish Times</i> with the same assiduity that I bring to it, because there was a fierce attack on Trinity College by the <i>Irish Times</i> correspondent in Trinity College, and this promoted quite a lively controversy in the correspondence columns which went on for quite some time, so that none of us, I am afraid, is exempt.</P>

      <P>The second point he made that I feel was not justifiable was when talking about this Report which we are asked merely to &ldquo;note&rdquo;, but which I should like to note with approval, he said that there were &ldquo;no international comparisons whatsoever within its 410 pages&rdquo;.  This is too strong.  It is true that they explained that standards are not similar and comparisons are not easy, but there is constant reference to the practice in France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Scotland and United States, <i>et cetera</i>.  Consulting the index would reveal that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point is that Senator Quinlan talked about parent-teacher groups with approval, and I could not help casting my mind back, as did Senator E. Ryan, to the debate in July, 1961, on my very mild motion asking the Minister to take fostering action to encourage the setting up of parent-teacher groups in national schools, when Senator Quinlan was one of the most vocal against the whole idea and took up the phrase of Senator Ó Maoláin&mdash;whom we all miss here and would like to see back here amongst us&mdash;that if you had parent-teacher groups you would have nothing better than &ldquo;Soviet style committees in every parish&rdquo;.  This phrase appealed to Senator Quinlan, and he took it up <Col N="1016" /> and said that our own present system was the best; and consequently Senator Quinlan was one of those who voted against the motion.  I salute his change of attitude, and I am very glad that he now supports parent-teacher groups, but I cannot help recollecting the previous occasion.  He did mention also in his speech that he was a D2 child, and this perhaps explains the lateness in his arrival at the truth by a year or two, and, therefore, we can forgive him for that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Yeats is not here, though he was here all the afternoon.  He made the point that what was asked for by the Fine Gael resolution was the active co-operation of teachers, headmasters, headmistresses and so on in the planning of education. Senator Yeats was opposed to that because he said that people actively engaged in a profession are not the best people to make decisions about reforming the structure of that system &mdash;I hope I am not misinterpreting him, but I am wondering whether he would be in favour, therefore, of the collaboration of practising barristers in the framing of legislation in this House. Does he mean that practising barristers would have to be excluded, on the ground that because they are active in the profession of the law they should not also be framing the law?  I do not think you can have it both ways, and exclude teachers from the capacity to make decisions in changing the structure of the system of education while admitting practising barristers to active decision-taking in relation to the framing of legislation.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed similarly that Senator Yeats, while he said he was in agreement with much of the Fine Gael motion on education, was actually moving the deletion of every word of it.  I find this hard to understand.  How can you be in agreement with much of what you are solemnly moving to have deleted?</P>
    <P>Senator E. Ryan mentioned the parent-teacher group motion which I proposed in July, 1961, and it is quite true that he both spoke very cogently in favour of it at the time, and voted <Col N="1017" /> for it himself, though in the event the motion was defeated by 26 votes to 11. Senator E. Ryan was one of the two Fianna Fáil Senators who voted for it. If I remember correctly, there were also three Fine Gael Senators who voted for it.  The big phalanx of both big Parties went against him, but nevertheless we got 11 votes for it.  I do not think Senator Ryan's support was enough for Fianna Fáil to prove they were in favour of it, since the majority of them voted against it, and since Dr. Hillery, who was then the Minister, while saying he was in favour of the idea, made it very clear he thought it was not his function to do anything, to take even some fostering action, saying merely that he would salute parent-teacher groups which would result from spontaneous generation apparently, but he felt it was not the function of the Minister to do anything about it.  His successor, Deputy Colley, when asked about the same thing by myself in this House and outside it, said he would not like to take any action, even sending out an encouraging circular to managers, because it might have the flavour of giving an order to a school manager.  This seemed to him a thing that no Minister for Education could do.  Therefore, I am not satisfied that any Minister, as yet, has done anything positive in public to support the view, which I know to be the view of Senator E. Ryan, that there would be great value for all schools in the organisation of parent-teacher groups in connection with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that it is extremely pleasant to see Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael vying with one another&mdash;at long last&mdash;in propounding progressive programmes for education. This has never happened before in the history of the country.  The Labour Party long since have put forward progressive programmes, and the programmes supported by Tom Johnson in 1925 went even further than much that is now propounded&mdash;on the necessity for nursery schools for instance.  But Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael seem to have vied in the other direction up to now.  However, now they are vying <Col N="1018" /> with each other on implementing proposals of this Investment in Education Report.  This is spendid.  I have read the Minister's Dáil statement and the Fine Gael policy.  In my opinion both are good and carefully thought out, and if I may adopt the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment, they are both proposing further &ldquo;progressive steps forward.&rdquo;  I am not quite sure what is the purpose of the phrase &ldquo;progressive steps forward.&rdquo;  It is probably to distinguish it from &ldquo;retrospective steps forward&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive steps backwards&rdquo;.  I cannot help remembering that the Minister comes from Limerick, for which I have great admiration, as the birthplace of my mother's family, and which gives a name at least to an Irish dance&mdash;The Walls of Limerick&mdash;and the dance routine therein.  If I recall it correctly, this dance drill presents the pattern of many previous Irish Governments in regard to educational policy; that is to say, you first mark time for three steps with your left foot forward, then you mark time for three steps with your right foot forward, then you take seven steps sideways and you start again.  I hope that this folklore pattern will not be repeated here, and I trust that when Fianna Fáil now speak of &ldquo;progressive steps forward,&rdquo; they mean steps of genuine progress.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased, of course, that the big parties are now in favour of parent-teacher groups; Fine Gael are actually talking of parents helping to run the schools.  This used to be the hit-back at people like myself who proposed such groups for deliberative purposes.  We were told we were trying to set up local Soviets, trying to get the parents to run the schools and so on.  Now Fine Gael have come forward and said, courageously I think, that parents should even have a say in the running of the schools.</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to a debate&mdash;I was not in the Seanad at the time&mdash;in which the late Senator T.J. O'Connell, in December 1942, proposed that the heating, lighting and cleaning of the schools should be a matter for public health authorities and not for the managers.  This gave rise to quite an interesting debate.  He felt at that time, <Col N="1019" /> so did the INTO&mdash;I hope it still does &mdash;that local people should have some say at least in the running and the maintaining, at any rate, of the schools. I am pleased to note that in the Report on Investment in Education, page 63 of the Appendix volume, they say, in paragraph 26:</P>
    <P>This programme will need to be systematically directed at discovering the current attitudes and awareness of pupils, parents, teachers, school administrators, both local and central, employers and trade unions and of society in general in its evaluation of the value of the education provided for various purposes.</P>
    <P>What pleases me there is the mention of parents, which is a sufficiently new thing, I think, to warrant comment and congratulation.  As between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, when they are progressing thus in rivalry, I do not care much who gets the credit for it, provided that the system moves forward. I would say: more power to both of you, and if you can each egg the other on, so much the better.</P>
    <P>I put the question, which perhaps should be expressed in private rather than in public&mdash;I wonder why there is this sudden concern about education? Why this change of heart, as it were? Is it economic?  Is it the EEC?  Will there be a shortage of skilled or semiskilled manpower and is it required by the economic pressures in Ireland that we remedy soon many of our educational defects?  Is it due to the fact that, as they mention on page 316 of the Report&mdash;they anticipate a grave shortage of manpower, a shortfall as they call it, of manpower unless serious measures are taken immediately in relation to education?  I do not really mind what is the motivation.  If it is economic, this does not matter to me, provided that the progress is made. Therefore, I salute the radical change, as I see it, in the policy of Fine Gael and when I find them saying, at the end of page 2 of their policy document, and I quote:</P>
    <P>... the total absence of planning in education hitherto.  In calling for a shift in emphasis from &ldquo;ordinary administration&rdquo; to &ldquo;active development&rdquo;, <Col N="1020" /> the team was clearly influenced by the lack of thought given to educational development in the Department and by its pre-occupation with routine administrative matters.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be in very marked contrast to the sort of attitude which was prevalent in that same Party, I am afraid, not so very long ago.  I turn back to a challenge put in the Dáil to Deputy General Mulcahy when he was Minister for Education.  On the 19th July, 1956, Deputy Moylan, who afterwards became Minister for Education, asked him to say what was his philosophy of education.  The reply was&mdash; and I take it that at this time he was speaking for his Party&mdash;General Mulcahy said, and I quote from volume 159 of the Dáil Debates at column 1494:</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan has asked me to philosophise, to give my views on educational technique or educational practice.  I do not regard that as my function in the Department of Education in the circumstances of the educational set-up in this country. You have your teachers, your managers and your Churches and I regard the position as Minister in the Department of Education as that of a kind of dungaree man, the plumber who will make the satisfactory communications and streamline the forces and potentialities of the educational workers and educational management in this country.  He will take the knock out of the pipes and will link up everything.  I would be blind to my responsibility if I insisted on pontificating or lapsed into an easy acceptance of an imagined duty to philosophise here on educational matters.</P>
    <P>There is a sharp contrast between regarding it as an absolute duty not to think at all about the kind of matter going along the pipes of education&mdash;without any reference to the parents at all&mdash;and the present Fine Gael policy which is well thought out, and very much concerned with what is passing along the pipes of the educational system.  General Mulcahy has <Col N="1021" /> qualities of character which I respect, but his ideas&mdash;and I think he spoke for the Party at that time&mdash;on education were not progressive.  Yet even he, as I propose to recall, was better than some of his successors, on the question, for instance, of looking into the data of overcrowding in schools, which I propose to mention a little later on.</P>
    <P>Today, of course, I must concentrate upon primary, secondary and vocational education, though I have here the Report on Higher Education in Ireland.  My thumb is covering the word &ldquo;Northern&rdquo;, and the lion and the unicorn appear on the top.  My point is that I note that we are awaiting, before we can talk about the universities, for a report from a Commission which ceased to take evidence, if I am correctly informed, in 1961.  Those who reported on higher education in Northern Ireland were appointed in November, 1963, and the report was printed in January, 1965, and presented to the Parliament in Stormont in February, 1965.  It took only one year and two months to prepare and publish.  I take it that something is eventually going to happen in relation to our own equivalent report.  I may be wrong, but I noticed several members of Fianna Fáil, including Senator Yeats, saying disparaging things about the report and this delay.  I have a feeling that somehow the report will not prove to the taste of Fianna Fáil.  My guess is that the Government will not accept it in its entirety.  However, I really am not in order discussing it here at this moment.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Investment in Education. This is an excellent report which we have, and to me, as to other Senators who have spoken, it seems a quite remarkable document&mdash;one might say a unique document&mdash;and one which provides a basis for our thinking about education, and the basis for the Minister's policy proposals.  I think he has taken it very closely into account.  It is also the basis for the Fine Gael policy put forward in their document.  As I read it, it is a well co-ordinated and coherent presentation of well-documented facts about Irish education, many of which have never been put together so clearly, or even <Col N="1022" /> collected.  It also gives the implications of these facts, and a wide variety of alternative methods, or &ldquo;strategies,&rdquo; for eradicating demonstrable defects.</P>
    <P>At page 387 they mention what they set out to do.  I do not propose to quote that, but it is very clearly and comprehensively put, and it commands our attention.  The aim is to discover in what way we can make more effective use of our resources to reach our goal&mdash;the goal of giving equal educational opportunity to all our children to develop to the fullest their innate abilities, which we all agree is at least what we should be aiming at. I am pleased also that Senators who have spoken are in favour of the measure of planning which is proposed by the Minister and by Fine Gael. Planning was previously regarded by some as an unclean word, but I note that at page 380, paragraph 15.32 the report says:</P>
    <P>A free market system is unlikely, therefore, to yield an educational pattern which would be satisfactory from a community viewpoint.</P>
    <P>This I feel is a very valuable statement. At page 386, paragraph 15.48 the same point is made where they say in the summary:</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise in using a free market price system as a method for allocating resources to various uses, which render the results of that system unacceptable from a community viewpoint.</P>
    <P>In other words, free enterprise is not the best method, at any rate in relation to education.</P>
    <P>If we are aiming at giving every child an equal chance, what are the facts? At page 18, tables 1.3 and 1.4 the chances which an ordinary child gets in Ireland today are indicated by percentages. At table 1.4 on page 18 they give the percentage of population in each age group attending aided and non-aided educational establishments in 1964.  At age 13, they represented 94.1 per cent of the population, plus a few in non-aided schools; at age 14, 66.1 per cent; 15 years, 51.1 per cent; 16 years, 36 per cent; 17 years, 23.6 per cent; 18 years, 12.8 per cent; and 19 years, 7.7 per cent.  This is an indication that the average youth has a <Col N="1023" /> limited chance, unless he can afford to pay for privileged educational opportunities, of reaching the higher strata of education.</P>
    <P>In relation to the teacher supply question there is, I suggest, a probability that the minimal targets will not be reached.  This is clearly set forth in paragraph 4.7, page 54, and paragraph 4.8, page 55.  The question of teacher supply is absolutely crucial to the improvement of the position.  On page 54 of the Report it is stated:</P>
    <P>It would appear from the Second Programme for Economic Expansion that while the attainment of this aim may be a matter of long-term policy, specific measures designed to achieve it by a target date are unlikely to be embarked upon within the period covered by this report and almost certainly not within the currency of the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>On the opposite page it states similarly:</P>
    <P>It is indeed unlikely that teacher availability at any time during the seventies will enable this target to be attained without recourse to measures to increase the inflow of teachers...</P>
    <P>In other words, we are going to be short of teachers, and Senator Dooge was perfectly right to direct the attention of the Minister to that fact.  It is clearly stated there in the report.</P>
    <P>This leads us to the whole question of teacher training.  I do not want to stress further what has been said, but I strongly believe that at least some contact with the university should be granted to every teacher in training. This will require more money, and the net will have to be cast wider for the recruitment in particular of primary school teachers.  One notices from the facts given on page 262 that the number of teachers recruited from Dublin in a given group is curiously small.</P>
    <P>On page 262 it is mentioned that:</P>
    <P>More than half of the 400 lay entrants to teacher training in 1963 came from five counties on the Western coast (Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Donegal, Clare, in that order) and a further 46 were from <Col N="1024" /> Cork.  On the other hand less than one-fifth of the entrants came from Leinster&mdash;8 from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is the necessity for spending more money and for making the profession more attractive, financially. On the same page you have a curious fact mentioned, emerging from teacher training in 1963.  I quote from this page:</P>
    <P>No girls took mathematics in the final examination in 1963 and only 14 boys did so, out of a total of 91 boys and 353 girls although about a quarter of their time as teachers will be devoted to mathematics&mdash;in most cases, this is confined to arithmetic.</P>
    <P>Again, the indication is that the methods and results of training are not altogether satisfactory.  With regard to the question of teacher recruitment the point made by Senator Jessop is very important, that is that we should attract back to this country teachers who have gone abroad for one reason or another and who have acquired valuable experience there, It is quite absurd to say that we are short of teachers, and yet that many Irish teachers who want to come back after five, ten or fifteen years teaching experience of a most valuable kind abroad are treated by us as if they were starting off on their careers.  It is quite obvious if you are not prepared to treat service abroad as if it had been service at home you will not attract back teachers with valuable experience to secondary and also to primary schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy, in my opinion, is quite right to suggest that the problems of primary education are even more acute than the problems of secondary education because there are in our primary schools five times as many children as there are in our secondary schools.  About one-third of this total get no further education.  Of those, who get no post-primary education at all, only 28 per cent emerge from the primary school with a primary certificate. That is demonstrated in Table 6.20 on page 140.  The fact is that the minimum that we regard as being what is to be expected in any case, is stated <Col N="1025" /> by the Report on page 140 to be very often not attained.  They say:</P>
    <P>The above result suggests that these pupils left school without having reached or without having completed sixth standard.</P>
    <P>In the paragraph below they say:</P>
    <P>Although this figure is undoubtedly exaggerated, the annual emergence of such a large number of young people who apparently have not reached what is commonly considered a minimum level of education, can hardly be viewed with equanimity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that post-primary education requires even more emphasis, as Senator Murphy suggests, than secondary education.  We recognise that secondary education, to all intents and purposes, is in private hands, despite the fact, as is shown in Table 5.4 on page 85, that 71 per cent of their income is supplied by the State. Yet they are not State schools.  In a pretty full sense they are in private hands.  Furthermore, there is a grave disparity, what is called on page 150 of the Report a &ldquo;marked contrast&rdquo;, in the participation in post-primary education, as between children of well-to-do families and children of working class families.</P>
    <P>This contrast becomes more marked in the higher age group.  Chart 6.7 on page 172 brings out very clearly the class barriers which operate within our educational system, and about whose existence I think there can be no argument. There has been discussion as to whether there should be State comprehensive schools, State secondary schools, and how best to ensure free access to secondary education.  The French system, which is certainly not without defect, and suffers from gross overcrowding at the moment, is basically a very good one.  The State <i>lycées</i> provide free education, provided that the child is of sufficient ability to pass from class to class, either by examination, if its school report is not sufficiently good, or, if it is good, on the recommendation of the teacher.  If the child does not pass from class to class it may repeat one year, but not two and it is then put out of the school.  It <Col N="1026" /> has no option but to do without further education or to go to one of the private, fee-paying schools.  In other words, free education is given to those children who are able and willing to work and benefit therefrom.</P>
    <P>The report also mentions, in relation to day continuation schools and vocational schools, that in Dublin in particular &ldquo;there appears to be an unsatisfied demand and a shortage of capacity&rdquo;.  The post-primary participation is shown, geographically as it were, on page 56, and a rather startling view it is.  We find that the city of Dublin does not come very high.  The best county in the whole Republic for post-primary participation in education is Sligo, followed fairly closely by Cork and Tipperary. That is shown in Chart 6.4 on page 164.  Dublin lags far behind.</P>
    <P>This makes for uneasiness and makes us wonder whether we are doing enough in relation to vocation or day continuation schools, as well as secondary schools because, of course, the two will be parallel and perhaps even fused in the years to come.  There is a very important point made, which is recognised by the Minister, and was recognised by his predecessor in office, Deputy Colley, and that is in order to aim at the best utilisation of teaching in schools it is stated on page 264:</P>
    <P>Above all because of the uneven distribution of that scarce and costly resource, teachers, we raise the query whether the present distribution of schools is the most suitable, satisfactory or economical method of providing primary education.</P>
    <P>On page 262 it says:</P>
    <P>Seventy-six per cent of national schools have average enrolments of less than 100 pupils.  They contain only 38 per cent of all pupils but 50 per cent of all teachers.</P>
    <P>This is an important basic figure.  It means that we are not using our teachers and schools to the best advantage. On page 316 the report says:</P>
    <P>The existing organisation of national schools results in an allocation of teachers that at the one extreme <Col N="1027" /> may give a teacher for 8 pupils and at the other, one teacher per 45 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I feel the Minister and the Government are right&mdash;Fine Gael agree with them about this.  The word &ldquo;tactful&rdquo; is the only word applied in criticism of the Government in the Fine Gael policy in this regard.  The Government are right in feeling that small schools must be allowed to wither away in order to allow better deployment of teaching skill, a better range of subjects, a better range of equipment, and also, a point in which I see value, a better degree of independence on the part of the teachers. I would contend that the teacher in a six- to seven-teacher school is likely to be more independent minded, less subject to pressure from above, than the solitary teacher in a one-teacher school or a couple of teachers in a two-teacher school.</P>
    <P>I mention <i>en passant</i> without wanting to stress it, although I do not want to omit mention of it, what seems to me an important chapter.  That is chapter 14, on the help we can give to the educational system in emergent nations.  I would make the point that this help would be reciprocal, because we can learn a lot from these emergent nations, and from their ways of tackling their own problems, as well as helping them along.  We can learn by exchange of methods, exchange of teachers and exchange of students.  In paragraph 14.25 the report urges the creation in Ireland of a School of African Studies.  I would terminate my reference to that by saying that this shows an insight to the future, because there is no question but that Africa will in future years loom large and will greatly contribute to the education of the world.  Consequently, our learning about it, and having relationship with the African emergent nations, is of prime importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's basic aim, which I paraphrase, is that no child shall be deprived of post-primary education on financial grounds.  It is clear, I think, that we are all agreed on that.  I am strongly on the side of those in Fine <Col N="1028" /> Gael who demand maintenance grants as well as free tuition, and I make it quite specific, as did Senator Murphy who first raised it.  I think Senator E. Ryan recognised it too, that you must do more than merely grant free tuition. You must provide maintenance for the 16-year-old who normally might be expected by a poor family to be bringing in £2 to £3 a week or more.  The Fine Gael policy is prepared to give up to £100 a year for a child.</P>
    <P>Unless you are prepared to do that you will deprive of the benefit you are offering, a whole lot of children.  In other words, this maintenance grant&mdash; and I am quite certain the Minister is aware of it as we all are because it is part and parcel of everyday life in this country&mdash;should be available to a family with a large number of children where the eldest has a practical obligation to bring money in at the earliest possible moment.  Unless you are prepared to give them some money to bring home, they will not be able to avail themselves of free places in the schools as planned for by the Minister. That is a great pity.  It is the one major mistake in Ministerial policy, that the Minister has not allowed for maintenance grants, with a means test, for those children who might legitimately be expected to be bringing in money, and who could not otherwise take up free places.  The Minister must face this.  The Fine Gael policy faces it quite specifically.  The Seanad ought not to be content with the Fianna Fáil amendment.  I do not think that the mere saying that everything is all right, and that we are all quite satisfied, is enough.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make a point, though I do not want to pause too long on it, in relation to industrial schools. They have not been mentioned yet.  We all know, though we sometimes forget, that a large number of children in industrial schools are there for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of poverty on the part of their parents.  In view of that fact, in the appendix to this report, page 31, we have a paragraph on which I think we ought to pause.  It says:</P>
    <P>The majority of the boys in industrial schools cannot hope to obtain <Col N="1029" /> an apprenticeship since they are not being provided with opportunities for the requisite post-primary education.</P>
    <P>These children are being victimised, and very often merely because of the poverty of their parents.  This is a matter to which we in the Seanad should direct the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the curriculum.  It has been mentioned already.  It must be modified and widened, made more flexible and made broader.  I think the Minister has this in mind too.  Large schools will effectively widen the subject available for the children.</P>
    <P>I made this point before, and I do not want to labour it now: it should be recognised that all teaching is conditioned by the State examination approach.  The State examination approach in my opinion has improved. Senator Jessop made this point first: the approach is still one which places far too much emphasis upon what is called the factual, rather the philosophical. The attitude is&mdash;take it down, learn it off, and serve it up again.  There is no need to think.</P>
    <P>As Senator Jessop said, it is vital that if the child is really educated he should be able to think for himself.  I believe the Cartesian method of &ldquo;methodical doubt&rdquo; is far better, the method of encouraging people to think for themselves and encouraging children to regard their minds as living, active things, capable of growth and use.  The emphasis in our schools should not be too strong on submission and obedience.  I would rather see it placed on question, and inquiry, and minor research.  I should be inclined to use a slogan which seems to have gone out of fashion, and say to our children: &ldquo;Up the rebels&rdquo;, and do not be too concerned with submission, obedience, and so on.  I feel that the spirit of the Fianna Fáil amendment is the spirit of obedience and submission.  The Minister knows best; his policy is best. &ldquo;The Minister's in Marlborough Street, all's right with the world&rdquo;.  This attitude is not to the credit of the amendment proposers.  Senators should be prepared to question and challenge their Minister and not say: &ldquo;We know the <Col N="1030" /> Minister's policy is right in every detail; therefore, let us wipe out anything that criticises it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another way in which the State examination approach conditions teaching, and that is in relation to the teaching of languages.  In the intermediate, primary, group and leaving certificates there is no oral examination for modern languages, the single exception being Irish in the leaving certificate, but even there the emphasis is put in the wrong place.  The idea should be to have orals in all examinations, and it is even more important in the first than in the last one.  Children are more receptive in their earlier days. To have no oral examination in French, Spanish, German and in Irish in the intermediate certificate is an active disincentive to language teachers who want to teach living languages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan in the debate on the 18th July, 1956, in the Dáil in volume 159, column 1215 of the Dáil reports in talking about Irish said:</P>
    <P>I am an Irish language enthusiast but I believe that the Irish language, and this applies to every language other than vernacular English, is being taught wrongly in our system of education.  No matter what enthusiastic Gaelic leaders may say, we are not making real progress in regard to Irish and we never will under the present system.  In the teaching of foreign languages we are as bad, if not worse.</P>
    <P>That is 11 years ago spoken by the late Deputy Moylan, and I feel those words have the ring of truth.  He made the point that learning by ear and by speaking was of the greatest value in relation to all the living languages and could be disregarded only at the peril of those who disregard it.  In 1965 Deputy Colley when he was Minister for Education made the promise that soon there was going to be oral examinations in the other living languages.  That is a year and a half ago now.  It may be about to come into being but, so far, it has not in fact been brought about.</P>
    <P>I would point out that if you take Irish in the GCE in Britain or in Northern Ireland you have an oral <Col N="1031" /> examination, but here it is not in the intermediate nor in the primary certificate. I have no illusions about the magic teaching of the language through language laboratories.  We have a language laboratory, I am glad to say, in Trinity College.  I have been involved in using this for the teaching of French in the last two years.  We also teach Irish, Russian, German, Italian and Spanish.  It is an effective method, but it is not magic.  You do not pour people in at one side and find that they come out the other side speaking the language.  A hard working student who will slog away for a considerable number of hours will get results, but let nobody think it is a miraculous way.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i> I have here also. I notice they make what seems to me to be an odd mistake but a mistake which I am afraid is not unusual.  The whole document is in Irish.  This is meant to be for the easy absorption of Irish by absolute beginners.  If you are an absolute beginner starting off with no knowledge of the language you will not understand anything in the book. I imagine the Minister will be able to tell us that this matter is in hand, and that this version is merely a basic document upon which more will be built, but I am afraid that so far it cannot have much impact upon those who do not yet know Irish.</P>

      <P>It is a method of teaching a basic form of Irish to absolute beginners.

    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> On the question of Irish there is, in my opinion, a great deal of unfortunate fake and a great deal of hypocrisy.  I should like to quote from Professor R. A. Breathnach, Professor of Irish Language and Literature in University College, Cork.  Writing an article in <i>Studies</i> in Summer, 1956, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... there is no doubt that the continuous use of pressure methods to propagate Irish in the schools has killed much of the love, joy and pride proper to the teaching and learning of the language; in the absence of these, the study, its patriotic motivation obscured or lost, ceases to have any real meaning and bears only Dead Sea Fruit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is quoting from a person whose opinion I think is worthy of consideration. It is fair to say that there is a surprisingly low level of performance arising from the teaching of Irish down the past years.</P>
    <P>A member of Misneach wrote recently to the papers complaining about the great difficulty he had in finding people in Government offices and in schools and in post offices and on the telephone who would talk Irish to him.  He mentions how he put through a phone call to the Gaeltacht and that every successive relay was done in English.  This is I am afraid a real measure of how much Irish is really talked.  If you ask any Irish speaker to spell his name in Irish you will find that in nine times out of ten he will use the English names for the very letters in his name.  A Frenchman or a German would not do that.  You will find Irish people speaking in Irish and quoting a date in English.  This would seem curiously funny to a Frenchman.  This is reducing Irish to the level of Churchillian French; and it is hard to get anything more unFrench than that.</P>
    <P>I should like nevertheless, to stress the fact that as a school subject Irish seems to me to have three major advantages.  The first one is the linguistic oral discipline of throwing your <Col N="1033" /> thoughts into a second language.  I believe if you get over that barrier early on it will help you to get over the same barrier in relation to other languages.  This is supposing that the oral teaching of Irish is practised. The second advantage is the wealth of idiom and image in Irish, and in Irish English for that matter, which enriches English and with which we have certainly enriched our English.  The third advantage is, when you reach a certain stage, the contact with the people of the Gaeltacht which it makes possible.  But all of these would, in my opinion, derive just as much and perhaps a good deal more from optional Irish, Irish by choice, rather than from what Professor Breathnach calls pressure Irish.</P>
    <P>Father Ó Fiaich, speaking at the Mansion House meeting held by the LFM, said that he had been taught Irish in the North of Ireland, but that there only seven per cent of the schools taught Irish, where it was a voluntary subject.  He said that this is what would happen here if you allowed it to be voluntary.  It seems to me that if you have 34 per cent or 35 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland Catholic and Nationalist, and if the parents want Irish and if teachers want it you will find that the amount of Irish would be nearer to 35 per cent than to seven per cent.  Perhaps seven per cent representing about one-fifth of the Nationalists shows the true proportion of those wanting Irish.</P>
    <P>The same Father Ó Fiaich was quoted in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> in relation to Irish and a competition for towns and villages, as laying down certain required minimum performances or minimum attitudes towards the language on the part of the towns and villages before they could enter for this competition.  I am quoting from yesterday's <i>Irish Times:</i>&ldquo;The minimum is: two per cent of the population wearing the Fáinne; point of sale advertising material in Irish in at least one shop per street; .2 per cent of the people in an Irish language group club;&rdquo; and so on.  The Seanad will recognise that the figures are not terribly high.  Father Ó Fiaich goes on to say: &ldquo;The targets might seem low, <Col N="1034" /> but if they were obtained they would represent a 100 per cent increase in the whole country, in the various categories mentioned,&rdquo; which means that as far as people being in a book club is concerned this indicates that now about .1 per cent of the people are in one.  In other words the actual desire would appear to be not as great as methods of compulsion might make it appear.  Therefore I would suggest that it is very important in relation to Irish, if it is to live on, not only that it should be treated as a living language but that it should not be treated as an instrument of discrimination for appointments or promotions.  In the leaving certificate or in the intermediate certificate examinations I would suggest that credit should be given for any subject passed, as is done in the GCE.  I would also suggest in relation to the state of Irish in the school curriculum there should be freedom of choice.  The Irish people ought to have the right to choose.  I ask why not? The amount of time devoted in primary schools to the teaching of Irish is proportionately great.  I think I am right in saying that ten hours a week are given in primary schools to Irish and English of which two-thirds are given to Irish.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the question as to how much attention you can get in schools where sometimes in the infant classes a subject is being taught through a language which is not the home language of the child.  This is linked up in my mind with the whole question of the impossible task imposed on some teachers by overcrowding. I know that the Minister is not only aware of this but is deeply concerned about it, and I warmly welcome the figures presented by the Report on pupil-teacher ratio, because for a long time it has been extremely difficult to find out what the position is in relation to overcrowding.</P>
    <P>I said that I would mention General Mulcahy again.  I have already mentioned to the Seanad that he was prepared in July to October, 1956, to tell Deputy McQuillan, as he then was, that he would find out for him what was the actual position in relation to overcrowding in Dublin and Cork <Col N="1035" /> schools.  Unfortunately there was a change of Government before he could find out the answers, after about three or four months' inquiry, and a new Minister for Education was in his chair by this time.  That was the present Taoiseach, and his answer to the same question the following year was that</P>
    <P>The returns prepared annually by school managers are not in such a form as would permit of the statistics requested by the Deputy being compiled, and their compilation would involve obtaining a special return from all the schools in the county borough of Dublin which would involve the spending of an inordinate amount of time and work both on the part of the school managers and of the officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>The same sort of response was given to a similar question later on by Deputy Dr. Hillery, and even in the Seanad a couple of years ago the then Minister for Finance, the same Deputy Lynch, although I had asked him in advance for the most recent figures, told me that 24 hours' notice was not enough for the Department of Education to produce the &ldquo;most recent&rdquo; figures.</P>
    <P>However, now in the appendix to the Investment in Education, Volume 2, page 558, we have the facts about overcrowding revealed and although I have spoken at some length tonight, I think that it is important to get on the record what those facts are.  For instance there is a table on page 558 of the Appendix Volume&mdash;Table A.6, which gives average pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools in OECD member countries, and we find the average for Ireland is only 33, which does not sound too bad, and there are some countries which are markedly worse, such as Turkey with 48.</P>
    <P>But we also find Table A.7 which gives figures for the 1st February, 1963, of class sizes, and in Ireland there were 109,725 pupils in classes with 40 to 49 pupils.  There were 82,290 in classes of 50 to 59, and there were 28,204 in classes of 60 and over.  When you <Col N="1036" /> consult the comparative international table above that with the &ldquo;average&rdquo; of 33, it is of importance to recognise just what that &ldquo;average&rdquo; means.</P>
    <P>On page 563 this becomes very apparent when we read Table A.11, which shows pupil-teacher ratios in national schools, and for the Catholic national schools in the cities with seven teachers and over, the average pupil-teacher ratio is 45.1.  But the percentage of pupils in those same schools in classes of 40 and over is 90.1 and the percentage of pupils in those same schools in classes of 50 and over is 60.1, so that you can see that a teacher in any such school is not having a very easy time of it.</P>
    <P>If you turn over to page 564 and page 565 you get figures for Dublin, and you find that as regards class sizes in Dublin for the Catholic schools, out of a total of 84,633 pupils, 48,103 were, in 1963, in classes of 50 pupils or more. That is, more than half the children in big Catholic national schools in Dublin are in classes of 50 and more.  The figures for Cork are slightly better.  The pupil total for Cork is 17,558 and the total in classes of 50 or more is 8,036 which is not quite half.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that successive Ministers for Education have been reluctant to expend the money which it would have been necessary to spend in order to find out these figures, but now that they have been found out I am convinced that the present Minister is personally concerned about rectifying this problem.</P>
    <P>For the solution of the overcrowding problem it is obvious that there are two prime needs&mdash;one a need for more teachers, as Senator Dooge quite rightly pointed out, and then the need for more schools.  I must quote from page 591 of the second volume in relation to the amount of time it takes to provide a new school.  The figure given in various tables can be illustrated by quoting from page 591: &ldquo;Table 2 shows that on average it took approximately 12 years five months from the date a new school (excluding non-replacements) was recommended to the time of its completion.&rdquo;  We know what &ldquo;average&rdquo; means, so what was the longest time, one wonders, in relation <Col N="1037" /> to such schools?  This is the kind of thing which must be changed.  The Report on page 57 says that &ldquo;100 new buildings a year will enable present standards to be maintained,&rdquo; and unless we are satisfied with present standards it is quite clear that 100 new buildings a year will not be enough. As to the planning of capacity, and trying to plan capacity to fit demands, the figures are not all available, and the returns from the schools were not wholly satisfactory, because it is stated on page 58 of the Report that information in this regard was obtained from only 75 national schools, or about 40 per cent of the total number asked. I should say that the secondary schools had a better figure, about 71 per cent. This therefore is another underlying fact, that there have been many primary schools which are not even prepared to answer the questionnaires or circulars.  Sixty per cent did not answer this question at any rate.</P>
    <P>According to the Report, there must be, in dealing with this problem of planned building and extension of buildings, a recognition of the fact that something like 400 new classrooms must be built fast, even to satisfy the present demand.  I would agree with what was suggested by Senator Dooge, that it is necessary to build fast for the present children and not be prepared to wait an average of 12 years five months for the building of a school.</P>
    <P>I believe consequently, if I might attempt to summarise, that there is a real move on now.  The question is coming, therefore, and must evidently be answered, where is the money going to come from?  Some people say from taxation, some from &ldquo;buoyancy.&rdquo;  I do not think we should be afraid of taxation in this matter.  It is a vitally necessary thing to invest in education. I would also draw attention to the fact, however, that in the 1966-67 Estimates £11 million were allotted for defence, which was ten per cent up on the year before, and that the year before was ten per cent up on the year preceding that. I would suggest that we can cut drastically the Defence Estimate. I am all in favour of the Irish contribution <Col N="1038" /> to United Nations peacekeeping operations, but I do not believe that this country now requires £11 million to be spent upon Defence.</P>
    <P>If I might stress three points which seem to me not to have been mentioned and which ought to be mentioned. One&mdash;co-education&mdash;ought, I think, increasingly be the norm both in primary and in secondary schools. The normal family has sisters and brothers living in the same house; and the normal school, I think, should deal with boys and girls.  I do not think it is a happy situation where a convent national school asks boys to leave at the age of seven.  I do not understand why it is done; I do not think this is good either for the convent school or for the boys.  Secondly, I should like to see a system of education, both primary and secondary, which would not be segregated according to religion.  I recognise I am in a small minority on this but I should like to say I do not think it is an accurate interpretation of Christianity&mdash;I say this with respect&mdash; to suggest that its teaching is&mdash;&ldquo;Love thy neighbour but meet him not at school&rdquo;.  I believe that &ldquo;love thy neighbour,&rdquo; inasmuch as it means: love people who are not yourself or who may not believe the things you believe, or who have not the same attitude towards things, means to meet them and, above all, to meet them at school.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to see far less emphasis upon church control in the schools.  I think it a bad thing that you have clerical management in every primary school.  This applies, of course, to all the churches and to almost every national school.  The fact that the employing and the dismissal of teachers is entirely in the hands of the clerical manager, I think, is a bad thing.  I think it is a bad thing that the State pays the piper in relation to primary education and the Church calls the tune.  I believe that the laity, who are increasingly gaining respect in this country, ought to have increasing control.  I am surprised always when I find that Church authorities seem to have a curious fear of Irish Catholic <Col N="1039" /> parents who get together and who, after all, have been brought up in a fully Catholic atmosphere and education. What goes wrong?  Why should we be afraid of them in groups?</P>
    <P>My last remark is, perhaps, a racialist point.  My impression is that Irish children, on the average, are bright.  I think there is quite a high level of intelligence in this country, and this adds impetus to my view, and to the view of all of us here, that we must&mdash;as far as in us lies&mdash; give them a chance to develop all their native talents, whether they be rich or poor.  I think that this excellent Report&mdash;Investment in Education &mdash;points the way, urges continued investigation, wants us to know where we are going, and offers plans for the skilled and planned utilisation of all our resources for all Irish children, with no discrimination arising from the wealth or poverty of the parents. It is true that by virtue of their circumstances, the social handicaps, of the parents already, in many ways, act strongly against their children.  I would conclude, therefore, with the appeal that we should at least see to it that these social handicaps, these social barriers and obstacles, be no longer placed in the path of our socially under-privileged children in the matter of education.</P>

    <P>During the dark days of the Land War, everybody hailed the three Fs of <Col N="1041" /> Davitt, especially the tenant farmer, as it gave them new life and hope.  Today, in 1967, I think the three Fs of O'Malley will give new life and hope to the descendants of those farmers and to our farm workers' children.  On behalf of that section of the community, and especially on behalf of the women of Ireland&mdash;on whom rests most of the decisions in education&mdash;I welcome the Minister's three Fs&mdash;free post-primary education, free transport and free books.  As I have said in Irish, there are many more reforms to be made in education.  We know the Minister is quite well aware of them but a start has to be made somewhere and I believe he has made a start in the right place and has his priorities quite right. When he has consolidated himself on these three fronts I am quite sure he will attack the other problems with the same vigour, reality and speed.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, I see around me many authorities on education. Some have spoken at great length and, looking around, I can see many who will speak at much greater length.  I would remind them that if their points were made in not quite so many words we might be able to digest them better.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of our system of education but we would be very dishonest if we did not admit that wonderful strides have been made in the past 40 years.  We all know that our oppressors did everything in their power to rid us of our thirst for education, and leave us to be the hewers of wood and drawers of water.  They failed miserably because of the deep-rooted Gaelic culture of our ancestors, and their innate love of learning.  It would be a sad day for Ireland if someone succeeded in wiping out our Irish language.</P>
    <P>We know that in the past 40 years while we were suffering the growing pains of a young nation, many poor people made great sacrifices to educate their children for education's sake. They expressed it by saying: &ldquo;It will be no load to you, child.&rdquo;  They also realised its economic importance and expressed it in an equally simple way by saying: &ldquo;It will help you get on in life.&rdquo;  Even though our ancestors did not have the things we are clamouring <Col N="1042" /> for today, their sense of values was quite correct.</P>
    <P>We hear quite a lot about the aims of education and in an assembly such as this it would bore the House to repeat the aims of education.  They are very well expressed in this wonderful document Investment in Education. There is also a wonderful contribution in the comments on this document by the NIEC, where we are given the causes and consequences of education and its social and economic importance. I should like to congratulate the team which compiled this work.  We all realise the amount of hard research that went into sifting and evaluating all the data collected.  In no uncertain way it holds up a mirror to our system of education, shows its weaknesses and suggests remedies.</P>
    <P>Several points have been referred to, and one that is of particular interest to me is the problem of the small schools.  That was debated at length last year.  I remember 25 years ago when I was a teacher in a secondary school the one hope I had was that I would see the day when one- and two-teacher schools would be abolished. Thank God I have lived to see that day.  Everyone realises that a child has a better chance in a bigger school, but I hope the schools will not be so big as to make them impersonal, and that the child will not be just a cog in a wheel. For rural Ireland I would suggest a five- or six-teacher school, but I suppose it depends on the area.  I know the Government will be wise enough to see that the schools are not too big.</P>
    <P>We have heard great tributes paid to our national teachers.  We all know that primary education is the most important branch of education for our children.  Therefore, no effort should be spared to recruit the most suitable candidates for teaching in our primary schools.  I was tempted to say &ldquo;the best brains&rdquo; but the people with the best brains do not always make the best teachers.  Because of that, the method of selecting candidates for teaching in our primary schools is a very big problem.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Colley was Minister for Education he stressed over and <Col N="1043" /> over again that it was the child and not the system that mattered.  The present Minister has repeated that and I think it is a most fundamental principle, especially in primary education. This sentiment was also expressed by Pádraig Pearse when he spoke of the murder machine.  Education should be far more concerned with turning out good men and women rather than good scholars.  Early education should be geared towards the formation of character, towards the formation of correct attitudes to fellow pupils and to life, towards the formation of a correct outlook on life and a correct attitude to our country, rather than stuffing children with facts and figures.  Primary school is the place where talent should be spotted.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to my grief at the fact that many of our text books are not suitable for this country.  They are not geared to a rural community, and they have not got a national bias. I hope that some time someone will remedy this.  Last year, too, I referred to the fact that I was sad because so many of our girls leave school without any training whatsoever in domestic science and child welfare.  This would take about another half hour to go into, but in an educated assembly like this we all know how important this is for the physical and mental health of our future citizens.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot recently about courses of civics in our national schools. We all welcome this, but it is not much use in teaching civics in our schools if they are not practised in the homes.  A first requirement would be a course in civics for parents on television, and they might transmit this to the children rather than ask the teachers to do it.  Career guidance has got much publicity in the past few years.  We know that career guidance is needed but we might overdo it because children in general have more than one aptitude.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes the end of the scholarship regime because it led to cramming and hot house education.  We also welcome the common inter cert, because at long last the hand and eye <Col N="1044" /> subjects are to get an equal place with languages, history, geography, and the rest of the academic curriculum.  It also means the end of the snob value of secondary education which has led too many of our children to aim at white collar jobs.  We have a long way to go to get back the respect that the people of Ireland once had for good workmanship and for manual and technical ability.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the Irish language.  I believe that as soon as <i>Buntús Gaeilge</i> and graded courses are introduced into our schools, with more emphasis on oral Irish, we can expect to see more strides made with the language.  More progress may well be made in the next five years than in the previous 25 years.  I also welcome the crash courses for untrained teachers.  I hope someone will prevail on the Minister to bring within the scope of these courses the five or six per cent who may be left out because they had not continuous teaching service or because of some little technical point like that.</P>
    <P>We know that everybody nowadays is interested in the integration of the three phases of education.  Everyone wishes that all our teachers should get some period in the university but we must admit that St. Patrick's Training College is second to none.  Many of our people coming out of the university would find it very hard to hold their place with the products of our national training schools.</P>
    <P>At last we also hear great concern expressed about the slow learners, the mentally handicapped and the physically handicapped.  Here is the place to pay tribute to the religious orders who for so long were the only people to take care of those handicapped children.  When the day comes that they ask either our Minister for Education or our Minister for Finance for greater financial aid, I hope they will be most generous in giving them whatever they require.  Those religious orders are the only people who have training in this line of helping to teach the mentally retarded and the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Another matter that was plugged here very much today is parent-teacher committees.  Last year I said that our teachers welcome parents.  The only crib our teachers have is that parents do not come to see them more often. If they did there might be a great improvement in their children's education. We know that if these committees are established very few parents are prepared to discuss their children's abilities and problems or lack of ability in front of the neighbours.  Therefore, from that point of view, which is the most important, I feel no progress will be made.  The only way I could see parents helping is in relation to providing hot meals for their children. If they made a start in that direction it would be some help.</P>
    <P>Another field in which the committees may help is in connection with Macra na Tuaithe.  Whilst great interest is shown in parent-teacher committees this is a body which is clamouring for such help.  So far, the parents of Ireland are conspicuous by their absence in that movement. The managerial system has got quite a hammering also.  I have, for the past 30 years, met many teachers and I do not think I have met perhaps more than one half per cent who have ever had any crib.  In some of those cases the fault as often lies with the teacher as much as the manager.  In this sphere the teachers are the greatest judges and if they are satisfied with the system we should be quite satisfied with it also.</P>
    <P>We know that our Minister in the vocational line has advocated a new system of appointment to schools. Everybody welcomes that.  Those of us in rural areas miss out quite a lot. We have no means of further education in rural or domestic science, in music, in art, or in craft work in general.  Those are all trimmings and even though we badly need them we know we must look after first things first.  We look forward to the day when we will have itinerant teachers so that we can get further education in those fields.</P>
    <P>There is a great need at the moment for educating parents of the middle age group.  The best way to do that is <Col N="1046" /> to direct all the media at our disposal, whether radio or television, towards that end.  When we listen to teachers we see now that there is very great irregularity in most homes. There is a great lack of discipline&mdash; and I do not mean punishment.  Many teachers complain that little children arrive at school in the morning and they are bleary-eyed from looking at television all the previous night.  They cannot sit steady and are unable to concentrate even for five minutes.  We know this is caused by television being in most of our homes.  The parents should bestir themselves and see that there is less indiscriminate viewing of television and less indiscriminate picture-going.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan was very distressed that there was too much emphasis on the economic side of education.  We all know the old cliché: &ldquo;Not by bread alone do we survive.&rdquo;  It is equally true that it is no use quoting Yeats, Synge or Seán Ó Riada to empty tummies.  That was proved long ago.  Mons. Coady and experts in the field of rural education and the co-operative movement at the Coady university, Antigonish, proved that you come to Shakespeare through the lobster pots.  Once we have more employment we can direct the spare time of our people, their leisure hours and the enjoyment of them into literary, musical and artistic pursuits. We referred to that the other day when we were talking about industrial training.  We said that in future leisure may present us with greater problems than unemployment.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter is to ensure that the quality and content of education keep pace with the quantity and diversity of education.  We should ask ourselves whether it is more important that genius, brains and money be employed towards sending a man to the moon than feeding and educating the millions of people in developing countries.  I hope that more use will be made of television as a medium for adult education and that we can like Australia and other countries, have a university of the air so that those of us in the middle aged group who, through lack of means or for some <Col N="1047" /> other reason never got a chance of a university education, can make up the ground we have lost.</P>
    <P>I should, at this stage, say something about secondary education and pay a tribute to the religious bodies who have down through the years made education available to many of our people who had not the ability to pay for it.  I should like to congratulate the graduates who set up the little secondary schools in small villages and at crossroads.  They were thus able to bring education within the reach of many people who could not get it otherwise.  We know that those schools in many places are too small. When those people who kept their fees to a minimum go to the Minister I am quite satisfied they will get a fair return for the sacrifices they have made in pioneering lay secondary schools.  I have often pleaded for diplomas for all our skilled workers so that they would get a status of their own side by side with their academic brothers.  If it ever comes to the day when everybody wants to be a white collar worker who will be left to clean our streets?  We all know the truth of the adage: &ldquo;Ar scáth a chéile mairid na daoine.&rdquo;  We need somebody to clean our streets as well as to teach in our schools.  The big aim should be to ascertain how these people could be helped to a fuller income and integrated into the community. We should help to educate these people so that they will fit into the community better, get the best out of living and leave the world the better for their being there.</P>
    <P>This is the Christian perfection of human action, the importance of doing each task that is allotted to us be it ever so menial as perfectly as we can do it.  No matter what degrees or diplomas education confers on us, it fails miserably if it does not give every person a sense of Christian commitment. Were that point to be omitted from our educational system, democracy would perish.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil mo dhóthain ráite agam.  Is mian liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire.  Táim cinnte go racgaidh an toideachas faoina churam <Col N="1048" /> ó neart go neart.  Gura fada buan é agus go neartaí Dia a lámh chun a thuilleadh oibre a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I am also intrigued at the way in which political parties are at this time vying with each other on education.  It certainly is most refreshing from a teacher's point of view. The Minister for Education must be congratulated on his courage in tackling a very serious social flaw in Ireland. That flaw arose from the fact that through lack of means many parents were prevented from sending their children forward for further education.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken one bold step forward and I should like to join with the other Senators in congratulating him.  I think, however, that education should be treated on a non-political basis.  It should be the concern of all and I would deplore any scoring on a party political basis.  We should look upon education in the real sense of politics, politics in the Aristotelian sense, politics for the good of the community and the nation.  If we approach education in this way, for the betterment of all, the community must benefit and the children of this country will get greater opportunities.  Education is a basic service and the efficiency of all services above that basic service will depend on our approach to education. Our levels in art, music, culture, literature, science, industry and agriculture, will depend upon the level of our education.</P>
      <P>There is growing importance attached to education in every country throughout the world at the present time because it has been clearly established that if there are high standards in education there are very high standards generally.  We are living in a competitive world and it is the duty of all of us in the Legislature to ensure that the best is done for the community as a whole so that we as a nation can move confidently forward into the competitive age which is developing, and that the prestige of Ireland can once again be restored, the prestige she enjoyed during the Golden Age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> There has been neglect of our educational system over the years.  Education grew up in a haphazard manner, stemming from movements at different times without any co-operation between them.  In 1831 a Board of Education was established and it undertook the provision of popular education. Teachers were trained in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  The records indicate that 9,000 teachers were required and were sent to do a two-months course so that they could be put into the schools immediately. It is well to recognise the need for a new approach.  The <i>ad hoc</i> training colleges were to produce teachers in a hurry to meet the pupils' needs. They should now be linked with the universities.  Their standards can be upgraded and a liaison can be brought about between the activities of the training colleges and the departments of education in the universities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the emergence of secondary education, it derived from the Intermediate Certificate Act of Ireland, 1879.  It remains a more-or-less private independent sector.  There has been a keep-off-the-grass attitude in the secondary education field.  That is still evident and will be evident over the next few months.  We hope in the general interest that those attitudes which do exist, and I am sure will exist, in the secondary sector will change for the good of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>In relation to the technical and vocational sector, it emerged from the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Education Act, 1900, afterwards amended to the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  The three branches of education stand side by side with very little relationship between them.  They were not properly articulated, never co-ordinated and never harmonised into an educational force.  They act more or less independently. We in primary education had very little interest in what went on in the secondary or vocational field.  Similarly those in post-primary had little interest in what went on in our sector. There was loss in the educational force.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must gear the educational machine so that there will be an end product, a final <Col N="1050" /> objective.  The system often reminds me of a watch without a mainspring. You turn the knob at the top, the wheels start to spin but there is no complete and final action.  There is a loss of power.</P>
    <P>We must see to what extent we can help the Minister, and the other speakers from the various political Parties who spoke on education, in weaving the various branches of education into a coherent tapestry, so that it will signify something in the future. There has been neglect at all levels of education, particularly in the primary and secondary sectors.  In the primary sector the backlog of school building has been evident over the years but there has been a change of attitude here recently.</P>
    <P>In a statement some time ago the Minister gave statistics on school building over the past twelve months and certainly they are most encouraging. In the matter of heating and cleaning, however, I intend at a later stage to make a statement in this regard, as my predecessor, Senator Dr. T.J. O'Connell, did in 1942.  With regard to visual aids, and aids generally, many schools have been sadly neglected and in primary education they are mainly unheard of.</P>
    <P>Over 50 years ago a council for research in education was established in Scotland.  One could also be established in this country to deal with bilingualism, vocabulary geared to the different standards, intelligence tests, and so on.  The Scottish council produces an annual report and the time is long past when such a council should be established here.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the matter of pupil-teacher ratio.  The national schools have been neglected in this regard.  It will be of interest to note that two teachers in the Republic are carrying the same class load as three teachers in Northern Ireland.  The greatest single factor which militates against a child, particularly a slow learning child, is a large class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Report No. 75 of the World Health Organisation on <Col N="1051" /> Mental Handicap states that categorically. It says that a dull or backward child is lost in a group of 15 or 20 children.  If classes were smaller, more individual attention could be given, work would proceed more rapidly, more progress could be made and generally I would say there would be a better understanding between the teacher and the pupils.  Teaching a large class on a hit and run basis &mdash;what I mean is that there is no time to put a finish to the work.  One is trying to beat the clock all the time. The advantages of the small class should be clear to anybody.  When a teacher is teaching a small class he can do far better work; he can have more flexibility in the work; he can teach in depth.</P>
      <P>We have neglected guidance for our students as they leave the national school.  There is no system of career guidance.  Up to this entrance to employment has been most haphazard and fortuitous and children&mdash;I have seen thousands of them in my time&mdash; have drifted out into the world without the slightest idea as to their aptitudes and ability.  They have drifted into dead-end positions in which they have no interest whatever and out of which they moved after a few years and finally emigrated. There was a loss to the nation because of the fact that we did not see fit to give the children and their parents some help when the pupils came to leave school.  It is most distressing to see so many thousands of children leave school and drift out aimlessly into society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In countries in which there is a scheme of career guidance at the stage when children are about to leave school, wonderful work has been accomplished.  In a community in which every person is doing the work in which he is most interested there is more harmony in society.  Of course, one cannot guarantee that if children are guided into various occupations and services they will remain in them, but, by and large, they have a better chance of remaining in those occupations and services.  Follow-up surveys <Col N="1052" /> in other countries clearly indicate that there is great merit in career guidance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of equality of opportunity in education, I should like to say that if we wish to have high standards in our community we should take note of what an eminent educationist wrote shortly after the last war.  Sir Richard Livingstone, Vice-Chancellor at that time of Oxford University, wrote in his work <i>Some Tasks for Education:</i>&ldquo;We cannot be content with mere political democracy, or with a State where the few are civilised and the many merely employed, fed and amused: we should aim at a community whose life throughout is first rate.&rdquo;  The character of a people cannot be judged on the basis of the educated élite, on the education of the top layer.  It is on the norms of the education, tastes, values and standards and culture of the broad mass of the people that a community will be judged.</P>
    <P>Over the years up to the time the present Minister for Education made his announcement about free education large sectors of our people were untapped from the point of view of using their talent in the best interests of themselves and of the nation.  Some of us who have been discussing this question of the difference between the Fianna Fáil plan and the Fine Gael plan think that in a matter involving such an important principle as &ldquo;more education for more children&rdquo; an effort should be made even now to reach some measure of agreement between the various interests.  I do not think that in a matter of such importance as this people should huddle in little private corners of their own.  All interests should be consulted and let us all get together on this important matter for the benefit of the country. Let us stop trying to score little political points over each other in this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will succeed in putting his plan into effect but from what I hear, discussing this matter generally in educational circles, he will meet with a considerable amount of difficulty.  Perhaps it is not the fault of the people who are opposing him. <Col N="1053" /> It might be the fault of his Department who did not take people into their confidence when they were arriving at this important principle of equality of opportunity through education. I hope it is not yet too late to draw all the interests together&mdash;administrators, teachers and others and see what can be done in the best interests of all.</P>

      <P>We think that there is so much at stake.  If the Minister is frustrated in what he is trying to do it will put the clock back and we cannot see how any other plan can succeed as long as the Minister and the Government remain in office.  I think this is a matter which should be seriously considered by the Opposition Parties.  I feel they should approach the Minister in a candid manner and ask: &ldquo;How can we help?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the development of a proper relationship between teacher and parents.  There is a growing awareness among teachers of the importance of this development. Parents play a most important role in the personality and character formation of their children and often when children arrive at school their personality and characters are well and truly formed.  While school can have a reconstructive effect upon the character of the child, it can never entirely eradicate some of the deep-rooted faults which are in the character of a child.  The situation is disastrous if there is conflict between the home and school.  A proper relationship must exist between home and school for the good and happy upbringing of any child.  We cannot see how that can be effected unless teachers know what parents are thinking and parents know what teachers are thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing development of thought in this matter.  Many teachers would welcome more co-operation from parents.  The advantages of parent-teacher co-operation are quite obvious.  Where the parent shows an interest the child will be interested. Where the parent shows no interest, it is only a matter of time until the <Col N="1054" /> child shows no interest.  The child does not sit down and think this out cold-bloodedly.  He just adopts the attitude of the parents.  With co-operation between teacher and parents great work can be done in the eradication of handicaps, in the correction of deviation, in the creation of enthusiasm in the mind of the child for work in school.</P>
    <P>This whole question of parent-teacher association should be carefully examined.  Many people are suspicious of formal parent-teacher associations mainly because they fear that they will interfere with the administration of the school and will be telling the teachers how to do their jobs.  This type of situation is illustrated in A, J. Cronin's book <i>The Citadel,</i> where the mining committee was telling the doctor how to treat children.  The doctor considered this an interference in his professional status and he resented it. Similarly, teachers fear that where there would be formal parent-teacher associations there would be an interference with the working of the school. Nothing but good can flow from the development of a proper parent-teacher relationship.</P>
    <P>We are glad that some time ago the Minister for Education announced the decision to raise the school-leaving age. We think this was long overdue. Senator Murphy referred today to the 1925 Labour Party pamphlet.  That pamphlet was written by a former official of the INTO, Mr. M.P. Linehan. The INTO have, over the years, conducted a campaign for the raising of the school leaving age.  People might think that what Senator Murphy said here today was an unwelcome criticism of the product of the national school.  I should like to say that is not so.  I have taught well over 1,000 children in the school leaving age group and I could see the inadequacies of the education in many school-leavers.  I often pitied those children going out and in a short time they had disappeared and gone to Birmingham, Manchester and so on.  I often thought of what happened to those children.  They left at a most critical stage, the age when the child went through mood swings, what the <Col N="1055" /> psychologists call &ldquo;the April weather of the mind&rdquo;.  I have often heard principals of schools say to children after sixth class: &ldquo;There is no room for you here, there is not enough accommodation, there is overcrowding, you cannot come back&rdquo; and the children were simply turned out into the world. It was most distressing to see this.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Doherty, the psychologist in UCD, stated that a child does not reach the zenith of his intellectual potential until he is fifteen or sixteen years of age.  Yet, we saw fit to turn them out at 13½ or 14.  We have sat back and accepted this.  We accepted the decision of an inter-departmental committee which reported in 1934 that children of fourteen were fit for employment. All world evidence at the present time indicates that children should be kept in school until the age of 15 or 16. The school leaving age in England at the moment is 15.  It is sixteen in Scotland. It is 17 in Russia and it is 17 or 18 in many States of the US.  Yet, we continue to turn them out at 14.</P>
    <P>Many of you have seen a television programme some years ago in which an eminent musician was interviewed by John O'Donoghue in &ldquo;Broad-sheet&rdquo;. She was asked what other activities she engaged in besides music.  She said she was married and that she and her husband engaged in social work in the London area. She was asked if she ever met the Irish there.  She said she did and found them a most delightful and lovable people.  She was asked what characteristic she noticed most and she gave a candid answer.  She said: &ldquo;I have always been struck by the immaturity of the young Irish boys and girls&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are at the crossroads at the present time.  We want to make more provisions for those people and will it be frustrated by technicalities and vested interests?  We think it would be deplorable if this situation occurs. This is not a political matter.  We all enjoyed the chance for further education.  Let us think of the others and put selfish considerations aside, at this hour.  We have failed these <Col N="1056" /> children over the years.  Let us not fail them in the future.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the primary certificate which was mentioned by a number of speakers the statement from Investment in Education indicating that a large number of children did not take primary certificate examination, was raised.  The statement also suggested that the figures might have been somewhat exaggerated.  They are, because the children enrolled for the primary certificate are enrolled at a stage where the teacher need not take into account the children who would be reaching the age of 14 and leaving at the end of the quarters 31st March and 30th June.  In other words, half the year was not taken into account. So the figures are not reliable.  Even suppose they did take the primary certificate examination we should ask ourselves what value would it be to them.  The Council of Education stated that it was useful for the transition from primary to post-primary.  Such is not correct because the weak children sit for the primary certificate examination; they also sit for entrance examinations to vocational or perhaps two or three secondary schools.  They are often in post-primary education by the time the results of the examination come out.</P>
    <P>My own experience in teaching the class which did the primary certificate over a long number of years is this. It had a most distorting effect upon teaching because I found myself, human nature being what it is, concentrating upon three subjects with the object of getting those children over the primary certificate hurdle to the neglect of the other subjects.  They were taught in the others so that they satisfied an inspector but they were not taught as I should be teaching them. I was just fulfilling the regulations because my main concern was to get those weak boys, in particular, through the examination.</P>
