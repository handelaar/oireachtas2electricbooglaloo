    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide for the continuation of the discretionary powers of county councils in relation to the appointment of members of county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The existence of a committee of agriculture in every county first became mandatory under the Agriculture Act, 1931.  That Act, which makes it a statutory function of the county councils to appoint these committees, prescribed also that every committee of agriculture should be composed, at the discretion of the relevant council, either wholly of persons who are members of the council or partly of persons who are, and partly of persons who are not, members of the council.  Provision for the curtailment of this discretion was made in the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964, to the extent of requiring that at least 50 per cent of the members of county committees of agriculture shall be non-councillors.  However, this provision has not yet had effect, because there have been no local elections since the 1964 Act was passed.  The present Bill proposes, however, to rescind the 1964 provision, and so to enable the discretionary powers conferred on the county councils by the 1931 Act to continue unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the body representing <Col N="484" /> all the committees of agriculture, the County Councils' General Council and a number of individual county committees of agriculture and county councils have all made representations against the amending provision in the 1964 Act.  I have carefully reconsidered the whole matter in the light of these representations and I have come to the conclusion that the system which has worked satisfactorily over the past 35 years should not be jettisoned now.</P>
    <P>In this important matter of the appointment of members of committees of agriculture, I am satisfied that the county councillors, who are the elected local representatives of the people and are themselves for the most part farmers or of farming stock, are quite competent to decide who are the persons in each county best suited to serve the interests of the farming community in that county.  I do not believe that the freedom of choice of the local county councils should be inhibited by making it obligatory on them to bring in a fixed proportion of outsiders.  There are no real grounds for assuming that the county councils abuse their discretionary powers, or that they are in general opposed to the appointment of outsiders.  Indeed, on the present voluntary basis, some committees of agriculture have 50 per cent or more outsiders and more than half of them have over 25 per cent outsiders.</P>
    <P>I feel that there need be no fears that persons who would have an outstanding contribution to make on committees of agriculture, although they are not councillors, will at all be debarred by this Bill from being appointed committee members.  On the other hand, if all the county councils are compelled to fit into a rigid pattern of choosing 50 per cent of the committee members from outside their own ranks, as envisaged in the 1964 amending Act, it could well happen that in some counties able men and women who have gone through the stress and test of the local elections and have satisfied their electors of their capacity, would be deprived of the opportunity of serving on committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> It is perhaps well also to remember that the councillor members of committees of agriculture, because of their rate fixing functions, are likely to have a very keen sense of their responsibility in ensuring that the funds of committees of agriculture, derived in part from the rates, are spent to best advantage.</P>
    <P>All things considered, therefore, I feel that we should preserve the long tried and democratic procedure which leaves discretion in this matter to each county council.  The Bill provides for just this and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the smallest Bill to come before this House, certainly since I became a Member of it but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in importance.  At a time when agriculture is being geared or should be geared for participation in the EEC we will, to my mind, take a backward step if this Bill goes through the House.</P>
      <P>The main function of the committees of agriculture would seem to be the spreading of information gained through the knowledge and experience of the agricultural advisers.  We all know that for very many years the agricultural adviser was frowned upon by the farmer.  He looked on him as an interfering person rather than as somebody who was being helpful and it has taken quite a considerable time to accustom the agricultural community to the idea that the advisory service is there to help rather than to hinder.  From that has sprung quite a number of organisations dealing primarily with education in agriculture. From that, again, has sprung a very great improvement in agricultural standards throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to my mind a tremendous pity that if this Bill passes through the House those organisations can be prevented from having representatives on committees of agriculture.  They have quite a lot to offer from their experience. They can recommend changes, desirable changes, I am quite sure, and in the long run the country would benefit from their experience and recommendations because agriculture at <Col N="486" /> one time was looked upon as a way of life but it is now very much an industry, as distinct from a way of life and the consequences of having a completely councillor-composed agricultural committee will tend to make the farmers lose faith in it rather than be helpful.</P>
    <P>When the Bill which this Bill proposes to amend was going through both Houses before, the then Minister, Deputy Smith, was very loud in his praise of the organisations to which I have referred.  He was determined they would have a say and a voice in the running of the agricultural affairs in their counties.  I fail to understand what has happened in the meantime to cause the Government to change the Bill and revert back to the existing position.  I know there is nothing wrong whatsoever with having all councillors on committees of agriculture. By and large&mdash;outside of the larger cities&mdash;whether a councillor is elected in a town or in a country area, his roots are in agriculture and he understands the agricultural problems, even though he may not be actually farming himself.</P>
    <P>The point I want to get across is that we have at present very many more specialists in branches of agriculture. They can make a tremendous contribution and they should definitely be given the opportunity of letting the country at large benefit from their experience. In Kildare we have a 50/50 representation&mdash;50 per cent members of the county council and 50 per cent non-members.  As a matter of fact, the present chairman is not a member of the county council.  Without fear of contradiction or without speaking in any boasting spirit, I think Kildare county committee of agriculture is one of the most progressive in the country. They have advanced a number of schemes.  They have given a lead to other counties in a great many respects in research and in adopting schemes which have not been introduced in the country before.  They have even given, I think, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries food for thought on many of the projects they have introduced very successfully in the county. To my mind, that is the kernel of the case for outside representation.  I am <Col N="487" /> referring here to non-members of the county councils.</P>
    <P>It is a tremendous pity, at a time when there is not the unity in agriculture everybody would wish, that this Bill should be brought in to cause further disunity among the farming community.  They will look upon it as a threat to make sure that certain organisations will not be represented on committees of agriculture.  People outside the committees of agriculture who are not candidates in the local elections may feel they have not the flair for the political activities involved in the county councils and yet may be quite willing to participate and act for the benefit of the people on these committees.  They should be given the opportunity; they should be invited to do so and, if they were invited, I am sure they would be only too willing to act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister, even at this last stage, to withdraw the Bill and give the original arrangement a chance of operating.  It has not been afforded an opportunity of doing so up to now.  We cannot condemn it from the point of view of experience but let us give it a chance and, if it does not work in five years time, we can go back to what the Minister is trying to do now.  I certainly must oppose the measure.</P>

      <P>As one who opposed the 1964 Act when it was introduced here, I am at a loss to know what has brought about this change of heart and what is the motive behind this because it appears to me obvious that this will again be construed as an attempt to deprive certain rural organisations of membership of committees of agriculture.  I should like the Minister to clarify the reasons because I am not satisfied that in his introductory speech he has given any cogent reason as to why we should have this Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1967.  The Minister in his introductory speech makes exactly the same case for amending the 1964 Act that I made when the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, was in the same position that Deputy Blaney occupies today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> In no section of the 1964 Act was it made clear how any rural organisation would get representation on a committee of agriculture when the new county councils would meet to select their committees of agriculture or any of their other committees.  I instanced the example of the County Meath where 29 county councillors would be elected.  A committee of agriculture composed of 20 members would be appointed at their first meeting and the 1964 Act deprived two-thirds of the elected members of that county council from being members of a committee of agriculture.  I pointed out that it was wrong that two-thirds of the elected representatives would be statute barred from sitting on a committee of agriculture. At the same time, there was no section in the Act which made it clear who would fill the other ten positions on the committee of agriculture. I also gave an example as to how they would be filled.  For example, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party on a county council would divide up the number of seats available.  After selecting the members of the council and appointing them to the committee of agriculture in my own county there would be ten left and they would be divided up again between the principal Parties and Party supporters, whether they were members of rural organisations or not, would be appointed to fill the other ten seats that remained. Therefore, you have your committee of 20 composing your committee of agriculture but there was no provision in the Act to ensure that any of the rural organisations, the NFA, Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, would get on the committees of agriculture. This Act was introduced in 1964 with a view to coming into operation during the 1965 Local Government elections which were then due to be held.  The elections were not held in 1965; they were not held in 1966 and now, on the eve of the local <Col N="489" /> elections in 1967, we have this &ldquo;about-face&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister for Agriculture who was then a member of the Government allowed the 1964 Act to be brought before either the Dáil or the Seanad.  If it is stupid to introduce such legislation in 1967 it was equally stupid to introduce such an Act in 1964.  I am at a loss to know why we have this.  I hope that the Minister in his reply will clarify the position and give a more cogent reason for this change of heart than has occurred now because the very case that I made, and I am sure the records of the debate will prove that, is that now advanced by the Minister for this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one aspect of the 1964 Act in particular that I was not very fond of.  I saw that possibly there might be a dispute between those who were county councillors and those who were non-county councillors, those who were responsible for the rates and those who were not, and it could happen that if one member of the county council on that committee was for some reason absent or perhaps had passed away, at crucial meetings the majority, who were not elected representatives, would be the people who would perhaps make the decision on some very costly scheme.  Otherwise I should have liked to see it working for a short time but even then I am not sure that we would have a first-class committee of agriculture.  I feel that the only way we will have a first-class committee&mdash;and I have never served on one, perhaps they are better looked at from inside than outside&mdash; is to have it elected as the county council is elected.  A time will come in the country districts when the committee of agriculture will be as important a body as a county council. They should in some way be elected&mdash; this is a little bit outside the scope of the Bill&mdash;at the same time as the county council is elected as a completely separate body who would deal with purely agricultural matters responsible either to the county council in the matter of rates or limited by the Government as to what they could <Col N="490" /> spend.  However, as I say, that is outside the scope of the Bill.  In regard to the 1964 Act I was always somewhat worried as to how those outsiders would be elected.</P>
      <P>It contained nothing guaranteeing representation to any farming organisation. If farming organisations want that, then this Act was no good to them because the majority of the county council were the people who would elect the remainder.  For that reason it would not be a great improvement on what we have at present in many counties.  We heard that in Kildare it would not make any difference to the present composition of the committee of agriculture and, quite frankly, I am not satisfied with the present composition.  I should like to have seen this getting one session of the county council in practice to see whether it would work.  I am afraid we would have defeated members of the county council or ex-members of the county council elected by their comrades for reasons of loyalty to the committee of agriculture.  This happened in my county on one occasion, perhaps more.  To my mind neither solution is nearly perfect or nearly as good as we should be able to get it. I should like to have seen one balanced against the other&mdash;to have seen this getting a trial for five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene only to comment on the speech made by Senator Fitzgerald who seemed to be at a loss as to the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.  He must not have listened very attentively to the Minister who gave the reasons very clearly in his opening statement.  The Minister said that the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture and the General Council of County Councils, a number of individual county committees of agriculture and a number of county councils, had made representations in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard from time to time quite a lot of sneers and jeers at the supposed absence of democracy.  We have heard quite a lot of jeering and sneering in certain quarters about the <Col N="491" /> failure of Ministers to listen to representations made by the people.  We have heard quite a lot in the Seanad and outside it to the effect that Ministers are a law unto themselves, that they do not listen to representative bodies who make cases.  Here is a classical example of a Minister, in response to a demand from elected representatives, setting out in the best interests of those people who ought to know to introduce a Bill to amend the Act passed in 1964.</P>
    <P>The position is quite clear and there should be no reason why Senator Fitzgerald or any other Senator should have any doubts about it.  I take it they do not dispute that the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture represent the farming community throughout the country. They have called on the Minister to continue the procedure which has worked effectively during the past 35 years and in responding to that request and introducting the Bill the Minister has been carrying out the wishes of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I should like to inquire when those representations were made. Representations were made before the 1964 Bill was passed and I should like to know when the last representations were made.  I am a member of the General Council and I am not aware of any such representations having been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity, which does not occur so very often, of agreeing with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and even partly agreeing with the Leader of the House.  I disagree with the Leader of the House when he implies that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is always amenable to public demand&mdash;that if public representation is made to him he is always prepared to listen to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not found him all that quick to come <Col N="492" /> and listen to us here in the Seanad. Eventually he did come and he listened with a degree of equanimity.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, however, it seems to me that he is perfectly right.  The former situation, as described by him accurately, was that every committee of agriculture was composed at the discretion of county councils, either wholly of persons who were members of councils or partly of persons who were members of councils and partly of persons who were not members of councils.  This seems to me to have been a good practice.  The 1964 Act tried to lay down that half of the membership of county committees of agriculture should by statute be non-councillors. As the Minister has said, this is really a restriction on the nominating rights of county councils.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that county councils are in a strong position to make a reasonable choice and, as between the two situations&mdash;the one under the 1964 Act which laid it down that 50 per cent of those committees must be non-councillors, and the present situation, or the one to which this Bill reverts, in which the council has a clear power to decide what proportion of county committees shall be non-councillors&mdash; it would seem to me that the second situation&mdash;the one being reverted to by this Bill&mdash;is the better, the more democratic.  Though it does not guarantee perfect committees, it would appear to me to be more soundly based and, therefore, whatever the background and whatever the reasons which make it necessary in 1967 to alter the intentions of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in 1964, I think the Minister is right.  Because this kind of opportunity may not occur very often, I take advantage of this occasion to say this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> I did not speak when the 1964 Bill was before the House because I was not too happy about the principle involved, but I was prepared to accept the <Col N="493" /> opinion of my betters and of others who spoke in favour of the Bill.  Still, I did not feel sufficiently convinced to speak in favour of it.  Subsequently, I met members of county committees of agriculture and some CAOs who were directly involved and they convinced me that the change made by the 1964 Act was not for the best.</P>
      <P>I have a clear recollection of meeting a CAO&mdash;not from the area where I live and not from the surrounding counties&mdash;a man well known to me and one I regard as being among the best in the country.  I learned he was part of the deputation to the Department and the Minister for Agriculture objecting to the principles of the 1964 Act.  I discussed it with him in an hotel and I remember distinctly putting this vital question to him: &ldquo;What is your experience as a CAO of members of county committees of agriculture&mdash; are councillor members better administrators?&rdquo; He is a man whose opinion I regard highly, a man of competence above ordinary.  The reply I got from him was that in 99 cases out of 100 he found that members of county committees who were also members of county councils were the better administrators.</P>
      <P>That convinced me.  That man was objective and I knew it.  I know also that the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture made representations on this matter just as CAOs did.  I expect they are also in an organisation but I am not quite sure.  Neither do I know if the chief agricultural organisations, as organisations, have made representations recently or over the past couple of years in this matter.  I fancy they have because it appeared to me that the chief agricultural officers, as a body, seem to think, from any conversations I had, that the principles laid down in the 1964 Act were not for the better.  It is because I am convinced of that that I am speaking in favour of this measure, something I did not do when the 1964 Bill was before this House.  I think Senator Fitzgerald really made a case for this measure when he said that the Minister has now used the exact arguments he used in 1964.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> I accept that.  I have a recollection that Senator Fitzgerald spoke on the 1964 measure and was not too happy about it.  I agree that, in theory, a case could be made for both arguments, the principle involved in the 1964 Act and the principle involved in this measure.  In practice, what happens in the long run is that we are dealing with men and women, the pride and prejudices of men and women and the collisions which take place, something like those which take place on the football field.  We must be practical about this.  In the long run I think that a better committee will emerge by leaving it to the council of county councils, particularly in view of the fact that a person who is competent to judge has informed me that in 99 cases out of 100 the elected member of the council is the best member of any county committee of agriculture. That man had no party political opinion, Labour, Fianna Fáil or otherwise.  That was the view of a person who I consider to be very competent.  That was a couple of years ago.  I suppose that view still holds.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> There is this fact.  A council of a county can still bring in people and appoint them to the committee of agriculture under this measure if they think they are people who may make a useful and worthwhile contribution.  In practice when a council or other such body have that provision it happens that it is not the individuals who may make a useful contribution who canvass for positions and appointments.  Those who are elected members of the county council make the best organisation men.  I am inclined to use the term &ldquo;organisation man&rdquo; because I think in our society at present we have the sort of person who in a large number of organisations will always want to act as spokesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will have a good committee of <Col N="495" /> agriculture if the council of a county have the full responsibility of appointing that committee of agriculture and if they are satisfied that they are people who will make a useful contribution as individuals but if a council of a county were faced with a situation in which rival organisations were jockeying for position on a committee of agriculture you would not have a good committee.  The sort of situation I have in mind is that in which you could have the Leinster Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association jockeying for position on the county committee of agriculture in County Meath.  That could happen.  In fact, it happens at the moment.</P>
    <P>I know, and most Members of this House know, that you had that sort of situation in regard to the election of An Bord Bainne some time ago.  You had different organisations campaigning against one another for election to An Bord Bainne.  I have some experience of Seanad elections, the same as most Members of this House, and my information was that the Seanad election had nothing on the collisions and events that happened in the election of An Bord Bainne between rival organisations, particularly in the South of Ireland.  This happened in other places as well.  If the county council were faced with that sort of thing in Meath, Longford or Leitrim you would not have a good committee.  While, as I say, I am speaking for this measure on this occasion, which I did not do in 1964, I still think there is enough freedom in the Bill to elect a council of a county in Meath, Longford, Leitrim or Galway to appoint people to the committee of agriculture who would not be members of the council.  I think this measure is an improvement on the 1964 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate opened here this afternoon I took the opportunity of consulting the Agricultural (Amendment) Act, 1964, and I think I can say with a certain amount of justification that the fears which have been expressed here, particularly in relation to the purpose <Col N="496" /> of this Bill, on the supposed provisions of this Bill, are hardly justifiable. Before I deal with that I should like to say that it is a pleasure to find myself in agreement with Senator Sheehy Skeffington particularly when Senator Sheehy Skeffington happens to agree with the Minister.  He did, to me, take the obviously correct line in this, the line one would expect any public representative to take and it is this.  The responsibility for policy and for advisory services should be and is properly placed on the elected representatives either of those Houses or of the local councils because, after all, their responsibility to the people who elected them is a very chastening check on the members of any association, council or committee.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion that the reason for dealing with this at all was because of recent events, because of recent difficulties with a certain agricultural association and that this Bill is meant in some way to limit the power of a certain association.  I can see no justifiable foundation for that. Some of the things said were suspicions rather than facts.  The choice still rests with the council under the Agricultural (Amendment) Act, 1964, and under this Bill, which we are introducing here today.  The members of a committee of agriculture who are not members of a county council will be selected under both those Acts by the county council.</P>
      <P>Further, and I think that this is more important, there is no regulation or principle which says that the council must select people from certain organisations, nor was there any such regulation in the 1964 Act.  There was no specification in that Act that certain agricultural organisations of any nature or of any particular type had to be represented on these committees of agriculture, and to suggest now that this was so is making a rather unreasonable and unfair case against this particular piece of legislation.  The only requirement in relation to the quality of type of membership of the committees of agriculture inserted in the 1964 Act was that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person, other than a member <Col N="497" /> of the council, appointed to be a member of a Committee of Agriculture shall be chosen by the Council for such appointment either by reason of his attainments in the practice of farming or the development of agriculture and rural living in the particular locality in which he resides, or by reason of his attainments in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we should at any particular time say that any special organisation should have a statutory right to representation on a body of this sort, because times and trends change; other vocational organisations will develop or be initiated, and to confine the membership of a committee of agriculture to particular associations in being at a particular time would be entirely unreasonable and restrict the basis of the activities of the committee.  It is, therefore, a pity that here in this House when this issue does not arise it is suggested that it does.</P>
      <P>Surely at a time when the local elections are almost imminent we should be unanimous on this point at least, that it is important to confer on members offering themselves for election, and particularly on those who are elected, a responsibility and a status which, unfortunately, apparently, they may not have always enjoyed in the eyes of the public.  To suggest that, because they are not being obliged to select at least half of the members of these committees of agriculture from representatives other than council representatives, this is in some way a political move is entirely irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator O'Quigley or Senator Malone can tell me how any particular association is prejudiced by the change made or how any particular association had a right under the old piece of legislation, then all this easy talk will be justified.  If they cannot it might be reasonable to forget the suspicions and it might be even honourable to withdraw <Col N="498" /> the suggestions.  What we have here is surely a piece of legislation conferring on local representatives, or leaving on them, a responsibility which is entirely theirs.  This type of legislation is very welcome at a time when elected representatives at every level do not appear to enjoy before the public the respect which they might.  Part of the reason for this, I suspect, may be the type of comment heard from some of the Opposition speakers here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite all that Senator O'Kennedy has just said, I still believe that this is a most inopportune time to introduce this piece of amending legislation in view of the unsatisfactory relations between the Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department on the one hand and all the rural organisations on the other.  In view of this country's probable entry into the more competitive European market it is necessary to encourage as many as possible of our more successful farmers to lend their talents, experience and expertise to the committees of agriculture throughout the country.  We need more and more experts, and the term &ldquo;master farmers&rdquo; which would be possibly found a few years ago in the Agricultural Apprenticeship Act will more and more come into its own. Surely in the interests of efficiency and economy representation on these county committees of agriculture should be more or less on a vocational basis.</P>
      <P>I certainly have nothing to say against the county committees of agriculture.  They do quite a good job, but nobody can deny that they should keep abreast of modern trends, and the only way to do that is to have progressive and energetic members on those committees.  The members of the county councils who to a great degree are members of the committees of agriculture, do excellent work and certainly give of their time very freely in the public interest.  I would like to commend them for the work they do in every county throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each of the 27 county committees of agriculture we have had great strides in recent years in the staffing and <Col N="499" /> organisation of the county committees of agriculture.  We have the numbers of personnel and instructors of these committees being increased and there is indeed a reasonably satisfactory service, but that is no reason why we should endeavour at this time to introduce legislation that may be repugnant to any section of the farming community.  For these reasons I regret that the Minister saw fit to introduce amending legislation with the least taste of hostility towards any section of organised farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the arguments put forward by the Opposition.  To take the last speaker, he has paid a tribute to the agricultural committees and the manner in which they have been elected and the manner in which they have been carrying out their duties and functions.  In general, he has paid a tribute to the excellent results arising out of their intense interest and activities on behalf of the agricultural community.  Exactly the same method of selection which was in operation and under which the present committees of agriculture were selected is intended to be continued in this measure.  If any regrets were to be expressed in this House I might have expressed my own regret at the fact that the 1964 measure was ever introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not personally working in the agricultural field, but over many years I was intimately associated with the county councils.  As an official of a county council, I had an opportunity of seeing the working of the council in its various committees and I had actually as a senior official intense interest in the method of selection of the various committees.  I had an opportunity of studying the effects of the work of the various committees in my own department and in other departments.  I can say with full justice that the method of selection by the county council is always fair and reasonable.  It was suggested by Senator Cole that a better committee might be achieved by having an election.  I do not think that that would be so.  I think that the committee of <Col N="500" /> agriculture, the vocational education committee and the other committees which are really selected by the county council were in themselves better administrators and better in their composition than was the county council which was an elected body.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Committee of Agriculture were not quite happy about the measure which was then introduced. They were criticised by Mayo County Council and at that time they should not have said that it was introduced under any political cloud.  It was criticised on its merits but now a measure which reflects the thinking of the agricultural committees and the thinking of the agricultural community is under a cloud because of recent unfortunate happenings among the agricultural organisations.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this measure, or in the 1964 measure, which makes it mandatory on any county council to give representation on a vocational basis to any organisation otherwise than by a selection of the county council in the manner in which they decide best helps out their own interests in the county council.</P>
    <P>I take my own county council again. The Mayo County Council is made up of three main Parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Clann na Talmhan.  It is an extraordinary thing that although they differ, and will differ, and are differing at present on the hustings, they want to consider the various bodies in the county and they have always been able to agree.  That is really a justification of the political set-up in this country.</P>

      <P>There is everywhere the interests of the country at heart and wherever the elected representatives are concerned to look after the interests of the people they are able to sink their political differences, except on the occasion of an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a tribute I should like to pay to the members of all Parties as I knew them on my own county council.  It is a tribute I should like to pay to all <Col N="501" /> Parties in every county.  The interests of the farming community will be safely guarded and are safe in the hands of the elected representatives. The members go before the public and they are open to all the criticism within their own Party.  Mind you, very many more critics will be found within a political Party criticising their own members.  These members are criticised by the opposing political Party and criticised by people in all walks of life but they suffer that and they give their time free in the interests of the public.  In the end, would we be justified in trying their hands in this matter of electing an agricultural committee or in any other way for all that by imposing on them conditions which would make it mandatory on them to select their committees from a particular limited representation?</P>
    <P>It is a fact that county committees of agriculture will select people from some of their own rural organisations. It is also a fact that they may not select any from another rural organisation. Everybody here who has any association at all with rural organisations will agree that they are of different degrees of magnitude and importance. No county council would really be justified in saying: &ldquo;We will pick one from this organisation and one from another organisation&rdquo; because these organisations are not of equal importance and have not an equal impact on the work of agriculture in the community.</P>
    <P>Any regrets that might be expressed in connection with this Bill arise from the fact that it is necessary at all.  The real trouble arose before the measure was introduced in 1964.  The Minister then introduced it in good faith and defended it in this House.  I, like Senator O'Reilly, did not feel happy about it.  I was convinced by feelings in my own county that it was not a wise measure, that it was not in the best interests of the community and that it cast a reflection on the county councils at the time.  It cast a certain reflection on the then committees of agriculture because it was sought to change the voting under which they were selected before that.  At that time, <Col N="502" /> and since, the committee of agriculture has given excellent service on the Mayo County Council, so much so that recently when the chairman of the committee of agriculture declined to go forward for election to the county council the members of the various Parties requested him to stand again for the county council.  He is a man who does not belong to any major political Party but every political Party asked him to stand and it was only under pressure that he stood again. This is testimony of the desire of the various organisations in the county to hold on to a good man when they have got him.  There is also the guarantee that in the future you can reply on the county councils to select people from their various committees in the interests of the people and the country. I am very happy to be able to support this measure which will eliminate the other measure about which I was not very happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>This Bill proposes that the 1964 Bill should be amended and that at least 50 per cent of the members of the committees of agriculture should be county councillors, regardless of their knowledge of agriculture in general.  It does not matter what a member's occupation is.  The political Parties will be required to put one-half of the members at least, on to the committee of agriculture and they have power then to co-opt the remainder of the committee members from political Parties, political supporters, political organisations and various other organisations which are associated with agriculture, such as the NFA, the ICA, the ICMSA, Muintir na Tíre and other very useful rural bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill could lead to a situation in which none of these bodies will be represented on the committees of agriculture because the various political Parties in their own interests may select people who are actively associated with agriculture and who are more closely associated with the political activities of the Party.  This is a regrettable step.  The previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, who brought in the 1954 Bill has, in the meantime, been sacked by his own Party.  This would seem to <Col N="503" /> be a fair Bill in giving representation to the rural community on committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just pointing out that the previous Minister brought this in and he is not here now to support what he did at that time.  Obviously, the Minister is not justified.  He has not made a case in favour of having this change, a case that would be convincing; whereas, the previous Minister for Agriculture made a very good case in favour of opening up the committees of agriculture to the various rural organisations who had the interests of agriculture at heart.  When we examine it, we see there are other committees &mdash; vocational education committees, library committees, scholarship committees and so forth &mdash; on which nonmembers of the county councils are co-opted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Bill permitted what I considered to be a very desirable situation &mdash; an independent committee of agriculture, outside politics, operating the various schemes within the framework of county councils.  These committees of agriculture render very valuable assistance to the rural community, particularly in agriculture and horticulture.  I know Dublin County Committee of Agriculture made the <Col N="504" /> first move towards the establishment of a very useful growers' co-operative society which has helped the growers to find markets for their produce, organise the marketing, sell their produce and present it properly to the various supermarkets and shops.  That was a very useful contribution that committee of agriculture made and the non-council members on that committee certainly made very valuable suggestions in relation to the ultimate organisation and setting up of that society.  I am talking only about Dublin County Committee of Agriculture but I am quite sure that throughout the country the various county committees of agriculture have done a very good service for the people associated with agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to move backwards instead of forwards.  At the moment we are looking forward to going into the EEC and getting a market for the various types of produce and livestock from our land. Therefore, it is all the more important that people who are actively associated with agriculture and making a living from the land should be on these committees because these are the people whose experience and suggestions will be most valuable in achieving whatever benefits the Common Market will have for this country.  It is proposed now, through this Bill, to dispense with the 1964 Bill which had all this in view and the case was made in favour of having this kind of vocational body established as a committee of agriculture in the various counties with those purposes in view.  Now we have a situation in which it will be political prestige which will count on the committees of agriculture&mdash;not representation of agriculture and horticulture.  Let us face it.  Those of us on the county councils know that when the committees of agriculture are being filled up&mdash;after the county council members have been elected to it&mdash;the co-options are then made.  Of course, I cannot imagine any Fianna Fáil member of the newly appointed committee of agriculture proposing that a person who is known to be a Fine Gael supporter should go on that committee and give the committee the benefit of his advice and <Col N="505" /> guidance.  I am quite sure that the Fianna Fáil Party will not consider that but will consider the political credentials of the person they propose to put on that committee.  That is why it will not be as good a committee as we could have if we just recognised experts in the various fields of agriculture and horticulture as representatives of the various associations I mentioned.  I would go so far as to suggest that this is actually a spiteful move on the part of the Government because, if the 1964 Bill were let stand, and had we had the 1965 county council elections we should have had at that time, we would now have a vocational body operating as a committee of agriculture in the various county councils instead of a body dominated by at least 50 per cent of the county councillors, probably in the majority of county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You could adopt some such system as was going to be adopted in 1964.  A very good case was made at that time by the previous Minister for Agriculture in favour of the amendment which he brought in and in favour of the results which would follow.</P>
      <P>We have in recent years, in the past 15 or 20 years, people associated with agriculture who realise the importance of science and techniques in connection with agriculture.  They have imparted this knowledge to the ordinary people earning a living from the land.  These people on the land regard them now as their leaders.  These organisations and associations have very good voluntary committees and do a great amount of voluntary work.  They do it on an objective basis.  They have nothing in view except the achievement of something better for the agricultural and horticultural industry with which they are associated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we will have to oppose this Bill.  I feel it is most unfair to the rural organisations.  The ICA, for instance, have done a wonderful job for the community at large, particularly in relation to handcrafts, <Col N="506" /> cooking and various other domestic economies and sciences.  Again, they will be deprived now of having members on the various committees of agriculture unless they have a political tab. We must be clear about that.  If a member of the NFA, ICA, Muintir na Tíre or the ICMSA does not wear a political tab of which the majority of members on the council portion of the committee of agriculture are in favour, he will not get on to it.  If you like, they will be tied hand and foot by the political outlook of those who proposed and co-opted them to the various committees. In other words, you will now have committees of agriculture which are purely and simply political organisations instead of voluntary organisations which are genuinely and sincerely interested in the employment of new methods and new techniques.  That is a very great mistake and even at this stage I would suggest to the Minister when it goes through the next Stages that he might even consider reducing the number of councillors.  Even if he were to reduce the number of councillors by less than 50 per cent you would not then have a situation in which the members of the various associations would have to wear a political tab before they had any hope of getting past the various political Parties. Therefore, if he reduces by less than 50 per cent county council representation there will be some chance of turning it into a vocational body.</P>

Then all his works and pomps are denounced.  The 1964 Act which we are now amending was the work of a Minister for Agriculture who has been dethroned, replaced or has resigned but, at any rate, who is no longer Minister for Agriculture.  It seems to be necessary, therefore, to complete the killing off of this man by introducing a Bill even before it has got off the ground, before it has been experimented with, repealing what he did in the 1964 Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are living at a time in this country when there is a great deal of talk about taking agriculture out of politics, when everybody says that agriculture should not be made the plaything of politicians.  If a political Party exercises discretion and restraint in a row between one section of the agricultural community and the Government they do not sometimes get the credit that they ought to get because they have exercised that restraint.  It is a good thing and right and proper in the interests of the nation that restraint should be exercised.  I want to suggest to this House that the <Col N="509" /> 1964 Bill which provided that 50 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture need not be drawn from politicians went a good distance towards putting on committees of agriculture persons with no identifiable political affiliation.  I think that it would have been a good thing to people every county committee of agriculture with persons with no declared political affiliation in a local election.  In so far as this Bill rejects that principle I think that the House ought to reject the Bill.  I think it was a good thing to get away from peopling committees of agriculture with persons of political Parties purely in the interests of agriculture, that here we are dealing with a dying section of our community, with an industry that is on its last legs.  One of the things we ought to try to do is to unite all sections of the community in an effort to save rural Ireland and to save agriculture from the fate to which it seems to be destined as long as the Government continue their present policy.</P>

      <P>Let there be no doubt about it, it was under Fine Gael Ministers for Agriculture that the agricultural population of this country prospered and they will not prosper again until there is a return to a Fine Gael Government and a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture.  Nobody can say that the former Minister for Agriculture was a dashing success.  When I heard Senator O'Kennedy read out the requirements for a committee of agriculture of 20 or 25 and contrasted these requirements with the knowledge of agriculture of Deputy Haughey I was vastly amused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said for insisting on a minimum number of persons not to be drawn from the elected representatives of the people on committees of agriculture, the minimum number may be 33? per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent.  There <Col N="510" /> is no doubt that there is quite a number of people in this country whose disposition does not fit for the ardours and the disagreeable work involved in seeking election to local authorities. Some people may say that if they are not prepared to do that they should not be put on committees of agriculture. That might be one view but if committees of agriculture or any other committee can benefit from the advice and help and work of these people then, in the interests of agriculture and of the local agricultural population, they should be put on the committees.</P>
      <P>If they do not happen to like the rigours of the battle for political honours on local authorities that is not any good reason for depriving the rural community of their services if they are prepared to give them.  In my experience, what is happening in this country is that the people in political life have too much to do and cannot do all the things they have to do as they wish to do them and are capable of doing them.  If people are on committees of agriculture, health committees, vocational education committees, mental hospital committees, harbour boards and so on the same people are all the time being called on to do this, that and the other job and their help and the services that they can give are being impaired.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is a very good idea that people who are not prepared for the arduous life of politics are the people with more time at their disposal for work on county committees of agriculture.  I would have thought that in modern times the trend should be towards unifying both town and country. We are getting to be a smaller community all the time and there are many people in the business world&mdash; managers of co-operatives, managers of creameries, people in business who have business acumen&mdash;who should be asked to serve on county committees of agriculture because very often they know the markets, they know all about prices of fertilisers and things of that kind.  Their knowledge should be made available for county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that the Minister <Col N="511" /> will say there is nothing to prevent, under the 1931 Act which was introduced by a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, councils putting up to 50 per cent of non-council members on committees of agriculture if they want to but the introduction of this legislation seems to me to be against the trend we should all like to see developing.  Apart altogether from these observations, which would be more apposite in support of the 1964 Bill if it were before us, the Minister in his pithy statement to the House recommending the passing of the Bill has not given to my mind any cogent reasons for the repeal beyond saying that he received representations from committees of agriculture and county councils.</P>
    <P>He has not told us from which committees of agriculture or which councils or when last they were received.  That is information the House would have found valuable. Is there a majority of committees of agriculture, a majority of county councils that have done this and what was the nature of their representations and when were they last received? If the Minister really wanted to persuade the House that account should be taken of these representations he might have given the House the benefit of this information when introducing the Bill.  This Bill has been introduced solely because of the existing political situation between the Minister and a large section of the farming community in this country and because it is introduced in that spirit I will not be a party to being vindictive against the rural community and I propose to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I may be accused of not making a very good case for this Bill but I assert that I made a much better one for it than has been made against it and, indeed, a much more logical one.  I might add a little to what I have already said, and if Senator O'Quigley were serious in the case he made against the Bill he can find the information in the Official Dáil Report where he will find the names of the committees in question.  The first bodies to make representations, he will find, <Col N="512" /> were the General Council of Committees of Agriculture&mdash;that was subsequent to the amendment being passed &mdash;and the General Council of County Councils which embrace all county councils as do the General Council of Committees of Agriculture embrace all county committees of agriculture. There were also the county committees of agriculture for Carlow, Clare, Laois, Tipperary, Waterford and Westmeath, all very much in favour of the 1964 amendment being rescinded.  These were all subsequent to the passing of the 1964 Act.  The last of these I am aware of was in the month of June or July, 1965, approximately a year after the amending legislation was enacted. We also had representations from the county councils of Roscommon and Tipperary North Riding.  They are the overall names of the bodies in question, one of them representing all the county councils in the country and the other all the committees of agriculture in the country, plus a number of individual county councils and county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>Because these representations were made subsequent to the 1964 amending Act being passed, it is unlikely that any of these bodies were supporters of the Fianna Fáil Government and Minister for Agriculture who introduced that amending Act.  If the Senator wishes to go back and see who was really against it at that time he will find that the majority of county councils, the majority of committees of agriculture were supporters of his own Party who spoke against the 1964 amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the unique experience of being in the Dáil a week or two ago when a colleague of Senator O'Quigley, Deputy L'Estrange, waxed eloquent on the topic and he challenged me <Col N="513" /> to name even one committee which passed a resolution condemning the 1964 Act.  Of course, his own county committee of agriculture were among them but the laugh was that it was he who proposed it and he challenged me to name one committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither Deputy L'Estrange nor I makes his money in that way.  We do not do much in that way.  The Senator may know more about it.  All these bodies are on record as having passed resolutions subsequent to the enactment of the 1964 amendment and the question may well be asked when and why did I change around to the present amendment or rescinding motion.  It is because I, my Party and the Government have changed our minds and we are not afraid to say so.  As distinct from some other Members who were against the 1964 amendment and who are now against the deletion of the 1964 amendment, I am saying we have changed our minds and are rescinding the 1964 provision before it becomes effective because we believe it is not in the best interests of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>There was then the imminence, as we thought, of the 1965 local elections. We have had time since to look to see whether there was substance in the resolutions passed by these bodies. We were satisfied that there was substance in them and we decided to introduce this rescinding Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and I usually agree on many local government matters and I hate to think we reached a point of disagreement on this occasion.  He told us that the arguments I used in my introductory speech today were the same arguments he used against the 1964 amending Bill and yet he said my arguments were not sufficient to justify the passing of the Bill today before the House.  Now, if I read the Senator aright, it is quite obvious he made a poor case of his story in 1964.  If my story is inadequate today, and it is similar to his in <Col N="514" /> 1964, both of us at two different times thinking alike, and he was right in his arguments, then I am right in mine now.  If his argument was worthwhile then, mine is worthwhile now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that there were no amendments proposed by the Opposition Parties at the time of the passage of the 1964 Act to give any real recognition to those voluntary bodies.  Now, the same people who had that opportunity at that time to propose amendments to give these voluntary bodies direct representations, the people who slipped up then, or did not think then as they appear to think now, come along today shedding crocodile tears about our taking from the voluntary bodies something which they had not or never had.  As the Leader of the Seanad on the Government side said in an intervention earlier, if you do not change the selectors, much difference will it be in any amending Bill going through this House or the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council have been, and will continue to be, the selectors of the committee of agriculture.  At the moment they have complete discretion, and they will continue to have this discretion, to appoint all the members to the county committee of agriculture, except one member who must be a councillor, as outsiders, if there is available to them, and to their knowledge, people who are worth putting on and who would join with the other members of their own council.  There is scarcely a county in the country which has not outsiders.  Many of those outsiders have not adherence to any political Party.  If one Party, say, the Fianna Fáil Party, were pigheaded <Col N="515" /> enough to put something through for Party political purposes, surely the Fine Gael Party or any other Party would not be pigheaded at the same time and ignore good people, and not only good but better than some of the elected members who are available and who are prepared to act on the councils?  If one Party errs, surely it is most unlikely if Fianna Fáil were to err, that Fine Gael would slip up and follow their bad example.  Surely the Labour Party people who are also on those councils in different parts of the country would not follow their example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if all those people who represent the three main Parties slipped up, surely there would be the odd upright, self-righteous, outspoken public representative, the Independent, of no Party who would get up and wipe us all out by putting us to shame and saying: &ldquo;You left so and so out while you put on this mug here&rdquo;.  Surely Fine Gael are not trying to tell us that this system would be such that all Parties would be wrong all the time and put on no good people while they had any political hacks to put on.  This is the impression to be got from what has been said here.</P>
      <P>I have said this before but it is no harm to repeat it.  I consider it a reflection at this particular time, a very outstanding reflection, and one which I hope will be taken note of, that for purely political expediency purposes, the main Opposition Party, both in this House and in the other House are opposing this Bill now and in so doing, the arguments they use are a reflection not only on Fianna Fáil councillors but on their own Fine Gael councillors, and prospective potential councillors and it is also a reflection on the calibre of their own candidates who are going forward in the coming elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not taking leave of his senses but he wants to get this thing clear.  The county committees of agriculture, as selected in the past, and, according to those same speakers who say that they wish to have a change, give good service. Senator Rooney and some other Senators paid tribute, in my own hearing, to the worth of those county committees of agriculture in the past.  How then, if they are aware of the worth of those people, do they seek to have a change and to prevent the passage of this Bill which will enable the committees of agriculture in the future to be selected in exactly the same manner as they have been selected in the past.</P>
      <P>You cannot have it both ways.  That is all I can say to the Senators who talk in glowing terms of the service rendered by those people and in reverse terms of what it will be in the future if we do not change the selection of the committees, assuming we have the 1964 Act in operation.  How can anybody assert that there will be a possibility or a probability, not to talk of a certainty, that outstanding people will not be available if we still had the 1964 Act?  That being the case why all the talk about it now?  Why not revert to what we know?  Why not leave it as it has been, as it has worked up to the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also add that my own opinion is that I would rather leave to the full discretion of the council the selection of outsiders to the degree they think is good and proper for the carrying on of their agricultural committee bodies than to oblige them to select 50 per cent from outside when in fact 50 per <Col N="517" /> cent good and bright people might not be available?  You could have the crazy situation where there would be 50 per cent outside membership available and willing to serve, with the requisite knowledge, with the specialist value we hear about, and 50 per cent members from outside who were not better than those within the council itself.  Would it not be a ludicrous situation?  This could well happen.</P>

When somebody tells you that there seems to be some special virtue in <Col N="518" /> people who have no declared politics, I think it is about time we considered this matter.  We are all in politics, and it is time we dropped this approach, this talk of the cynics outside, who are already too many, or those who have declared politics as if they have some sort of plague to be kept away from.

      <P>The House and the Senator know that I have views about that, and I have not changed my views in relation to this House.  It is true that we have changed our minds, and the reason we are now taking this course urgently is the fact that there will be local elections on 28th June and <Col N="519" /> thereafter on 12th July or some other such date, the first meetings of the new councils take place, and at those meetings the election of this and every other sort of committee takes place. Therefore, if we are to have it changed within the next five years, we must change it now or not at all.  This is the urgency of the matter at this particular time.  This is why it is being brought forward now, and not for the other reasons that are being alleged here.</P>
      <P>There is not only a suggestion that we are taking from the voluntary organisations but there is the innuendo, on some occasions openly expressed, that we are keeping the NFA off these committees.  The NFA will get on them or not get on them depending on the wishes of the councillors elected on June 28th.  This was the case; this will be the case whether or not this Bill is passed, so that there is no point in trying to make out that this Bill is there not only to prevent all voluntary organisations getting on but particularly to block the NFA from getting on.  They can either get on if this is passed or they cannot.  The passage of it will neither help them or hinder them.  If the majority of each council wish that certain people should be members of the committee, then I hope that they will be chosen not simply as members of any organisation but because they are the best.  I hope they will be chosen because they are worth it for the contribution they can make, and not for the organisation they represent. This is the essence of the selection I would like to see, and nothing that we do in this Bill is going to interfere with that spirit which I hope will be carried out on 12th July.  It is a rather significant date and I hope will be a big day when these committees return after the election on June 28th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really true that one can be led away from relevant debate by what has already been said.  If one does not <Col N="520" /> make some reference to it, he is accused of running away from it; if he does, it merely adds to the general irrelevancy already talked.  The Bill is straightforward. We propose to wipe out by section 1 the 1964 amendment which obliged councils as and from the next following election, which is June 28th, to select absolutely 50 per cent outsiders for the committees of agriculture. We are changing that and restoring the 1939 Act provision which is that all the members, bar one, need not be councillors.  This is what we are asking to have changed.  I believe it is right that we should change and that we were wrong in proposing the 1964 measure and therefore should retrace our steps.  Instead of being criticised for that rather should we be praised, and likewise in regard to the Land Bill mentioned here.  Criticism is being levelled at us because we have refused to accept a principle we adopted earlier, and finally on full consideration have replaced it.  This surely is good, wise, prudent, reasonable, well considered government rather than that we should not be willing to make a change on which we are convinced, lest we be criticised for changing.  We and the Government will change our minds when we are convinced that it is in the best interests of the country to do so, even though our political opponents will try to make an embarrasing situation out of that change.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a worthwhile principle that should commend itself to the House, and I hope it will be accepted and that we will get it through and ensure that what we have known and thought will be made clear to the public, to show the people approaching June the 28th as electors that we as Members of the Oireachtas have confidence in those who will be elected, and that we fully agree that they are the people who should be free to select these committees of agriculture throughout the country.</P>

      <P>We have time and time again had to protest against the failure of the Government so to organise their business that we should not have to rush through Bills in this House.  According to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries here this afternoon they knew in July, 1965, that this Bill would be amended and they did nothing about it until they introduced it on the 24th May.  I do not propose to encourage that kind of approach to the business of this House and I will not agree.</P>

Another thing, I resent very strongly the insinuation he made that Government business is badly organised.  The point at issue is whether Senator O'Quigley and his Party will try to ensure that when their speakers get an opportunity of contributing on Bills they will realise there are 59 other Members of this House who might like to speak and not monopolise the time by hour-long speeches on everything; then there would be no delays.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a point on this.  I accept that a number of the amendments put down were, by any reasonable standards, probably out of order.  I am a little unhappy, however, about two, amendments Nos. 9 and 11 and in particular amendment No. 11.  The point I want to make, and it is one of general application to the business of this House, is that amendment No. 11 sets out to amend a section and subsection of the original Act which, in fact, is being amended.  The issue here is the question of the appeals to the Appeal Board in respect of prohibited books.  Now the ruling here I think is that in a Bill to amend the Principal Act, it is not possible to go outside the Bill as read a Second Time and amendments must deal only with provisions of the Principal Act as affected by the Bill.  There is apparently some disagreement on the interpretation of &ldquo;as affected by the Bill&rdquo; but I submit that the precedents all relate to cases of an entirely different character.  There are three precedents given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to enter into a discussion on this general point at this stage.  The Senator has raised two points&mdash;one a general point which we cannot discuss in the House here, the other the particular point of the ruling out of one of these amendments.  On the particular point raised the Chair has, as is usual, given this amendment among others most careful consideration and come to the conclusion that it is outside the scope of the Bill at present before the House.  Accordingly, <Col N="525" /> once that ruling has been made, it must be accepted.  Whether other discussions take place elsewhere on the general question does not arise.</P>

      <P>I accept, of course, with respect, the ruling of the Chair in this matter, but I would urge a reconsideration on the ground that the purpose of this Bill is twofold&mdash; to lift certain prohibitions from banned books and to provide for the reprohibition of certain works.  This amendment of Senator FitzGerald deals with certain conditions related to the reimposition of a prohibition.  It would, therefore, seem to me to be very germane to one of the two main purposes of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), line 24, to delete &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two amendments down.  One is for the purpose of changing the time-limit of twelve years to seven years and the other is for the purpose of changing it to ten years.  The case I should like to make is that twelve years is too long.  I should prefer a seven year period.  We are all supposed, in fact, <Col N="526" /> to be renewed in a period of seven years.  It would seem to me that this would be an equitable maximum period of time for which a ban would apply.  All of these, of course, can be reconsidered under this very Act at the end of this period of seven years. But if the House does not agree to the reduction of the twelve year period to seven my hope would be, and I am supported by other Senators in that, that at least the period of twelve years would be reduced to ten.  I would hope also that the Minister might agree to this.  We are approaching the period during which the decimal system will be introduced into our currency and weights.  Why not introduce it into the period for which a book will be banned?  Ten years is a nice easy period to calculate.  A book banned in 1967 is banned until 1977.  It renders the operation in practice a good deal easier.  It is, in fact, half the period that the Minister first mentioned and it would seem to me reasonable then to ask the Minister and the House to agree.  I would prefer the period of seven years but if they do not agree to that to agree at any rate to reduce the twelve years to ten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this proposal.  In putting down this amendment and, indeed, they were two separate amendments both to the same effect which have been joined together here, I had several things in mind.  First of all, I thought I would like to probe a little further the reasoning which led the Minister to twelve years.  Is it purely a question of a compromise or is there any kind of rational basis for it?  Of course this is not a thing we would be precise about in any real sense.  Nevertheless, we have to apply our judgment as best we can to what is a reasonable period during which contemporary standards may have changed requiring reconsideration of decisions of this kind.  Ten years was the period that was suggested to me certainly by a number of people who have some expertise in these matters. It is a period that was suggested in the Dáil and it has a further rationale in this particular case because I think I am correct in saying the present <Col N="527" /> Censorship Board, the present membership, took office and the previous board was replaced very largely, just ten years ago.</P>
      <P>The House may recall that the chairman and other members resigned at a certain point in 1957 and there was a turnover in the board, a majority of the members changing in that year.  It is certainly true that since then the decisions of the board, while one may argue about them and there are cases I would disagree with, have not given rise to anything like the volume of objection and protest which was the case previously.  It seems logical, therefore, that if we are going to pick a period of years which is approximately of the order of ten to twelve we should make a clean sweep of it and pick a period of ten years, which means that all the decisions of the previous board which gave rise to these difficulties, would immediately come up for review at this stage and have to be reviewed without waiting a further three years for that to happen. It seems to me logical not merely because of the decimal system but because of the fact that it is just ten years since the board changed.  It is a period I should like to see unless the Minister has some rather specific reason for twelve years.  I think from what he said that he arrived at it rather as a compromise and I would like him to reconsider it and take into account what I have mentioned which I think is relevant, that we should relate this fact to when the board changed and since when we have had a much smaller volume of complaints about decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of change in contemporary standards is, of course, a difficult one.  It is evident&mdash;in all the debates this point has been made by some person&mdash;that while standards of morality do not change standards of reticence do and contemporary standards of reticence change considerably and at a reasonably rapid rate in modern circumstances.  Looking back to ten years ago things that would not have been spoken of are freely spoken of now.  I can recall in the early 1950s when a statement was issued by the Pope in relation to matters of birth <Col N="528" /> control it was regarded in Ireland as being such an inappropriate subject for discussion that the statement was published in full only in two papers not connected with his religious denomination&mdash;the <i>Evening Mail</i> and <i>Irish Times</i>.  Other papers more closely connected with Roman Catholicism did not carry his statement and we had to go to these other papers to find out what he said.  Yet within a few years there was no difficulty about discussing these problems publicly not because of any change in moral standards in the matter by anyone, any religious authority or otherwise, but because standards of reticence had changed.  The people had become more used to talking frankly and plainly about matters of this kind.  The speed with which these changes take place is quite considerable. Within a very short period of years the attitude of people changes and matters which could not be printed in national newspapers become a matter of normal discussion and debate.  To impose a period of more than ten years seems to be a bit excessive in the light of current events in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not think the difference between ten years and 12 years is important in itself but I thought it right to put down an amendment so that we could discuss this matter further, so that the point I made about the composition of the Censorship Board could be considered and so that the Minister could give us a little more of his mind on the time limitation and tell us whether on reflection he does not think now, with the guidance he has received from the Seanad, that he should come down from 12 to ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This reminds me very much of fair day bargaining as to which year or period we should settle for.  I have been reasonable towards meeting the point of Senators Sheehy Skeffington and FitzGerald.  I have reduced the period from 20 years to 12 years.  It is of course a matter on which opinions differ.  It is obvious straight away that an unduly short limitation period would render the whole censorship <Col N="529" /> system nugatory.  I have defended the basic principle of a code of censorship run on sensible grounds.  If one reduced the limitation period excessively, one would drive a coach and four through the whole censorship system.  If the Censorship Board's decisions could be changed in two, three or five years the whole system would be made nonsense of.</P>
      <P>The question is what is a reasonable time.  After the debate on Second Reading in the Dáil, I considered that 20 years was possibly too long, that some shorter limitation period should be introduced to reflect the changing attitudes that have been mentioned.  I was pressed to take ten years, and indeed five years was mentioned in the Dáil, and seven years and ten years have been mentioned here. On balance, I think 12 years is probably about right.  The reason I was finally inclined towards 12 years is that it is already a recognised statutory limitation period.  It is well known that 12 years is the prescriptive period in regard to the adverse possession of land.  It is well recognised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On that basis I felt that because 12 has been established <Col N="530" /> as a precedent, it could be transposed from that field to this field.  As I have said, I was in accord with the general view in the Dáil that 20 years was too long.  At the same time, I could not go too far in reducing the limitation period because as I said earlier, it would render the whole system nugatory.  I struck on 12 years as being a reasonable compromise.  I am easy on ten years or 12 years but I do not think there is very much advantage in going down to ten years and even Senator FitzGerald has conceded that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the lifting of the ban on any book that has been banned after a period of 12 years.  I think it has been well said on Second Stage and I do not want to say it again at too great length, that this is a progressive measure and one to be welcomed.  This section is quite clearly in my view the best section in the Bill.  I should just like to say that one of the considerations which bedevils all discussions of censorship is the fact, which the Minister recognised in his opening speech, that the same book may have a good effect on some and a bad effect on others.  One of the difficulties is that censorship is a subjective thing.  It would be quite wrong to say that no book ever did anybody any harm.  I personally believe it is quite possible for a book to be harmful and quite possible for a book to be good.  One of the things this section deals with is a recognition of the fact that legislation itself recognises that standards by which we judge whether a book will do good or bad will vary from year to year, or at any rate from a dozen years to a dozen years.  This has to be recognised as factual: that, as I say, the same book may have widely different effects on different people.  I might say, that in general, in this Assembly I find the official reporting very accurate, but I did notice the other day when I made the point on Second Stage that other things besides literature can arouse sexual passions that when I said &ldquo;the mini-skirt, for instance&rdquo;, in the first version of the transcript this read &ldquo;the Minister for instance&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister will be disappointed to learn that a later hand had crossed out &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and reestablished &ldquo;mini-skirt&rdquo;.  I do not know whether this was the hand of the reporter or the hand of the reviser. This is a recognition of the fact, however that it is not only literature which may have this deleterious or beneficial effect on people.</P>
      <P>I am very interested also in this question of banning and of later lifting a ban.  I notice that Senator Gerald Boland was once in the unhappy position for him of having to work the censorship, though, he said, he was opposed to censorship by legislation because it was unworkable.  I feel that he is quite right in that.  I also feel that it is a pity when we are talking about lifting the ban, and also of sometimes re-imposing it, we do not take other things also into consideration. I will refer to that under section 3. In general, I think that this section is to be welcomed.  I am only sorry that the 12 years period has not been at least slightly reduced.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to ensure that immediate steps are taken to deal with the situation that will arise as a result of the enactment of the section.  The immediate result will be that within seven days of its enactment, the printed list of banned books will disappear as completely out of date.  Until something is done, then, there is nobody to know which books are banned or which books are not.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that immediately an adequate up-to-date list which will include only the books that have been banned within the past 12 years will be available; otherwise customs officers and so on will presumably be in difficulties <Col N="533" /> about which books are banned or not.  I would not worry about the customs officers except that they might resort to the existing list to see if a book was listed on it.  I hope that immediate steps will be taken to publish a proper printed list of the books which will be officially banned as from seven days after the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that each year we will have changes because of the 12 year period in the list of banned books, we should have, in addition, the deletions as on each December 31st, since there will be a new set of books each year taken off the list of banned books because of the operation of the 12 years period.  I would suggest that immediately after 31st December of each calendar year from now on, a further list should be brought out of the books which as from that date are not banned.  It is important that active steps should be taken to see that this is done in the future.</P>

This is for the information of booksellers, publishers and everybody concerned with the trade and for the benefit of the public generally.  We will have this list circulated immediately after the passing of the Bill.</P>

This is really the key section in the Bill: the rest of the Bill is subsidiary.  I think the section does go a long way to meet the main grievances which existed against censorship here, and that was the unlimited period of time which operated in regard to a prohibition order.  This is an indefensible position and has caused, I would say, well over 90 per cent of the various complaints against the code.</P>

It is, of course, the end of the calendar year, but I wonder whether he has consulted with the book trade on this subject, if books are going to be unbanned which are of some importance or literary merit.  I know of schools which have problems with books they want to put on the course but cannot because they are banned, and would it not be worthwhile consulting the book trade on this point? It could be that by fixing the date mentioned, the Minister will miss the Christmas trade for a number of these books.  Is it not something to consult the trade about?</P>

As books come up for review, some of them books of merit, it is a pity that they should be kept out in that way because of a date fixed in an arbitrary fashion instead of a date that <Col N="536" /> would be more convenient to all concerned.

From the point of view of general convenience, particularly with regard to members of the public, there are great advantages in having the calendar year system.  This way one <Col N="537" /> would have, I hope, an annual list completed for 1966, 1967 and 1968, and so on.  Then, everyone would know that the new list would come into force on January 1st and there would be no problem.  If there were a date like December 1st or November 15th, there would be an element of confusion as to exactly when the new list came into force.  There are great advantages from a general point of view in having it on January 1st.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 37, before &rdquo;, under&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after due re-examination&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the Censorship Board, if it decides to re-impose a ban on a book which has had the ban removed by this automatic process under section 2, shall be obliged to re-examine it and not merely just decide to re-ban it. We already have the Minister's assurance that even with the section as it stands there will be an obligation on the Board to re-examine.  I should like to quote what the Minister said the last time we debated this, in volume 63, No. 6, at columns 479-480:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested that the Board could re-ban without re-reading.  That is not the case.  The Senator was concerned in case the provision in section 3 did not place the obligation on the Board to re-read the book concerned. That is not so.  The 1946 Act provides that the Board may only make a prohibition order, having duly examined the book.  This <Col N="538" /> requirement still stands in regard to any such examination.</P>
    <P>My feeling&mdash;although I am sure the Minister is correct in this&mdash;is that it would not do any harm to have the words &ldquo;after due re-examination&rdquo; included in the actual Bill, because section 3, as it stands at present at subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board may, under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in respect of which a prohibition order has ceased or will cease to have effect by virtue of section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>This is the section, then, which permits the Censorship Board to make a further prohibition order and, although it does refer to section 7 of the Act of 1946, it does not make it quite specific, as the Minister did in his speech, that they can only do this after this due re-examination.  I would rather fear that unless we include these words, there might be some argument as to whether section 3, as it now stands, necessarily implies full re-examination. I should feel happier, therefore, if these three words &ldquo;after due re-examination&rdquo; could be inserted in section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that they should read the books.  I shall make my own remarks on the amendment.  It is partly a point I was raising on the previous section that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is probably trying to get at.  A list, the Minister said, will probably be published now of books which are the only banned books now in existence, that is, those banned within the last 12 years.  My point, which I attempted to raise on section 2&mdash;and which I think was partly relevant thereto&mdash;is that the customs officials or any private person might get a list of banned books and say: &ldquo;Well, these are the only banned books relevant; I can bring in any of the others&rdquo;, or a publisher might say: &ldquo;There are a lot of copies of that book on the shelf not very saleable in this country; I will send them over to Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Is there any way of stopping that except by the Censorship Board deciding previously that a great many books are of no literary value and straightaway putting them on the list again? I am sure the board would be quite capable of doing that.  A great many books have been banned in the past. I wonder what would be the position of a private person or a publishing firm bringing in certain books that had been banned here prior to 12 years ago and trying to distribute them in this country.  Will they be stopped at the customs post and sent to the Censorship Board or will the customs official automatically look at his list and say: &ldquo;This is not on my list and it is a very recent list only published last week.  I must let it in&rdquo;?  I wonder has that point been considered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment is adequate for the purpose because the word &ldquo;re-examine&rdquo; which is used here must be read in the context of the Act and the Act without defining &ldquo;examine&rdquo; does make the requirement that: &ldquo;The Censorship Board shall examine every book duly referred to them.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;examine,&rdquo; therefore, must have developed some kind of meaning in the board.  There is also the point that they are required to have regard to a number of matters which it would be difficult to have regard to if they did not read the book including the general tenor of the book, the language in which it is written, the nature and extent of the circulation which, in their opinion it is likely to have, the class of reader which, in their opinion, may reasonably be expected to read it and any other matter relating to the book which appears to them to be relevant.  I think it is obvious, therefore, that examination as required by the Act involves reading the book and the word &ldquo;re-examine&rdquo; in the amendment must, I think, be taken as requiring them once again to carry out this process laid down in the Act in the same detail.  I submit, therefore, that the amendment is clear and concise, conveys a specific meaning and is adequate for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also agree with the proposer that it is necessary to make sure that the books are examined because the basic process of banning a book does require examination and this is spelled out.  The Act does not say the Censorship Board may ban a book. It says, first of all, they shall examine every book and, secondly, that having examined the book and having certain opinions, they shall prohibit sale and distribution.  If we allow the Bill to go through in its present form there is no specific requirement for them to <Col N="541" /> examine it.  It says they may &ldquo;make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in respect of which a prohibition order has ceased or will cease to have effect&rdquo;.  There is nothing there to say that the process of making this prohibition order must be after re-examination of the book. This may have appeared to the draftsman to be implicit but it is not explicit. I feel that in its present form the Bill could be read by the board as giving them power to ban a book without re-reading it on their recollection of what they thought of the book when they last saw it or perhaps in the light of statements by the staff of the board as to the views that were held on the previous occasion.  I think, therefore, it is necessary to have this amendment and that the amendment will do what its proposers want it to do&mdash;read in conjunction with the use of the word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; in the Act itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the section itself is very much in plain English and the relevant portion as far as fitting in the Bill with the existing law in regard to censorship is the introduction to section 3, subsection (1): &ldquo;The Censorship of Publications Board may, under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further Prohibition Order in respect of any book in respect of which a Prohibition Order has ceased or will cease to have effect by virtue of section 2 of this Act.&rdquo; That quite clearly relates section 3 of the Bill to section 7 of the 1946 Act, which again places the obligation on the board.  Section 7 reads:</P>
      <P>If the Censorship Board, having duly examined a book, are of opinion...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It, therefore, places clearly the obligation on the board to duly examine a book before they come to an opinion about it.  You have here a direct reference from section 3 of the Bill to that particular section of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946.  Therefore, I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment is superfluous. It is bad legislation to duplicate unnecessarily. I do not see any point in doing it in this case.  I am quite convinced <Col N="542" /> that once you have the introduction which you have here to subsection (1) of section 3 relating that specifically back to section 7 of the 1946 Act there is no further need for the amendment suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  The whole spirit and the terms of the amendment are amply covered by the section, particularly by its relation back in very specific terms to section 7 of the 1946 Act.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister is quite right.  I would have thought that section 5 of the Bill should read: &ldquo;This Act may, be cited as the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967,&rdquo; and subsection (2) therefore should read: &ldquo;The Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 and 1946 and this Act may be cited together as these Acts and shall be construed together as one Act&rdquo;.  The Minister says the phrase &ldquo;shall be construed together as one Act&rdquo; is in the Bill.  I was amazed that it was not included and therefore, I submit, Senator Sheehy Skeffington may have a point.</P>

The fact that we have in section 3 (1) a specific reference to section 7 of the Act of 1946 makes its watertight.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal first with what Senator Cole said about re-examining.  It has been made clear by Senator FitzGerald that if one wants to amend the section, one must use the word in the original Act to which this section refers.  Section 7 of the original Act provides that the Censorship Board, &ldquo;having duly examined&rdquo; the book, and so on, &ldquo;shall by order prohibit such sale and distribution&rdquo;.  It seems to me, therefore, that the phrase that should be used is &ldquo;after due re-examination&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I should like to know does the Minister feel that any harm could possibly be done by inserting <Col N="543" /> the words &ldquo;after due-re-examination&rdquo;. They mean explicitly what he says there is no need to say because it is there by implication.  Can they do any harm?  I suggest that they cannot. Their omission, on the other hand, might do harm because without these words section 3 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board may, under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in respect of which...</P>
    <P>The Minister contends that this can be read only in the light of section 7 of the 1946 Act, which says they can prohibit a book &ldquo;having duly examined it&rdquo;.  But a member of the Censorship Board might contend that since this applies only to books already prohibited, he is entitled to say: &ldquo;We have already examined the book.  The Board examined the book in 1948. Therefore, we can make a prohibition order, &lsquo;having duly examined&rsquo; the book, because we did it in 1948 and there is here no stated obligation on us to re-examine it.  We fulfilled our duty because (a) this is a book we think should be banned and (b) we &lsquo;duly examined it&rsquo; in 1948 or 1952, etc., and, therefore, there is no obligation on us to re-examine it, despite what the Minister said in the Seanad in 1967.&rdquo;  We must, therefore, specifically require the Board to re-examine it, because otherwise they can contend that the book had already been examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment on two grounds.  Firstly, the Minister is right in saying that the section as it stands is perfectly clear.  Secondly, I refer Senator Sheehy Skeffington to section 1 where &ldquo;prohibition order&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;an order under section 6 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, or section 7 of the Act of 1946.&rdquo; That is a definition of a prohibition order and quite definitely anybody <Col N="544" /> making an order under section 3 must have reference to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to finish?  Senator O'Quigley can come back later.  One thing at a time.  It is laid down in the Bill in section 1 what a prohibition order is and it seems to me that anyone making a prohibition order under section 3 must have regard to the fact that all that can be done is to go through the machinery laid down in the other two Acts.  I do not object very strenuously to the other points in regard to the amendment, which may be due to bad draftmanship. However, I suggest the amendment would weaken and not strengthen section 3.  I do not like the word &ldquo;re-examine&rdquo;. To me as a layman, there is something a great deal weaker in it than in &ldquo;examine&rdquo;, something more perfunctory: you are taking something somebody else has done to see if what the other person has done is right.</P>
      <P>The only safeguard authors and others connected with the book trade have is that the Censorship Board should take a book, forget completely that the book has been banned before, look at it as something new and decide thereby whether they want to ban it. &ldquo;Re-examine&rdquo; to me means that they can go back, subconsciously or consciously, on what had been done by previous boards and ask: &ldquo;Were those boys right?  Perhaps they were.&rdquo; I would much rather not have a word like &ldquo;re-examine&rdquo; put in.  I should prefer to have it definitely laid down that the Board must go through the present machinery <i>de novo</i> as set out in the other two Acts.</P>

      <P>I do not see what a Censorship Board would do except examine a book in such a way as to satisfy them.  The word &ldquo;examine&rdquo; in the 1946 Act, I regard as something on the same lines as &ldquo;after consultation with a Minister.&rdquo;  I do not know what consultation with a Minister is.  The Censorship Board must in some way examine a book, and putting it doubly, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment does, does not get us any further.  It is just a waste of time.</P>

      <P>I am not sure you get over all your difficulties but you get over some.  I do not think the Minister has answered the point which Senator Sheehy Skeffington made.  The initial examination made the first time the book was looked at could be held to suffice for the further prohibition order.  That seems to be the only sensible interpretation of this. When you say that the Censorship of Publications Board may make a further prohibition order, you read back to section 7 which says you shall examine it. <Col N="546" /> When they come to make the further prohibition order, they have examined it under section 7.  That has been done all right.  There is nothing to compel them to re-examine it.  I could not see, if I were a member of the Board, that it would bind me in the slightest way to re-examine the book.  I might feel bound in conscience to re-examine it.  I do not see how the Minister can read that as requiring a further examination. I would certainly not be bound in law to re-examine the book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must go back again to the plain meaning of the section.  I am repeating myself but section 3 refers back to section 7 of the 1946 Act and that section states that in order to make a prohibition order the Board must duly examine a book. Section 2 of this Act says that a prohibition order made in respect of a book on one of the statutory grounds shall cease to have effect after 12 years.</P>
      <P>Section 3 says that in order to look at the matter <i>de novo</i>, in order to make another prohibition order, the Board must go back to section 7 of the 1946 Act which obliges them to duly examine the book.  It seems very plain to me.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment is entirely contained in that logical relationship of section 2 and section 3 of this Bill which refers back to section 7 of the 1946 Act.  As Senator Yeats said, Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment is doing the spirit of his own ideas less than justice and the very incorporation of this would only weaken the very idea which is incorporated here, namely, that the Board will look at the whole thing in a fresh light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cold interpretation of sections 2 and 3 linked with section 7 of the 1946 Act is quite plain that the obligation <Col N="547" /> is on the Board, if a book is referred to them, to make or not to make a fresh prohibition order, having duly examined the book in question.</P>

      <P>On the question of whether &ldquo;re-examination&rdquo; makes the situation weaker, as Senator Yeats suggested, I would not accept that.  I do not believe that the re-election of a Senator, for instance, is any weaker than the election of a Senator. I feel he is just as much a Senator.  On the other point, I would ask the Minister, if he does not feel the necessity for specifically mentioning &ldquo;re-examination&rdquo;, why does he feel the necessity for talking about a &ldquo;further&rdquo; prohibition order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, if he thinks there is anything in this point about re-examination weakening it, would the answer to that not be an amendment to say that the Censorship of Publications Board may having complied again with the procedure in section 7 of the 1946 Act, or words to that effect, re-examine the book.  The Minister has not in fact answered the point we made.  He has not given any grounds on which to require a member of the Board to re-examine it.  A member of the Board might come to him and say: &ldquo;The way I am operating this is by making a further prohibition order and, as I have already examined this book 12 years ago, I am carrying out the requirements of section 7 of the Act, and having duly examined the book 12 years ago, I am now making a further prohibition order&rdquo;.  The very use of the words &ldquo;further prohibition order&rdquo; in fact strengthens the case for that interpretation.  It implies a kind of continuation procedure which one could carry out, basing oneself on the original examination, which had been made at an earlier stage.  I can see no basis on which the Minister could argue with a member of the Board on the terms of the Bill as laid out that he must re-examine the book although the Minister may feel that such a member of the Board would be perverse in his interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7 he is required to <Col N="548" /> examine the book.  The book has been examined 12 years earlier.  The Board have examined it.  That requirement is carried out.  The Censorship Board, having duly examined the book 12 years earlier, are of a certain opinion, and, having been of that opinion, they make a further prohibition order but there is nothing whatever there to require them to re-examine the book.  If the Minister stands back from it&mdash;the trouble about those things is one can get very close to them&mdash;and looks at it as a plain man, he will see that there is no such requirement there and that something is needed.</P>
    <P>I do not necessarily feel that Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment is the only way or the best way of doing this. There may be something in what was said that re-examination is in some way a weaker concept.  Maybe the right thing is to say that they shall examine it again.  Something is required.  Certainly if it is the Minister's intention that they shall re-examine it&mdash;it is clear from what he said that he intends that&mdash;he has not succeeded in achieving this requirement, in imposing legal obligation on the Board to examine it again.  It is left in the position where, if they wish to do so, they can validly say that the examination was carried out on a previous occasion and that they are now making a further prohibition order, being still of the opinion, on the basis of their earlier examination, that the book should be prohibited.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the Second Stage I said that this was the section in which I was particularly interested because it provided for the continuation of censorship after the period, as the Seanad has now decided, of 12 years.  The wording of subsection (1) of section 3 puzzles me still.  This subsection says: &ldquo;The Censorship of Publications Board may, under section 7 of the Act of 1946, make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in respect of which a prohibition order has ceased or will cease to have effect by virtue of section 2 of this Act.&rdquo;  Who starts it?  The <i>de novo</i> approach has been mentioned a couple of times.  I wish to ask the Minister now if at the end of 12 years prohibition on a publication that publication is free for circulation to the citizens of this country, how am I or how is anybody to know that, if we do not get some information when these books are released?  I do not want that particularly, but I want to know what procedure is available to the public.  Will the <i>de novo</i> application be taken as in the original case? I understand the Censorship Acts to apply through the citizen.  A citizen makes a complaint to the Censorship Board and from its finding an appeal can be made to the Appeal Board. The terminology here is not clear, as to whether it is the Board itself or the Appeal Board.  What I want to ask the Minister is, when this Bill becomes law and the 12 year period has elapsed, how are we to know what books are free for publication again?</P>

      <P>I have stated that I myself would take action in connection with a certain book if it were allowed for publication.  How am I to know, if I am to know, if it is the Board itself that can start <i>de novo</i>, or will it still fall on the citizen?  The question here is that the Censorship Board may do this.  Why &ldquo;may&rdquo;?  Then, who is going to make them do it?  Who will make them make a further prohibition order in respect of any book in regard to which a prohibition order has ceased?</P>
      <P>The censorship ceases by virtue of this section and then the publication is free.  I want to know what happens. The Censorship Board may do something, but who is to request them to do it?  How are we to know?  <i>De novo</i> it is the citizen, and that is democracy, and that is how it has been from the start&mdash;it was the citizen who must make a complaint, which was then forwarded to the Censorship Board, which then banned the book.  The author or publisher has the right of appeal, and apparently those people have not appealed to any great extent. Now this is the sequence of events in a democracy.  The citizen finds something to complain about and we have, thank God, a board like this instituted to safeguard the people.  I am asking the Minister if this <i>de novo</i> statement means that when the 12 years have expired the citizens will be aware of what books that applies to, or will the Censorship of Publications Board do it themselves automatically?  I do not think they would.  Therefore the onus is on the citizen <i>de novo</i> to start this procedure over again.</P>
      <P>I want that clarified by the statute or by the Minister or in a section which does not at present make it clear.  That is what I tried to get in, and the second subsection of this section does not matter a whole lot.  My point was not relevant to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment but it is very relevant to the clarification of this section and how it is to be efficacious in the operations of the Censorship Board in the future.</P>

      <P>The other point on the section that I should like to make is this: we are asked to believe that in general prohibitions mentioned under this section are efficacious in combating the encouragement through literature of one deadly sin.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, in view of the efficacy, apparently, of the censorship procedure in relation to this one deadly sin, he has any plans for the introduction of similar legislation dealing with the propagation through literature of the six other deadly sins, and if not, why not.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for meeting Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others who joined with him in regard to that amendment.  It is always worthwhile arguing with the Minister, because, unlike some of his colleagues, one does sometimes get somewhere with him if one has a good case.  On Senator Ó Donnabháin's point I should like to follow up what he said and clear my own mind that I am right.  It is my <Col N="553" /> presumption that the Censorship Board will, when these books come up to be unbanned, exercise the initiative they have under section 6 (1) of the 1946 Act to consider the question of examining books and that they will not simply sit back and wait until somebody sends them in.  I suppose what would happen&mdash;the Minister might confirm that this is the idea&mdash;is that members of the staff would suggest to the board books to be unbanned which are still in print and in their view worthy of re-examination.  That might be a possible procedure.  Senator Ó Donnabháin has a good point in raising that.</P>

      <P>No; it is perfectly legitimate.  I think it is right to ask on behalf of the House how it is to be done.  I would not call it bureaucracy in the Seanad to assist the Board by drawing their attention in that way to books which are still in print and which in their view should be looked at. I wonder is that what is intended or how is the procedure to be worked?  It is a fair question and one that ought to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of amendments which I tabled were ruled out of order.  In respect of most of them I clearly understand why.  In the light of that decision and in the light of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said on that point when it was raised, a number of these amendments, while they have been expressed too broadly in relation to the whole process of banning of books, would be in order if they were re-expressed in relation to the re-banning process.  It seems to me that while we may not under this Bill be entitled to change the definition of indecency in general, we must be perfectly entitled to apply any definition of indecency we like when books come to be re-banned.  I am considering, therefore, on Report Stage, having been frustrated on Committee Stage by the extreme generality of my amendments, putting them down in regard to the process of re-banning so that when it comes to re-banning better standards will apply than do currently <Col N="554" /> apply.  I do not know what the Minister would think of that procedure.</P>

      <P>There is no change in the procedure in this respect.  As I <Col N="555" /> said in regard to another amendment, immediately after the passing of this Act we will circulate to booksellers and others a note on the effect of the Act, together with a list of the titles of books that were banned on the second statutory ground and, therefore, unaffected by the new Act.  The initial document will be circulated immediately after the passing of this Bill. Up to date registers of published books will be published annually if possible. I do not presume to make suggestions to the board as to how they should operate but from the practical point of view they will obviously adopt some such method as he suggested in regard to the examination of books and I am sure that they will look at the register of books that have been banned and generally keep an eye on particular books.  When this Bill becomes law they will be in a position to assess precisely what books they would like to reconsider.</P>
      <P>From the practical point of view, I should like to emphasise again what I said in reply to the Second Stage debate&mdash;that 95 per cent of the books that will now become unbanned are out of print anyway.  They are completely useless matter, ephemeral matter which was in circulation for a short while and then disappeared. What the board may do in practice is to examine the comparatively small number of books that have been banned and which have survived.</P>

      <P>The Minister made one point about which I am not quite clear. He said that the Censorship Board will, after this Bill becomes law, find out which of the banned books are still in print with a view to seeing which are to be reconsidered.  I am not quite clear about this aspect of the matter.  Have they copies of all the banned books? If they have not, then they will be faced with the problem of getting further copies.  I do not know whether the suggestion is that they should write to the publishers of these books in Britain and America and ask for copies in order to ascertain whether they should be rebanned or whether they should wait until the books reach the <Col N="556" /> country as is the position at the moment, I take it.</P>

      <P>This raises some complicated problems.  They have a list of all the books they have ever banned. Let us take the case of a book which they consider should, perhaps, be considered again to see if it should be rebanned.  One problem which seems to me to be very difficult is that one of the things they have to consider, under the Act of 1946, is the sort of circulation this book is likely to have. This may well be a book they have banned which is technically in print. How on earth are they to consider this in relation to the question of its circulation and the type of reader who will read it?</P>

      <P>I am thinking of the case of a book which is not in stock in this country; it cannot be in stock in this country because it has been banned until now.  There is one copy in the basement of the Censorship Board office.  It seems to me that the board, strictly speaking, would not be entitled to make a prohibition order in respect of that book until supplies reach the country, even if it is only one copy.  How on earth can they say that a book is likely to have a large readership, which might be affected adversely, when it is not even in circulation in the country?  I think that in all fairness, and in all legality&mdash;in order to comply adequately with the 1946 Act&mdash;they should wait until these various books which are still in print in fact do reach the country.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1967: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, is, in effect, a temporary Act.  Under an Act of 1964, the period to which it applied was extended to 31st March, 1967. The present Bill proposes to extend this period up to 31st March 1970. The Bill also proposes to extend the reliefs afforded under the Act of 1946 as amended.  These reliefs will operate in the present and two following years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Rates relief on agricultural land will now be applied in three broad categories. In the case of small holdings with rateable valuations of £20 or less &mdash;and these comprise the great majority of farms&mdash;it is proposed to increase the primary allowance from 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the general rate in the £, thus effectively de-rating the land.  Where a holding of land has a valuation of more than £20, but not more than £33, the first £20 of valuation will also, in effect, be de-rated and the occupier will be directly liable for rates only on the part of the valuation above £20.  This liability can be abated in appropriate cases by the employment allowance.  Finally, holdings with rateable valuations above £33 will continue to get a primary allowance of 80 per cent of the general rate in the £ on the first £20 of such valuations and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent of the general rate on the balance.</P>
    <P>During the next three years the employment allowance will be available towards the relief of the entire net rates payable on holdings with valuations over £20.  Up to this the allowance was related only to the portion of the net rates on the part of the valuation above £20.</P>
    <P>The increased rates of allowances under the Bill will increase the total amount of the agricultural grant by £1.6 million to almost £16 million in the current year.  Ten years ago the grant totalled less than £5.5 million and met 44 per cent of all rates on agricultural land.  In 1962-63, when the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1962, increased the primary allowance from 60 per cent to 70 per cent and introduced a supplementary allowance of 25 per cent on valuations over £20, the grant rose to £8.5 million and met 57 per cent of the rates on land.  The primary allowance was further increased to 80 per cent by the 1964 Act which also raised the supplementary allowance to 30 per cent.  In consequence, the grant increased to £11.2 million in 1964-65, meeting 64 per cent of land rates.  The £16 million grant this year will, it is estimated, meet approximately 70 per cent of all rates on land in county health districts. <Col N="559" /> As a result of these progressive increases in rate reliefs met from the Agricultural Grant, farmers will pay less net rates on their land this year than they paid ten years ago in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the increased grants provided during recent years have accrued in the main to smallholders. The increase to 100 per cent in rate relief provided for in section 3 of the Bill represents the final step in this process by providing, in effect, for the complete derating of all land for farmers with land valuation of £20 or under.  The derating will apply to 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land in the country.  The benefits provided by the increased primary allowances for the further 10 per cent or so of holdings in the £20 to £33 valuation category will range from almost complete derating at the bottom of the scale to an average relief of approximately 61 per cent of the gross rates at the top of the scale.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the increase in the primary allowance for holdings with valuations under £20, provision is made in section 8 for the waiving of small amounts of rates which would otherwise fall to be levied as separate charges in respect of compensation for malicious injuries.  It would normally be uneconomic for a county council to levy and recover these charges on small holdings which are otherwise de-rated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the making of the allowances will be conditional on payment of the net rates due within the year unless the county council, with the consent of the Minister, decide to waive the condition in relation to any year.  It is proposed to give power to the Minister to extend the time for payment beyond the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The reliefs proposed in the Bill will have effect in the present year and county councils generally have now reached an advanced stage in the preparation of demand notes.  It is highly desirable that the Bill should become law at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this proposal confers some benefit on the farmers we welcome it.  It is not what many people were led to believe, particularly those not associated with agriculture.  When this matter was announced during the Budget, people in the cities and towns were slightly shocked to learn that in one stroke the Government had decided to derate rates on all agricultural land up to £20. That is the way the case was presented. In fact, the meaning of this Bill is that an extra £4 valuation has been derated. Already there was £16 of the rates on land derated and now a further £4 making a total of £20 complete derating.</P>
      <P>At first sight this might seem a very great benefit to the farmers.  However, it is well known that at present there is a flight from the land.  The people are leaving the land rapidly.  Even in the last 12 months over 10,000 people left the land and you had the same pattern in previous years.  We were shocked to see that something like a quarter of a million people left the land over a comparatively short number of years.  It shows that the manner in which this country is being managed is driving the people from the land because they are unable to make a living.  This derating of agricultural land up to £20 means, in the case of rates being £3 in the £1, the farmers who will benefit from it will get a reduction of approximately £12 over the year which, of course, is even less than the old age pensioners got. They got £13 a year but, of course, they have to live to get it.  They have only got a promise of it.  This relief means a reduction of approximately £12 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made many times in favour of complete derating of all agricultural land.  There is complete derating of all agricultural land in the Six Counties and in Britain.  We are mainly an agricultural economy and we are within the framework of the British Isles.  Our economy is bound up with the economy of the North of Ireland and Britain.  There is a very strong case for complete derating of all agricultural land.  The Minister may come back and say that it would cost <Col N="561" /> too much but we can see that the Budget this year is approaching the £300 million mark.  It is not many years ago since the annual Budget was approximately £100 million.  I remember the Fianna Fáil Party who were in Opposition at the time saying that we had reached a fantastic situation when the expenditure to run this small country of three million people was £100 million.  We have gone a long way since then in the matter of national expenditure, not alone ordinary current expenditure but also capital expenditure.  If you take those very steep increases into consideration, it must be agreed that the derating of agricultural land is quite within the bounds of possibility and it should be tackled.  In his statement here the Minister has not extended any hope that we can expect complete derating of all agricultural land.  It is probable that when we get into the EEC our rating system so far as agricultural land is concerned will be changed considerably.  It is possible that so far as agricultural land is concerned the rates will be very nominal compared with what they are at present.</P>
    <P>At present whether it be a large or a small holding the rates loom large in the domestic circumstances of any family.  Being ready to meet the rates is one of the big burdens.  The people are finding it very difficult because from the official statistics given we have seen that a number of farmers are earning only around £5 per week compared with workers in other occupations, and it is obvious that it is necessary to derate land with valuations up to £20 and indeed higher.  On this occasion we are giving some concessions on up to valuations of £33.</P>
    <P>When it was announced in the Budget that rates on valuations between £20 and £33 would be relieved to some extent, people thought it would be of great benefit.  However, the Minister, I am sure, will be able to give us figures to show in fact what benefits will be available to those people who qualify and who have valuations not exceeding £33.  We shall then be able to compare those figures with figures in respect of valuations not exceeding £20 and it will be <Col N="562" /> shown that the relief on valuations of between £20 and £33 will not be very substantial.</P>
    <P>Numbers of farm labourers have dropped considerably and the result is that many farmers with valuations up to £33 are dependent on family labour or must do without any.  A farm up to £33 valuation in many parts of the country is not capable of providing a week's wages for a farm labourer.  Indeed the farmer himself finds it difficult to get sufficient out of the holding to make ends meet.  Of course it can be said that if the farm were covered with grass, it would be a different matter but all farmers are not geared for that kind of economy.</P>
    <P>Taking the average farmer with a valuation of £33, we may assume, generally speaking, that it would not be viable without family labour, that it would possibly barely make ends meet.  It is obvious that apart from the concessions made here, the economic situation is not good enough to keep members of farmers' families on the holdings.  They are leaving, emigrating or going into other occupations, because the living they can get from the land is not sufficient to keep them at home.  The same applies to farm workers.  They are able to obtain higher wages in other occupations.  The rate of wages for an able-bodied man on the land is lower than in other employments.  There is no doubt it would be higher if the landowner were in a position to pay more: the farm worker would then be in a position to demand and to get more in return for his work.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Minister has not given much to the farmers, considering this is mainly an agricultural economy.  When one takes into consideration the amount of revenue derived from farmers and their families by way of general taxation, this £1½ million in addition to what farmers have been getting is not much. It is less than Potez got towards their Clondalkin factory by way of grants. All the farmers of Ireland have got less in this year's Budget than the Clondalkin factory got&mdash;this enterprise, if I may call it such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> We consider, however, that this is a move in the right direction.  We agree that agriculture needs to be subsidised. It is not the right way to do it but it is the only way at the moment, apparently, as far as one can judge from Government policy.  In the long run, this type of relief should not be necessary.  A policy should be operated which would replace this form of relief and which would put the farmers and those working on the land in a position to make ends meet without this form of relief which really does nothing except ease the burden.</P>
    <P>This does not make a useful contribution towards achieving a general increase in farm output or towards achieving efficiency in farming methods or towards improving the land.  On average, this works out at approximately 6d a day relief for each farmer on the first £20 valuation.  Therefore, the Minister should not talk to us in terms of £16 million.  That is the total amount farmers are getting and it was already in the framework of our economy, in the framework of the farmers' economy in so far as rates are concerned.  What the Minister is giving them this year is £1½ million&mdash;less than the grant made available to Potez.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great problems facing councillors when they come to strike a rate each year is to hold an even balance between the services the people require, which they are entitled to, and their capacity to pay.  Any relief which the Minister can give of this colossal burden of rates is therefore to be welcomed, and I do just that.  Nevertheless, when one considers that the first £20 of rateable valuation is now to be free of rates, one must look at the other side of the picture.  The person concerned in this valuation bracket usually had some other job or tried to meet his rates from the humble pig in the yard, which he reared with a view to meeting the rates bill when it came due, and some farmyard poultry which also helped in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both have now disappeared, due to changes in farming methods and other factors.  It is no longer possible to see <Col N="564" /> the couple of pigs in the pigsty or the few hens in the yard.  That applies to those farmers&mdash;they cannot be called large farmers&mdash;with valuations between £20 and £33.  Therefore, the case Senator Rooney made in connection with derating can be taken further.  Are small farmers who had jobs, very often as council workers, to be deprived of those jobs, due to reductions in grants from the Road Fund?  In that respect I wonder is the Minister robbing Peter to pay Paul.  If he is, the last situation will be much worse than the first.  The entire system of rates must soon be reviewed because it is not just the small farmers who are badly affected by this. One can make a case for the small shopkeepers and indeed for the big ones too but we are dealing here with the question of relief of rates on agricultural land.  In so far as it helps to alleviate some of the hardship and some of the stress brought about by the ever-increasing burden of rates, it is welcome, but we must remember that while the land is derated, they still have to pay rates on their buildings and on their houses.  These will be very heavy on them.  I certainly welcome the Bill for any benefit the Minister gives in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The present iniquitous system of taxation by means of rates certainly needs to be changed.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it is a step in the right direction.  At the time this measure was announced in the Budget Statement, it was certainly very welcome news throughout the country. Unfortunately, when people got down to working out exactly how much they were to gain by this measure, it worked out, as I read in a Dáil reply to a question, that it was only something like £3 17s 9d, or some such figure, so on the whole it is not a great relief.  But it is a step in the right direction.</P>

    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity of appealing to the Minister to introduce legislation for the devaluation of agricultural land, as distinct from derating, because we find in many parts of the country, in the Nore Valley, the Barrow Valley and the Shannon Valley, where land is constantly <Col N="565" /> subject to flooding, that people pay high rates on high valuation on land which is to all intents and purposes useless to them.  The very same applies in relation to pollution and, may I say, pollution by Bord na Móna, especially in Kildare, Offaly and in particular, the Blackwater district of West Offaly where this pollution has rendered vast areas of agricultural pasture land completely useless.  Despite this, those people must still pay rates on this land.  Furthermore, the valuations on this useless land deprive many farmers of the right, shall we say, to medical services.  If their valuations happen to be over £50 for a while, they are deprived of certain grants. This is surely an injustice.</P>
    <P>Our present rating system completely ignores the ability of the ratepayers to pay and for that reason there is no social justice whatsoever in the system.  Our entire rating system has outlasted its usefulness.  The Fine Gael Party on this side have given considerable thought to the entire question of rates and we have many proposals which we feel are in accord with modern times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with devaluation.  I refer particularly to the Barrow, Nore and Shannon Valleys, which are subject to flooding for three-quarters of the year.  The land is completely useless to the unfortunate farmers who must pay rates on it.  It is also completely useless to the unfortunate farmers in West Offaly whose lands have been affected by pollution from Bord na Móna bogs.  When the flooding subsides, not even the grass grows.  Yet, those people get no compensation and no alleviation whatsoever so there is a genuine case for devaluation of agricultural land.  I would appeal to the Minister to bring <Col N="566" /> in legislation to deal with that situation.</P>
      <P>On the general question of rates, the time has come to tackle the problem directly.  The present system of the rates providing 50 per cent of the cost of the health services in the various counties is an excessive burden on the ratepayers.  The vast majority of people, except in towns, do not pay any rates.  It is only the householders and the occupiers of agricultural land who pay rates.  There are quite a number of people in the country who avail of all services that are paid for partly through the rates, such as roads and health, and who are not asked to contribute towards this rates burden. We in the Fine Gael Party propose that the contribution from the Central Fund towards the cost of health services in the various counties should be increased from 50 per cent to at least 70 per cent to reduce the burden of rates in the various counties.</P>
      <P>A great case can also be made with respect to local authority housing. We favour again that the greater share of the cost of local authority housing should be paid of central funds and thereby act as an incentive to local authorities to tackle the problem of providing the required number of houses more quickly.  The present system is certainly a deterrent to any council to get abreast of their building programme.  As the present system is certainly inequitable in the towns especially, we find that people pay very high rates irrespective of whether there is any business at all going on in the shops or business premises.  In most of the county towns business in some premises has declined but yet rates are the same.  I would like the Minister to say if subsection (2) of section 7 means that it is a reserved function of the council and not of the county manager.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> This is quite a substantial step forward and a substantial relief in that it gives a measure of relief to a large number of people, and in the long run, it is people that count rather than systems. It affects to a great degree a very large number of people in the congested districts in the west of Ireland and in many other counties, because there are pockets in Meath, Kildare and other counties normally regarded by people living in the West as uncongested.  It is true to say that up to £20 valuation the responsibility of paying rates has been removed on agricultural land, and a measure of relief up to £33.  That is a substantial forward movement.  It does involve approximately £1½ million. It is part of the budgetary proposals of the Government and therefore cannot be taken in isolation.</P>
      <P>Coupled with that, there are other reliefs and supports for the working farmer.  I know that the support given to the milk producer in the creamery area where I live, according to a document I recently received from the local creamery management, will amount to 3d per pound in my particular case and in that of the other suppliers in the area, since they pay on a butter fat basis.  It would therefore be very wrong to take this in isolation since it is part of the budgetary proposals of the Government.  Even taken by itself, as the three previous speakers wished to take it, I still say that it is not a small thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human nature being what it is, it is practically impossible to have absolute equity in this question of rating. When I was a younger man, most of 20 years ago, I remember being a representative of a county council on the General Council of County Councils, <Col N="568" /> and advocating from the council I represented a particular scheme of basic rating whereby the same amount of rate would be collected in Leitrim, Kerry and Clare&mdash;in each county&mdash; with a subvention available from central funds.  The idea was that the subvention would go to the poorer counties as well as to the richer to achieve a situation in which you could have equality of services, and an equal standard of service in housing, water, sewerage and other responsibilities of the local authorities.  What Senator McDonald said brought that back to my mind.</P>
    <P>What I found then was that the representatives from Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Clare, Kerry, Galway and so on on the western seaboard, and indeed Cork and Kerry, supported it.  There was some measure of support for the idea in certain areas in the midlands, but along the eastern seaboard&mdash;and this irrespective of political Party&mdash; there was opposition to the ideas from the representatives from Dundalk to Cork on the eastern seaboard.  It was debated fairly fully and for some considerable time, and finally defeated. It has not been resurrected since.</P>
    <P>I think of this in view of what Senator McDonald has said.  I believe that no matter what system of revaluation there is, you cannot have equity so long as you have different boundaries, different local authority areas with different economic capacities and different taxable capacities.  I could not envisage a situation in which you could have that idea I have outlined, equality of standard as between Mayo and Meath or Kildare and Leitrim, because the taxable capacity of Leitrim and Mayo is quite different by any standard.  Therefore the idea suggested by Senator McDonald of revaluation would not, to my mind, solve the problem between counties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> You cannot have devaluation or increase in valuation without a revaluation.  I am intelligent enough to see that part of it.  No matter what we call it, or what its name may be, I am not making myself more or less shibbolethic, though I know that Senator McDonald was not intending to talk in shibboleths &mdash;I will pay him that tribute.  While you might by devaluation or revaluation, or whatever name we want to put on it, achieve more equity within county boundaries&mdash;because there can be glaring cases where some properties are valued far lower, though they are valuable business premises, than newly-built houses which have a residential value&mdash;that will not in any way achieve equity or justice as between counties, because of the fact that there is such a wide difference in taxable capacity from the central or local point of view between Mayo and Meath, Leitrim and Kildare or Longford and Offaly, say.</P>
      <P>All we have to do to see that is to look at the gross capital value of Meath and what a penny in the £ will yield, as compared with Longford, Leitrim or Cavan.  It is no harm that now and again somebody should refer to this in the hope that at some stage there will be a more equitable scheme for providing money for local services. It is a fact that counties with a low taxable capacity cannot provide the same services&mdash;health services, housing, sewerage and water&mdash;as counties with a high taxable capacity.  The services are bound to be poorer.  A county in such circumstances, even doing its best, cannot provide as good a service as a county with a high taxable capacity; there will be better services in a better-off county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of rates relief, may I join with the others who have welcomed it, although some welcomed it half-heartedly?  It is a step forward.  The Bill gives rates relief on agricultural land up to £20 valuation and further relief up to £33.  That is welcome.  It may not be welcomed in the better-off counties like Kildare and Meath but it is a quite substantial relief <Col N="570" /> in the congested districts, Leitrim, Longford and Cavan.</P>

      <P>What we are dealing with is the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1967.  As I understand <Col N="572" /> it, the meaning of the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; is that you are suffering or carrying some burden, and that is about the size of the situation in relation to rates on agricultural land in this country.  They are a burden.  We should not have rates on agricultural land at all.  The poor rate in this country, the system of rating we have at the present time, was known as the poor law relief, introduced by what we refer to as a foreign Government at that time, a rate that was levied on the rich for the relief of the poor.  In modern times, the poor and the rich are lumped together in the inequitable system of taxation we have for our local authorities.  It is quite scandalous in modern times to say that an old age pensioner, a sick widow or somebody who is only qualified for outdoor relief who is living in a house is required to pay rates.  How anybody can square that with social justice beats me.  We have a Fianna Fáil Government in office for ten years and they have produced no plan.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how anybody can say in this day and age that it is right and proper to tax the old age pensioner or a widow with maybe five, six or ten orphans. That is what is involved in levying rates on the houses of old age pensioners and small farmers.  Let it not be forgotten that all this Bill is doing is relieving rates on land up to a valuation of £20, and the poor farmer living on the hills of Mayo, in Leitrim or on the hills of Donegal will still have to pay rates on his land and in respect of his house and buildings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> Senator McDonald suggested revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is typical Fianna Fáil propaganda.  Senator McDonald never used the word &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; once tonight and Senator O'Reilly is now saying he has used it; <Col N="575" /> that is a typical method of Fianna Fáil propaganda.  I am surprised at Senator O'Reilly.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that in a Bill of this kind we might have found that there was another relief we could offer, not alone to the rural population but to the rate-paying population in general, that is, the simple method of paying rates by instalments.  I do not see any reason why we cannot enact legislation to provide that rates will be paid by, if not 12 monthly instalments&mdash;because the demand notes have to come out some time after the beginning of the local financial year&mdash;then, by nine monthly instalments, at the option of the ratepayer.  There are many people whose family budget is geared to weekly and monthly payments. It is high time this facility was provided for the ratepayers.  It would cost nothing to implement this, by way of legislation, and in practice, and it is another of the reliefs we ought to afford the overburdened ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Finally, on the form of the Bill, might I say that while we propose, if the House wishes it&mdash;from this side at any rate&mdash;to enact this Bill tonight, might I say I must again object to the slovenly manner in which this Bill has been prepared?  Any farmer or rate collector trying to ascertain what is the position, when it comes to working out the allowances, will find it extremely difficult when he takes this Bill in conjunction with the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act of 1939, another Act of 1946, another Act of 1953, another Act of 1962 and yet another of 1964.  And we have this form of legislation presented to us here&mdash;to quote subsection (1) of section 1 of this Bill:</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Act of 1946, as amended by section 4 of the Act of 1962 and section 4 of the Act of 1964, shall not apply in relation to a person rated in respect of a tenement of agricultural land the primary allowance in respect of which is, by virtue of section 3, equal to the general rate in the pound on the specified valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of legislation we are enacting and expecting people to <Col N="576" /> understand.  In my time, I have seen courts learned in the law finding it extremely difficult to patch, first of all, these various amendments of amendments of amendments and then, having done that&mdash;having assembled the pieces&mdash;try to work out what the Legislature intends to do.  It is high time, when we introduce a Bill of this kind, that we introduce it in a form readily understandable by ordinary members of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, particularly in view of what transpired in the Dáil, it was only to be expected that the concession involving the granting of an increase of £1.6 million under this Bill would be belittled.  I had some idea of the type of criticism we would have&mdash;for example, that the extra relief on a £20 valuation holding with rates at 60/- in the £ would be only £12 a year.  But the fact of the matter is that the agricultural grant will now meet the full £60 of the rates on this holding; this is an additional £12 and, even if it does look in any individual case as a fairly small relief, you cannot remit more than 100 per cent of anything. This is an additional relief and is a continuing benefit.  If it should happen that there are further increases in rates, then the benefit under this concession of 100 per cent relief will, of course, increase.</P>
      <P>Senator Rooney advocated the complete derating of agricultural land, as obtains in Britain and the Six Counties. He did not advert to the fact that the valuation of agricultural land in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;combined for this purpose&mdash;is less than ten per cent of all property valuations, whereas in this country land valuations total nearly 45 per cent of all rateable valuations.  Therefore, the derating of agricultural land here would be a much greater burden on other ratepayers and taxpayers than is the case in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  It is also a fact that the valuations of farm houses in Britain and Northern Ireland are very much higher than here and that they are, of course, not devalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the addition of this £1.6 million to the grants in relief of rates <Col N="577" /> on agricultural land brings the total of the grants to £16 million and, as I said, this means that now 70 per cent of the rates on agricultural land in this country is being relieved.  It does not take a very involved calculation to work out that 100 per cent relief of the rates on agricultural land would cost approximately £23 million. That is an extra £7 million.</P>
    <P>I know it was not necessary for the Senators who spoke on the opposite benches to point it out&mdash;that Fine Gael have recently announced their intention of relieving rates in general and many other costly proposals which would cost the taxpayer, or cost the Exchequer, an astronomical extra amount of money.  In fact I expect to be dealing in great detail with this announcement of Fine Gael at another and more appropriate time, but, however, I am aware of this proposal of theirs.  I am also aware that, as in the case of all the other proposals of the Fine Gael Party, the problem of raising the taxes necessary for this is not considered relevant, so I suppose that the addition to their proposals of another £7 million is neither here nor there.  After all, if the cost of what they have already promised is not relevant, well, why bother about another £7 million?  I can quite see their point on that.</P>

However, I shall be going into that during the time that still remains between now and next Wednesday.  I can assure the policymakers of Fine Gael that so will other Members of the Government and of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael Senators on this Bill and indeed on the Bill dealing with planning, which is to follow, maintain that the problem of raising the actual money to implement these things is not relevant.  Still it might be interesting if at some time in the future the Fine Gael policymakers would show some activity after an election.  I will not ask them to do this before the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But if after the election they would explain even broadly how they propose to raise this extra money which has now been added to by Senator Rooney to the tune of an extra £7 million, I am sure the taxpayers and the people in general would find that interesting.  I also think that they would pay more attention to Fine Gael policy, that they would treat these regular productions of new policies as something more serious, if there were some indication as to what new taxes or what new tax structure were to be imposed in order to raise this money and also, of course, if there were some indication as to how they were going to so depart from their previous performance as to ensure that the community would be able to provide the money in any shape or form.  So far, however, we are without such an indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I can assure the Fine Gael experts, most of whom, I think, are in this House, that we do not worry overmuch about their efforts because we know that the voters, largely because of their past experience, do consider the question of cost very relevant indeed and I am quite satisfied that the agricultural community in general will consider this addition to the grant in relief of rates on agricultural land of £1.6 million, in conjunction with, as Senator O'Reilly said, the other subventions provided in the Budget this year a significant contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Malone referred to the fact that there were farmers earning £5 a week and less.  Admittedly, it appears that there are some persons on agricultural holdings who get a return of £5 or less a week from the land.  However, an examination of the census will show that the majority of smallholders have some alternative or additional source of income.  The 1961 census showed that the owners of farms of under 30 acres include 2,703 labourers, 725 agricultural and forestry workers, 869 shopkeepers, 140 publicans, 327 tradesmen and 504 fishermen, a total of 5,268 who presumably would be in this category of farmers who earn £5 a week or less from their agricultural holdings.  Therefore, the position in this regard is not as serious as some people try to pretend it is.  In so far as there are people who are not earning an adequate livelihood from the land, the Government in the Budget this year made some arrangements for a modest income supplement for these people for the whole year round.  However, that does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator McDonald that the general question of rates is being investigated and has been for some time.  It has been investigated both by the Economic Research Institute and by an interdepartmental committee which has published one report and a second report is now ready and will be published in the very near future. A third report is nearing completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a Fine Gael <Col N="580" /> tactic to which Fianna Fáil do not resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a favourable report then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the regular production of new policies by Fine Gael, this is a scientific investigation of the problem by an interdepartmental committee, not a political Party matter at all, and it will not be utilised by the Fianna Fáil Party as an election tactic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that it is not a favourable report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is available to be published in the near future and a third report is now nearing completion which deals with the incidence of rates generally, with the possibility of opening new sources of revenue and with the feasibility and the consequences of transferring some part of the expenditure now partially met by rates to the Exchequer.  Senators may be assured that any decision taken by the Government will be taken in the light of the problem of providing that the Exchequer will be able to pay the extra amount.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the temptation to suggest that the State should relieve local ratepayers of an even greater part of the cost of local services grows stronger as the local elections approach but the facts of the matter are that over the country as a whole the State will meet 52 per cent of all local revenue expenditure this year and that the rates will meet only 32 per cent.  That is over the whole country.  In regard to county councils the percentages are below these averages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am satisfied that the people appreciate that this Government have been pursuing this policy for some considerable time, that they appreciate there is a problem in regard to rates and that they are having it investigated, not from a political angle but with a view to arriving at a really feasible solution which will result in lessening the burden on the rates.  I am <Col N="581" /> satisfied the people appreciate that when this Government take a decision they will do so having assessed the consequences of transferring the burden to the taxpayers and that they have made up their minds on what necessary impositions will be required on the taxpayer.</P>
