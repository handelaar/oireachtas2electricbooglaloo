    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal object of the annual Appropriation Bill is to appropriate formally the sums voted by the Dáil for the supply services.  In addition, the Bill authorises the utilisation of certain departmental receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid of the various Votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's Bill provides for the <Col N="396" /> appropriation of the sum of £278,977,700, which is the total of the supplementary and additional estimates for 1966-67 which were not appropriated in last year's Appropriation Act, the estimates for 1967-68 and the supplementary and additional estimates already voted this year.  The Appropriations-in-Aid to be authorised under this Bill total £20,203,891.  Further particulars of these sums are given in the Schedules annexed to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In Dáil Éireann, this Bill is usually passed without debate because the services covered have already been discussed when the individual Estimates were taken.  In this House, however, the Bill provides an opportunity for debating in detail the expenditure covered by the Bill and for discussing expenditure and financial policies in general.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>To anybody not used to public finance and to the methods by which Parliament transacts its business this would seem from the Minister's speech to be a relatively unimportant Bill.  Of course, the Minister has not got anything more to say on the Bill than that this is the sum of money which is required to finance the public services for strictly speaking, the current year.  However it is, as we in the House know, a very important Bill and a very useful one in that it provides the Seanad with one of the few opportunities it can avail itself of to say something about the administration of the public services in a general way, and in some instances in detail, to review Government policy and its implementation over the past year and to review and comment on the Government plans and policy for the future.</P>
      <P>It is probably true to say that the country at this time is in a state of flux. It is not very easy to know at present where poor old Ireland stands.  It is not very easy to get from Government pronouncements any clear indication as to what we are doing or going to do in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  I think it would <Col N="397" /> not be an exaggeration to say, has somewhat fallen apart, if not collapsed, and instead of carrying out the review of the Second Programme, which was promised in mid-term, we are told that that cannot be carried out, that it could not be carried out earlier this year.  I understand, if my recollection is right, that it was promised for some time before Christmas and now it is to be carried out some time in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that is the indication from the Government that the Third Programme for Economic Expansion is to be brought out.  I do not quite follow the timing, whether the Third Programme for Economic Expansion will be designed to take effect immediately on its being issued or whether it will await the outcome of the full term of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion which was to expire some time in 1970.  These matters are not entirely clear to the man in the street.  They are not even clear to people who try to find out what the position is from Ministerial pronouncements or from other official documents.  I think it is correct to say that there is in the country generally a mood of disappointment that we no longer hear anything about the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Any references to it now are of an apologetic character.  Government Ministers are at pains to try to explain why it has failed and even in the Dáil last week the Minister for Finance tried to give an explanation in his reply to the debate on the Vote for his own Department.  Introducing the Budget of 1966 the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, raised the query as to what had gone wrong with his Budget of 1965 and having raised that query, left it in mid-air and furnished no explanation. The Minister for Finance said in the Dáil at column 1302, No. 9 of Volume 231 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Deputy Cosgrave kept talking about getting the economy moving forward.  He seems to think it is still in a depressed state which, of course, it is not.  The truth is that the whole free world suffered a serious set-back in <Col N="398" /> economic growth during 1965 and 1966.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Senator Sheehy Skeffington will seize on the words &ldquo;the whole free world&rdquo; and ask what happened in Communist Russia and the Eastern side of the Iron Curtain. Did their economies keep moving forward under their Socialist Governments? However, the Minister might have some information for him on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the Minister is trying to say, as I understand him, that what happened in this country in the years 1965 and 1966 was part and parcel of the pattern of what was happening in the free world. Why it is confined to the free world I do not quite understand.  It is hardly good enough to give that explanation because it certainly does not correspond with the forecasts given by the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1965.  Everybody will recollect that in every speech, in every radio broadcast, in all the television appearances of the various Ministers, the great appeal to the people was to return the Fianna Fáil Government to office so that the Second Programme for Economic Expansion could be kept going forward. In the election the Fianna Fáil Party did stake all on the Second Programme; they indicated that if the people voted Fianna Fáil the Second Programme would be implemented in full and one was given to understand that we would reach a new plateau in material and social prosperity and from there we will pause a moment to take our breath for the next great leap forward, as was said, into the future with Fianna Fáil.  That is the kind of propaganda which was given out to the people and which the people evidently accepted.  I think it would be a valuable exercise at this stage if the Government <Col N="399" /> were to give some indication as to what went wrong in 1965 and 1966 bearing in mind that the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Lemass, in Nenagh on the 26th of March, I presume, published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 27th March, 1965, had this to say about the state of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion in the future.  He said:</P>
      <P>There was so much to be done that was urgently desired and that was now becoming possible by reason of rising national wealth, that it would be a shame to see the nation's progress stopped now because of political difficulties.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to this.  In this expansive and apparently very sincere and infallible way which Deputy Lemass had of speaking and persuading the people he came out with this one:</P>
      <P>Rarely before in history were all the circumstances, external and internal, so favourable to Ireland's economic development.  The opportunities which we have must not be thrown away.  They might never come back.</P>
      <P>That was in 1965 with all the information that Ministers have at their disposal.  The Taoiseach in March of that year was able to say that never before were circumstances, external and internal, so favourable and yet the Minister for Finance tells us the truth is that the whole free world suffered a serious set-back of economic growth during 1965 and 1966.  Later in his speech at Nenagh the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>If the result of this election is an ineffective minority Government it is almost certain that there will be another election within a year.  This would not be helpful because it is in this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That presumably was 1966.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Fianna Fáil's national development plans must be put into full working order if they are to achieve the benefits in higher production and increased employment which we have forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> That, I am afraid, sounds very hollow when one considers the present position.  However, that was the basis on which this Government got into power and we have not yet to my knowledge been furnished with any coherent explanation as to what has happened and why things are now in the position in which they are.  That is not the whole of the picture and some people might be inclined to say: &ldquo;Well, yes, there was a recession around the world, around the free world at any rate, in 1965 and 1966 and there was nothing very much that the Government could do about it.&rdquo;  If that be so, then the forecasting mechanism of the Fianna Fáil Government was very much at fault and we know of no reason why it should be relied on any more in the future than it should have been in the past.  If the Taoiseach with all his years of experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Supplies and as Taoiseach makes so serious a mistake as that in 1965 we have no reason to have any greater confidence in the new Government which took over after his retirement. There might be a possibility that one could find an excuse for the Government in external circumstances which Deputy Lemass thought to be so favourable for us but there are other things which this Government could have and should have done and that need to be done.  In 1961 that great warrior Deputy Seán MacEntee, being perturbed at the state of the health services, which he thought were essentially sound, set up a committee of the Dáil to examine them. They heard no fewer than 180 people and their evidence was recorded in 350 pages of closely printed text.  I am quoting from Deputy MacEntee's speech of March 30th, 1965, but after four years of unremitting labour by a committee of the Dáil&mdash;we are not very good in the Oireachtas introducing reports&mdash;not even a report was produced by the committee.  Then the new hope, Deputy O'Malley, was put into the Department of Health.  Deputy O'Malley having an eye for a good thing, took the Fine Gael proposals for a health scheme which had been decried by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy S. Lemass in their time and <Col N="401" /> he knocked them into some kind of shape to suit Fianna Fáil theories and he produced his health services in a White Paper some time in March, 1966. Then he got on Radio Telefís Éireann and he announced to the Irish public, with two or three press correspondents interviewing him, that he was going to implement his White Paper by a Bill to be introduced in the autumn of 1966.</P>
    <P>But, the autumn of 1966 has come and gone.  Indeed, he was taxed by some of the interviewers as to whether he did not think in view of the bad state of the health services not to have them implemented for a year and a half would be a very bad thing.  We thought all these difficulties would be ironed out before that and that his Bill would be in full operation before the year 1967.  We are now at the end of 1967 and there is no sign of these proposals being implemented.  I understand that leave to introduce a Bill has been given in the Dáil and we all know what that means&mdash;a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health Acts, 1947 to 1965, or whatever is the last one.  That is all that is involved in that procedure.</P>
    <P>But the Minister for Health has done nothing at all about helping to inquire into the conduct of those dispensary doctors known to him who treat people like pigs in his own county of Limerick.  It is an awful indictment against the Minister for Health and against the Government, if that be so, and if the Minister is correct in saying that they treat their patients like pigs, in a society with any standard of civilisation to permit that to go on.  Either it is so or not and is it the blackguardly behaviour of the Minister for Health that makes him delay his proposals?  Nothing has been done by the Minister for Health about the health services.  Nothing has been done about the maladministration of these services if doctors are allowed to treat their patients like pigs.</P>
    <P>That is something that has not been done as one would have thought within the framework of our existing finance legislation.  Certainly there is available a method of financing these health services through insurance which has been decried by Deputy S. Lemass <Col N="402" /> when Taoiseach and which Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health decried as being a poll tax designed to hit the weaker sections in the community.</P>
    <P>It is a revolting thing to say in this day and age that when people are in hospital sick and sore and worried about their health, their future and their families somebody comes along prying into their affairs to find out whether they will require them to pay 7/- or 10/- or nothing per day while they are in hospital.  That position will continue under the O'Malley health proposals and I think it is a hopelessly wrong system for paying when insurance against the evil day is the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>That is not merely all of the failures. The Minister for Finance, who was Minister for Agriculture in 1965, was then thought by many to be a Minister of great promises.  I distinguish him from Deputy O'Malley as a Minister of many promises but the Minister for Agriculture as he was then, Deputy Haughey, also got on television and told the people that he liked being Minister for Agriculture, that he liked the job of being Minister in charge of agriculture.  Among other things, he went on to announce to the people of this country that he would set up a small farm division in his Department although we have been informed by Deputy Dillon that such a section had been instituted in the Department of Agriculture for many years.  But the Minister for Agriculture indicated in his speech that the division would make an extensive study of the small farm problem.  We have heard nothing about that.</P>
    <P>He would have to find out what other countries were doing and whether their problems would be suitable here. This is the Minister for Agriculture as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 23rd, 1963.  He said that the Minister for Agriculture must also help the farmer to help himself.  One saw an example of that in recent times in relation to the present Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Agriculture and the farming community. He must give them every assistance to improve their output and stand ready to help them to meet the <Col N="403" /> difficulties and setbacks they were bound to meet.  I have seen no evidence and I doubt if anybody else has evidence of any efforts by the Minister for Agriculture to stand shoulder to shoulder with the small farmer or stand by them in the times of difficulty and setbacks which they are bound to meet.</P>
    <P>More important&mdash;and this I think is the crucial point of the whole farming community in this country&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture said:</P>
    <P>Prices and markets are of vital importance&mdash;and, incidentally, I am a great believer in the contract system in getting more and more farmers growing different products under contract so that they can thereby be assured of a guaranteed market at a fixed price.</P>
    <P>I believe in the same thing.  I am sure there are others who believe this is the way to get an increase in agricultural production.  Unfortunately, some farmers have had the experience in the eastern part of the country of having a contract to grow peas for the Sugar Company.  At the end of a few wet days they were told they were not under contract any more; they would pay for what they had got and they could do what they liked after that.</P>
    <P>Every time a new scheme is launched and is based on a contract system, people will remember the experience they had in relation to the peas in that particular area and that will be the end, with the result that they will be slow to invest.  One of the reasons the farmers in this country are so conservative and slow to change is that they have so often been disappointed in the past.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey said he was convinced that the Minister for Agriculture must work in the closest possible co-operation with the farmer through his organisations.</P>
    <P>Will anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party have the temerity to say that the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, or the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Blaney, works in the closest possible co-operation with <Col N="404" /> the farmer through his organisations?</P>
    <P>Then we read:</P>
    <P>These, he said, provided the essential link between the individual farmer and himself so that they could have a two-way exchange of views and work in an atmosphere of trust and understanding.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of hopes and ideals that were held out to the farmers, big and small, by the then Minister for Agriculture.  Is it any wonder that, in December, 1967, there is such a pall of gloom, disinterest, apathy and lethargy in rural Ireland because they do not see any hope whatever in looking to the Government or to the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries?  I think it would be correct &mdash;and not unfair&mdash;to say of the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that, starting with his Christian name, Neil, onwards, everything about him as Minister has been negative.  I know of nothing of a positive character he can point to that he has done to start something new that would bring new hope to our farmers, big and small. Instead of that, we have had this intermittent warfare between the Minister for Agriculture and at one time ICMSA, at another time NFA and at another time some other body.  It is in marked contrast to the &ldquo;closest possible co-operation&rdquo; that was promised by the Minister for Agriculture in 1965 if the Government were elected with a large majority.</P>
    <P>It takes misfortune, I suppose, to enable us to realise our fortune.  It is interesting to note on television, presumably sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, that what was once scoffed at, the cattle industry &mdash;people who owned cattle in Meath were regarded as big ranchers who were making no contribution to the economy&mdash;is now described, several times a day, on Telefís Éireann, as &ldquo;our greatest industry&rdquo;.  The cattle industry is our greatest industry.  We are so perturbed about it, and rightly so, that we are contemplating, and again rightly so, closing the ports to all incoming traffic to this country for a period.  But what baffles me and what I can never understand is why our farmers do not see through the <Col N="405" /> failure of the Government to harness the resources which are there and which, if used, would provide byproducts required in other parts of the economy.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not cut out the speech at the time but I instance the case of the Chairman of the Castlebar Bacon Company at the annual meeting of the shareholders&mdash;whoever they may be&mdash;complaining that there was a lack of production and a shortfall of tens of thousands of pigs for the Castlebar Bacon Company and that they had to send lorries out as far afield as Monaghan in order to get a proper supply of pigs for the Castlebar Bacon Company.  At the same time, in and around Castlebar and all around Mayo, there are thousands of farmers who have nothing to do all day, who have empty sheds and who could produce pigs&mdash;but the Castlebar Bacon Factory is still without them.  What is the explanation for that?  How is it that the Minister for Agriculture and his Department, the county committee of agriculture in Mayo, the farming organisations and the bacon factory interests cannot get together to ensure that those who can produce and supply the necessary pigs will produce them for the Castlebar Bacon Factory in such a way that we shall not have the Chairman of the Castlebar Bacon Company complaining that they have underproduced because they could not get enough pigs?</P>
    <P>I was on holidays this year for a period in August, when the Seanad was not sitting, and I was in one of the poorer areas of Mayo, down in the Belmullet peninsula.  This is the kind of picture I saw.  Leaving Glosh, where I was temporarily resident, at about 10 am, to go to the nearest town, Belmullet, about 15 miles distant, the road on the way in was dotted with pigs and people.  For children brought up in the city it was something of an adventure to see so many pigs and people along the side of the road on a nice morning in August.  When we were going home at about 1 pm, for the last five or six miles of the journey we were stopped in a couple of places by some of the people with pigs who wanted to know if we had seen the pig lorry anywhere. <Col N="406" /> We were able to tell them that we had seen it a couple of miles back.  They then resigned themselves to waiting for another hour or 1½ hours, or whatever time they would calculate.  That is the kind of system the farmer on the Belmullet peninsula is expected to participate in and those are the conditions under which he has to operate and produce and sell his pigs to the Castlebar Bacon Company.  It is hopelessly obsolete. It is as antediluvian as the sort of thing one sees portrayed as happening in the Yemen and in Saudi Arabia at the present time.</P>

      <P>What is going on in Balla will help the people there, but it will do nothing to help the people in the Belmullet peninsula.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department, the county committee of agriculture in Mayo, the farming organisations and the bacon factory cannot <Col N="407" /> get together to produce a system whereby people will not have to wait for hours along the roads.  On the occasion I instanced the sun was shining but it could be as it was last week. Do not forget that there has been a general shortage of pigs for the bacon industry all over the country.  At the same time, we have farmers with a low income who are unable to make enough money.  If there were somebody somewhere who could do something about using our available resources, we could achieve a better standard of living for those who engage in pig-breeding and pig-rearing and we could have sufficient pigs for our factories.</P>
      <P>Do not forget that one of the things that has always killed the bacon industry and bacon exports to Britain has been our failure to ensure a regular supply of the same quality of bacon.  There was a few years ago a very laudable and quite expensive campaign to advertise Irish bacon in England.  When they had made all their contacts and got all their markets they found they were unable to fulfil their orders and the people resigned from the Pigs and Bacon Board as if they had been affected by the plague.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, no use talking about one project in Balla.  One swallow never made a summer and one progeny station or feeding station will not help the people of County Mayo or any other part of the country.  Of course, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;I suppose the speech was written for him by a civil servant in the Department as are most Ministerial speeches&mdash;was right when he said he believed in contracts, but nobody has done anything about that since, to my knowledge.  In consequence, one finds in parts of rural Ireland today that young married people&mdash;relatively young for rural Ireland&mdash;in their forties and fifties, with young children, have no hope of keeping their children on the land.  They do not want them to stay on the land and endure the same hardships as they did during their lifetimes. They want something better for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> For as long as the present system continues, so long as the weak kind of excuses made by Senator Flanagan are given, of course the drift from the land will continue and we shall still have the young fellow of seven at the railway station crying because his daddy is going to England until Christmas. Senator Flanagan said there is a factory in such and such a place.  What help is that for all the farmers to earn some kind of living?  Most of them are prepared to put up with a much lower standard of living than they could have in England and one sees tangible evidence of this if one visits the Land Commission courts when they are sitting. People spend £1,700 or £1,800 of their own money to build houses on their own small farms, where they will never make as good a living, because they want to bring up their children in their own country.  I have seen it time and time again.  The last thing they want is the Land Commission to take over their holdings, because they always want to return to them.  That is the spirit of the people and that is the spirit that is being broken.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in any Programme for Economic Expansion or in any scheme adumbrated by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or anybody else which is doing anything about that system.  Instead, we have had the deplorable spectre of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries refusing to meet a few footsore, worn and weary farmers who had marched from Cork to his Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure some Senators opposite will say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, we have been doing something for the small farmers.  We have now extended the period and the range of people who can get unemployment benefit all the year round.&rdquo;  If that is the substitute for an economic policy in the Fianna Fáil view, it is not in mine or in the view of my Party.  The dole being handed out in that way stamps the people as being condemned for the foreseeable future to live in utter poverty.  Were it not for emigrants' remittances, there are parts of rural Ireland where there would not be a house that would not be closed.  It is the remittances, and the few bob from the dole, that enable <Col N="409" /> parts of rural Ireland to remain partially inhabited.</P>
    <P>Of course, before the next general election the Fianna Fáil Government will extend the range of the people who will get the benefit of unemployment classification the whole year round; or they will increase it by five bob a week and thereby buy back the foolish support of the small farmers for the simple reason that the small farmers are now beginning to believe that they will remain annuitants of the State&mdash;that there is no hope for them in the world in which we live.</P>
    <P>The pretence of doing something for the West by sending the Department of Lands to Castlebar and the Department of Education to Athlone will not deceive for very long the people it is intended should be deceived.  I can see clearly a great rumpus in the town of Castlebar if the ratepayers are called on to finance a water scheme or an extension of the sewerage system.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Senator can speak on behalf of the Cavan people.  At any rate, whatever prosperity it may bring to the people of Castlebar and the people within a radius of five or ten miles, it will do literally nothing for the rest of the county.  It may be a very good thing to have one area which will be fairly well developed, but as a substitute for a policy for the West the whole thing is meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have perhaps digressed from the main theme of my speech by referring to these obvious failures which it was within the power of the Government to rectify at very little cost.  The Second Programme for Economic Expansion was presented to the people as the means to increase prosperity, but that has not come.  The test anybody will look for in relation to the success or failure of any economic programme is the number of new jobs it has provided. The forecast for the six-year period from 1964 to 1970 was that we <Col N="410" /> would provide a net 80,000 new jobs. The Minister for Finance in the Dáil last week confessed in sorrow that they had succeeded in establishing in the first four years of the six only 14,000 new jobs, whereas if we had been going at the rate of or approximating the target, we would have had 44,000 new jobs provided in this country since 1964.  In other words, there has been a shortfall of two-thirds of the target &mdash;of 30,000 out of the 44,000 jobs promised by the Fianna Fáil Party and Fianna Fáil Ministers to the country.</P>
    <P>The explanations we want are why has that happened and what are the new measures now designed to enable us to make good in the next few years the 30,000 jobs that have not been provided and the remaining 26,000 that are required if the target is to be reached.  There was a time when there was talk about revising the targets so as to make them realistic. That is what they get on with in Soviet Russia: whenever the facts do not fit the current economic situation the encyclopaedias and the histories are rewritten to fit the facts.  At the present time, the Second Programme is likewise to be revised to make it look more realistic.  The explanation the people want, now that we are half-way through the five-year term of office of this Government, is what has happened to the 30,000 new jobs and why is emigration proceeding at the rate it is proceeding, while at the same time the Castlebar and other bacon factories cannot get sufficient pigs.  It is quite evident, as far as this Government are concerned in the last year, and, indeed, that since they came into office in 1965, they have no plan which anybody can point to and say that that is what they intend to do in relation to pigs, that is what they intend to do in relation to sheep, in relation to textiles or in relation to any other aspect of the economy you care to name.</P>
    <P>There is no plan, there is no coordination of effort, there is no co-ordination between the workers and management by the present Government. When the Ministry of Labour was established our great hope was that the Minister for Labour would be <Col N="411" /> the person who would be the mediator between the workers and management and that he would occupy in relation to the trade unions and management the same position which his opposite number, Mr. Gunther, occupies in Britain.  You did not find Mr. Gunther saying that the workers were irresponsible.</P>

That ought to be the function of the Minister for Labour, not to round on the trade unions.

      <P>It is quite obvious that the intention is to disrupt the debate.  When we have identified the problems, as they say in official circles, we have then to proceed to prescribe the remedies.  One of the things I prescribe for the Minister for Labour, who is a medical doctor, is that he should be the last person to say anything that would offend the trade unions in this country and, likewise, he should be the last person to say anything that is offensive and known and calculated to be offensive to management in this country.  He should be the great mediator, the great go-between, the man who will bring those people together and improve relations.  I do not see any efforts in that respect I do not see this Government trying to do anything to improve relations between management and labour, between Government and labour, and certainly not trying to do anything to improve relations between the Government and the farmers' organisations.</P>

If you want my prescription for the Minister for Labour it is that he should keep his mouth shut when he comes to deal with problems, like he did in Dún Laoghaire, or I will make another prescription, which is probably more polite, that is to say nothing for a long time and then to say nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, of course, will have to address themselves also to a problem which I think has had a very bad effect on the attitude of labour to their work, the attitude of labour to working hard and to earning more money.  I think PAYE was a very fine system designed to bring in revenue, but as a measure designed to stimulate the economy, to improve the productive capacity of our workers, I do not think PAYE has been a success. One finds from time to time that people do not want to work overtime because, if they do, one-third of it will be taken in tax, when they get to that stage.  I believe we will have to consider some way of increasing the personal allowance or reducing the rate of income tax in order to make it worthwhile for people to work overtime, that they should be given an incentive to do this work.  There is a disincentive provided by the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial problem, it seems to me, in relation to the running of the country is the attitude of Ministers and the crucial aspect of the problem is how the Ministers address themselves to their various responsibilities which they are called on to discharge. I said last year, and I say it again this year, that in my view Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries spend far too little of their time at their desks in their offices.  It is a well-known fact, which is now known to the public, the number of places in which Ministers <Col N="414" /> and Parliamentary Secretaries are found during working hours, when they should be in their offices. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> is to be congratulated on having the intelligence to make known the fact that hardly any Minister of State in this country drives less than 50,000 miles a year in a State car.  One Minister drives up to 70,000 miles per annum.  Make any calculation you like, but you will find that any Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary who drives 1,000 miles a week on an average, at a minimum, cannot be devoting the time he should to his work as a Minister of State. When you have the disgraceful position of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries spending one, two, and three weeks away from Dublin conducting by-elections in Party interests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am saying that one of the indications, if the public want it, that Ministers do not do their work and are not doing the jobs for which they are sent into their offices by Dáil Éireann is to be found in the fact that they travel from 50,000 to 70,000 miles per annum in their State cars and that they leave their offices for weeks on end to take part in byelections. That, in my view, is an abnegation by Ministers of their responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be a longer time.  That is only one aspect.  Then consider that a Minister in charge of Parliamentary business, particularly the Minister for Finance, has to spend prolonged periods actually in the Dáil every week when Parliament is sitting. When he is on that, of course, he is discharging his office <i>par excellence</i> as a Minister of State but when he is doing that he cannot be formulating policy or discussing with his advisers things that he ought to be discussing. The Minister is a Deputy.  He has to see various deputations <i>qua</i> Deputy, <i>qua</i> Minister.  He has to see various deputations on matters relating to his constituency and while he is on that, of course, he is keeping in touch with public opinion, but let nobody think <Col N="416" /> that if the Minister stays in his office he will lose touch with public opinion. What are all the Deputies and Senators in his Party for but to keep him in touch with public opinion?  Does he not get hundreds of letters every day? Does he not have reports from his advisers to keep him in touch with public opinion?  That is all eyewash. Then a Minister has to attend Party meetings.  I do not know what length of time the Fianna Fáil Ministers spend attending Party meetings.  That is a legitimate task for what it is worth, I suppose.  Then they go to a variety of functions which in my view are quite unnecessary.  It has got to the stage now where people cannot open an extension to a garage for washing cars without having a Minister of State to squirt the first splash upon some dirty car.  Have we not reached a queer level in politics when that is a requirement of a Minister of State?  There will be people on the Fianna Fáil benches who will say that it is right and proper that a Minister should be there to discharge important Ministerial functions of that kind.  By the time a Minister has got through all these things and lived his ordinary social life it is plain to see that he has very little time left for discharging his functions as a Minister in charge of his Department, formulating new policy and administering the various Acts of Parliament which fall to be administered by him and upon which he, as Minister, is required by law to exercise his power of decision.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not able to be with us this evening to hear what I have to say.  The truth of the matter is that the real power in this country resides in, and is exercised by, the civil servants.</P>

      <P>Speeches by the Minister at the dinner of the Institute of Public Administration saying that all this talk about the Civil Service being the real rulers is nonsense, is just nonsense.  The Minister speaking at the dinner the other night&mdash;I am reading from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Tuesday of this week&mdash;said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become fashionable for <Col N="417" /> some people whose own contributions to the public good are usually of a verbal nature to criticise our Civil Service and talk about faceless men, bureaucrats who are the real secret rulers and so on.</P>
    <P>Then he declared:</P>
    <P>This is just so much nonsense and I would like to avail of this occasion to pay a tribute to the integrity, capacity and devotion of the public servants of all ranks.</P>
    <P>To the latter sentiment I say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; because I know very well the integrity, the capacity, and the devotion of public servants of all ranks.  I was a civil servant myself one time.  I was a servant of the Civil Service for a period and I know better than most people, certainly better than most people in this House, of the integrity, capacity and devotion of our civil servants.</P>

It is noted that you have not delivered the accounts and paid the duty payable in respect of this estate.  Unless those accounts are delivered and the duty paid forthwith legal proceedings will be initiated which will lead to your conviction and imprisonment.&rdquo;  That was the final letter we always sent out to the widow when the solicitor had failed for one reason or another to deliver the accounts and pay the duty.  That was the letter that showed who was the power and brought in the accounts and got the duty paid.  That is power.</P>

      <P>I shall.  The Civil Service in this country, of course, is a splendid institution for the purposes for which it was intended but it requires some adaptation.  That is not to say <Col N="418" /> that because it requires adaptation the people who are in it are not people of capacity and integrity.  The Minister went on to deal with another matter which is very relevant to what I have just been saying.  He said that a particularly unfair criticism was that senior civil servants were the real rulers of the State and that Ministers merely provided a public face for policy formulated by officials.  He then said:</P>
      <P>From my experience of three Departments I would like to say that nothing could be further from the truth. The formulation and execution of policy would provide material for an interesting study on another occasion. It will be sufficient if I say now that, while both the Minister and his advisers each have a contribution to make, the ultimate decision in practice as well as in theory rests with the Government on all major matters.</P>

      <P>One could indicate instances in which it is quite clear that decisions were taken by civil servants or else the Minister concerned was just <Col N="419" /> plain daft.  I want to instance the Succession Bill of 1965 which was designed to prevent a man leaving his property to his widow.  Is it the Minister for Justice, who sponsored that Bill?  In what he proposed to Dáil Éireann, no man would be entitled to leave all his property to his widow; the most would be one-third, and the rest to the children.  If the Minister tells me he took that decision, he took it when he was asleep or when he was drunk or when he took leave of his senses.</P>

      <P>Public outcry.  A general election intervened.  The Minister for Justice was changed to the Department of Agriculture.  Not one of the crank organisations in this country agreed with that proposition.  Senator Ó Maoláin will not find one letter in all the columns of the newspapers to say they agreed with that proposition.  I want to give another indication.  We have before the Dáil at present a Fisheries Bill which proposes to require a licence for a young lad of ten years of age to throw a line in and catch a trout.  I doubt if that decision was taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who was Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am illustrating what is going on and establishing what <Col N="420" /> is going on by what has happened in the past.  Nobody will tell me that the Minister for Finance decided that upon the sale of a house to which you added one room and which you bought for £1,000 and sold for £4,000 you should pay income tax at a rate of one-third. Nobody can tell me that these decisions were proposed in the Finance Bill of 1967.  They were changed because of public outcry and outcry from Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  Let nobody tell me that Deputy Jack Lynch stated that we will sit down and rake in finance on this.</P>
      <P>I have taxed your indulgence up to now in these illustrations.  There are others to which I would have liked to refer but I do not wish to travel too far on this Bill.  I do not believe for a single moment that these kind of decisions were ever taken by the Ministers in question.  There is another way in which real power is being exercised in this country by the public service.  Dáil Éireann has assented to it because the Fianna Fáil Government with its machine majority has been able to push these regulations through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We voted money to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare is run <Col N="421" /> and staffed by a great number of civil servants, some of whom have the appellation of Deciding Officers and some of whom are called Appeals Officers.  I think they exercise an undue amount of power.  Their decision under the Social Welfare Acts and under the Occupational Injuries Act is final and while there were some people who thought, and this was particularly true of the trade union movement, of marrying the Occupational Injuries Act to the social welfare procedure, that taking it away from the courts would be a good thing, I was glad to see that some of the Labour Deputies in Dáil Éireann put severe strictures on the Department of Social Welfare Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers in relation to the manner in which they were discharging their duties.  I do not think that any of these officers or any public servant has that depth of vision or independence which it is necessary to have in order to decide the kind of things which are currently being decided.  Various people have complained to me regarding the procedure at present adopted But what can you do?  I have heard of the case of people being examined by a Department of Social Welfare referee; the examination was of the most cursory character and on the decision of that minor examination the fate of somebody, whether entitled to sickness benefit or injury benefit under the Occupational Injuries Act, is decided.  It is a far cry from the hearing given the limited number of disputed cases, and is still being given, during the currency of the Workmen's Compensation Acts in the circuit court.  It is a far cry indeed from the kind of hearing they get before a circuit court judge.  That is where power has been translated from the courts to the civil service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the insurance companies because, in all undisputed cases, the insurance companies pay up according to law.  Only a small proportion came to the courts and the vast majority of these went through.  There can always be appeals.  That is the <Col N="422" /> exercise of real power.  According to my information, it is not being prudently or fairly exercised at the present time.</P>
      <P>I think the time has been reached in this country, with so many decisions that can be made by public servants, to have some from of administrative tribunals to which there can be a right of appeal.  It is absurd to say that the Minister for Local Government, under the Planning and Development Act, 1963, can decide the hundreds and hundreds of cases that come to him each year under the Town Planning Act alone.  The truth of the matter is that the Minister acts upon the report of an inspector who holds an inquiry.</P>
      <P>I have attended some of these inquiries at which the inspectors have been very diligent.  But sometimes, when I thought matters of great import were being given in evidence by one side or another, I looked to see if the pencil of the inspector was writing and, whether or not it ceased writing in admiration of the evidence I do not know, but the important part of the evidence was not being taken down by the inspector.  Therefore, an incomplete report was made to the Minister with whatever recommendation the inspector thought fit.</P>
      <P>Let nobody say that the Minister for Local Government can effectively discharge his duty of deciding appeals under the Planning and Development Act, 1963, in the way it is being done at present.  If he is a very conscientious Minister&mdash;I say this without reference to the present Minister: I am sure he is&mdash;he cannot read the 1,000 or 1,500 reports that come to him, consider them in relation to plans, maps and so forth, and then make his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical and the only feasible approach for the Minister to adopt&mdash; except in the more important cases such as the one pending at present in relation to Hume Street and St. Stephen's Green&mdash;is to ratify the decision of the inspector.  Here, again, the real power of decision is being exercised by a public servant.  The Minister is sealing it with his seal but that is purely nominal in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners were purely nominal when I threatened legal <Col N="423" /> proceedings in relation to the case of an unfortunate widow.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the whole field of grants and licences for this, that and the other.  The effective decision and the real power of deciding rests with the public servant, with no real form of appeal to anybody outside of those who have taken a decision.  These are things that affect people in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of criticism from time to time about the amount of law which is enacted enabling regulations to be made under it by various Ministers or statutory bodies.  The truth of the matter is that in modern times it would be impossible to compile in any one enactment all the details that subsequently can be dealt with in regulations.  Here again, one cannot emphasise too clearly the unfortunate position in which members of the public find themselves&mdash;the public <i>vis-á-vis</i> the civil service.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in this country, no matter how learned he may be in the law, who, at any particular time, can tell the position with regard to regulations made under any Act.  Just consider the position in regard to social welfare legislation.  Somebody said to me: &ldquo;Can you tell me for a certainty, on the basis of the information available to you, that these are the only regulations that are made&mdash;and you can have a fee of whatever you like to mark for giving me that information?&rdquo; I could not express an opinion because there is no way of knowing at any particular moment what regulations are made under any particular Act. There is no up-to-date index.  There is nothing to indicate what regulations are amended by subsequent regulations.  The only person who knows that is the officer of the Minister's Department.  Frequently, I have to direct solicitors and, as a public representative myself, if I have any doubt about it, I have to get in touch with the particular civil servant in the section in order to ascertain whether any amendment has been made to any regulations.  As often as not I am told: &ldquo;A regulation was made last week.&rdquo; This is deplorable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> The Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the Stationery Office and who, generally, is in charge of Government printing, should see to it that the public have available to them at all times an up-to-date index of regulations and those which, from time to time, are amended.  This is vitally necessary in the case of the Department of Social Welfare and in other cases, too.  All of the regulations made under a particular group of statutes should be consolidated so that any person who wants to find out the position can look at one group of statutes. A note to the effect that regulations amending Order so and so are varied by so and so and shall have effect as if a certain paragraph were therein inserted means nothing except to the person who drafted it and, probably after 12 months, it does not mean anything to him either.  It is a matter to which the Government and the Minister for Finance should attend.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk where power resides.  I am speaking of power in relation to regulations which certainly resides in the person who knows what is in them and in no other person. Another development is to be detected under this present Government. There have been numerous White Papers in relation to valuation of premises, in relation to occupational industries, the recent Ground Rents Bill, and so on.  All of these and the whole trend in modern legislation under the present Government is to take power from the independent authorities that were hitherto accustomed to exercise that power and vest it in Civil Service administrators.  The decision of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to vest the arbitration of matters arising under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act of 1966, I think, in county registrars is now regarded with mild amusement by every person who has anything to do with the Act.  The county registrars are well outside their depth in dealing with that particular piece of legislation.  The problems which it has thrown up are quite hopelessly presented to them for solution.  They have neither the time nor the necessary skills available to do that.</P>
    <P>This is the trend.  You take it away <Col N="425" /> from the courts because you do not like the courts.  Fianna Fáil do not like the courts because the courts have always put a halt to their gallop&mdash;&ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In due time, we shall see.  I have very little doubt what it will say.  If you wish me to commit my opinion in writing, I shall be glad to do so.  The whole trend is to take these things away from independent authorities and to bring them into the Civil Service.  This is a further accretion of power to the public service to be exercised by public officials and wielded by Ministers.  It seems to me the Ministers who are seen so much around the country at every dog race meeting and at every garage that is opened should instead be seen to spend more time in their offices in consultation with the able and dedicated body of civil servants who are there at their disposal.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance is not here to hear some remarks I should like him to hear on the proposal to decentralise.  Of course, everybody agrees that decentralisation is a valuable thing.  Dublin is becoming absurdly top heavy and the report of this gentleman, this town planner, who suggested yet another three satellites, was ridiculous at a time when the rest of the country is underdeveloped. There are more ways than one of decentralising. The decision that was not made by the Government but was announced by Ministers in advance of the Government&mdash;by one Minister, at any rate, in advance of the Government announcement&mdash;was ill-conceived. The announcement of this decision in this manner, without any prior consultation with the Civil Service, was a ghastly mistake because the plan will be made successful in its final working out only by the persons who are comprised in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service, I have little doubt, would have accepted&mdash;and will accept, perhaps with misgivings but nonetheless loyally &mdash; the decision to decentralise if they had been given prior notice, if there had been proper and <Col N="426" /> adequate consultation with them, if there had been even an indication that there would be full and adequate consultation.  The decision as announced, however, has aroused widespread antipathy and resentment within the public service.</P>
    <P>I can think of two parallels in my experience.  When I was the servant of the Civil Service some time in the early fifties, I remember that the Department of Finance decided to introduce what they called organisation and methods officers.  Of course, their methods and time and motion studies were then relatively new in this country, and it was a very progressive step on the part of the Department of Finance; but instead of consulting with the Civil Service staff associations about this project, they first of all announced it and, of course, the homeostatic or the auto-immune processes that work in the Civil Service reacted straight away and they said: &ldquo;We will have none of it.&rdquo;  The organisation and methods officers, the whole scheme of organisation and methods in the Civil Service, walked on crutches from then on.  Civil servants are not accustomed to change. They are not built for flexibility.  It is difficult to get a group like the Civil Service to accept readily a decision handed out to them such as the organisation and methods scheme some years ago.  That was foolishness on the part of the Department of Finance proper in those days.</P>
    <P>The other decision, which was a Ministerial one and which caused widespread revulsion in the public service to the cost of the Government, was the decision of the Minister for Finance in 1951 not to honour in full the findings of an arbitration board.  That produced a violent reaction and the tremors of that reaction were to be felt for many years.  I think Etna has started up again with this proposal to decentralise, so unceremoniously handed out.  The Minister for Finance, no doubt, called in the chairman of the General Council of the Staff Panel the day before it was announced and said: &ldquo;There it is&rdquo;. That is nothing like the consultation procedure provided for in the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  The Civil Service were promised in that scheme <Col N="427" /> of conciliation and arbitration that they would be consulted before any legislation peculiarly affecting them was introduced.  It would be hard to get anything so closely analogous as the decision to decentralise.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the decision of the Government in this respect was born of any well thought out or defined plan.  I know that Senator Dr. Ryan, when he was Minister for Finance, set up some kind of committee and I think the present Minister for Lands said in Castlebar during the 1965 election campaign that the committee which he and the Minister for Finance set up would be reporting shortly.  I do not know if that committee have reported or whether the report was ever published.  It certainly has not been referred to in the discussions on decentralisation.  I would have thought that if it was right and proper for Senator Dr. Ryan to set up a committee, it would be desirable to have a report which would be the subject of a debate in public and in the Dáil, and particularly among civil servants, so that gradually the idea of decentralisation would become part and parcel of the thought and make-up of our public servants and they would not be so rudely awakened out of their way of life as they have been by this announcement.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there has been any planning behind this move.  I would have appreciated it if the Department of Education were being transferred to a place like Galway, which is close to the Gaeltacht and is badly in need of the kind of income group to be found in the Department of Education to furnish more students for UCG and more income for that institution.  I do not know what advantage its transfer to Athlone confers on the surrounding area.</P>

      <P>If it is still there.  At the rate, as they are closing the railways we might have to go by the Grand Canal.  However, this entire matter was obviously a power struggle within the Cabinet.  The Minister for Lands said Castlebar.  We know of a politician who <Col N="428" /> set his eye on a public office and put it into the newspapers.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said: &ldquo;There it is&rdquo;, and he had to appoint him to that office.  There was a by-election as a result.  That happened, and the Minister for Lands no doubt took a leaf out of that book which was well known to him.</P>
      <P>I would have thought this would be done according to some plan, but we have this new form of Government action by bludgeoning and blundering &mdash;like amalgamating Trinity College with UCD and letting everybody else work out the details; like the new health scheme promised 18 months ago and not a sign of it; like the draining of the Shannon and not a sign of it; like the £1¼ million for Galway for university development, not a halfpenny of which will be provided for years to come.  I would have thought this would be worked out in good Civil Service fashion&mdash;that somebody would have opened a file for Lands and another one for Education and that they would have planned step by step and decided when the Minister would have attended to cut the first sod of the new Department of Lands building in Castlebar and when the Taoiseach would be sent down to cut the first sod of the new Department of Education building, or perhaps they would have sent the President down to do it, in Athlone.  All those things should have been planned.  There has been a great deal of unnecessary disquiet and upset caused to a wide variety of the most devoted people by this decision. I know of one poll taken in one Department of one or two joint grades and out of 120 there was only one who volunteered to go West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that a lifetime of saving and of endeavour has been put into people's homes here in the suburbs of Dublin, of those who are married with children.  Children have been placed in schools here in Dublin. There is no guarantee that the Convent of Mercy in Castlebar will be able to accommodate anything like the number of children who are going to go down to that school or that subjects which those children are being taught here in <Col N="429" /> Dublin schools, which their parents want them taught and which they are entitled to have them taught, will be taught in the Convent of Mercy or the De le Salle College in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Those are real problems and there is no use in saying that there will be teachers.  There will be between 50 and 60 children who will be seriously affected by this lack of planning.  It may be some comfort I suppose to the people who are affected to think that rather a lot of other Fianna Fáil plans and promises have been slow in implementation and still slower in bearing fruit.  I would have thought that if they were going to transfer any Department, that if they were going to decentralise at all, that there are certain units in a variety of Departments which could be transferred to any town, such as Castlebar, Athlone or Waterford, or anywhere else you like, and that in any Department there would always be found enough volunteers or enough people who would not be upset by this decentralisation.  I would have thought that in such a situation if you wanted to transfer 3,000 or 5,000 civil servants to the West it would have been possible in the various Departments to pick out certain self-contained units, such as a law branch, and that those could be hived off into various towns in the country with no dislocation to anybody in any particular Department.</P>
    <P>When you single out a whole Department to transfer to another part of the country undoubtedly this creates insoluble problems as far as the civil servants are concerned.  The same thing could have been achieved, as I say, if we had hived off self-contained units, which are in any Department, and this would have achieved exactly the same number of civil servants to transfer to the West.  It would have been a very good thing to have a variety of Government offices with some contact with the people in the various towns.  That, to my mind, would have been a far better way of approaching this.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Lands spoke in Castlebar during 1965 he referred to the transfer of the Forestry Division of his Department.  I think that is what he had in mind and that that is probably what was in the Ryan Report. <Col N="430" /> It certainly seems to me to be a more sensible and a more cautious way of doing this.  It certainly would have been welcomed by the civil servants. It was a recommendation, which, if it was made, would have been followed.</P>
    <P>The situation now is that married men and no less the single men and women have been upset.  I want to point out that to my certain knowledge there are many people in the Civil Service of this country who have grown into spinsterhood and bachelorhood because they were looking after a dependent mother or father or the children of a married brother or sister or looking after a sick relative.  They still have to look after them.  Some of those civil servants brought their relations to Dublin so that they could look after them.  That is the kind of thing which will be upset now.</P>
    <P>It is an intractable problem when you are transferring a whole Department. It would not have been so if you did it otherwise.  The sooner an announcement is made the better it will be because there may well be a stage that, because of the intractable problem which will be there for some civil servants, they would retire without full pension or certainly with full pension on attaining 60 years of age.  We have precedent for that in the legislation of this country.  The British, when they were getting out of here, made that provision for their civil servants in Article 10 of the Treaty.  That was honoured by the Irish Government right up to the 1940s and later.  They were given permission to retire, if they could show that their conditions of service had been worsened.  The same happened in legislation which took place in the 1920s in relation to the railways. There was a scheme of redundancy whereby they were enabled to retire if their conditions had worsened.  The same thing happened under legislation affecting the railways and canals in 1954 and under dieselisation in 1955. When that came in it caused redundancy. I do not know whether that has been adopted in regard to the British railways.  We have a better record in that respect.  Similarly, under the amalgamation of the GNR and CIE, <Col N="431" /> we had legislation to cover that in 1958.</P>
    <P>When it was necessary in the interests of the common good and the public interests to do something which, while it may be entirely valid so far as the contracts of the people are concerned, when such a decision is necessary, when it is necessary to do something which will upset their lives and upset their way of living, such people are entitled to expect morally, if not legally, that we should provide some escape for those who find it necessary to take a somewhat smaller pension. We should certainly provide them with the opportunity of retiring, if they so wish, rather than transfer them.  The sooner an announcement is made the sooner it will relieve the unnecessary worry and misery which some people have had to bear since this announcement was first made.</P>
    <P>There is another intractable problem that has been presented to me by some people I know in the Civil Service. Indeed, I know from my own experience that there are some people who will not leave Dublin if they are told to do so, and who will forfeit their promotion rights, which they have got in the Department, if they remained in it.  That will create a problem for those people and it will be a grave disappointment to them.  I do not know how best to attack that problem.  The redundancy affecting promotion in the Civil Service is in my experience the most insoluble problem which has ever been encountered.  Everybody is unhappy with this.  I can see people deciding to remain here in Dublin and this will affect not alone the persons in the Department to which it is necessary to have them transferred, where they will block promotion, and, of course, the people themselves so transferred will, I rather think, forfeit promotion, if not for all time certainly for a very long time to come.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of problems that affect the civil servants.  It is no use laughing at the typical view the public have of the civil servant as somebody who is bound hand and foot with red tape and who is a faceless person.  Of course, they <Col N="432" /> are not.  They are the men and women living on the same estate as any of us all around the city of Dublin with their families and their wives to think of.  They have a network of relations and friends.  In the public interest all that will be thrown overboard. There is a real problem there that has to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is particularly burdened by the Government with the responsibility of looking after the revival of the Irish language.  I do not think the present Minister for Finance has any time for Irish in the sense that, as a Minister charged with the economy of the country and with all the many things he has to do, he can possibly find the time to devote in a worthwhile way to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Revival of Irish.  It is an absurdity to say that the job of reviving the Irish language should be given to the least flexible and, in the public mind at any rate, the most fossilised Department of them all, the Department of Finance.  The thing sounds crazy from the start.  If it had been given to the Department of Education people could accept that, or if it had been given to the Department of the Gaeltacht people would think that that was a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The only effort as far as the public are concerned is one which, in fact, I do not think the Minister for Finance had hand, act or part in.  The only person who spoke about it on television was the Minister for Education, if my memory serves me.  That is the new programme <i>Buntús Cainte.</i> That, to my mind, is a programme that has been very well received by the public which indicates the fertile field that is there to be cultivated.  Now, instead of learning Irish ó glún na máthair we are learning it ó glún na spéirmhná nó ón ainnir on our screens.  It is a popular programme and well done on the lines of <i>Parliamo Italiano</i> and the French programme.  I feel that if the proper background work were put into preparing the people of this country for a programme of that kind and if the people were properly cultivated, we would find a great deal less difficulty in getting people to cotton <Col N="433" /> on to <i>Buntús Cainte</i> and <i>Labhair Gaeilge Linn</i> and, what is more important, speaking such Irish as they know.  The truth of the matter is that most of us are shy or bashful about speaking such Irish as we know because the idea has not yet got abroad of speaking what I term revival Irish&mdash;Irish that certainly is not of the standard of the native Gaeilgeóir but is good Irish in 1967 and should be spoken widely and be widely approved of.  I am glad to see that Telefís Éireann has got its news announcers who are obviously people who have not Irish ó glún na máthair to deliver the news in Irish.  That is a thing which I recommended myself to the Commission on Irish.  I was the only member of Oireachtas Éireann to give such evidence to the Commission. That must be ten years ago, but better late than never.  I am glad to see that it has been introduced.</P>
    <P>On the BBC recently they had a programme about cells.  Senator Dr. Alton is not here, unfortunately, but it was a very highly scientific programme, well outside my reach and comprehension. The programme was absolutely fascinating in the way in which it showed the development of cells and how they can be interfered with.  The important thing is if you have one good living cell to keep it alive.  Unfortunately, whenever one goes to the Gaeltacht, whether it is in Galway, Mayo or Kerry, one sees year in and year out the inevitable dying of the living cells of the Irish language.  There is nothing effective being done by the Government nor do I know of any promise even to do anything effective to even keep the attenuated areas of the Gaeltacht alive and vibrant.  I cannot understand why it would not be good policy for the Department of the Gaeltacht and Bord Fáilte to erect a fine, big luxury hotel such as they are going to erect in Dún Laoghaire, out in Spiddal or, better still, down in the Belmullet peninsula where there are strands by the mile unpeopled all day, every day, during the summer, and no shortage of staff for hotels.  That would provide something for the people.  It would provide some incentive for them to grow vegetables and the other things that hotels require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> I suppose if they did establish an hotel in such a place we would be getting Michael Joe Costello's dessicated carrots and dessicated French beans because of the incapacity of the organisers of this country to organise local suppliers into supplying fresh vegetables.  Either that or establish factories where there are populations. Stuffing dolls and making teddy bears and so on and paying girls £5 or £6 a week is not even an effort at industrialising the Gaeltacht and as certain as the Government does not do that and subsidise transport to those areas&mdash;that seems to me to be the only added cost and disincentive to industrialists going there&mdash;as certain as we are sitting here in 1967 the Gaeltach will die.  It is dying and we are doing nothing to give moral support, not to speak of financial support, to the people of the Gaeltacht. Because these people are living in poor areas they feel that speaking Irish is the badge of poverty and nobody is doing anything to try to bring home to them that they are the people who are in a unique position in this country as far as Irish is concerned. If one meets some of them and tells them that they are so pleased to hear that there are some people who have that kind of respect for them.  There is nothing being done by the Department of the Gaeltacht, by the Minister for Finance who is charged with implementing the Revival of Irish plan, the Department of Education, Bord Fáilte, the Department of Industry and Commerce or anybody else to save the last remnants of the Gaeltacht that it is still possible to save.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, I would hope and suggest that Telefís Éireann should try to do something about bringing the actual Gaeltacht to the people since there is not the accommodation in most Gaeltacht areas for the people to go to the Gaeltacht.  So long as we continue with the Fianna Fáil policy of making sure that people must pass their Irish for their examinations and that we do not leave it optional to people, so long will we have antipathy towards Irish and so long will Governments feel they have not got the people behind them in these extraordinary <Col N="435" /> measures which are necessary to deal with an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>I think the sooner the Fianna Fáil Government adopt the Fine Gael policy in relation to Irish in the schools the sooner will you get the kind of attitude towards Irish that will enable it to grow steadily and enable the Government, if they feel that it has not the moral support at the moment which it should have, to do the kind of things for the Gaeltacht area that urgently require to be done.  A time was when we were told that the two great national problems were the saving of the Irish language and the ending of Partition.  I am afraid that the exponents of the two ideas did damn all for saving Irish and damn little for Partition.  If Partition is ever ended in this country it will be due to two people&mdash;to Pope John for his decree on the need for tolerance and to Ian Paisley who shows how intolerant people can be when they live together. Paisley has done more to expose the weaknesses of the Stormont Government and the Stormont régime over a period of 40 years than all the talk and all the exhortations and all the complaints that could ever be made.</P>
    <P>As my time is running short, I should like to devote some little time to a few matters of importance.  In my own profession, as in other professions, there is need for modernisation.  One could take a decision to get rid of wigs and gowns and one could say that the Government have got rid of these things.  There is a great deal of nonsense in them but there it is.  If the Government got rid of them to-morrow they would say they had reformed the legal profession or were they to decide they would abolish senior counsel.</P>
    <P>There are things in the courts at the present time that to my mind have no relationship with any requirements of modern times.  I shall not proceed further on that line.  That is a matter for the Rules Committee of the various courts.  There is another matter for which the Minister for Finance is responsible and about which he can do something.  There is a requirement that nearly every document that is used in any litigation has to be impressed <Col N="436" /> with a 2/6d or 1/- stamp or whatever it is.  That means that the solicitor's clerk has to take the document which is, first of all, sent from Castlebar, or Bandon or Cork, to his town agent.  In this modern age why we cannot serve these by registered post on every lawyer in the country I do not know.  At any rate, this is sent to the town agent who goes down to the Four Courts where he has to queue up at the counter and pay 2/6d and get his stamps.  This goes on, day in, day out, and the number of man hours wasted in that way is probably incalculable.</P>
    <P>It is, first of all, a question of whether we should waste so much time in the national interest for the sake of the little money got out of it.  I would abolish the stamp altogether for the amount of revenue that is got out of it is negligible.  If the Minister says he will not abolish that source of revenue there is a simple way of dealing with it; that is, by taking all the cases that come in and working out an average and saying on every order the amount to be paid should be ten pounds.  That would be one operation with a limited number of people and it would dispose of the whole procedure.</P>
    <P>You have a procedure whereby you have to get an attested copy of a document which means that the document is brought up to some court official who has it proof-read over to him with another official and then attested with the name of the officer attesting and then stamped.  It is great waste of time and this could be dealt with by placing the onus on the solicitors to send in proper documents.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of things that require to be done and these are the kind of things that cause unnecessary delays, confusion and waste of time.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice should be acquainted. It relates to the appalling conditions of the courthouses around the country and in the city.  It is disgraceful that lawyers require a person to sit from, say, 11 o'clock to 4 o'clock in a cold and draughty court.  He may be 60 or 70 years of age suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or gout or rheum can <Col N="437" /> come on him if he has to sit in these places.  High court judges and circuit court justices have to sit for hours at a time in places that would not meet the specifications I came across one time in a Department of Agriculture leaflet for piggeries, where it was specified that the piggery should be kept sweet and clean.  There are a great number of courthouses that would never reach that specification.  They are most unwholesome, unhealthy, draughty, dull places and this is where justice has to be administered in this country.</P>
    <P>I saw where a district justice was administering down in Achill from 11 o'clock to 9 o'clock and at the end of the day he had no light and it was the ingenuity of one of the gardaí that enabled him to rig up some kind of light.  There was no fire.  In the days of the old Grand Juries courthouses were kept up by assessments collected by the Grand Juries and consequently county councils are supposed to look after those places.  What is clearly a central government charge should not be charged on the rates and the responsibility of cleaning these courthouses should not be left to the county councils.  It is time the Department of Finance and the Minister for Justice awakened up to their responsibility and provided proper accommodation with adequate space with a minimum of toilet accommodation, which does not exist for the public or the people who work there.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer which causes untoward delay to the legal profession and that is the Land Registry.  The Act was enacted in 1963 and its operation was delayed until 1st January, 1967.  It is an absurdity to say that in this day and age, with all the mechanism of photostating and photocoding, and so on, that it takes three months to get land registry maps in the Land Registry even if the fee had been paid.  Either the staff is inadequate or the machinery is inadequate, but it is an absurdity to say that people have to wait so long to close sales of property.  If they are buying a plot of land from a farmer, they must wait in order to see whether the particular plot they have in mind is on the map attached to his folio.  You have <Col N="438" /> to wait three months before you can get it.</P>
    <P>Again, you have the absurdity that you have to pay Land Registry stamps in order that somebody in the Revenue Department can say: &ldquo;We collected so much last year in land registry fees&rdquo;.  I had to go, in pursuance of my lawful duty, to look at a Land Registry map.  In my innocence, I produced £3 to the official who said: &ldquo;You will have to get Land Registry stamps for that&rdquo;.  I asked if I could buy them there and he told me I would have to go to the post office for them.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that one cannot get Land Registry stamps in the Land Registry. This brings the service into disrepute. This is an indication of the inefficiency and lack of concern for public opinion which arouses so much antipathy to the Civil Service and leaves people, like one of the Senators opposite, with a cynical smile when we talk about the sorrows, grievances and so forth, of civil servants who are real flesh and blood.  It is the system of which these unfortunate persons are themselves victims because the Department of Finance will not sanction an increase in expenditure.  That is the reason these things go on.  There are many other matters to which I should like to refer but, in deference to the House, I shall not do so.</P>

      <P>Here is another matter.  We have increased our postal rates to 5d for the ordinary stamp that used to cost 2d, which I think is probably the correct price having regard to money values.  It is absolutely impossible nowadays to have letters delivered on time.  The most recent example I had&mdash;which caused me to make two telephone calls to Ballina and which caused somebody in Ballina to make a phone call back to me during the daylight hours, having to pay the daylight fee of 3/6d for three minutes, or whatever it is&mdash;was a letter posted at 5.30 p.m., according to the postmark, in Ballina on Friday evening. In the ordinary course, that letter should be delivered at my home on Saturday morning: I would not mind <Col N="439" /> that.  However, one would expect it to be delivered on Monday morning&mdash;not on your life.  When I did not get it on Monday morning&mdash;requiring it for court on Tuesday&mdash;I had to make phone calls and somebody else had to phone me back and then it arrived on the Monday afternoon.  This happens all the time.</P>
      <P>I send every one of these postal &ldquo;covers&rdquo;, as they call them in officialese, to the inspector concerned in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. On every occasion, they reply that they have investigated the complaint and tender their apologies.  On this occasion, I felt it necessary to ring up and the man said to me in effect: &ldquo;Of course, you are right.  You have a grievance.  It is shocking.&rdquo;  Where is the breakdown?  It is happening not alone in Ballina, where they have no railway since Dr. Andrews was appointed Chairman of CIE: they have only one line in a day.  It happens from Ballinasloe, from Galway, in the same way.</P>
      <P>If we are paying for a service we are entitled to get it.  A lot of other letter do not arrive on time but it does not make any difference to me because I do not know anything about them.  However, there are letters that I do expect.  All they say is that they will investigate the matter and then they apologise.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should look into the matter and make sure that it does not happen because that is not the type of service for which we are voting something of the order of £9 million in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a look at CIE.  The rail and bus fares have been increased in the past few days.  Is it any wonder that CIE are losing traffic and losing passenger traffic?  When I attended last week to deliver some people to Seán Heuston Station to go on the train to Tralee I noted that two coaches were reserved for people travelling to Tralee. It was Thursday or Friday morning of last week and it was very cold. Lo and behold, when they were getting into the back carriage, which seemed the more modern of the two, a gentleman with a braided hat came along <Col N="440" /> and announced: &ldquo;I would not advise you to go in there: the heating is not working.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The train duly pulled out of Seán Heuston Station with a number of unfortunate people who would have to sit in it from Dublin to Tralee with no heating.  When moneys are voted to a company like CIE, by way of annual subsidy, the management of CIE should delegate to some person the duty of seeing that all of the train is in working order, that all the lights are working, that the train is serviced, that it is fit to be used by the passengers who are paying dear enough fares for it.  That is not an isolated instance in relation to CIE.  I always marvel that they manage to attract as many passengers as they do, because of the manner in which they carry on their business.</P>
    <P>Now, in deference to the feelings of the House, I shall drop a number of other matters on which I should have liked to speak.  I have perhaps dealt in a rather complaining way with some matters and I hope constructively with other matters.  I have a message of good cheer for the House, which it is right and proper to have at this time of the year, that the Government have at last seen the light in regard to one matter, at least.  I am reliably informed by a colleague that when he attended the Government Publications Sales Office on Saturday morning last&mdash;it is one of the places open on a Saturday morning&mdash;in search of a copy of the Livestock Marts Act, 1967&mdash;a measure with which the House will be familiar &mdash;he was informed that the Government Publications Sales Office never received a copy of the Act and that the Bill, as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, was not to be found on the shelves of the Government Publications Sales Office.  I rejoice to think that the Government and the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for Government publications, are ashamed to circulate this notorious Livestock Marts Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To avoid the possibility that I might continue for two hours or more, I shall launch straight into such suggestions as I <Col N="441" /> may have to make in this debate.  The first relates directly to the raising of money and to payments into the National Exchequer.  I shall confine myself to what will be obvious to anyone who listens with an objective mind and who has a layman's approach to this problem.  From the financial accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1967, I note that the total of money paid into the Exchequer by way of income tax and surtax was £63,988,360.  From the same accounts, I note that the total raised by way of turnover tax and wholesale tax was £17,245,670.  It is immediately evident to anybody who compares these two sets of figures that there is a vast gap between them.  For the purpose of my suggestion, this is a matter which obviously raises a problem.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the manner in which our income tax has been raised for a long number of years.</P>
      <P>I am concerned because of the social implications and the burdens which it imposes at present; and I might say I am encouraged in my concern by the fact that apparently economists are satisfied that the added value tax system is economically more desirable and that any hesitation there may be on an added value tax system in substitution for an income tax system is on social grounds.  It is to this that I wish to direct my remarks immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the disadvantages of the income tax system are easily discernible to anybody who makes even the most cursory examination.  One that immediately occurs to me is that the wage and salary earners at every level are being asked to pay more than their fair burden of income tax.  I do not suggest that the system is designed to extract or to impose such a heavy burden on wage and salary earners, but in view of the fact that the same scope of allowances and facilities are not available to them as to self-employed and professional people, this is the first outstanding imbalance that occurs.  I hope that any suggestions I make will be accepted in the light of the fact that it is precisely to relieve the wage and salary earners, who are paying an incidence of income tax beyond their means, however small, <Col N="442" /> that I put forward suggestions for consideration.</P>
    <P>If we compare their position with that of the self-employed or professional people who have facilities for such things as travelling expenses and entertainment allowances, one cannot help getting the notion that to a certain extent the present system encourages living at a high rate of expense; and while it is quite legitimate and allowances can be claimed legitimately under various heads, I find it hard to accept that the single person, for instance in the Civil Service or in any other like employment, earning fixed salaries, should be obliged to pay tax of up to £2 a week from a limited income, whereas other people are being allowed to live at a high standard and being given generous allowances on the basis that they are entitled to them in connection with their businesses. I do not for a moment suggest that there are any sharp practices involved, but all of us are aware that their scope is, indeed, very wide and that the possibility for evasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator would care to move away from that aspect.  Discussion on details of taxation are not appropriate on this measure, though general questions in respect of the burden of tax and the administration of the law in regard to the Revenue Commissioners are appropriate.  I do not wish to curtail the Senator unduly, but this would be more appropriate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to general observations on the system.  The system at present administered imposes, to a certain extent, a tax on incentive in that the more one progresses in a private capacity the more one is obliged to pay. I am not suggesting that those who have most should pay least.  I accept as a principle that those who have most should pay most, but it would be more effective and less painful if such money were raised by way of indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another disadvantage of the present system is that the notion has gone abroad that it is not a system which, for one reason or another, is morally binding on the community.  It appears <Col N="443" /> to be paraded as such&mdash;that though it is a penal tax it does not impose legal or moral obligations, particularly moral.  This notion is bad for the morale of the community at this or any other time.  Such a notion is fairly widespread.</P>
    <P>When I propose, as an alternative, the added value system, I should like to suggest in the first instance that it spreads the burden over the whole community in accordance with spending: he who has money to spend pays tax according to his spending capacity and he who has not money to spend does not bear the same incidence of taxation.  I appreciate that in considering the introduction of such a system, the Government would have to have regard to a different level of indirect taxation in relation to the essentials, such as foodstuffs, clothing and matters of that nature, than in respect of luxury goods such as cosmetics, beer, cigarettes and high-powered cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the Senator's remarks have been general, they have been on matters more appropriate to the Finance Bill.  It would be undesirable if he developed them any further.  The whole House might then turn towards such a discussion, which would not be desirable.  I might add that I do not think it is proper to suggest that there would be any difference of ruling depending on the occupant of the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it regrettable that what I have been saying appears to be less relevant than the method of collecting pigs down in Belmullet, which was relevant for half an hour or more.  I know this is a matter which the Government are considering and I should like to emphasise that the <Col N="444" /> system I have been advocating would not impose any extra burden on those not now subject to income tax.</P>
      <P>Passing to the social welfare sphere, I should like to confine my remarks to social implications rather than economic ones.  The first part of my remarks on the Bill have been directed towards the best way of collecting the necessary money.  We have in recent times seen an immense increase in social welfare benefits.  In Finance Bill after Finance Bill we have seen increases in benefits to widows, orphans, old age pensioners and in children's allowances.  There is still in our social welfare system an element which, though it may be reasonable for administrative purposes, is undesirable in its implementation.</P>
      <P>It is that the old age and widows pensions should be subject to a means test.  I feel if those are made available for the reason that persons have been bereft of their wage earners or husbands, or have reached a certain age, they should be available to them as such without having to go through a searching means test.  At present there is a danger that people who endeavour to supplement their rather meagre pensions by any extra work may thereby render themselves ineligible for the benefits which are being made available.</P>
      <P>I see great improvements being introduced in this sphere but I would ask that more would be done.  The Occupational Injuries Bill, which came before us in this House, introduced a very desirable innovation in allowing maintenance allowances for those who are attending people ill or injured as the result of an accident or injury in their employment.  I would like to see those maintenance allowances extended so that people who are ill or old would be given the facilities for such treatment, that such treatment would be encouraged in their homes, where it can best be made available, rather than later on in an institution away from their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend to the Government that the principle which was strongly implemented in the Occupational Injuries Bill would be more widely introduced in our social welfare system.  Another principle which, <Col N="445" /> rather than a payment, is really getting to the hub of the problem, is the availability of services, whether it is electricity or travel.  Those are all things which give our social welfare system an enlightened approach and that is to be encouraged.  Again, we can hope that the Department of Social Welfare will, with the moneys which are made available to it, continue to develop those necessary services which have been very widely and very well received.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that sometimes causes most heart-searching for many of those who are familiar with the pattern of social welfare in the country is that the special allowances which are made available to the older generation, who contributed their share towards achieving the freedom we now enjoy, is subject also to a fairly stringent means test.  While it is meant to be an addition to the special pensions which those people may have, and while most of them because of their age are now in receipt of the old age pension, I still feel that the means test which is imposed is a rather restrictive one and it limits rather more than it should.  I feel that we should not have such a means test when we are extending something to those old warriors, if I may call them such.  At the same time, there is no doubt that this and other schemes like it, which have been introduced and implemented by this Government, are fully accepted and indeed very strongly appreciated by those who are in receipt of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I now come to another sphere of social activity, in which the Government can take every pride.  Although, of course, it is one of <Col N="446" /> the most basic social activities, that of education, we have heard from time to time much criticism of the fact that the Government's schemes are not being made available as widely as they might, that there are problems of transport, that it is not all it was purported to be. I think all must recognise that in introducing such an enlightened scheme as post-primary education&mdash;the Government and the Minister in particular realise that this was an immediate priority, a matter of immediate urgency &mdash;this Minister cannot wait any longer until our smaller problems have been resolved before we tackle our major problems.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems in this country for some time has been the lack of development of our national potential, our personnel.  The Minister is to be highly complimented on ensuring that this scheme of post-primary education was introduced and implemented without any delay and that such problems as there were are now being ironed out in the light of experience.  The Minister might well have waited for two or three years until those problems had been ironed out in the first instance.  This House should acknowledge that this was indeed a very determined and progressive step on the part of the Minister. I believe more will yet follow.  This House, as we know, is debating a motion on university education and I will not introduce any comments on that beyond saying that I think we can expect to see a rationalisation of every level of our educational facilities. We can expect also to be assured that our education at every level will be made available to those who are best equipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sometimes occurs to me that one of the factors which would most develop our national resources would be an extension of the regional development programme which the Government have at present undertaken. I am, in this instance, encouraged to know that the Government are, in fact, at present considering an extension of regional development in the field of industrial programming.  If I might, just before dealing with any aspect of industrial <Col N="447" /> programming, come to one particular and precise point, which I feel cries out for regional development, that is our road construction and development scheme.</P>
    <P>It appals me from time to time to see the difference between road construction techniques and the road services which exist between adjoining counties along the main roads.  I feel this is one of the possible contributory factors to the high accident rate which we are all so used to deploring at present.  Anyone who travels at any stage throughout the country will notice as soon as one comes to a county boundary the whole contour, the whole breadth and vision of the road on which one is travelling changes abruptly with all the other consequent problems that arise from adjusting oneself to another type of road service without any warning.  We used to have a system whereby the county boundaries were clearly marked but in recent times this practice has not been followed.  I feel that this is one sphere where there could be a great saving of public money and, more important, a very definite saving of the lives of the community, if we were to develop a regional road programme rather than the existing county programme.  I do not want to dwell any longer on that because I feel I might be tempting the indulgence of the Chair.</P>

      <P>This regional programme would, of course, be consistent with the regional programmes at present launched and actually being undertaken by the Government.  One can see immediate evidence of this in the field of tourism.  One can see the regional development tourist boards which are doing such effective work on the spot in the various areas throughout the country.  One can see evidence of the same type of development in the regional programming which is now being launched in the <Col N="448" /> field of industrial development and, in fact, has already been launched in places like Shannon and Waterford. I say this merely to indicate that with this new concept, which even be it said is not fully adopted though certainly stated as policy by the European community, we are very much ahead in this concept of regional development and it should very much assist and facilitate us in adjusting ourselves to a European community, if and when such an occasion arose. I understand that this is their stated policy though they have gone only half the road that we have in implementing such regional programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, as I am sure everybody will be, with seeing the full development of our national resources. I am concerned that this country now having been given an opportunity by the initiative of this Government will be allowed to expand and continue to realise our full potential without any of the derisive cries which we hear from time to time, cries that the Government should be more left or right or this or that.  It often occurs to me that it is a strange thing at a time when other societies which almost nurtured themselves on political labels are dropping these labels, as instanced by the recent interview with the new British Chancellor of the Exchequer as being almost a barrier to the full development and potential of any economic activity, that parts of our society are insisting not that the country move together in one organised community but that the country be expected to divide itself into labels which is exactly what will prevent the full development of our national resources.  One hears short-term criticisms of the industrial incentives given by the Government to foreign investors and one hears in this House and the lower House complaints about Potez and the other one or two which are so significant by the fact that they are the few.  I must say that I would be much happier to hear constructive suggestions from those who would say that those failures should never have occurred because I feel the record speaks for itself.  Were it not for the programme of industrial development <Col N="449" /> and attraction of foreign investment to our country our nation would not now be realising and enjoying the economic activity and welfare which it is enjoying.</P>

      <P>It may be convenient for Senator O'Quigley to say that the country is now enclosed in a pall of gloom and despair.  This strikes me as being unfortunately typical of the most negative type of opposition which the present Government have had to tolerate for so long.  I feel that it would have been much more beneficial, and certainly that the interests of the community would have been much more effectively advanced, if we spent more of our time suggesting community development efforts rather than criticising as we heard in this House last year the salary payable to a particular person on his retirement from a particular board.  This is the kind of convenient catch-phrasing and criticism which does no service to the Opposition and certainly offers no facility to the community.  I say this in the light of the fact that we are now on the threshold of increased exposure to outside economies.  We have developed our own and we must continue to develop it in the light of this new exposure.  I have no doubt that the Irish people, given the opportunity for such community development, will realise, in view of the new educational incentives that are being offered, our full potential in this sphere.  I feel that the realisation of such would be a much better facility than the divisive cries that we have heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just start at the point where the previous speaker finished, that is in relation to the grants which were allowed to one of the factories which he mentioned.  I would like to say that it was allowed to them as a result of the Industrial Grants Acts, which were brought in by the inter-Party Government and, of course, the foreign money that has been brought into this country is as a result of the setting up of the Industrial Development Authority which <Col N="450" /> Deputy Lemass promised to dismantle as soon as he got an opportunity of doing so.</P>
      <P>I heard Senator O'Quigley mention the fact that the Marts Bill was not available in the Government Publications office.  It is just typical of, one might suggest, the attitude of the Minister in relation to the issues that were there when that Bill was being implemented.</P>
      <P>Now we have a situation, and I think it is only right to mention it because of what appears to be a national emergency, and that is the action which has been taken by the Minister and which has not been taken by him to ensure the safety of our livestock population. We have the NFA giving the lead in the matter of advocating the necessary precautions which are required by this very important sector of our economy. The NFA are giving the lead and the Minister is following.  It is a good thing that he did agree to follow some of the advice that he got from the NFA in relation to these precautions.  However if I may make a suggestion to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to this matter, I feel that the Minister should now try to have the disinfecting process commenced in England, that is, where the people coming to this country step on to the train, boat or plane.  I suggest that the disinfecting process should start there and that a further process be followed on their arrival in this country.  Many people in this country, but not enough, realise the danger of the plague coming in and wiping out our livestock population.</P>

    <Title>Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) (Amendment) Bill, 1967&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="451" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, so that the election of members of the Dublin District Milk Board which is due to be held this year may be held in 1968 instead.  The reason for this change is that the situation arising from the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain make it most desirable that the election should not take place at present.</P>
      <P>Hitherto elections of members of milk boards have been conducted by postal ballot.  I do not consider, however, that postal balloting is a satisfactory system for such elections.  For example, secrecy cannot always be ensured and there is a risk of abuse through such occurrences as ballot papers getting into the hands of persons other than those entitled to vote. For these reasons I arranged for a change in the election system so that in future voting would be by secret ballot at polling stations provided by the milk board concerned.  I might add that the question of making a similar change in the election of members of An Bord Bainne is being examined.</P>
      <P>Because of the crisis created by the foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Britain it is very important that the congregation of voters at rural polling stations should be avoided at present, and, therefore, that the election for the Dublin Board should not be held until 1968.  Section 1 of the Bill provides for this.  It will not, however, affect subsequent elections to the Dublin Board which will, therefore, take place in 1970 and each third year thereafter.  Neither will it affect elections to the Cork District Milk Board which is the only other board established under the principal Act.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in the Dáil, an election of members of the Dublin Board will be held as soon as possible in 1968 after the risks arising from the foot and mouth disease outbreaks in Britain have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some doubt as to whether the power under the principal Act to make an Order appointing an election day automatically includes power to <Col N="452" /> revoke such an Order.  Section 3 of the Bill is designed to remove any doubt that may exist in regard to the recent order revoking the 1967 election day Order for the Dublin Board.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he has any idea of the date.  He has mentioned section 3 of the Bill, but could he tell me briefly what the probable date will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not any clear idea at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister said that section 3 sets out the date on which the election takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the election should have taken place some time now but owing to the national emergency in relation to the foot and mouth disease the Minister has decided that the election of members should be postponed.  I should like to know whether it will be postponed for 12 months from the date on which the election should have taken place this year?  In other words, will the members of the existing board have another year to serve on that board before the election takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the place of residence of many of these people who are entitled to vote, I think it is a fair enough suggestion that postal voting should be permitted, particularly under the kind of supervision I envisage will take place.  I expect that, in future, people who have a vote will probably have to produce a ballot paper in the same manner as voters for Seanad elections are required to produce the ballot paper in a sealed envelope in the presence of a Superintendent of the Gardaí or a Sergeant for the district.  He will see that the ballot paper is not marked.  By reason of his office, he will ensure secrecy of the marking of the paper at that particular barracks or place where the <Col N="453" /> voting will be supervised, of course, by a responsible person.  When the voting takes place in that manner, I think we can feel satisfied that there will be no question of, if you like, bribery in the matter of casting votes or any undue influence on the persons who will have the right to vote in these elections.</P>
    <P>It is a new principle, I think, apart from the system of voting in relation to the election of members of the Seanad.  I welcome it because I think in future we must consider the possibility of making similar facilities available to electors who cannot be present at any particular polling station for the purpose of casting votes in ordinary Parliamentary elections.  I feel this is one more step towards the achievement of that kind of aim.  For instance, commercial travellers may have to be down the country on the day of a Parliamentary election.  They will have a ballot paper which they can produce in the presence of a responsible person, show that the paper is blank, then vote, put it in a sealed envelope and address it to the place where the votes will be counted.  I think this is a very practical suggestion.  I think it is a move in the right direction in so far as concerns the casting of votes by people who cannot conveniently be in a certain place on a certain day for the purpose of casting their votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this measure.  I feel that the Minister and the Department should be supported in every individual step they may take to ensure that the dangers of the spread of foot and mouth disease will be minimised in this country.  We assure the Minister that we shall afford him and his Department every possible co-operation.  We shall advocate inasmuch as is humanly possible, that every section of the community do their share to ensure that unnecessary dangers and risks will not be allowed to aggravate the spread of the disease, particularly in so far as the milk and dairy industry is concerned.  This is one section of the farming industry that would certainly take a very bad beating if the disease got any foothold at all in our country.  Therefore, any regulation the Minister now sees fit to introduce <Col N="454" /> cannot be regarded as too strict or too severe.  What is at stake is of tremendous magnitude and we support the Minister in every step he takes.</P>

The intention is that, within 1967, the election will be arranged by Order in the normal way as soon as it appears safe to do so.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was mentioning, in relation to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which comes under this Appropriation Bill, that I consider it necessary immediately to put into effect more stringent regulations than the present regulations to protect this country against the cattle plague known as &ldquo;foot and mouth disease&rdquo;.  An outbreak here would affect our economy to a far greater extent than it would affect the British economy.  So far, the British have lost approximately 250,000 animals&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs and other animals that must be slaughtered under <Col N="455" /> the law of the land when this disease enters a farm.  If we lost anything like that number of animals in this country, or had 2,000 outbreaks&mdash;the number is almost 2,000 outbreaks now in Great Britain&mdash;there would be a national financial crisis because of the importance of the livestock industry to our country and to our economy.  It would put out of business many other organisations indirectly associated with the livestock trade.  We can easily call to mind the various trades which are immediately dependent on the cattle industry&mdash;the slaughter of cattle, the sale of cattle and the export of cattle.</P>
      <P>The revenue which the export of cattle on the hoof, and canned, brings in represents a very large part of the total value of our exports.  Therefore, I consider that the Government ought to get in touch with the British Minister of Agriculture and with the British Government about precautions in Britain so far as people leaving for Ireland is concerned.  If people are allowed to come here, some will certainly be arriving from infected areas.  Many of them may be farm workers in areas in Britain where the disease is rampant.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I suggest that the disinfection process should begin at the stage where such people begin their journeys.  If we consider it desirable to allow people from Britain to come into the country at this stage of the crisis&mdash;that is what it has become&mdash;we should take very stringent precautions that the disease will not be carried in.  The arrival of one person carrying this virulent germ would be enough to start its spread throughout the country.  It has spread throughout the greater part of England and it has taken them a very long time to control its spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we should not take any risks.  We should implement very strictly any precautions we consider necessary.  Of course, because it takes the virus three weeks after infection to show itself, we shall not know until three weeks have passed whether our efforts have been successful so far.  It may be here already.  That is the situation in which we find ourselves <Col N="456" /> and that is why more stringent precautions should be implemented at this stage when, we are led to believe, many of our kith and kin will be returning to visit their relatives during the Christmas holidays.  I was glad to learn that the Irish Ambassador in London has tried to impress on Irish people, and others who might decide to visit us, that it would be a patriotic thing to stay in England until the epidemic has died down.</P>
    <P>This Appropriation Bill involves a sum of £279 million, a colossal sum for a country with a population of fewer than three million people.  Under the inter-Party Government, when a generous housing campaign was undertaken involving a good deal of finance, and when the annual sum reached £100 million, I remember that Fianna Fáil said the last straw had been piled on, that the country could not afford £100 million.  Of course, under successive Fianna Fáil Governments in the meantime, the value of money has dropped dramatically, its purchasing power has dropped, and, therefore, the £279 million we are now discussing would not represent the same value as £100 million when the inter-Party were in office.</P>
    <P>We must remember that though we have reached that very high figure, the present incidence of taxation is 25 per cent higher than the figure which had been forecast for 1970 in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  In other words, two years ahead of time, our taxation is 25 per cent higher than was envisaged in the Second Programme.  I know that Programme has collapsed.  It did not achieve any of the targets set.  We hear members of Fianna Fáil boasting that this year our productivity will have risen by four per cent.  They regard this as a great achievement. We must remember it was only one per cent last year, and if we average it over the other years the targets have not been reached, particularly in relation to the provision of more jobs.</P>
    <P>Much of this is the result of the financial gymnastics in which the Fianna Fáil Party were engaging during the latter part of 1964 and the early part of 1965, all designed to win <Col N="457" /> the Cork and Kildare by-elections and later the general election.  Immediately following the elections, we had deflation which caused great difficulty and strain in our economy.  In 1966 it was necessary to introduce a second Budget in order to put our financial position right.  That was trickery on the part of Fianna Fáil because they must have known when the Budget was being introduced in the spring of 1966 what the requirements were for the financial year.  However, there was a Presidential election coming up, so they brought in half of the Budget before that election and the remainder after it.</P>
    <P>Anyway, it all amounts to tricking on the part of Fianna Fáil with the country's finances.  Now, as a result of the rectification of the economy, which it was necessary for Fianna Fáil to do, they are boasting that the economy is again on a level keel.  The result of it all is that it was the wage earner, the savings of our people, who had to pay for those financial gymnastics&mdash;not the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We have reached another serious situation in relation to the health services. The present high cost of these services is the talk of the country. When the Health Act was introduced by Senator Dr. Ryan, he was asked how much it would cost and he said 1/6 or 2/- in the £ on the rates.  Now every ratepayer knows the cost of the health services is the highest charge on the rate demand notes.  It exceeds even road maintenance charges.  At that time, people thought the cost of roads was very high and complained bitterly about it.  It was suggested roads should be made a national charge.</P>
    <P>Now we have a situation in which the health services are costing the ratepayers more than road maintenance. It was suggested a long time ago that the health services should be made a national charge. Apparently the Fianna Fáil Party are quite happy to leave this burden on the shoulders of the ratepayers and let the figure go up higher every year.  Next year in the Dublin area it is expected that the rates will go up at least 11/- in the £ in relation to the health services alone, apart from any other services which may cause the rate in the £ to be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> Then we have the promise of the White Paper from the Government in relation to the health services.  They are hesitating about that but the ratepayers are still being salted for the payment of those health charges when many of them cannot even benefit from the heavy subscription which they make towards the operation of those services. It is a well-known fact that there are many people who find it necessary to protect themselves by taking out what is known as a voluntary health insurance in relation to their own health. While they do so they are still paying heavily out of their pockets, their earnings and their wages towards the implementation of health services which are bringing no benefit to them. Those to whom those health services apply also have reason to complain about the shortcomings of those services and about the manner in which they are administered so far as many of them are concerned, particularly when they find that in order to get those free services they are compelled to make a contribution towards these services which they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>I feel it is time for the Government to make a pronouncement in relation to the White Paper regarding health services.  They cannot leave it tucked away forever while the ratepayers in the meantime are shouldering this burden. It is possible, for instance, that this White Paper advocated that the health services should be a national charge. It may have been recommended that the citizens should make a specific contribution towards the financing of the health services.  Whatever the Government White Paper has recommended it is about time for the Government, first of all, to publish it, and, secondly, to set about implementing it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have already published what they considered to be the most desirable type of financial arrangement for health services in this country.  Unfortunately, the Government are not so quick about acting on it as they were in relation to the educational policy, which was published by Fine Gael before the Government announced their policy in relation to education.  Of course, their policy was announced only in respect of primary and secondary <Col N="459" /> education.  Fine Gael announced their policy in relation to the whole of education.</P>

The situation is now that we have given the lead to the Government again in relation to university policy, in relation to education so far as university education is concerned.  They should take heed of the recommendations that have been put before them and implement them as soon as possible.  It is good if Fianna Fáil implements the Fine Gael policy, even in a piecemeal manner.</P>

      <P>We have given you the lead.  I hope the Government will now get down seriously to implementing the policy in relation to the universities of this country.  We have given them some good ideas now in the debate which took place last week and I have no doubt that the Government will consider it advisable.  I noticed in the speech by the Minister for Finance in the Budget in relation to this Bill we are discussing now that he referred to western development.  At least he had a heading in the Budget statement in relation to western development. Apparently he has now decided to barter the flesh and bodies of civil servants for votes in Castlebar and Athlone.  He does not care about up rooting those people and their families who sat for examinations, competed for jobs and got them.  They knew those jobs were in Dublin when they sat for the examination, entered those competitions and got those jobs.  They are in a bad position now so far as their wives, their families, their relations, schools and general living conditions are concerned but now for the sake of a few votes in the West of Ireland I have no doubt that the Government will be thumping platforms and dancing on them at the next general election about the fact that they tried to bring down a Civil Service Department, involving £8 million to be spent in Castlebar and they would not be let do it by the civil servants because they would not come down, or Fine Gael stopped them.</P>

    <P>Again, in Athlone, they will be dancing on the platforms and saying that they wanted to bring the civil servants down and that the wage bill would be £10 million but they would not be let do it.  They will be telling the people that if those salaries went into the <Col N="461" /> locality that great prosperity would be created there.  It is just one big swindle. They know it would be impossible to uproot those people and barter their lives for the sake of a few votes in those localities.  There are many other ways of creating prosperity in the West and establishing industries for the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We will publish our policy for industrialisation, if you are interested.  Of course, we have already done a very good job in relation to industries.  We found industry in a very poor state when we managed to put Fianna Fáil out of office in 1948 and again in 1954.  During those years we established the Industrial Development Authority.  Its purpose of course, was to investigate the possibility of establishing industries, creating extra employment in industry and bringing in foreign capital.</P>

The only thing they can think of now is the transfer of two <Col N="462" /> Departments, one to Athlone and one to Castlebar. They will tell the people down there: &ldquo;Now we have them down here to spend their earnings and to live among you and to establish their homes here&rdquo;. It is obviously only a wild dream as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned except, of course, it is a good vote-catching device at this stage when they have nothing better to offer the people in return for their votes and support.</P>

We can put these figures against the promise of 100,000 new jobs which we had from Deputy Lemass, there again trying to win a general election.  In the past year there has been a substantial rise in the cost of living and apparently <Col N="464" /> the cost of living will be increased further as a result of devaluation.  That is one thing for which I shall not blame Fianna Fáil&mdash;devaluation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I shall blame them for is the attitude of the Minister for Finance in relation to devaluation when he tried to put it off by telling the people that devaluation will only mean an increase of two per cent in the cost of living.  I do not know what the opinions of the other Senators there are but I think that was a ridiculous statement.  Everybody knows that the cost of living will be increased by more than two per cent.  My calculation is that it will be nearer to six per cent. The truth should be told to the people. The people know that the Minister for Finance is not responsible for devaluation except in so far as the capital of this country is invested outside it.</P>
      <P>Again, we have the effect of devaluation on building costs.  Building costs will go up.  They have gone up already by about ten per cent in the last two years and devaluation will cause them to go higher still.  Anybody associated with the building trade knows the problems facing people who wish to become owners of houses.  First of all, the house itself is very expensive mainly as a result of the land speculation in which the Minister's colleagues were very active, and the fact that all the available building land around the city has already been snatched up.  Of course, when houses are dear the deposit must be high.  Therefore, very high deposits are required from people now who wish to become owners of their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, it is nearly impossible to get loans even from building societies towards the cost of these houses.  The building societies are short of money and, of course, they have put up their interest charges to a record figure with the permission of the Government.  The interest charges now are very high which means that in over 12 years these unfortunate people pay the price of the house in interest alone <Col N="465" /> over the period of purchase.  Many of these houses are subject to a purchase period of 30 years.  In relation to house building grants which we have at the present time there were grants made out in 1948.  At that time the grant for the building of a private dwellinghouse was £45.  That was increased to £275. There are additional grants available now which have been brought in in the meantime to assist certain classes of people, but in general the grant for the house is around £275 and it is a very unrealistic figure having regard to the price of the house now in relation to the price of a similar house in 1948.</P>
    <P>The output of houses in 1965 fell by approximately 5 per cent.  The number of people engaged in the building trade has also fallen and there has been a fall in the number of county council houses built.  This housing campaign was to be organised and directed to some extent by a group known as The National Building Agency.  I am told it was a political set-up, and while it contained a number of technical people, that agency did not prove themselves fruitful so far as building is concerned.  Now I am told this National Building Agency is to be dismantled and discarded by the Government which set it up in a blaze of glory.</P>

      <P>Another thing which has affected our economy is that we had the lowest acreage of wheat for 25 years this year. It has dropped to an all-time low.

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the Senator for correcting me there.  With this heavy drop in tillage, and particularly the low acreage of wheat, it will be necessary for us to pay a much higher price now for imported wheat than we did before devaluation took place.  The taxpayers' money will have to be used because the Fianna Fáil Party abandoned the farmers and allowed the millers to beat them out of production because the millers would rather handle imported wheat than Irish-grown wheat.  In the meantime, of course, pig production collapsed and the factories are closing down owing to the drop in the number of pigs being left at the bacon factories.  There, again, the Fianna Fáil Party have abandoned the pig producers and have left them to the tender mercies of the factory-owners who have the final say in the grading of bacon which is the basis, of course, of payment for the pig producers.  The number of pigs going to the factories has dropped.  Perhaps Senator McGlinchey will explain why there is such a sharp fall in the number of pigs produced to the factories.  Why are the farmers not producing pigs now and why has the number dropped considerably since last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Budget speech also we heard the Minister boast about the abatement of rates on agricultural land being brought up to £20.  Many people in the cities and towns believed that the farmers had got a very big concession when they heard that the rates abatement was brought up to £20.  The Minister was very careful not to let the public know that, in fact, the farmers were already enjoying an abatement of rates up to £16 so that the Budget gave an increase only of £4 valuation in so far as abatement of rates is concerned <Col N="469" /> in addition, of course, to a further adjustment, which also had snags, up to £33 valuation.  In the <i>Just Society,</i> it was proposed by Fine Gael at that time that the figure should be £25 flat which, on figures, would work out better than the Fianna Fáil arrangement of £20 with a scale up to £33 valuation.</P>
    <P>There are many classes of people suffering because of the policy of Fianna Fáil in reducing the purchasing power of money.  There are many non-State pensioners on small pensions. Every time the Government implement a policy which further reduces the purchasing power of money, these non-State pensioners are left poorer and find it harder to make ends meet.  I should like to know if it will be possible, in these days of financial adjustment, to come to the rescue of many of those people whose pensions are now below the kinds of Social Welfare pensions that are available to the subsistence classes in this country. I refer to people who are depending on a very small weekly allowance in the form of one pension or another.</P>
    <P>When we consider what the cost of living is at the present time, and consider what prices are, it is very difficult to calculate how a person living alone can make ends meet on a pension maybe of less than 50/- a week.  It must be very difficult.  There should be some kind of arrangement to come to the rescue of these very poor classes of people who are dependent on what can now be described as only a pittance, having regard to the prices of essential goods.  I believe there are sick people who are getting only £2 7s 6d per week. I think Senators will agree that it must be almost impossible for those people to get any kind of proper living conditions on that kind of money.</P>
    <P>Now, we have the Redundancy Payments Bill and we have the Occupational Injuries Bill.  That legislation, of course, will further reduce the purchasing power of money and, at the same time, increase taxation.  In both of these schemes, employers are required to make a substantial contribution in the form of the cost of the Social Welfare stamp.  These stamps are now so <Col N="470" /> costly that they actually go into the framework of pricing goods especially where large staffs are concerned.  It is difficult to decide the best thing to do. Employers are being faced more than once a year. in recent years, with increases in the price of social welfare stamps.  I think that at the present time, the cost of a social welfare stamp for a typist is around 15/- a week and it is more for other classes of workers. This Redundancy Payments Bill will put a further cost on to the weekly social welfare stamp.</P>

      <P>Is the Senator talking about money values or money incomes?  The Government brought in a wholesale tax a couple of years ago the purpose of which was to adjust a financial situation into which the country had been led by the policy of the Government at that time.  The Minister for Finance now says he has got the finances of the country on an even keel again and I think it only right that he should consider removing the wholesale tax.  This is a very small community.  With all of these taxes amounting to nearly £300 million, it is difficult to understand how such a small population can continue the luxury of such a policy or activity on the part of the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to part of what Senator Rooney said and to most of what Senator O'Quigley said.  The first thing that struck me was how accustomed we all are now to these forecasts of gloom and doom, these whingings and groanings of Fine Gael on all occasions. It seems to have become their theme song, this banshee wail that everything the Government are doing is wrong.  On the other hand, they say Fine Gael have a policy to cure all the <Col N="472" /> evils and ills of the country.  Better still, they are able to do that without the necessity for new taxation.  Senator Rooney said the turnover tax is not needed, but at the same time he would give big increases in pensions and would push forward many new schemes.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that Fianna Fáil, who have been in Government during such long periods, must consider very seriously the expenditure necessary to implement the legislation they pilot through.  Not alone have they done this but down through the years they have maintained that policy.  It is not necessary for me now to range over the entire field of Fianna Fáil endeavour and success.  They have been successful in pushing forward numerous schemes for the benefit of the people as a whole and, the people of this country being sound, intelligent people, on every occasion practically during the past 30 years have returned Fianna Fáil to office.  They knew that in Fianna Fáil they had people who honoured their word, that they were responsible people who would do their best for the nation.</P>
    <P>Consequently, on only two occasions have Fine Gael, with the help of other elements with whom they coalesced, succeeded in getting to office by the back door.  We know the sad history of those two occasions.  It is something Fine Gael can read if they are searching for gloom and doom to read about. It is amazing that in every election since 1932, Fianna Fáil have got more votes than all the other Parties combined. These are the bold, bald, plain facts which the people over there must swallow whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>Always before elections, be they Presidential elections, by-elections or general elections, Fine Gael are always quick to forecast that they will sweep into office.  It takes the solid reasoning of the electorate to bring them back down to earth again.  In this House, too, they are wont to suggest that they are capable of bettering the lot of the people, but on the two occasions when they had the opportunity we know what happened.</P>
    <P>There are many matters on which one could speak but to my mind the <Col N="473" /> greatest development in the past few years has been the provision of free post-primary education for all our children.  That must go on top of the list as the greatest achievement in the past century.  It is a striking tribute not only to the Government but to the Minister responsible, Deputy O'Malley. He has made it possible not only to give free higher education to the children, rich and poor, but to provide transport for them, to supply teachers and classrooms.  On all sides we were besieged with the usual banshee wail that it was not possible.  In counties such as mine, where there were so few facilities for post-primary education, so few secondary schools, the fact that the Government were able and willing, first of all, to equate secondary and vocational education so that children in either could get the Leaving Certificate, this will confer massive benefits.  Not only will it be a great asset to the children who will benefit now but it will be a great relief to the parents who will not any longer have to budget to send a privileged member of the family to a secondary school, leaving the others without any chance of post-primary education.  I have no doubt the Government will push it up to the top, so that the poor man's child in any remote area can get university education if he so desires.  That is certainly something we could boast about if we were inclined to boast.</P>
    <P>On the question of health, I listened to Senator O'Quigley say that little was being done for the people who were ill, for the old and so forth.  He forgot that it was the Fianna Fáil Government who brought the Health Act into operation despite difficulties.  They were responsible for ensuring that those people in our society who were not able to pay their hospital bills out of their own resources would not be left to die or to suffer for lack of proper medical attention.  Sensibly, we realised because of the cost, that those in the middle income group who could pay a little should contribute a reasonable amount, and that the ten per cent in the top bracket would not have free health services&mdash;that they would have to pay their own bills or insure against ill health.  That is the fundamental principle <Col N="474" /> behind the health services&mdash;that those who could not afford to pay would not go without attention.</P>
    <P>The school medical service is also most important.  If the Minister has not already considered it, I ask him now to ensure that children enrolled in national schools up to the age of 14 years who are not present on the day of examinations be allowed to avail of the service later.  Until now, it was the children who underwent the school examination who benefited.  There could be children absent because of illness or so forth.</P>
    <P>As far as the social services are concerned, I do not think anybody from the opposite side could even attempt to equal the record of Fianna Fáil.  Practically all Acts piloted through the Dáil dealing with widows' pensions, children's allowances, wet time, <i>et cetera,</i> all for the benefit of the workers, have been introduced by Fianna Fáil. Not alone that, but in each succeeding year they have been responsible for giving increases in benefits to the extent that our resources allowed.</P>
    <P>Now, I could give the House individual figures but I am not going to bore the House with them.  It is significant, however, that in 1967 the old age pension was 24/- and now it is 57s 6d.  That is the contributory pension. The non-contributory pension was then introduced.  The widows' the old age and all those other pensions are designed to help people in need.  I would like, in passing, to refer to something which was said regarding the old age pensions, that we should give them to everybody.  I always think of the reply which the Minister for Social Welfare gave some time ago in the Dáil when he was asked a similar question&mdash;he said that if he could get, say, an extra £7, £8 or £9 million to do so he would have no hesitation at all in using that money to increase the pensions and the social welfare allowances for those who are already in receipt of them and that he would pay an old age pension to everybody.  That was logical and it clearly showed the concern of this Government for the underpriviledged.</P>
    <P>I am not going to wander into the field of agriculture, although I heard <Col N="475" /> Senator Rooney mention it.  Indeed, Senator O'Quigley did likewise and threatened us rather alarmingly regarding the NFA <i>et cetera.</i> He accused the Minister of not co-operating with the farmers. He forgot the fact that the farmers' friend on all occasions&mdash;I would say this irrespective of what Government was in Office&mdash;is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries because he has to sit around the table at a Government meeting and push hard to get more money from the Minister for Finance for the farming community as a whole.  When it is said that he has not the interests of the farmers at heart, it is not correct.  Indeed, we know that most of it is nothing but a bit of political wrangling.  That was illustrated very forcibly at the recent meeting of the General Council of Agriculture.  Deputy Clinton proved that they had the whole Council hogged and decided, in their own way, not democratically, to ask the two members nominated from it to withdraw.</P>
    <P>That clearly shows that there is something more than a dispute behind this and that Fine Gael have done their best to try to cash in on a situation like this.  I do not believe that they were the slightest bit worried about the farmers.  They were hoping to embarrass Fianna Fáil and the Minister.  This play-acting is going on all the time when we should all be thinking seriously in regard to agriculture and falling squarely behind the Minister and his policy on agriculture in order to ensure that we will increase our output and improve our farming techniques so that eventually we will be able to compete and outstep many other people who are engaged in the field of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that thanks to the Bovine TB Scheme, successfully piloted through by Deputy Paddy Smith from County Cavan, we in this country have now our cattle free from disease.  Indeed, we are the most free country perhaps in Europe, or probably in the world.  Our reputation as a country for having its cattle population free from disease is very widespread and it is one of the things which will be of tremendous advantage to us in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> Senator O'Quigley mentioned something regarding Partition.  I do not know why he did that.  He also mentioned something regarding Ministers making announcements here and there forgetting, of course, that some of the important announcements which the Coalition Government made were made in this way.  It will be remembered that when they declared this Republic of ours it was in Canada.  I do not think that this cant about Ministers motoring around the country like small boys in big cars should be heeded.  It is not any great treat for any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to motor around the country and put up this mileage of 50,000 to 60,000.  All of us drive cars and we should be the first to admit that it is not a great comfort for a Minister to four from one end to the other of a county.  I wonder if they expect Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to lock themselves away in some room, put their feet up and sit down by the fire.  I am quite sure that all those Ministers who go around doing this are showing the interest they have in the welfare of the community and the people.</P>
    <P>Those Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have been asked by various organisations up and down this country to go down there and address their meetings or whatever it is.  I have seen Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers down in my own county and I can say they acquitted themselves very well and it was a great help to the attendance and the people as a whole were very glad to see them.  I admit there was one occasion when a Minister came there and certain people threw sods at him.  It reminds me of the snowballing which goes on in Belfast.  People who take part in antics like that are not taken much heed of. If some people feel like going around making fools of themselves like that they are quite entitled to do that.  If the <i>Sunday Independent</i> feels like making a front page article in regard to the number of miles covered by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries they are quite entitled to do so. I feel I could equally ask the directors and the editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> when they go out and <Col N="477" /> go around from place to place in cars who pays for them?</P>
    <P>It is time for Fine Gael to stop that type of carry on.  The plain fact of the matter is that we are making progress. We have a definite, defined programme. We are not ashamed to say that we have to change it, if the times are changing, but at least the people have a fair idea of the fundamental policy of Fianna Fáil.  We have put it before the electorate as recently as a few months ago and also over a year ago when conditions, so far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, were not so good.  I will freely admit that anybody, even Fianna Fáil supporters, could say to themselves that things were not as good the year before last.  We had the 15 per cent tariff on, so far as England was concerned, when they were in difficulties themselves.</P>
    <P>Despite all this we went out and faced two by-elections.  We went before the people and told them the bald facts.  We told them all those different things at that time.  I remember a chapel meeting which I attended and some of the queries which were put. They did not know at that meeting that I knew that cattle were being taken from the Enniskillen mart and brought up to Dublin during that period.  This is something that happened at that time.  Fine Gael never got a better opportunity than they did on that occasion of making some attempt to be responsible and of attempting to get elected.  I would say despite all the gimmicks they could pull out of the hat, and all the various policies they could spew out from the offices, <i>et cetera,</i> they had not a hope and they were beaten on that occasion.  Again, of course, in the last two by-elections the same thing happened.  Last year we had the county council elections and Fianna Fáil again came out victorious.  There is not a doubt about that.  I will admit we did not get chairmanships in various counties but that can happen.  Indeed, there were many councils where Fine Gael were able to combine so well that they were able to take all the representation on the general council of agriculture, so much so that when that body met <Col N="478" /> recently in Dublin one could truthfully say that it was not a democratic body at all.</P>

In fairness, it is not true to say that whether you like it or not at least we have been getting almost 50 per cent of the votes in this country down through the years?  Surely to goodness we should not expect that all councils would behave as they did recently in Limerick when Fine Gael took home one of their members to ensure that the seat would go to one of them when a Fianna Fáil man died.</P>

      <P>Surely that should have gone to Fianna Fáil.  In county Cavan &mdash;and politics in Cavan are just as rough and tough as anywhere else&mdash;we at least try to have a sense of fair play and if on our county council one of our members dies as happened not very long ago when a Fine Gael member died, we immediately agreed that certainly that seat should go to Fine Gael, but you have people who think they can oust us out just because they can combine now and again.  I do not think that is a proper way to approach these things.  At any rate, that is the Fine Gael way and I cannot do anything about it.  I would say that we are not the slightest bit afraid to meet fair criticism.  We welcome it, as a matter of fact.  We cannot expect you people to sit there all day and say nothing.  If we get reasonable criticism it is welcome but when you get this type of gimmick, this type of showmanship just for the sake of trying to hit the headlines by making false promises, etc. what they are doing is just trying to foment certain dissensions and trying to make people discontented. I think it is time for them to come down from their high horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley dragged in the question of the Irish languages.  I feel the question of the Irish language should be far above politics.  I will be <Col N="479" /> the first to admit that there are many people on the Fine Gael side of the House who have been deeply concerned with the Irish language.  I will admit that there are people in Fianna Fáil who might be a little bit worried about it, but we must admit that we will not succeed very far in this if we make a political issue out of it.  Indeed, Fine Gael should know that because it is not terribly long since, during an election campaign, Deputy Dillon who, mind you, is a good Irish speaker, threw in this red herring of the Irish language.  It did not succeed and it will not succeed any more now than it did then.  I feel we should all come together and try to form a common platform as far as the Irish language is concerned and stop all this hash about people failing examinations because they fail in Irish.  I can truthfully say that people fail examinations even at Leaving Certificate level because if right was right I do not believe they should have sat for the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>They just got a secondary education because their people had money and they were pushed through but the truth of the matter is that they probably failed in English, maths, history and geography and probably every other subject.  The number of people who fail in the Leaving Certificate because they fail in Irish is so small that I do not see why the facts are being so distorted so as to try to poison people against their own native tongue.  After all, the Welsh language has been taught in all the schools in Britain.  Surely to God if that is happening in Britain the people here should not be moaning because the children of our nation are being given facilities to learn the Irish language. Surely at any rate they should not be discouraged from doing it.  I feel it is the duty of parents to encourage their children and not to mind all this talk we hear about difficulties <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>I would, however, join hands with Senator O'Quigley in complimenting Radio Éireann and I would add Telefís Éireann, on the progress they are now making.  The Buntús Cainte is a <Col N="480" /> tremendous step forward.  I would hope that our national newspapers of all kinds would follow suit and that they would have a little more Irish if at all possible.  There is no doubt that, if we look at the facts as they are, we can easily say to ourselves that if the majority of us were as fluent in French, German or some Continental language as we are in Irish, we might be very proud of the fact.  For some reason or other many people do not seem to think it any asset that they are fluent in the Irish language.  I think it is a great asset for anybody.  People who have been at school in this country, and some of them have gone to secondary schools, should be ashamed to admit that they are not able to carry on a conversation in Irish.  I would encourage them by saying that nobody expects perfection, they are entitled to use bad Irish.  That would be much better than using none.  However, I do not want to cause any dissension over this or any animosity because I was myself at one time a member of Connradh na Gaeilge here in this House and I know that there were Deputies on all sides who were interested in it.  That is how I would like it to be.  I shall not say any more except that I agree with this Bill. Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The facet of the collapse of the Second Programme that has had the worst impact on the country is the position in relation to employment.  We know the difficulty that there was for some years in comparing the employment position due to the method that was employed in its compilation.  Now we have the example of the last few years, which readily and frequently brings home to all members of the Oireachtas by way of the frequent reports issued from the Department, that on an average the employment position is some 9,000 to 10,000 worse than it was 12 months ago.  This despite the fact that we have considerable sums invested in an attempt to provide our people with the level of employment that was envisaged in the programme which has now failed.  The figures that are provided relevant to the cost of employing labourers in various industries have risen alarmingly and, while we welcome <Col N="481" /> investment at all times in industry when its aim and object is the giving of employment, we are concerned with the fact that better results have not been forthcoming from such investment. We have the added interest by our people in improved education of our young people.  This is a very healthy thing but it is also a matter of grave concern to very many people as to what the future will be for those young people when they leave school because so far we have failed to absorb our school-leavers and many of them are compelled to take up employment outside the shores of this island.</P>
      <P>I wish to be specific in the remarks I have to make relevant to the measures we are discussing and which gives us entitlement to roam over all Departments of State.  In order to add emphasis to the remarks I have to pass I will confine my remarks to a limited number of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of industry and of employment, I am particularly concerned at the position in one episode that I want to recount.  That is in relation to the position of the town of Bandon where I reside.  In 1965 in the course of a general election, the then Taoiseach Deputy Lemass and the present Taoiseach Deputy Lynch came to Bandon in the course of the campaign.  With my own ears I heard Deputy Lemass, then Taoiseach, assure the people of Bandon that two industries had been secured for the town. I was concerned in both as a member of the local development association and it was with considerable elation that the local residents heard these good tidings and no doubt it was reflected in the electoral support the Government got, in consequence of this announcement.  At that stage £20,000 had been collected by the local development association for one of those industries.  A site had been procured and a very attractive sign erected on the site indicative the future of the particular project.  Premises were leased in the town or in the county at least and the name of the second concern was painted on the front wall. The people were willing to believe in this public pronouncement which was made by the head of the Government, <Col N="482" /> speaking in his capacity as leader of a political Party seeking re-election.</P>
    <P>At that time all the posters on the walls carried the message: let Lemass lead on.  He did not lead long.  He retired from his position as Taoiseach after the election of his Government. None of these industries has come to Bandon.  This is a matter that annoyed local investors when they were informed that the industry was abandoned, and it took a considerable time before their money was refunded to them.  I am concerned because any worthwhile project that may come about in future will not get support from these people.  In view of their cynical approach to Ministerial promises it will be exceedingly difficult to get these people to re-invest in any future project.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the saga. Following on the Taoiseach's departure from head of the Government he took up numerous directorships, among them United Breweries and he became chairman of that concern.  We were promised two factories.  We had one great source of employment, United Breweries, of which Deputy Lemass became chairman, and overnight he closed that factory and displaced 140 men from employment.  The man, and his successor as Taoiseach, who months before had promised the town two additional factories, closed down the only factory that was giving employment in the community.  This has left a bad taste in the local community relative to public pronouncements and his action in closing down that concern is one that will be long remembered.</P>

      <P>He was doing the job for the salary he was getting, but he acted in complete contradiction to what he said when he promised two factories to the town in my own hearing.</P>
      <P>In the past year the Redundancy Payments Bill became law.  Too much time elapsed in the interim between the announcement of the intention to enact this legislation and its ultimate passage for the pursuance of justice and fair play.  In the length of time that passed between the announcement of the legislation and its enactment, it was unfortunate that again in Bandon some workers were laid off in an effort to relieve employers who might have to compensate them properly for their unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other aspects to which I should like to refer in various Departments. One is the need for greater investment in drainage.  There is a need for greater investment in arterial drainage with consequential drainage of tributaries.  Much field drainage has had to be deferred pending these schemes. We have had the abandonment of the scheme of the local authorities' works which to my mind was a retrograde step.  Much good work was done under the aegis of the local authorities in implementing drainage under that scheme.  There was no money forthcoming despite constant clamour on the part of all political Parties for the revival of works under this scheme.  I feel it is one that would come readily to the rescue in relation to the position regarding rural employment.  Practically every penny voted under the local authorities' works schemes was spent in paying men to work on these schemes.  That brought land that was incapable of active production of any kind into fertility, and there is no doubt that there is a good case to be <Col N="484" /> made for the resumption of these works.</P>
    <P>The question of drainage is important because much of the productive land of the country&mdash;land that would otherwise be productive&mdash;is unproductive at the moment because farmers cannot get the value from it due to recurrent flooding.  Any member of a local authority is fully aware of the fact that there have been deputations to local authorities asking the county councils to intervene in the question of drainage in order to make their land more productive and relieve them from these hazards as well as the consequential disasters that follow from the prevalence of fluke from wet land.</P>
    <P>The local authority had to resist the very cogent cases made in many instances because they felt they should not ask to have money levied on the rates for the relief of what is an occasional charge.  Furthermore, the cases put forward have been substantial inasmuch as these people are paying rates for land which they cannot properly work and I would certainly make an earnest appeal to the Minister to allocate some money for the arterial drainage scheme so as to ensure that the tributaries will be done and ultimately that the land drainage work will be undertaken in many farms where it cannot be carried on at present due to the fact that there is not an adequate out-fall.</P>
    <P>One of the most reprehensible actions in the last year was reducing the amount of money for road upkeep and improvement.  On one occasion a sum was deducted for a period of one year but it was conceded at the time that it was in exceptional circumstances and would not operate for a period of more than 12 months.  In the course of the last year it has been announced that this is the formation of a pattern for the years to come.  The consequences are that at this time of the year, facing Christmas, local authorities are under pressure to vote ratepayers' money to ensure that roadmen will retain their employment long before the expiration of the financial year.  It is regrettable that such a problem <Col N="485" /> should arise among road workers in many county councils.  There has been a cut in the road grants and it is unfair to ask the ratepayers, at least by expression of the Government, to pay.  The position is grievous in relation to the charge on the rates and something should be done within a short time to enact legislation which will give relief to the ratepayers <i>vis-á-vis</i> the charges that are inflicted on them.</P>
    <P>Consequently, though members of local authorities are cognisant of the position of the ratepayer, they are merely repeating what was expressed in Ministerial pronouncements but which has not been supported by any concrete action, to come to the relief of the ratepayers.  Before I conclude, I shall indicate where, far from coming to their relief, the practice has grown of transferring to the backs of the ratepayers charges that, up to recently, were borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that the Government are really sincere in their protestations of sympathy for and understanding of the lot of the ratepayer. It is in these circumstances that many councils have had to resist demands made on them with the laudable purpose of maintaining employment because of the slashing of the road grants.  It is just too bad if, at this time of year, workmen have to be laid off their work, which is vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>We hear much about road safety &mdash;all of which is very sensible and all of which is very desirable&mdash;but in Cork County Council we had adopted a staged plan in road development and road improvement. We had reached the point that in a major part of the county, we had completed the tarring programme of almost all the roads under the care of the local authority and we were next intent on proceeding with the removal of dangerous junctions and bad bends on county roads with the object of making the roads safer for the road users and giving to the people paying the road tax to an increasing extent some return for their investment in road taxation.  That has had to be completely <Col N="486" /> abandoned due to the cut in the road grants.</P>
    <P>We cannot now implement a policy that was intended to meet the situation relative to road safety as well as to give very lucrative employment.  I may remark, in that respect, that it is extraordinary that the road grants should be cut in a year in which record sums were paid into the Road Fund by way of an increasing usage of motor vehicles on Irish roads.  The Irish users are paying in motor and general taxation on petrol the highest motor charges in Europe and they are entitled to a return in the preservation of the condition of the roads and the improvement of them to carry modern traffic. As well as that, whole areas of the country have been relieved of the facility of rail transport and the goods and passengers that were formerly carried on rail have been diverted to the roads.  Despite the capital grants that were made&mdash;not justly made as between areas but made&mdash;there was no continuing grant for the maintenance of roads consequent on the increased traffic they had to bear following the closure of railway lines.  All of this had its impact on the position of road upkeep and road maintenance.  This was the most reprehensible action of the Government in the past year and it is having a dire effect at present on the employment of road workers throughout rural parts.</P>
    <P>There was gross miscalculation of cost of Health Act charges with their impact on rates.  Despite the close examination of current estimates, any variation of the vastly increased estimates presented no reduction which could be effected.  The increases were created by inflationary tendencies in recent years.  Increases in salaries to combat cost of living increases could not be reduced.  Neither could the cost of items such as drugs and medicines which had increased in price.  We are glad to note that the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme is growing from strength to strength and that it is now possible to extend the scope of benefits. The scheme is recognised by this Government as a successful innovation by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins when he was Minister for Health.  It is an <Col N="487" /> example of what can be done by extending the principle of insurance to many other fields of health activities.</P>
    <P>With regard to State assistance to local authorities, a position has arisen in the past few months relative to the overall national scheme for water supplies. A few years ago, a grandiose scheme of providing piped water supplies throughout the country was announced by the then Minister for Local Government.  I think Deputy Blaney.  Co-operation was readily forthcoming from the local authorities and their staffs in preparing for the implementation of these schemes.  Money, time and effort were involved in diverting engineering staff to the preparation of these schemes.  Policy was adjusted to co-ordinate plans in line with the national schemes and several hundreds of pump-sinking proposals were deferred.</P>
    <P>People requiring new and more satisfactory water supplies believed that the Government's scheme would early be brought to fruition.  Recently, the bombshell was dropped, by way of circular from the Minister for Local Government, that, due to financial stringency, the original plans were to be abandoned and savings effected by confining work to the provision of spinal or arterial supplies.  This is most unjust on the cottiers whose pump-sinking proposals were abandoned on the assurance of securing a piped supply. It is now advised that group schemes should be availed of to extend water supplies from the main system.</P>
    <P>Examination of the comparative expense involved indicates that the overall saving would not warrant the grievous disruption of planning and execution in providing much-needed water supply services.  We have had this examination by Cork County Council.  We find that all the plans that were ready for implementation pending the availability of State finances which, we were told, were forthcoming have now to be abandoned.  We were advised to switch to the alternative of the group supply scheme.  Having made an estimate of the cost involved in paying a subsidy on the group scheme, we find there is a saving but that it is not substantial. <Col N="488" /> We are entitled to say that the game is not worth the candle.  No doubt, those who looked at it thought a substantial saving could be effected.</P>
    <P>We are surprised, in view of the fact that Ministerial statements frequently contend that money is available for schemes such as water supplies, to have the clear indication that the financial position of the country does not permit the scale of operation in the water supply scheme that was first envisaged. Here we have an example of a complete lack of planning over a period on the part of the Government.  We have the situation where many groups of cottages were left for the past four or five years without pump-sinking operations because we were led to believe that the piped water supply would cater for these people.  It was on that basis that these schemes were abandoned. Now, our engineers have had to revert to the old practice of pump-sinking, realising that they can see no hope of the piped water supply being provided within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>With these remarks, I feel we have plenty of cause to criticise the Government for some of their actions over the past 12 months.  I shall conclude by referring to two further matters. The first is that we advised the Minister for Transport and Power to use his good offices with the ESB to encourage them, if needs be, to engage more staff to implement post-development in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We find there is an increased recognition that electricity supply services are not adequate to meet today's demands.  We have increasing usage of electrical machinery on the farm.  There are circumstances in which the current provided at the initiation of the rural electrification scheme is so completely inadequate for the load it is required to supply to maintain the various instruments now operated electrically. Many farmers are frustrated in their efforts to increase production, to provide facilities to carry more cattle, particularly milch cattle, and they are constantly waiting for the ESB to give them the amount of current necessary to operate their equipment satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> Therefore, I appeal to the Minister for Transport and Power to influence the ESB to clear the extensive backlog that exists in this sector and so give those people the green light to go ahead with the installation of the additional equipment they require.  At present they have to operate at certain hours of the day.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to refer to is a small one but it is indicative of the way the Government are administering many schemes.  We had tributes paid to the Minister for Education by a Senator a few moments ago, but many of his statements are in the nature of very fine promises, very attractive proposals which have not been followed up with the administrative arrangements or the finances necessary to implement them.  A statement was made regarding the subsidising of school books.  This was welcomed by everybody concerned with the impact nowadays, with increased prices, on parents in the provision of school material for their children.</P>
    <P>The fact is that when the scheme was presented to vocational committees there was imposed a very strict limitation on the amount of money allocated to each county.  The headmasters of the various vocational schools have been at their wits' end to try to implement a just scheme.  The categories were outlined&mdash;people who are holders of medical cards, people in circumstances that warranted the issue of free schools books&mdash;but the general result is that only one in four of those who qualified under the terms of the circular has enough finances allocated to meet the situation.  It is no wonder, therefore, that so many of the vocational committees throughout the country have supported their headmasters in their protests at the inadequacy of the funds available to them in the invidious task imposed on them within the extreme financial limits imposed.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points I wished to raise while availing of this occasion to discuss the financial policy. I am sure many other Senators wish to put forward their views on this, the only opportunity we get of discussing <Col N="490" /> the general financial obligations of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill annually gives Senators a chance to discuss two main topics.  First of all, it gives them a chance to have a general debate on Government policy and as well gives Senators an opportunity, which they do not otherwise get, of dealing with some individual aspects of administration and matters arising out of the Estimates.  Because we do not get the Departmental Estimates as they do in the Dáil, this is the only opportunity we get during the year to deal with detailed matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>Before I get on to those matters of general policy, which have been mainly discussed today, I should like to say a few words about one aspect of Government administration, that is the very small amount, the too small amount, devoted to what one might describe as cultural activities.  We have, or would like to think we have, a traditional interest in learning and the arts.  We like to think that Ireland is, as in the past, a land if not of saints at least of scholars, but I am afraid the truth is that we have, at least in recent centuries, a long tradition of skimping.</P>
      <P>I was reading recently some of the essays of Thomas Davis which he wrote 130 years ago.  He dealt with all the different aspects of the social, economic and cultural life of the country, pointing out the things that were needed and expressing the hope that when Ireland gained her independence everything would be different. One of his complaints was about what he described as the neglect of institutions for the promotion of literature, science and art, and the stingy grants of the Government.  I am afraid that if Davis came back to Ireland today he would not find things changed so very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some slight signs in the last year or so that matters are improving.  In this year's Estimates we had the very welcome news that the Minister for Finance had raised the grants to the Arts Council by 50 per cent.  It sounds a fine increase, but 50 per cent of what was originally a small sum is not as good as one might hope <Col N="491" /> for, though raising the sum of £60,000 was not bad even if it does leave the Arts Council with a ludicrously small subsistence by comparison not with Britain but in Northern Ireland and in almost any other country one could name.</P>
    <P>We have next door to us the new extension, almost finished, to the National Gallery, another very welcome step.  We have a fine new Abbey Theatre, though I wonder if I am being too cynical when I suggest that if the old theatre had not been burned down it is doubtful if we would have a new one.  We have activity where formerly there was inactivity and perhaps one may therefore hope that in certain other fields something may be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak of the National Library.  The most obvious point about it is that a new building, or at any rate a very big extension of the existing building, is not merely an urgent matter but has been urgent during the past 20 or perhaps 30 years. Anyone who goes in has only got to step into the hall to see the eight-foot high pile of boxes.  The building is fantastically overcrowded, not merely the building itself&mdash;the places where the books have to be kept&mdash;but the reading room.  Anybody who goes there in the afternoon to try to get a table will find it extremely difficult to do so because of overcrowding.  It is essential that something practical should be done quickly to deal with this question of lack of space in the National Library.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not merely in this respect that the National Library has been neglected by all Governments for years.  The grant for buying books is ridiculously small.  For many years the annual grant given to the National Library for buying books and periodicals was £5,000 a year.  About five years ago this was increased to the munificent sum of £8,000 a year. About one-third of that sum goes in buying journals which leaves about £5,000 for buying books.  When you consider that in Great Britain about 40,000 books are published every year, many of them of very great interest <Col N="492" /> to the National Library, to say nothing of the many thousands more brought out in America, you will see that that sum of money is totally inadequate. You will also see that the National Library cannot purchase any books published on the continent of Europe with the sort of grant which is given to them.  They simply cannot keep up with the output of books.</P>
    <P>The National Library have a fine collection, not by any means a perfect collection, of books relating to Ireland. Of course they are entitled under the copyright law to a copy of every book relating to Ireland but in regard to the books outside Ireland they are not able year after year, to keep up with those. They are well behind in regard to this. It is also obvious the National Library is grossly understaffed.  They have nothing like the number of people which any normal library would require to carry out this business.  I do not know how this situation has continued for so many years without any great pressure to do anything about it.  I suspect that one thing which is at fault is the system of administration.</P>
    <P>So far as I can understand it is nominally in the hands of trustees, of which nine are appointed by the Royal Dublin Society and three by the Department of Education.  This is inherited from an earlier period when the origins of the National Library were in the library of the Royal Dublin Society.  Those trustees issue an annual report. I have a copy of it here and it is a very small document.  It is the same from year to year with the dates changed.  Something should be done by the Government to change this system of administration of the National Library so that a new look can be brought about, a completely new approach, so that there is some chance of improving the present situation.  The present situation is very bad and has been so for 20 years and to my mind it has been allowed to remain for so long because the trustees, the people responsible, have not been doing their job.</P>
    <P>There is another point regarding this&mdash;I know one could go on for a very long time dealing with the general <Col N="493" /> neglect of the arts and culture in this country&mdash;but there is one basic point I want to raise under this head. It is the perennial one of the concert hall.  I would urge the Minister to press ahead with his concert hall as rapidly as possible.  I would stress the point that the concert hall is not a luxury.  There are some people who seem to think that the concert hall is a sort of unnecessary luxury for the greater edification of the people living in Foxrock.  A concert hall, to my mind, is a basic essential.  At the present time there is no hall at all in Dublin that is even remotely satisfactory for the hearing of orchestral music.  We have a symphony orchestra in Ireland but there is no way of hearing it at all satisfactorily in Dublin.  Its public concerts are given in a totally inadequate building.  For example, next week there will be a performance of Handel's <i>Messiah</i> in a boxing stadium, which apparently is the only place in Dublin which can provide space for a large enough audience. When you are reduced to having the performance of oratorio in a boxing stadium the need for a concert hall can be regarded as a basic essential. If one goes to the continent of Europe it is not merely that even the smallest countries possess a concert hall but that in any sizeable town you will find that sometimes there is more than one concert hall.</P>
    <P>It is a fantastic situation in this country, 40 years after we gained our independence, that we still have not got a hall in Dublin which is even tolerably suitable for the performance of music.  I would appeal to the Minister to press ahead as quickly as possible with the building of this hall and not pay attention to the people who say that it is ridiculous to be building a concert hall when there are still houses and swimming pools to be built.  Fifty years from now there still will not come a time when there will be so many of those things that no more are needed.  It is no use hoping that if you wait five or ten years that there will be enough houses or enough swimming pools and that that will be the time to build a concert hall.  I would say that <Col N="494" /> we must, of course, build those houses and those swimming pools, but we should also press ahead with a concert hall.  The attitude of the people who say that we should build swimming pools instead of concert halls reminds me of the sort of attitude which was taken many years ago by the Chicago meat packer who proclaimed that a ton of cement in the right place was worth more than all the works of Shakespeare.</P>
    <P>There is room for houses, swimming pools and concert halls.  Of course, I am looking at this not merely from the musical sense but also, as has been pointed out, that this particular hall, which it is proposed to build, will also have a practical value to it, that is, that it will be used also as an assembly hall.  It will not be merely used for the performance of music but it will also be used for the holding of conferences, which is an increasingly valuable part of our general tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Now, getting on to the more general questions of Government policy, we have had today a good deal of somewhat unnecessary olagóning from Senators on the Opposition benches. We had Senator O'Quigley and others asking plaintively what went wrong with the economy since the last general election.  Of course, this kind of question, to my mind, is, although they may not realise it, highly complimentary to the efficiency of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The difficulty is that the experience we have had in the last ten years or so under the Fianna Fáil Government has made the public and Opposition Senators used to the proposition that there will be every year some economic growth.</P>
    <P>They have got used to the idea that normally speaking the Irish economy under Fianna Fáil will expand at the rate of perhaps four per cent or so each year so when we fall below this normal Fianna Fáil target Fine Gael Senators stand up and say: &ldquo;This is, terrible, the country is in a bad state.&rdquo; Looking now at the period since the last General Election, in the last three years the total growth of our economy has been in the region of between seven and eight per cent.  That is not <Col N="495" /> up to the normal Fianna Fáil standard but it is a great deal better than the total growth of perhaps one per cent&mdash; not one per cent per annum but about one per cent nett&mdash;during the whole period of the Coalition Government.  In other words even in the past three years when there has been some slowing down in our economy we have been going ahead at perhaps seven or eight times the normal growth rate under the Coalition Government.  It is a reflection of the extraordinary change that has come about in recent years in the Irish economy.  It is altogether unrealistic to expect that any country will be able to go ahead every year by exactly the same amount with no setbacks ever talking place.  It would be totally unrealistic in any country to expect that, particularly so in Ireland which is so much of an open economy, so much inclined to be influenced by what is taking place in countries abroad.</P>
    <P>We had in Ireland in the past two or three years a variety of adverse influences from abroad.  One of these which has continued to the present day is the extraordinary depression in our main market.  Our reliance on exports to Britain has, of course, somewhat decreased in recent years.  There was a time when we exported about 85 per cent of all our exports to Britain.  That has come down now to somewhat around 70 per cent.  However we still rely very heavily on the British Market for our exports and therefore for our whole economic development. For the past four years or so there has been a constant depression on the British Market which has of course meant that they are not able to expand their imports of our produce as they would have been if they were engaged in a period of economic growth.  This has had a depressing effect all along the line on our exports and continues to the present day.</P>
    <P>Apart from that we had the situation in England immediately after the last British General Election where the Labour Government imposed a 15 per cent import surcharge which meant straightaway that all our industrial exports to Britain had to go through <Col N="496" /> this 15 per cent barrier which was later reduced to ten per cent.  That, of course, had a very serious effect on our exports and no Government, neither Fianna Fáil nor any other Government could possibly have either foreseen that or if they had foreseen it done anything to prevent it.  It was a matter entirely outside our control.</P>
    <P>Then we had the serious slump in cattle prices last year.  I do not think anybody even in Fine Gael has ever seriously suggested that we in this country could control the prices for our exports of meat or livestock.  The price in export markets is a matter quite outside our control.  There was a very serious slump in prices largely as a result of the EEC ban on meat exports.  We had also for a period the difficulty caused by restrictions by various countries particularly the US. on exports of cattle.  These were all external factors outside our control which inevitably affected our economic growth by affecting our exports.  We have had in the past couple of years, that is in 1965 and particularly in 1966, a slowing down in our economic growth as a result of these factors. We had a period of credit restriction in order to deal with our increasing adverse balance of payments but as I have mentioned even over this period our rate of growth by previous standards, before the Fianna Fáil expansion programmes got under way, even in those years our rate of progress would in previous years have been looked at as fairly satisfactory, as being well above the average for many years earlier.  However, as a result of the steps taken by the Government this year progress has not merely begun again but all the signs are that our growth this year will be in the region of four per cent or perhaps even little more, well up to the target set in the Second Programme which we have been told so often has collapsed.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable aspects of the recovery which we have made this year is that it has taken place at a time when the whole of Europe and even countries outside Europe are suffering from what can only be described as a fairly severe depression Owing to the fact that we are such an <Col N="497" /> open economy, we have to rely completely on a growth in exports in order to develop our economy because the home market is so small and limited. Because of these factors we are normally speaking very much influenced by external factors.  If other countries are depressed, normally speaking we would expect to be depressed also. The most remarkable aspect of our progress this year has been that it has taken place in the face of this depression in the economies of pretty well every other country.  Our growth of four per cent this year in national income compares with an expected growth this year in OECD countries in Europe as a whole of only two per cent.  Germany, for example, expects a growth in national income this year of ½ per cent.  France is doing rather better but not quite as well as us, they expect 3½ per cent.  The UK as usual staggered along with an expected rise of one per cent in national income and other OECD countries by about three per cent.  However, OECD in Europe as a whole only expects a growth rate of two per cent this year whereas we <Col N="498" /> expects one of at least four per cent. This is a remarkable state of affairs for us in view of the fact that our main market in Britain is one of the most depressed in Europe.  Our exports this year have shown a quite extraordinary rise so far of about 20 per cent in the 12 months up to the end of October last.  Our exports are up by about £45 million.  That is an immense increase over a short period and it comes at a time when all over Europe the growth of exports has been very small.  Here again OECD exports as a whole will be up by about eight per cent this year, a very much smaller figure than ours.  We have France at 6½ per cent, Germany 10½ per cent, Italy eight per cent, UK seven per cent, all this far below our rate of increase in exports.  If you look at the list of countries in Europe in the OECD statement, we, in fact, for once in a way, are heading the list and not lagging behind as we used in the past.</P>
