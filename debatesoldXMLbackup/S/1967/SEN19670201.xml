      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 23, to add at the end:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and different dates may be appointed for different sections.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason I am moving this amendment is that there may be some difficulty and that some time may elapse before the Bill is completely in operation. The Minister may have some other views on that and, if he has, the amendment may not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal purpose in putting down this amendment is to ensure that the real amendment to the existing law of landlord and tenant, which is proposed to be effected by amendments Nos. 46 and 47, which are the same, will come into operation <Col N="742" /> without any delay.  I think it will be agreed that it is desirable that the relief being provided by the section should not be delayed.  In addition, it seems to me that there are other amendments to the law of landlord and tenant contained in sections 25 to 32 which need not be delayed.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should have power to bring these various sections, which do not deal specifically with ground rents, into operation on a date earlier than the other provisions of the Bill, if it is inconvenient to bring the other provisions of the Bill into operation at that time.</P>
      <P>I want now to turn to amendment No. 47 which is the same as Government amendment No. 46.  I think the House is already aware of the need for this amendment.  Its purpose is to bring relief to tenants who, for one reason or another, find themselves in the position of being the assignees of property which has been let or assigned without the consent in writing of the landlord and therefore find themselves with absolutely no title in law to the property.  It has been held in a number of cases, which it is unnecessary for me to go into now, that no relief can be given to a tenant or the assignee of a tenant who has acquired property where there is a provision in the lease against assigning, subletting or parting with possession without the consent in writing of the landlord.  I am pleased that the Minister has an amendment down to deal with the same matter and I can anticipate his agreement to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>There may be criticism by some people that this is not perhaps the best amendment that might be effected. That may be so.  However, the hardship that is being caused and that will be caused to tenants of property by allowing the law to remain as it is warrants the House in making this amendment to the existing law of landlord and tenant.  I do not think there is any great hardship: I know that the amendment will widely be welcomed by the legal profession which sees both sides of the case.  It sees the case from the point of view of the landlord and from the point of view of the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> The legal profession is well aware of the extreme hardship caused to tenants who unwittingly have acquired property which was assigned without the appropriate consent, in writing, of the landlord.  The improvement in the law contained in the Minister's amendment and in my amendment will remove the temptation, which unscrupulous landlords have availed themselves of up to now, of causing the complete forfeiture of property for which persons might have paid thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary course, in our general law, there are provisions in the Statute of Limitations where somebody has certain rights.  However, the general policy of the law is that the line must be drawn at some stage where people have certainty as to their occupation of personal property and are not troubled by litigation long after the event has occurred.  In the existing framework of landlord and tenant law, there are cases where breaches of covenant occurred up to 40 years ago and, because the breaches continue and because the assignment was void <i>ab initio,</i> there is nothing in the existing Statute of Limitations to work in favour of the person in possession. In this amendment, we are not doing any more than putting the tenant in the same position as if he were a squatter who had acquired title against landlord property under the Statute of Limitations Act.</P>
    <P>The landlord is not shorn of all rights under this amendment.  He still has the right to say that the lease is forfeited.  If the person is an unsuitable tenant &mdash; for example a bankrupt or a person of no substance &mdash; he still has his rights under the Conveyancing Act to come into court and, if it is a good case, the court will uphold him.  Therefore, we are not injuring landlords in this provision.  I am very pleased that the Minister has agreed to accept this amendment.  I trust he will not fault me for having, to some extent, infringed his copyright in the improvement of the amendment I had on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment I <Col N="744" /> put down meets the point made by Senator O'Quigley the last day.  I am glad he brought this matter to the notice of the House.  Undoubtedly, the two sections in the Deasy's Act, 1860 &mdash; section 10 and 18 &mdash; imposing the forfeiture principle in cases where assignment or subletting has been carried out without the written consent of the landlord, are too drastic in the modern context and, in effect, in regard to other covenants, have been whittled away by the Conveyancing Act, 1881. This brings this particular kind of assignment and subletting under the 1860 Act into line with the other provisions relating to breaches of covenant and is consistent law in regard to breaches of covenant.</P>
      <P>The Senator need not fear that there will be delay in bringing the Act into operation.  The drafting of the regulations is in train.  My purpose is to have the commencement date declared immediately after the passing of the Act and to have it brought into operation as quickly as possible.  By that, I mean a matter of a month or two, no more than that.</P>

      <P>The same principle is involved.  This is merely a question of the English usage and the language in which the Bill is couched. We had this discussed already and the Minister promised that he would have a look at it but, apparently, his having a look at it did not prompt him to suggest any change.  So we still find that section 3, subsection (1) says &ldquo;a person who as respects any land&rdquo;.  It is the phrase &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; that I object to on the ground, simply, that it is not good English.  I think &ldquo;as regards&rdquo; is quite legitimate but I think here what is meant is either &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; or &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a person who in relation to any land is a person to whom ...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us as a defence for this &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; the fact that a British parliamentary draftsman had used the phrase but I feel that that as an authority for English language usage is not perhaps going as far back a source as could be reached.  In each of these cases the drafting would be improved &mdash; although it is a small point &mdash; linguistically improved, by replacing &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; which I again submit respectfully is not English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> I note with pleasure, in support of my contention, that, for instance, on page 6 of the same Bill, line 46 reads: &ldquo;the rent payable by him in respect of the land&rdquo;; on page 7, line 54 reads: &ldquo;the rent in respect of the interest in the land&rdquo;; on page 9, line 16 reads: &ldquo;where in relation to a rent&rdquo; and on page 11 line 5 reads: &ldquo;the rent payable in respect of the land&rdquo;.  I feel, therefore, that this &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; in these three instance where it occurs constitutes a minor blemish which we ought to remove.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Chathaoirleach, the draftsman is in high dudgeon over the aspersions cast by Senator Sheehy Skeffington on his grammer.  I have had discussions with him and he will not be too co-operative with me in future drafting matters if I do not hold the fort for him on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I have done some research myself since the last meeting of the Seanad and as regards &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; being in the proper order of English grammar and English terminology, I have gone to those two fountains of knowledge in regard to English linguistics, the Oxford Dictionary and Webster's International Dictionary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of them refer to &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; and refer to what &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; means in the context of the English language.  I would refer Senator Sheehy Skeffington to Volume 2 of the 1933 edition of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, page 1717, column 1, and to volume 2 of Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961), page 1934, column 2, in which &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; is dealt with in great detail.  From any perusal of the remarks in those two English language bibles, I am firmly of opinion that &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; is proper drafting, good grammer and good English in the context of the drafting which is before the House at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to me to be following a former Leader of his Party in according to dictionaries an authority which they do <Col N="747" /> not have politically or, indeed, as regards correct usage.  A dictionary may say what, in fact, words used or abused mean.  It does not tell you whether it is, in fact, good usage.  I wonder whether the Minister in failing to consult Fowler on the matter was inadvertent or deliberately avoiding taking an authority on correct usage. What the Minister has not done is explain to us why, in fact, it is necessary to use a phrase to which exception is taken, which seems to be out of line with the rest of the Bill, whether it has some special meaning here and is necessary because it means something different from the other three usages to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has referred, and whether, therefore, if it is dropped, this could lead to a legal flaw of some kind.  If, in fact, this were the case, one would understand it. If not, it seems pointless to insist on complicating the Bill by using arbitrarily another phrase.  The mere fact that the draftsman is in high dudgeon because an aspersion is cast on his grammer is no reason for retaining the item.  The Minister may feel so but I do not think the House would feel so. Unless there is a legal reason for maintaining it, it should be changed to something more acceptable and more in line with the rest of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that we employ draftsmen to draft legislation in terms which can be understood, not alone by this House and the other House, but by the people to whom the legislation will be applied. It has been strongly suggested here, and personally I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the point, that this term is badly expressed.  It may be good English according to the authorities quoted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Quite.  My point is that as far as I and many people are concerned, we could understand it if it were expressed more simply and in conformity with the type of phrase we are accustomed to.  That is the main point made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  It strikes me that this House or the other House should not be dictated to by the whims, or the convictions for that matter, of the parliamentary draftsman.  We ought to tell the draftsman what we want and what we insist on having and, having done so, should insist on having it.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's argument about the parliamentary draftsman.  This has just been said &mdash; we are usually willing to bow to his opinion on a legal matter but why we should bow to him on a matter of grammer, I do not know.  He is not supposed to be an authority on grammer.  This is not the first time a queer phrase has appeared in a Bill. One gets some very awkward constructions. However, I am quite happy about &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo;.  I think it is infinitely better than this dreadful <Col N="749" /> phrase &ldquo;as respects&rdquo;.  The latter does not strike well upon the ear.  Legally it may be what the Minister means but from that point of view, the argument would have been more convincing had the parliamentary draftsman stuck to his guns right through the Bill &mdash; as respects, as respects, as respects.</P>

He mentioned that they say this term exists.  It has a tenuous existence, but it is not referred to in Modern English Usage and I think among people using English every day there would be general agreement that &ldquo;as respects&rdquo; such-and-such sounds odd and clumsy.  I am glad to see there is quite a bit of support for this view here.  Because of that I am inclined to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 4, section 3, subsection (2) (d), as amended in Committee, in subparagraph (i) to delete &ldquo;expire twenty-five years or more&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not expire within twenty-five years&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment and the similar amendment to section 18 (b) which I have put down and which I suggest should be taken with No. 7 in Senator O'Quigley's name, are intended to remove doubts which were expressed on the Committee Stage as to the application of the Bill in <Col N="751" /> relation to fee farm grants.  As the Bill stands, persons holding land under fee farm grants are in exactly the same position as persons holding under leases, because the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; is defined in both the 1931 Act and the 1958 Act as including a fee farm grant. Under section 34 of this Bill, these Acts are to be construed together as one Act.  Accordingly, where a fee farm grant satisfies the conditions of a building lease, it will attract the right of purchase in the ordinary way.  There will be no difference between the fee farm grant tenant and the ordinary ground land tenant envisaged under the Bill.  Alternatively, the fee farm grant may come within the definition of the leases which we are now, by the amendment to paragraph (d) of section 3 (2), making eligible in this respect also.</P>
      <P>However, on re-examination of the terms of the latter class of lease, it has appeared that the reference to the lease &ldquo;expiring 25 years or more&rdquo;&mdash; I am quoting from the section &mdash; after the date of service of the notice under section 4 could not appropriately be applied to the case of a fee farm grant, because fee farm grants do not expire. The same applies to a similar expression in section 18 (b).  Accordingly, the expressions in question have been redrafted to remove this difficulty of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the incorporation of these amendments will make quite clear that holders of fee farm grants will now be in exactly the same position as holders of leases in so far as the right to acquire the fee simple is concerned.  I made this point on the Committee Stage and it occurred to me since that in putting in the word &ldquo;expire&rdquo; in the extension of categories coming within the terms of the Bill to expire in 25 years or more, the verb was inconsistent with the rights accruing to fee farm tenants.  By substituting &ldquo;not expire within 25 years&rdquo;, the position is made quite clear and copperfastens what I said on the Committee Stage, that fee farm grant tenants are in the same position as other tenants envisaged in the Bill in <Col N="752" /> regard to purchasing out their fee simple rights.  To that extent it is relevant to Senator O'Quigley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that.  We can take No. 7 and deal with the three amendments together.  It is perfectly clear from what the Minister says that it is intended to include the fee farm grant within the terms of the Bill and enable the owner of a fee farm grant to buy out the fee farm land.  I quite agree with the Minister that section 2 of the 1931 Act defines &ldquo;lease&rdquo; as including a fee farm grant.  What I am not satisfied about is that in section 3 we say that &ldquo;a person who&rdquo;&mdash;<i>pace</i> Senator Sheehy Skeffington &mdash;&ldquo;as respects any land, is a person to whom this section applies, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the right as incident to his existing interest in the land to enlarge that interest into a fee simple.&rdquo;  This is a matter on which I should like the Minister to give his view.  I understand that a fee farm grant is a fee simple.  If I am buying a property held under fee farm grant it is described as property held in fee simple.</P>
      <P>What will puzzle lawyers not to speak of laymen when they come to read this Bill is they will know that property held under a fee farm grant is property held in fee simple and then they will say: &ldquo;You cannot enlarge interest into a fee simple when you have that already.&rdquo;  What I want to do is to make it clear beyond any doubt so that we will not have cases in the High Court or people sending off cases to counsel and counsel going into the origin of fee farm grants and fee simple.  I merely want to put it into the Bill so that there will be no doubt that a person who owns property in fee simple subject to a rent is entitled to buy out the rent to which the fee simple property is subject.  I think, therefore, that we ought to make it perfectly clear that we intend that the fee farm rent should be bought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another and perhaps more cogent reason from the point of view of construing the Bill.  In section 34 we say that the Landlord and Tenant Acts 1931 and 1958 and this Act shall be <Col N="753" /> construed together as one Act and the Minister relies upon that to bring in a lease which includes a fee farm grant within the provisions of this Bill.  Mark that in this Bill we go the distance of giving a special definition to &ldquo;business&rdquo; but if you look at the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 you find that the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is defined.  It is clear then that we are giving a special and more extended meaning to &ldquo;business&rdquo; in the Ground Rents Bill than we are in the Landlord and Tenant Act. Therefore, if we are dealing with a lease it seems to me to be inconsistent in the one case to import a particular term into the Bill, that is to say a &ldquo;lease&rdquo; but in the other case you do not give a new definition to the term &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  It will put the matter beyond all doubt if we include the definition I have suggested in the Bill. It may be that the Minister thinks it is clear but I think it will puzzle a great number of lawyers that in section 3 you say that you are buying out the fee simple to a person who has a fee farm grant as the fee simple subject to a rent.  You cannot acquire any larger interest than you have already.  You are merely liable to a rent.  You have the fee simple under a fee farm grant and, therefore, it seems to me that it is not appropriate to say you shall enlarge that interest into a fee simple.  When you are talking about a fee farm grant it is a fee simple subject to a rent.  That is the whole point.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from this Bill that fee farm grantees, to use the correct term &mdash; I previously employed the term fee farm grant tenants &mdash; have got the right of the other tenants included in this Bill to purchase their head or ground rent. That is quite clear.  To copperfasten that, and I do not think Senator O'Quigley adverted to this, we have in section 2, line 35, a provision that &ldquo;fee simple&rdquo; does not include the interest in land of a person holding the land under a fee farm grant.  In this Act when it is in operation fee simple does not mean fee farm grant, however fee simple may be equated with fee farm grant under other Acts or in other circumstances.  As far as this Act is concerned, fee farm grant is not a fee simple.  A fee farm grantee is in the same position as a lessee who has the right to purchase out his head rent.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, section 3, subsection (2) (d), as amended in Committee, in subparagraph (i) to delete clauses (I) and (II) and substitute &ldquo;is less than the amount of the rateable valuation of the land at the commencement of this Act,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving this amendment as a result of the discussion on the Committee Stage during which it was suggested that the requirement that the rent under a pre-1914 lease should be less than three-quarters of the rateable valuation, as first fixed or revised after the granting of the lease, was too stringent and would exclude a great number of leases where improvements had been carried out as a result of which the rateable valuation had been increased to a point exceeding the rent payable under the lease.  It was also suggested that the rateable valuation to be considered for this purpose should be the valuation existing at the time the notice of intention to purchase was served by the lessee.  This last suggestion would mean <Col N="755" /> that a lessee could bring himself within the purchase category by reason of a revision of the rateable valuation in the future and I am inclined to think that this would be going too far.  That is why I have chosen in the amendment to take the middle course relating the rateable valuation to the valuation of the land at the commencement of this Act.  I think it is fair that the question should be whether or not the rent is or is not less than the rateable valuation at the present day.  I think this is a reasonable compromise and I hope it will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very reasonable amendment and is an admirable middle course between two extremes.  I am aware that there are certain property interests that would have preferred subparagraph (i) of the amendment that was put into section 3, that is to say, that the rateable valuation would be that fixed on the date of the granting of the lease but as the Minister has said that would be unfair to the tenant.  On the other hand, people could readily get their valuations increased.  There is no difficulty at all under the law in trebling your valuation any day you want it because the way the valuation Acts work at present is that they make out the valuation in accordance with the present Acts and divide by three.  That is all going to be rectified at some date in the future.  It would be very simple to bring oneself within the provisions of this Act by just telling the Valuation Office that you wished to have your premises revalued.  They would be very glad to do that.  I think that the middle course is the best one.  I know there are hardship cases on both sides.  I am aware of one who, if the original part remained, would certainly be in a position to buy out his rent and convert his property into a fee simple property and make it much more valuable than it is at present.  Acting responsibly and reasonably and being fair to all interests, what the Minister has proposed is acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, section 5, between lines 48 and 49 to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where land held under a lease is indemnified against payment of any part of the rent payable under the lease by any other part of the land held under the lease, the apportionment of the rent reserved by the lease shall in respect of land so indemnified be nihil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a section where we are providing for the apportionment of ground rent and we would want to walk <Col N="757" /> cautiously here, especially if the Bill is enacted finally in the way in which the Minister proposes to have it enacted.  I have already indicated what the position is where property which is held under a lease is subdivided into a number of lettings; sometimes when that happens, at a future date when some one owner of two properties is selling one of the properties, in order to get a better price, the property he is selling is sold free from rent and the rent that was payable in respect of the property being sold is charged upon or indemnified by the property retained by the person selling.  The correct way to do that is to get the consent of the lessor to the apportionment of the rent.</P>
    <P>Very frequently that has not been done and, therefore, when it comes to apportioning the rent that was originally reserved by the lease, the authority dealing with that will find that all the property under the lease is subject to the rent.  However, private arrangements have been made as between owners of the property, the tenancy interest in the property, that part of it should be indemnified against the payment of any rent and should be free of any rent.  That is a transaction which has been provided for and, in effect, the rent of that property has already been bought out by the person who now holds it free of any rent, though <i>vis-à-vis</i> the landlord that property is still liable to pay the whole of the rent under our ordinary law of landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, it is within the powers of the person apportioning the rent under this section to apportion rent on property which might not be paying rent but which in fact is liable to rent by reference to the landlord, thus apportioning part of the original land reserved by the lease.  I want to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that should not be so, that in a case of that kind, where the property has been indemnified against payment of any part of the rent, when it comes to apportionment, the apportionment in respect of that property should be nil.  That is only fair and reasonable as far as the owner of that property is concerned because he is all <Col N="758" /> the time paying; he paid a higher price by reason of the fact that there was no rent payable in respect of the property.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which will put the law beyond any doubt for those who administer it, for those who interpret it and for those who will try to benefit by the provisions of this Bill. I would urge the House to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley has been repeating the point be made on the Committee Stage and, in replying to him, I shall be repeating what I said then.  There are many variations in landlord and tenant arrangements, and I am quite certain that in the sort of case outlined by Senator O'Quigley the county registrar would, in fact, do what the Senator seeks to have done by way of his amendment and that the apportionment would be nil.  I think it would be better to leave it to the discretion of the county registrars whom we must assume to be reasonable men.  It is perfectly obvious that in the situation outlined by Senator O'Quigley the county registrar would make a nil apportionment.</P>
      <P>There are cases where that might not be the right thing to do, where the lessor could be prejudiced.  Take a case where a speculator might develop a scheme in such a way that the full rent might be payable out of some worthless part of the property with an indemnity against payment of any rent by all the valuable properties in the scheme.  If, on apportionment, the county registrar had no option, as suggested by Senator O'Quigley, but to apportion all the rent to the worthless portion, the lessor would be left with no security at all for his rent.  On balance, I think it is better to leave it to the good sense of the county registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of force in what the Minister has said about the exceptional case where the whole of the rent would be charged upon the most worthless part of the property under a lease, but that certainly would be an exception and a very rare exception.  What I am concerned with here is what one finds very <Col N="759" /> frequently.  The Minister says the county registrars are very reasonable men.  Of course they are reasonable men, but the most reasonable arbiters have given unreasonable decisions because the law makes them do it.  One often hears judges saying in court: &ldquo;That may not sound very reasonable but it is the law.&rdquo;  Where we are dealing with property rights, I think that to give to a non-judicial person such as a county registrar the right to make property, which has never been liable to any rent, liable in future to pay a rent, is certainly treading a long way away from respect for property rights guaranteed to us under the Constitution. To say that a county registrar will have the power under this Bill to do so will cause many people who are concerned with the Constitution and the safeguarding of the rights of citizens to wonder where we are going and what value our Constitution is.  I should like to press this amendment because for a county registrar to be enabled to impose a rent on somebody who has not been liable to the rent up to now is too great a power.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is identical with No. 22 and is mainly of a drafting character, but perhaps I should explain it to the House.  It is a question of streamlining the drafting. It will be seen that the effect of the amendments is to delete the reference to an infant and therefore remove from the county registrar the power of authorising an infant to convey or join in conveying the fee simple.  The position will now be that in the case of an infant who is not a ward of court, the infant's guardian &mdash; his <Col N="760" /> parent or a guardian appointed by the court &mdash; may convey the fee simple; or the county registrar may use his powers under subsection (2) of section 8 to appoint an officer of the Circuit Court to execute the conveyance in the name of the infant.  Where the infant is a ward of court, then, under the new subsection proposed to be inserted in section 8 by amendment No. 21, the county registrar will exercise the powers of appointing an officer of the court to execute the conveyance only by leave of the High Court or, if the infant is a ward of the Circuit Court, by leave of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The position is the same in relation to apportionments on behalf of infants under section 14, where the power to authorise an infant to join in the apportionment is being dropped and the infant's incapacity to join in the apportionment is being remedied in the same way as indicated for the case of an infant required to execute a conveyance of the fee simple.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the reference in the existing draft of subsection (1) of both sections 8 and 14 to a personal representative being incapable in law of conveying the fee simple has not been correct since at least the coming into operation of the Succession Act, 1965, on 1st January, 1967.  The similar reference to a trustee being incapable in law of conveying the fee simple or, in the case of section 14 (1), being incapable of joining in the apportionment of a rent, does not seem to be quite apt, notwithstanding that it has appeared in the 1931 and 1958 Acts, because a trustee should have these powers in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is a question of streamlining the drafting and also largely meeting the views put forward by Senators in regard to the infant's position and preserving the position of the courts in regard to wardship.</P>

      <P>This probably does effect some improvement in the section. However, I am sorry Senator Sheehy Skeffington is temporarily absent from the House because I think he would revel in the bad English as contained in this section.  One can understand the amendment down to a particular point. <Col N="761" /> We are deleting lines 30 to 32.  The section will then read:</P>
      <P>Where a person who is required by this Act to convey or join in the conveyance of the fee simple in land is, by reason of having a fiduciary capacity or by reason of being an infant or by reason of having an estate for his life. ...</P>

We all have the capacity to have a fiduciary relationship to X or Y.  I do not think the phrase &ldquo;fiduciary capacity&rdquo; is the kind of one to win laurels for any parliamentary draftsman.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these amendments I am seeking to do what I understood the Minister indicated he would accept on the Committee Stage.  I am not going to delay the House by repeating what I have said already in relation to the position of the county registrars under this Bill. The Minister has said there is almost an infinite variety of relationships and complexities in the law of landlord and tenant.  If one looks at section 3 of the <Col N="762" /> Bill, one sees that a county registrar will have to determine whether a person holds land under a building lease or under a proprietary lease and a whole lot of other things.  He will have to make up his mind what to do in the case where the originals of leases cannot be got and where only copies of them are to be found.</P>
    <P>I am not so much concerned with that aspect of it.  In this Bill we are undoubtedly dealing with property rights.  I do not say we are not dealing fairly as between landlord and tenant, but there will be cases where disputes will arise.  Where these disputes arise, it is my clear view that these disputes should be litigated only before a county registrar if there is agreement between the parties that he shall be the arbitrator; and if there is not agreement as to the manner of determining these disputes, they should be litigated in the courts.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the Bill which prevent any undue costs being piled up against either landlord or tenant.  It is always necessary in this House, and I think elsewhere, for people who are lawyers to disclaim any financial interest in amendments of this kind.  There will not be any money in the operation of this Bill as far as the appearances in court are concerned.  Even if there were, to safeguard against that, I have provided in one of these amendments &mdash; I think it is one of the group we are dealing with at present &mdash; that if we allow these matters to go to court, the hearing will be in chambers.  That is the procedure the Minister himself devised and the House accepted in respect of the Succession Act &mdash; that a speedy, not costly and effective means of determining disputes between parties is by having them dealt with in chambers before a judge.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how it can be contended that where you are dealing compulsorily with property rights, where you are compulsorily alienating the property rights of another person, that does not come clearly within the provisions of the Constitution which guarantees the right of private property to all citizens.  That being so, I am concerned that, bit by bit, the powers of <Col N="763" /> the courts in this country are being eroded.  That concern is not mine alone; it is a concern of the members of the legal profession of all shades of opinion and all Parties that this gradual erosion is taking place.  The disquieting thing about it is that nobody seems to mind.  This type of procedure adopted here is like a bit of rust occurring on a piece of metal; nobody takes much notice until one day you find it has corroded or is corroding the whole piece of metal, whether a bucket or a coal scuttle or something else.  One finds at that stage, as metal polishers will tell you, it cannot be arrested.  Here, bit by bit, we are getting away from the court and from the protection which the Constitution gives to private and personal rights such as the right to property.</P>
    <P>For quite some time I was disposed to take the line that there is nothing much that one person can do about it even with the support of my colleagues on this side of the House, but I have been pressed by people of varying shades of political opinion to speak out against this type of provision.  I do so voluntarily because these are my views but I do so with more vehemence and more confidence because I have been asked to do so by people of all shades of opinion.  I deeply regret that the Minister for Justice who is concerned, who should always protect the rights of private individuals from attack from criminals, by unjust laws and their operation, should be himself the instrument which, in my view, is gradually bringing about a diminution of the powers of the courts.</P>
    <P>The only reason one needs to have respect for the courts is that ultimately the protection of private rights and of our democratic system lies in the courts, and if we remove bit by bit the power of the courts and make these inroads into the Constitution, the time will come when we shall wake up to find that the courts have been paralysed or that their area of activity has been greatly attenuated and that many things which people ought to be able to redress in the courts founded under the Constitution and established by <Col N="764" /> Act of this Parliament are being determined by civil servants, whether of the Department of Justice or Social Welfare, or by local government authorities or elsewhere.  We shall find that property and other rights that people have are being determined by civil servants who are not answerable to the public and who cannot be got at.  One finds that happening increasingly and it is for that reason I put down these amendments.</P>
    <P>On the previous occasion I think it was Senator Nash on the other side who suggested that the District Court might be the most appropriate court in which to have these matters litigated as between the tenant and the landlord. The Minister said that if he was having any court, it would not be the District Court for a variety of reasons which he gave, but that it would be the Circuit Court.  It is for that reason of ever wanting to meet the Minister as the Minister has, in some cases even on this Bill, met us, that I put down these amendments to provide that all these matters would be determined by Circuit Court judges through the inexpensive procedure of having them dealt with in chambers.</P>
    <P>Doing that, I know, is not gratifying the Circuit Court judges who, I am sure, would not thank us for the increased work that we are making as a result of this legislation.  At the same time, I do not think that will have the slightest effect on their position &mdash; they will administer the law as enacted by the Oireachtas &mdash; but what I am trying to do is to go the distance with the Minister of saying that these matters should be dealt with in the Circuit Court.  I do not mind if we go the further distance of saying that there will not be an appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Circuit Court judge in chambers.  What I am concerned about is that we shall be seen, in this piece of legislation when dealing with a very fundamental thing specifically provided for in the Constitution, to ensure that property rights are being disposed of and finally determined by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the last occasion argued that the county registrar would <Col N="765" /> be concerned under this Bill merely with determining values.  That was an oversimplification.  It is the kind of clear expression of view of which the Minister is so admirably capable from time to time.  That, of course, is not the position.  He will have to determine apportionment and leases; construe various leases and he will very often have to decide whether the person is properly the tenant as he alleges he is when somebody may say: &ldquo;You are not the tenant; somebody else is the tenant.&rdquo;  He will have to construe the whole law of property and landlord and tenant law as well as the very difficult sections of this Bill which is not a simple one in some provisions of some of its sections.  It is not correct, therefore, to say that the position of the county registrar will be the same as the position of an arbitrator under the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act of 1919 who is determining the value of property.  That is a very simple matter if he is determining a whole lot of rights and the amount for each person where there are superior interests involved, the amount that each person is entitled to get.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of anything more clearly involving property rights than this Bill.  It is well recognised in the law of landlord and tenant in relation to ejectments that the tenant is entitled to plead every defence in law and equity.  The reason is that you are dealing with the home or business of an individual.  Equally in this Bill we are dealing with the homes and businesses of individuals and perhaps their livelihoods in the case of landlords.  I can think of nothing more fundamental in the law of property than that with which we are now dealing.  I hope at this stage that the Minister will come the distance in meeting us.  If he finds afterwards that this is not a workable system, the matter can be looked at in another way but I am not prepared to agree that a person who is not sworn to administer justice according to law &mdash; which the county registrar is not &mdash; and that a person who may have for 20 or 30 years, depending on the length of time since his appointment as county registrar, very little acquaintanceship with the <Col N="766" /> law of landlord and tenant, should be constituted the authority under this Bill to determine property rights.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, has been and should always be a function of a court, especially where as in a case like this, the property is being compulsorily taken from the landlord.  We have agreed upon that but, having done so, we should decide that what remains to be determined &mdash; who is entitled to what amount of money to be paid &mdash; should be the function not of a person who is not sworn to do justice but of those who are sworn to do justice, the judges of the courts.  That is what they were created for and what they are required to do.  I have spoken rather too lengthily on this.  I trust the Minister will accept this amendment and I hope that the nominee of the Incorporated Law Society, Senator Nash, and my other colleagues on the other side of the House will lend their powerful support to the arguments I have been making in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to second the amendment, not at any length, because Senator O'Quigley has dealt with the matter fully.  I should like to express my disappointment that the Minister has not, as a result of the recent consideration he was good enough to undertake after Committee Stage, found it possible to accept the amendment which was pressed effectively and cogently from both sides of the House to a degree which did at least get from him an agreement to reconsider the matter.  I would be interested to know why that reconsideration has proved negative, in view of the cogency of the arguments put forward.  I am disappointed it should be so and would press him, even at this stage, to reconsider his decision in the matter, in view of all that has been said in keeping this matter with the courts, which will not add to expense or, because matters will be heard in chambers, give undue publicity.  None of the arguments put forward by the Minister has convinced us.  I would hope that, even at this stage, he could be persuaded to change his mind.  I trust, on this occasion, it is not the parliamentary <Col N="767" /> draftsmen who will prevent him from agreeing.</P>

      <P>But, under the Constitution, a judge is compelled to make decisions in relation to legal issues, legal differences.  Here, we have a situation where this man is not an appointed judge; he is a county registrar. It is proposed now that he step into what was formerly the position of a judge in making a decision in relation to the interpretation of law.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley has very clearly set out all the different problems which can arise and which must be clarified before that decision is given by the county registrar.  Of course, the judge on the Bench must look into all those legal aspects before he gives his decision, too, but then he is appointed for the purpose of making these decisions in relation to the various laws. I feel you are putting the registrar into a rather invidious position, that is setting him up as a judge to make decisions which normally are made from the Bench.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is making actual provision in this for extra staff and assistance for the county registrars.  I know that at least some of these officers are grossly overworked at the present time and there has been a slowness on the part of the Department, or the central power to sanction additional staff when they have been requested so to do.  Has the Minister looked into this very important matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the position of supporting this Bill and almost all of its provisions; at least the intention of the Bill is something this House must, obviously, pass.  At the same time, as I indicated on Committee Stage, I find myself rather anxious about the provisions which give this power to the county registrar. I must indicate that if the matter is pressed for amendment, I will find myself obliged &mdash; in favour of the Bill as a whole &mdash; to vote against this amendment.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of it I should like the Minister to be aware of. In relation to the costs, which have been referred to here, I think Senator O'Quigley has made a suggestion of hearing in chambers.  I would not go along with the suggestion of hearing in chambers, merely in relation to costs, because a hearing in chambers is appropriate to confidential matters and, in the present practice of the courts, it is used for certain matters of a confidential nature and revenue investigations of one kind or another. I cannot see that a matter like this would be a proper case for hearing in chambers.  I would say that the court hearing or the arbitration in a case of this sort &mdash; on the very odd occasion when it does go to arbitration &mdash; would be only a small fraction of the cost involved in cases of this sort, that is the costs involved in the actual investigation of title itself, the execution of title, of preliminary matters relating to title, whether or not it is dealt with by the county registrar or judge.  Those are the matters which will be costly in this case.  The arbitration fee, whether before the court or county registrar, can be fixed according to scale and, if that is the suggested difference in costs or expense in this case, it is not a very valid one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the county registrars feel competent and well equipped: experience alone can answer that.  I certainly do not want to cast any reflection on the ability of county registrars but I do say this is a <Col N="769" /> very specialised field, a field in which many lawyers would not offer themselves as being experts.  In so far as we will now be dealing with what I might call multiple interests in leasehold and ground rents, rather than the registered interest one finds and with which the county registrars' staffs are familiar, I very much doubt whether they will be capable of dealing with these.  Certainly there are provisions in this Bill which go further than any provisions introduced in any other Bill.  It is not a question of declaration of title, such as we might have had in the Registration of Title Act.  This is a question of a judicial determination between the rights of various people.  Under the Registration of Title Act, as I see it, it may be a limited function as defined by the Constitution, but here you have two people, certainly not a common right, litigating or arbitrating in a case of this sort.  That is a totally different question from a man coming before a registrar and saying: &ldquo;There is my title; register me&rdquo;.  There is no one there on the opposite side to question his title.</P>
    <P>Above all that, there is a provision in this Bill which specifically states that where questions of law are being litigated or considered, the county registrar may provide for fees for counsel. This, in itself, is an open admission that here we will be concerned with questions of law coming within the power of the county registrar to determine. There are other powers which he has, for instance, the power to penalise in costs.  I am not aware of any similar person having any similar power, which again would involve a review of the whole law relating to this particular Act, as to whether or not a person has acted within reason within the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons &mdash; and I do not think the question of costs enters into this one way or the other at this stage &mdash; I would certainly hope the Minister might see fit to accept the spirit of this amendment but, as I indicated, although being in support of the Bill as a whole and its provisions, I would certainly feel obliged to vote against this if the matter is pressed for amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should mention as a background to this matter that I have over the past 18 months received numerous deputations representative of the landlords' interests, the tenants' interests, business interests, and various other organisations such as those of chartered surveyors, valuers and auctioneers who were all concerned with this Bill.  I received numerous representations from lawyers interested in the matter as well.  No one has pressed this point with me.  In the Dáil it was generally welcomed by Fine Gael and Labour.  There was no particular pressure about this point at all in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The whole trend of the representations made to me, and of the comments made in the Dáil, in the public press and elsewhere, on the Bill, has been one of welcome for this expeditious and effective way of deciding the issue as to the amount of compensation to be paid to the landlord by the new tenant who is buying it.  There was general appreciation of the fact that the whole purpose of the Bill would be frustrated if there was an expensive court procedure whereby the tenant would be put to excessive cost, in the event of dispute, to enable him to buy out the ground rent.  In that situation the cost aspect would be completely oppressive.  It was important in framing this legislation that an expeditious, effective and inexpensive way should be found in which the arbitration could be carried out quickly, by a man like a county registrar, between the tenant and the landlord.  That was our thinking on this and until we arrived here, and it was generally welcomed.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to one matter which was raised by Senator McDonald.  I have had correspondence from the County Registrars' Association, who did not take kindly to some of the remarks made about them here and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>I have with me a letter from the County Registrars' Associations.  I shall not quote what <Col N="771" /> they say about remarks made by some Members of the Seanad.  They said that they hoped the Minister would be able to deal with these criticisms and reflections.</P>
      <P>The County Registrars' Association welcome this provision, and welcome the Bill, and feel that this work which is being placed on them is appropriate to their responsibilities.  They have not objected to me about what might be regarded as an extra burden on them. Arrangements may have to be made about staff, as was mentioned by Senator McDonald, but that is another day's work.  In principle the County Registrars' Association welcome this Bill and the additional duties imposed on them under it.</P>
      <P>As regards the general principle of statutory arbitration, this is another form of statutory arbitration.  It is not something new or unique that I am bringing in here.  It is not a new principle which is eroding people's rights.  It is another form of statutory arbitration which is universal in nearly every system in the world.  Provided there is a proper appeal procedure to the courts, arbitration is now regarded over a wide field as being the appropriate way to assess compensation as between parties in an expeditious and effective way.  This is another form of statutory arbitration and it is a form of statutory arbitration that should be welcome to Senator O'Quigley, Senator FitzGerald and some other Senators who are critical of this aspect, in that the man appointed to be the statutory arbitrator is a man of considerable legal standing.  A man can be appointed as a county registrar only after a certain number of years in practice. Many of them are equal in stature and ability so far as the law is concerned to many of our judges &mdash; without reflection on either group.  They are, in fact, judicial officials of the Circuit Court. They are not just faceless men as some bureaucrats are described.  There are officers of the Circuit Court, men of proved legal standing, appointed after a certain number of years in practice as legal practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any form of statutory arbitration <Col N="772" />&mdash; and we are setting no precedent in that respect &mdash; surely this is precisely the one that should appeal to people who are interested in the part the legal profession and the courts play in our whole system of law and justice.  Surely this is one form of statutory arbitration &mdash; arbitration by officials of the Circuit Court &mdash; that should appeal to people who think the way Senator O'Quigley has expressed himself.  Far from being critical of it, it should be welcomed as a form of statutory arbitration which goes further in that direction than any other so far being exercised in this State.</P>
    <P>I could go back over the whole scheme of statutory arbitration.  It was confirmed by an Act passed by the inter-Party Government in 1954, the Arbitration Act, 1954.  The Taoiseach at that time was a lawyer himself. Many eminent lawyers served in that Government.  The Arbitration Act, 1954, consolidated the arbitration that had operated for a long number of years.  In that Act there is certainly a more extreme form of arbitration than is proposed in this Bill.  In the 1954 Act where property is being compulsorily acquired by a local authority, there are more drastic forms of interference with property rights than anything in this Bill which gives very reasonable compensation in regard to compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>In the case of the compulsory acquisition of land, for housing purposes or road widening purposes, by the local authorities the person from whom the property is being acquired has no right at all to resist the action of the local authority if the local authority deem it proper that the land should be acquired for housing purposes or road widening purposes or a number of other purposes.  The ESB can purchase land compulsorily in what might be described as an arbitrary fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to face the facts of life and some form of compulsion is necessary if progress is to be made.  Some form of effective <Col N="773" /> and inexpensive arbitration is necessary. I am pointing out that this is one of the facts of life in the age in which we live.  There is no point in going back.  The arbitration procedure was grouped together and consolidated in 1954 by a Government which could be described as a lawyers' Government. Under the 1954 Act the decision in regard to the person whose property is taken in what might be described as an arbitrary fashion by the ESB or the county council is taken by a person who is not an official of the Circuit Court and has no judicial function. He may be a lawyer of any number of years standing.  The people who were appointed to do the job probably do it in an excellent manner. They are technical people, officials of the Department of Local Government, engineers and the officials of the various local authorities.  They are the people who decide on very serious cases relating to compensation to be paid, in relation to who is to be compensated.</P>
      <P>In this case the arbitrators are not in any sense obliged under the Act to be people of any legal training or officials of the courts.  Their decisions can affect enormous sums of money and they can affect substantial property rights.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to go on with all these old-fashioned and Victorian eulogies about the courts and about lawyers. I am a lawyer but one must be practical in 1967 and recognise that the eroding of the functions of the courts has been going on progressively since Victorian times.</P>
      <P>It is one of the facts of life in the modern world that arbitration as a system side by side with the courts obtains in every country in the world where the rule of law obtains, provided, of course, that there is an appeal procedure.  Here we have an appeal procedure to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is precisely what was envisaged by Article 37 of the Constitution when it provided that limited functions of a judicial nature could be exercised by bodies outside the courts.  It envisaged statutory arbitration as it existed then in this country and as it has been extended since by <Col N="774" /> the 1954 Arbitration Act and as it obtains in every country in the world where the rule of law exists &mdash; a system of arbitration such as we envisage in the Bill.  It is a much less harmful position from Senator O'Quigley's point of view than that obtaining as a result of the legislation passed by a Government of lawyers in 1954. Lawyers, as a Government, know they have to govern and realise that government must go on.  These are all practical considerations I have been referring to.</P>
    <P>There is one other point and it might be no harm to mention it.  A lot of play was made during Committee Stage about the case of O'Farrell and Gorman.  There has been no other case along these lines since, though a disciplinary authority is exercised by a number of professional and trade associations.  In that case the phraseology used by the judge, Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, in deciding whether powers of this kind were proper to be exercised by the courts &mdash; I shall refer to the exact phraseology in a moment &mdash; shows he was thinking of very extreme cases affecting the fundamental liberties of the people.  He was referring to the Incorporated Law Society Disciplinary Committee and the test as to whether the exercise of such power must be limited.  I quote from the relevant portion of the judgment:</P>
    <P>The test as to whether a power is or is not limited in the opinion of the court lies in the effect of the assigned power when exercised.  If the exercise of the assigned powers and functions is calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching way the lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations of those against whom they are exercised, they cannot properly be described as &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That sort of situation bears no relation to the situation envisaged here in regard to the functions the county registrar will be exercising under this Bill.  Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore took the view that taking a solicitor's livelihood away from himself and his family for life was not a proper function to be exercised by a limited body like the Disciplinary Committee.  One could use that very <Col N="775" /> extreme language in order to bring that type of proceeding out of the limited category but one cannot equate it with the situation in this Bill which merely introduces another form of statutory arbitration as between contending parties on the matter of proper compensation, arising out of compulsory rights, to be given to a tenant.  It really extends, in a more modified way and more appropriately to what Senator O'Quigley has in mind, to all functions of compulsory acquisition by State and semi-State bodies and local authorities.</P>

Perhaps Senators on the other side thought of how well he dealt with the arguments made.

That is the present lawyers' Government, and good luck to them: they are probably a better Government than those which were not lawyers' Governments.  Lawyers have the merit of being in touch with a wide variety of people every day in the course of their practice.  I wish to make it quite clear that I am not concerned with costs for the legal profession and that that was not why I raised the question. It does not matter what fees one pays to an architect or the five per cent on a sale of £3,000 or £5,000 to an auctioneer.  Nobody question them. But when it comes to lawyers' fees, which are the only fees in the State regulated by law, then people think lawyers are out to gobble up their property.  That does not happen because it cannot happen.</P>

It received praise from us here, from me, in respect of certain aspects.  The Minister did not mention these aspects or this praise.  We agree this is an expeditious way to fix compensation.  However, nobody among tenants, valuers, auctioneers, has considered the constitutionality of appointing county registrars compulsorily to arbitrate on property values and property rights. The Minister said that was adverted to in the Dáil.  Is it not so that the Seanad exists to pick up the things the Dáil has not time to deal with?</P>

      <P>I have become sick of that.  I am praising the Minister for that but that does not get away from the fact that it is our business in this Chamber to look at those Bills, as they come from the Dáil, and then to do what we can with them.  It is entirely to the Minister's credit that we have made the kind of progress we have on this amendment and that this Bill will leave this House in a better condition than it was in when it came here.  If Senator O'Kennedy is concerned about this question of being in chambers, we will not vote on that and we will not move that amendment until later on.  We can leave that out if it will meet his objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county registrars will welcome this.  I have said before, and I want it to go on the records of this House, that if the county registrars are burdened with this work, so surely as a year and a day passes after they have begun to operate this, they will put in for increased salary from the Minister <Col N="778" /> for Justice because of the increased work of a judicial character which they have to perform under the Bill.  There is no doubt in the world about that. The county registrars have to work from 9 a.m. until 5 o'clock in the afternoon five days a week.  If their work increases, they are entitled to go to arbitration and they will be given an increase of salary.  Of course they want that.</P>
    <P>The district justices will welcome the increase in the jurisdiction of the district court because it gives them more responsible work.  When they have to do this extra work, they will be entitled to an increase in salary. Of course the county registrars welcome this and they object to any suggestions that they are not competent to do the work.  I am certain they did not do their work by reading all I had to say on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage in regard to this matter.  The criticism I made referred only to the position of the county registrars under this Bill.  I do not want to retract what I have said.  I am really concerned with the unsuitability of county registrars, whatever their abilities may be, to take on to themselves the judgments proposed to be given to them under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about statutory arbitration.  I do not know what that phrase means but the Minister seemed to define it in some way by referring to the Arbitration Act, 1954, enacted by a lawyers' Government.  Surely the Arbitration Act, 1954, has nothing whatever to do with this Bill?  The Arbitration Act, 1954, if the Minister looks at it, is merely concerned with the procedure to be employed in default of agreement under a different procedure between parties who have agreed to go to arbitration.  Under this Bill there is no such thing as agreement to go to arbitration.  The landlord says: &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the apportionment&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am not satisfied that you are entitled to this money&rdquo;.  That body find themselves before the county registrar but the Arbitration Act, 1954 section 2 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Arbitration agreement&rdquo; means <Col N="779" /> a written agreement to refer present or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named therein or not.</P>
    <P>It is when there is agreement between two parties to go to arbitration that the provisions of this Act come into operation in default of agreed machinery.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now talking about another thing, and I want to come to that.  In the case of property being compulsorily acquired by local authorities, everybody agrees that the public interest must always give way to private interests.  We all accept that as a principle in 1967.  That was accepted away back in 1919 and it was accepted in the days when railways and canals were first made.  It is not even Victorian; it is pre-Victorian. It is always accepted.  It is accepted in our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am really concerned in this particular Bill about defending the Constitution and defending the people's rights.  I want this House to appreciate that when you enact legislation of this kind, you are enacting legislation of a very dubious character.  When the Minister refers to compulsory arbitration in relation to property, he is referring to an Act which was enacted away back in 1919 and which fixed the price of land.  Mind you, the Minister, or his predecessor not such a short time ago had to go to the High Court in connection with the learned Judge Comyn and the Minister for Justice.  In order that Judge Comyn should have his compensation in relation to mines, which were taken over during the emergency, he referred to the Land Act, 1919.  In this case, under the 1919 Act, he would have got considerably less than what he would have got under a different approach to valuation if the valuation were decided by the court.  Therefore, when you are <Col N="780" /> talking about the 1919 Act, let it be understood that you are talking about an Act which in many respects is not fair to property owners.  I merely want to point out here that there is no virtue to be derived from saying that property may be valued under the 1919 Act.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minerals Development Bill which was passed in the early 1960s.  I moved an amendment to that Bill because I held the view that the small farmer with a valuation of £2 15s or £3 10s gained very little under it.  Therefore, there is nothing to be derived from the 1954 Act.  That is purely a machinery Act and it provides the procedure to be followed in default of agreement.  The Minister makes bold to say that county registrars are as well qualified in the law as judges in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I do not at all agree, not for a single moment, because judges and justices have to bring their minds to bear upon different types of legislation every day.  They have to deal with evictions, the Social Welfare Acts, offences of all types, in addition to road traffic and other matters of that sort. They are in contact with all types of people during their work.  A county registrar has nothing like the experience a district justice has.  I do not think they would claim that either.  They certainly could not substantiate it and I have little doubt that if the Minister's office were dealing at arbitration with county registrars, this argument would be adduced against the county registrars making their claim.  The important feature about the county registrar is that he can be approached and subjected to pressure.</P>

      <P>The distinction between a member of the judiciary and a county registrar is that one is sworn in accordance with the Constitution to uphold the law and administer justice in accordance with the law but the other takes no such oath.  The county registrar is entirely answerable to the Minister and the Government; the judges are not.  County registrars are bidden to go here, there and everywhere, if the Minister for Justice thinks fit.  He appoints them and he removes them from office with the concurrence of the Government.  No such thing can happen to judges whose tenure of office is secure under the Constitution.  That is the difference between district justices and justices of the other courts and county registrars.  There is no use in the Minister saying they are officers of the court.  That is a fine phrase but in terms of the law and the Constitution it means nothing.  A civil bill officer is also an officer of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to the O'Farrell and Gorman decision.  I did not bring in that decision today because I dealt with it last week.  I refrained from bringing it in because I hoped the Minister might accept the amendments suggested.  Now that he refers to the O'Farrell and Gorman decision, I want to make quite clear what that decision signified.  Once the determination of the inferior tribunal, in this case the Disciplinary Committee, was in relation to the status of a person, even though there was a right of appeal, as there was, to the High Court, they had <Col N="782" /> usurped the judicial function, and the section of the Act under which the Committee was established was repugnant to the Constitution.  What the Minister has read out from the judgment of the court, by Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, is only part of the judgment.  They referred also to Article 37 of the Constitution and very quickly decided that the Disciplinary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society could find no authority for its existence under that Article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My quotation was the key to the whole decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  That was the end result.  It did not argue that Article 37 justified the existence of the Disciplinary Committee as being a court or a body with limited functions, and the Supreme Court held that Article 37 did not apply to a decision of the Disciplinary Committee without any appeal determining the status of the solicitor.</P>
      <P>It is not right for the Minister to say that it took away that right.  These are florid phrases used by the Minister to give substance to his argument. There was a right of appeal and solicitors have often been suspended for three or six months and have been restored again.  Even though it was only suspending a solicitor for six months, that particular Committee would have been invalid, even though it was determining the status of its solicitor by striking him out for all time.</P>
      <P>I shall not go further into that.  I am quite satisfied that a case has been made for leaving this power where it belongs, the Circuit Court.  I hope Senators who agree with that view will give visible expression to their support of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, section 8 (2), between lines 48 and 49 to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply in the case of an infant or a person of unsound mind who is a ward of court or in the case of a bankrupt save with the leave of the Court having jurisdiction over the ward of court or bankrupt, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In section 8, we have now apparently decided that the county registrar will make the various determinations which fall to be made under the provisions of this Bill.  In section 8, the county registrar has been given authority to make orders which would cut across the jurisdiction of the President of the High Court who has the care of wards of court, whether they be infants or persons of unsound mind, or the Circuit Court where it has jurisdiction over such people.  I raised this matter on Committee Stage.  The Minister has an amendment down, No. 21, to deal with the same matter.  Unfortunately, in my amendment, I made no reference to the powers of the county registrar under section 14 and I think my amendment is defective to that extent.  However, I think that, equally, the Minister's amendment is defective inasmuch as he does not include a bankrupt.  The property of a bankrupt, once the order is made, vests in the official assignee and, as I understand the law of bankruptcy&mdash;and there seem to be very few people who know anything about it&mdash;that property can be dealt with thereafter only under order of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the county registrar can properly direct the official assignee to take £X for a lessor's interest in a particular property. It seems to me that as matters stand the county registrar is exercising in relation to property vested in the official assignee the same power as was given to him under the section as passed in Committee to deal with property of a ward of court.  There may be some explanation for that.  I certainly do not claim to be even knowledgeable, much less expert, in the law in relation to bankrupts.  There are very few people who are knowledgeable in that.  It seems to me from what I know that the county registrar will be exercising, or can exercise, powers which might conflict with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation here is that the official assignee is not a person under any legal disability.  He really does not arise under the section <Col N="785" /> at all, which is confined to people under a disability or people who refuse to convey the fee simple. Once this is a bankruptcy, there is automatic vesting in the official assignee and from there on he takes over, as it were.  There is no need for this procedure in the case of the official assignee.  He automatically comes in on bankruptcy taking place and from there on moves outside the scope of section 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation, as I understand it, is that the property vests in the official assignee where a person is declared to be a bankrupt by order of the court and thereafter while the official assignee is not under any disability he can act only in accordance with directions given to him from time to time by order of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is in this position, that he can act only under order of the court.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
      <P>Where any person who is required by this Act to convey or join in conveying the fee simple in land</P>
      <P>and afterwards it is provided where he will not convey&mdash;that is subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Where a person who is required by this Act to convey or join in conveying the fee simple in land is an infant or a person of unsound mind, or cannot be found or refuses or fails to execute such conveyance,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the county registrar may order him to convey.  As matters stand then, if the official assignee says, &ldquo;No.  I will not convey this property&rdquo;, the county <Col N="786" /> registrar can direct him to convey or he can appoint somebody else to do it.  That quite clearly gives the county registrar power to direct the official assignee who, in accordance with the law on bankruptcy, is liable to be directed only by the judge in bankruptcy. That is entirely clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what the Senator is getting at all right but the bankruptcy procedure is a separate procedure altogether.  There is automatic vesting in the official assignee on bankruptcy.  From there on the official assignee acts in regard to the property and subject to the direction of the court.  It is quite fantastic that the official assignee would not join in a conveyance when this Bill will require him to do so, subject of course to the overriding direction of the court.  The official assignee is, again, a court officer and acts under the bankruptcy judge and is subject to his directions. That situation is not being interfered with under section 8.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been put in to meet a point made on Committee Stage by Senator O'Quigley.  The effect of the amendment is that it proposes to enable a county registrar who feels that he cannot properly deal with a matter falling to be determined by his arbitration by reason of the fact that he has a personal interest therein or such personal knowledge of the facts or of the parties as might prejudice his determination of the matter, to nominate the county registrar for an adjoining county to handle it.  This is a practical way of dealing with the point raised by Senator O'Quigley.  I thought at the time there might be another way of dealing with it.  This is more appropriate having regard to the general scheme of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 52, to delete &ldquo;35, 36&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the light of the fact that the county registrar is now to be the determining authority, it seems to me to be desirable to have this amendment which proposes to retain sections 35 and 36 of the Arbitration Act in so far as it will apply to arbitrations under this section.  What sections 35 and 36 of the Arbitration Act provide is that the arbitrator shall, if so directed by the court, state any question of law arising in the course of the reference, or any award or any part of an award, in the form of a special case for the decision of the court.  I think it is desirable that the county registrar, acting as arbitrator under this Bill, should be empowered to state a case to the High Court for determination in the same way as an arbitrator in a private arbitration could state a case or would be directed to state a case under the Arbitration Act of 1954.</P>

      <P>Really there is not much between us.  It is a question of procedure.  Which is the better procedure? Under the Arbitration Act, as Senator O'Quigley rightly said, there is provision for appeal by way of case stated to the High Court.  Here we make provision under section 22 for an appeal to the Circuit Court.  Having regard to the general thinking behind the Bill, which is to make procedure in relation to assessment of compensation as inexpensive as possible, I think it is preferable to leave the very few cases that will arise by way of appeal from the county registrar to the Circuit Court since that will be more inexpensive than the High Court and so of greater benefit to the tenant.  On balance, I think it is the better procedure.</P>

      <P>What I have been seeking to do&mdash;it should be obvious from the amendments tabled&mdash;is to put beyond all shadow of doubt, in so far as that is humanly possible, what the law actually is, to state the law clearly and thereby keep down the costs of acquiring the fee simple from <Col N="789" /> the point of view of both the landlord and the tenant.  I grant you there is an appeal to the Circuit Court but the Circuit Court does not, unfortunately, make decisions which are binding on other Circuit Court judges.  A Circuit Court judge is not bound to follow a decision given by a colleague on a particular matter of law.  When the High Court makes a decision, that is binding on the whole country and everybody is bound by that decision, unless and until it is reversed.  It would bring certainty into the law here.</P>
      <P>There is a queer feeling abroad that law must be kept as cheap as possible. That is a mistaken idea.  There would be a great deal more certainty and much more clarity if a District Justice, for example, were allowed to go direct to the High Court to get a matter about which he was uncertain determined. In the Arbitration Act, it is provided that private parties may request an arbitrator to state a case to the High Court.  That is something upon which the arbitrator can make up his own mind.  It should be borne in mind, too, that the arbitrator will not state a case unless he has some difficulty with regard to the law.  Even in a matter such as the Rent Restriction Act, designed to meet the less well-off sections of the community, one would expect it to be drafted in such manner as to make the law as clear as possible, but one finds, in fact, that even judges of the High Court not infrequently, when hearing appeals, state a case for decision by the Supreme Court because of some uncertainty.  I am at the moment involved in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may puzzle the layman: what is a High Court judge paid for if he is not able to determine the law?  Very often there are different decisions, decisions shading into conflict with one another, and there is therefore this area of uncertainty.  It is in order to get clarity into the law once and for all that a judge of the High Court is empowered to state a case to the Supreme Court.  Such a power is needed much more in the case of an inferior tribunal, such as we are establishing under this measure, and, while it is all right to some extent to <Col N="790" /> provide for appeal to the Circuit Court, the county registrar, if he finds he takes one view and a colleague takes another view, should have power to state a case.  I do not think that would add to the expense because presumably whoever wants to have the case stated will pay the piper.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 6, after &ldquo;therein,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, as far as can be reasonably assessed, the justifiability of the amount of such rent at its date of origin,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (a) of section 18 reads:</P>
      <P>the purchase price shall, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, be the sum which, in the opinion of the county registrar conducting the arbitration, a willing purchaser would give and a willing vendor would accept for the fee simple or other interests having had regard to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a list then of the things to which regard must be had in the formation of any opinion and the first of these is the rent payable in respect of the land by the person acquiring the fee simple.  I should like to have included among the considerations which go to the forming of an opinion a consideration as to whether originally the ground rent was or was not a justifiable one.  In my opinion, one of the difficulties involved in framing an equitable measure of this kind is the fact that some of the ground rents, within the context of our system, are defensible.  There are, of course, countries which do without ground rents altogether and regard them as rather an old phenomenon.  Within the context of ground rents, as we know them, it would appear to me that there is a whole range between what I term the defensible ground rent, which constitutes a deferred payment of a capital sum, and the indefensible ground rent <Col N="791" /> which arises as the result of a speculative builder, contractor, or owner of land slapping on a quite unjustifiable ground rent and allowing it to continue forever unless the tenant agrees to buy him out under the very generous terms given by this Bill. I drew attention already, and I apologise for doing so again, to the Minister's statement on the Second Stage that the inflation in ground rents was a post-war phenomenon.  It is recognised by the Minister that after the war there was inflation in ground rents.  These rents, which he agrees were inflated by post-war conditions, by the shortage of housing, are continued to this day and I am contending that the arbitrator should have power to distinguish between these unjustifiably high ground rents and the more normal ground rent which really represents deferred payments of portion of the cost price, of the capital sum.  In other words, some ground rents are justifiable within our system and some are either partially or totally unjustifiable and represent racketeering levies on the tenant at the time of the sale of the house, levies representing an exploiting of the tenant, due to the post-war housing shortage for which the tenant was not responsible and for which he should not be held up to ransom.</P>
    <P>Since there are these two types of ground rents, it is inequitable that both types of ground landlord should be compensated at the same level, should be compensated fully in terms of the ground rent which either (a) has been a legitimate one and a reasonably small one or (b) has been a grossly inflated one from the start.  After all, if for 20 or 25 years a man has been paying a grossly inflated ground rent, he will think it no compliment for the Minister to say in his Bill: &ldquo;I am going to allow you to compensate your ground landlord in full for any loss of income which he might otherwise incur by making over to you the ground rent and transforming it into a fee simple holding&rdquo;.  He might well say: &ldquo;I have paid far too much down the years and it is quite unfair that this <Col N="792" /> man who exploited me should be put on a par with perfectly decent ground landlords whose rents are modest and defensible and represent nothing more than repayment of interest on money lent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore I am asking that the arbitrator be given certain discretionary powers in the formation of his opinion and, after all, it is his opinion that will be operative.  We tell him the factors he should take into account in forming his opinion and he should be told to have a look at, and as far as it can be reasonably assessed, to judge whether or not the original ground rent was justifiable and if so, how far was it fully or partially justified?  After all, in other legislation we have the concept of a court or arbitrator deciding what would constitute a fair rent and it is not impossible to assess it.  It may be more difficult in some cases than in others but the concept is there in other legislation.  The arbitrator in trying to determine whether the original ground rent was justifiable or not would view comparable property and similar sites going at about the same date at an equivalent price.  If he found rough equivalents of property and sites at an original price at about the same date and that there was a grave disparity as between two ground rents, that one was relatively modest and the other appeared to be grossly inflated, he should have the power to allow this factor to influence his opinion as to what would constitute a fair price now.</P>
    <P>He should have the power to decide whether the ground rent in the light of this particular factor was fully or only partially justifiable.  Under this Bill, within the context of our property ownership system, it can be agreed that fair compensation for money lent, which is what it amounts to, on fair terms might be granted to the ground landlord when it does represent that, but if it is apparent, after reasonable investigation and comparative assessment, that to a large extent the ground rent in question represents ill-gotten gains and not a justifiable rent in relation to money invested, then the compensation which this Bill will allow should be commensurately reduced by the arbitrator.  The racketeering <Col N="793" /> ground landlord should not be compensated on precisely the same terms as his fair-minded and fair-dealing ground landlord colleague with what we would regard as higher standards.</P>
    <P>In deciding the amount of the price for the ground rent, the arbitrator should be empowered to take into account the original justifiability of the ground rent as far as it can be reasonably assessed because, of course, it is not possible to get precision in these matters, any more than it is possible under other legislation to get precision in relation to the concept of what constitutes a fair rent.  However, my amendment would allow the arbitrator to take these matters into account and I feel we would be wise in adding this to the other considerations which he must take into account.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge the reasonableness of this amendment and to point out the obvious necessity for it.  I am not in a position to quote exact figures but it seems obvious to me that the overwhelming majority of ground rents have been long established. In the context, that may well be regarded as very reasonable, but on the other hand, we also know that in recent years&mdash;in fact, the Minister mentioned this question&mdash;a certain amount of exploitation has gone on in the development of land for building purposes especially.  I think in many of these cases it would be found that the ground rent assessed is anything but reasonable and therefore there is a strong necessity for some amendments of this type that would draw the obvious distinction between a fair ground rent and an obviously unfair figure.  I strongly urge acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the theory behind this amendment is a very good one.  I see only one difficulty, and it is: what happens where the original owner of the ground rent has sold his ground rent to some other investor?  Under the terms of the amendment, this innocent investor who came much later into the whole business would now be penalised. He would not have been the person who imposed a severe ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> It might be a widow or it might be anyone at all who quite innocently is now the owner of the ground rent but the effect of the amendment would be that this innocent person would suffer just the same as the racketeer referred to by the Senator in proposing the amendment. Everyone has great sympathy with this but I think it should not be done in any way that would injure the innocent.  It is a point that should have arisen in regard to an amendment by the Senator and I think he has one on similar lines about the amount of compensation to be given.  I always understood that it was better that ten guilty persons should escape rather than that one innocent one should suffer.  I am quite sure this is the sort of thing that Senator Sheehy Skeffington would very nearly go to the scaffold for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the thinking behind Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment, but in drafting legislation we have to be, above all else, practical and ensure that whatever legislation we pass here works.  There is much we would like to do, much that would probably be, in strict terms of justice, the right thing to do, but the practicality of doing it is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> I should just like to illustrate a few obvious difficulties that would arise in the event of the Senator's amendment being included.  It might be a greater burden on the tenant than having twice the purchase price imposed on him, because the amount of costs and research expenses involved in seeking to prove the justifiability of the amount of rent at the date of origin, involving an appalling amount of investigation, would render the matter a fruitless exercise.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking to do in this Bill is to provide for the great majority of tenants a system whereby guidelines are laid down and they know where they stand.  We envisage that in most cases a simple exchange of letters will settle the amount of compensation. There is no point in trying to pursue the ideal; indeed in pursuing the ideal, as I have said, the expense involved might be greater than the amount to be gained.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there are other difficulties.  One has to take the circumstances in which the ground rent was originally created.  The arrangements between landlord and tenant vary considerably.  There could be a high rent, for instance, but that might be in consideration of a small fine or no fine.  The landlord and tenant may have agreed that it was better business for each of them to have a higher ground rent where, possibly, the tenant might not have been able to afford a high amount by way of fine. That is a practical example of how many high ground rents have been created.  If you go right back to the past, you can meet tremendous difficulty. If you go back to Strongbow and investigate in what manner ground rents were created and to whom the land should be given back which was acquired by the original Pembroke Estate, that might cause a lot of historical research and might not bring any good.  In practice the way we propose here is, I think, the best way. There is no point in going back to the past.  There may or may not have been injustices in the creation of ground rents, but an investigation into how the matter originally started <Col N="796" /> would be expensive and might be fruitless in many cases.</P>
    <P>It is my experience, and the experience of legislators over the years, that refined justice and precise justice does not often work out in practice. If we seek to make legislation overprecise, we are into the field of morality.  There may be unjust profits involved.  But if you go into morality in any question of drafting legislation, you are in serious trouble.  To my mind, it is better to be practical, lay down the guidelines, make the legislation simple, effective, as inexpensive as possible, and avoid fruitless investigation into the past.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment.  He makes the point that in order sometimes to legislate we must take into account not only the desirability of the piece of legislation proposed but also the question as to whether we are quite sure it will work.  The amendment I am asking to have adopted is simply to add one more consideration <Col N="797" /> to the quite large number of considerations which the arbitrator must have in his mind when he forms an opinion as to the price a willing purchaser would give and a willing vendor accept.  This is not aiming at precision or at laying some mandatory obligation upon the arbitrator but merely drawing his attention, as it were, to the fact that some ground rents are less justifiable than others. The Minister has drawn our attention to the danger of wanting to apply strict justice and he makes a very sharp distinction, if I understood him correctly, between justice and the law and he recognises that the law in general has nothing to do with morality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the Minister.  It seemed to me that he was asking us to forget about strict justice and not to try to legislate simply on the ground of morality but to take a more pragmatic approach and ask ourselves: &ldquo;Would it work?&rdquo;; we should forget the past and just apply a piece of legislation which will give the same compensation to the good and the bad ground landlord.  That is just precisely what I had hoped we would not have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentions&mdash;it is not really relevant and I am surely aware of it &mdash; the possibility that the ground rent might be very high because it was, in fact, the equivalent of a deferred payment of a loan of a big capital sum. <Col N="798" /> This could be almost all in lieu of a fine.  This would be obvious to the arbitrator, if it were reasonably assessed, and would not lead to any injustice. The arbitrator would recognise that this rent, though appearing high, was, in fact, justifiable and I am asking that the arbitrator should have his attention called to this fact that some ground rents are unjustifiably high and have, in the words of the Minister himself, been inflated by post-war conditions.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheldon mentioned that it might be very far from the original ground rent, that it might be some later investor, some innocent investor, who was involved, but this, I suggest, in a permissive amendment such as mine, would be taken into account by the arbitrator in question when he tries to establish what would be a fair price in his opinion, and it is his opinion, based on a variety of views to which I should like to add the having of some regard in so far as it is reasonably feasible, for the original justifiability of the ground rent; in other words, to the basic justice involved.  It seemed to me that in proposing this amendment, I was avowing a method whereby recognition would be given that some ground rents are excessive while others can be quite legitimately defended within the terms of the present system.  I should like, therefore, to press the amendment and stress the fact that this is simply to draw the attention of the arbitrator to another aspect of what constitutes a ground rent and that it is permissive and not mandatory.</P>

In practical terms, this means I am suggesting that the compensation for any given ground rent should not be 13.2 years purchase but something nearer to ten years purchase.  I proposed, on Committee Stage, that it be brought down to half, which would have been about seven and a half years purchase.  This was rejected by the Seanad and it was interesting to see the phalanx of the two big conservative Parties joining forces together in defence of the sacred rights of the ground landlords of this country.  I would rather fear, though I remain optimistic, we may get the same kind of union of strength behind the ground landlords on the part of the two big Parties even on this modest proposal of mine.  If the Minister does not concede that seven and a half years purchase is enough, he might at least agree that ten years purchase is ample.  I would suggest that very few tenants will see any advantage in buying out their present ground rent at the rate of 13.2 years purchase, plus all the costs of the conveyance falling upon the tenant.</P>
      <P>It might well be that we are wasting our time passing this Bill, because the number of tenants who will avail themselves of the opportunity to buy out the ground rent will be very small, owing to the exorbitant price enshrined in the Bill, this 13.2 years purchase.  I do see an exception to this possibility that not many will take advantage of it, that is, of course, in the case of tenants where the ground lease is due to fall in soon, within 20 or 25 years, or less.  In that case, tenants will be tempted, even at this high price but, otherwise, I would be inclined to suggest that tenants on the whole would be ill-advised to buy out their ground landlords because they are being offered the fee simple at a very exorbitant price, 13.2 years purchase.</P>
      <P>The amendment implies that the terms offered to the tenant must be improved, must be made attractive.  I think ten years purchase is quite dear enough and unless we make the terms more attractive to the tenants, they will be reluctant to buy or to take any advantage of this Bill whatsoever. The Minister, on Committee Stage, indicated that he was convinced that ground rents, after the passage of this Bill, would, as it were, wither away and felt optimistic enough to believe that within ten years, perhaps there would be no such thing, or very few, left in the country.  I believe, on the contrary, that very few ground rents will be bought out under this Bill in its present terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is fairly obvious that quite a lot of new ground rents will be created every year and so far from the Bill in its present terms, encouraging the whole system of ground rents to wither away, it will be bolstering it up all the more.  I wish, therefore, to press this amendment which, in effect, reduces the purchase price of a ground rent from 13.2 years purchase <Col N="801" /> to ten years purchase, which, as I have said, is ample.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same objections, among others, to this amendment as I had to the last amendment proposed by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, on the ground that it will catch everyone, good and bad original landlords who charge exorbitant rents, innocent purchasers, and everyone else.  In answer to my argument on the previous amendment, Senator Sheehy Skeffington said: &ldquo;But I am only asking for discretion.  All this could be taken into consideration.&rdquo; That does not apply in this case because there is no discretion.  In so far as he answered my argument at all on the previous amendment, his answer does not apply in this case.  I have been trying to make out how 7½ is half of 13.2 and so far I have not discovered how it is.  It was a slip of the tongue I am sure.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty I see is that this is not fair to the innocent legitimate owner of a ground rent.  It would catch a landlord who imposed an exorbitant ground rent and was still the owner, but if he had sold it, the innocent purchaser would suffer.  In the same way, ground rents which were not exorbitant would be caught as well.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington says he does not think the terms of the Bill are attractive and that 13.2 years is an unattractive figure.  I would say that 13.2 years is about the best figure. There seems to be a tendency at the moment for interest rates to drop.  If interest rates drop, the number of years purchase will go up.  At present the interest rates are all against the landlord and not the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not agree that 13.2 is unfavourable. I would say you would probably be very lucky to get it because interest rates are dropping slightly and 14 might be nearer to the normal figure by the time this Bill becomes law.  Most of the talk I heard in the past about ground rents was based on a much worse figure.  People were quite glad to come to an agreement with the landlord on the basis of 16, 17 or 18 years purchase.  I think the tenants should be strongly advised <Col N="802" /> not to listen to Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  While the interest rates are high, now is the time to buy them out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to urge the House to listen to Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this point because I think he has made a very good attempt to bring home to the House one of the weaknesses in the Bill.  He made the point that we are not writing into this Bill any incentive or encouragement to anyone to buy out his ground rent.  I should like to advert to one consideration which obviously must arise, but which has not been alluded to by anyone since this debate began, that is, the fact that apart from the very high rate of purchase, 13.2 years, a tenant will also have to bear in mind &mdash; and it is only right that we should remind him &mdash; that once he has decided to buy out the fee simple, he automatically becomes liable for Schedule A tax.  This will automatically be payable in the future by the owner of the fee simple.</P>
      <P>I should like to share Senator Sheldon's optimism about the level of the ground rents but, candidly, I think he has his facts a little mixed. I can recall, within a reasonable time, when the level of ground rents was running around 11 and 12 years purchase. That is not a very long time ago.  It is only since the early 50s that they have risen to anything like their present level.  They seem to have reached their peak now.  If you put yourself in the position of a tenant with a ground rent of £15, which is about the average that young people are obliged to pay for the honour of living in a house, and also has to produce a sum of £250 or thereabouts if he is interested in buying the ground rent, and must thereafter pay Schedule A tax on top of that, I do not think you will find that is an attractive proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I was most enthusiastic about the introduction of legislation for this purpose, quite frankly I have come to the view that in this Bill, at any rate, we are not providing the answer to the problem.  We are not disposing of ground rents as such.  We are perpetuating the system for a long <Col N="803" /> time to come.  We are not giving any encouragement to people who have a desire to become the owner of the bit of land on which their houses are built.  I strongly appeal to the House to listen to Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this amendment and to support it.</P>

      <P>We in Belmullet wanted to buy out our ground rents and after a lot of haggling and bargaining, we bought them on 10½ years purchase and we thought we did very well.  Our landlord was very reasonable I must say.  We eventually agreed to 10½ years purchase.  The legal costs were admittedly very high but this is a matter that deserves consideration at this time.  I wish to be honest and say that I have not heard any complaints about this Bill.  Since that effort in Belmullet things have worked reasonably satisfactorily and I commend everyone affected to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill.  Things have not changed radically in ten years and if we bought at 10½ years purchase ten years ago, 13.2 years or 14 years would not be out of the way today.  I am just giving my experience in my own town and assuring the Seanad that we have had no complaints or very few.  I, therefore, strongly advise anyone who comes under the terms of the Bill to avail of it and purchase his ground rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Seanad on Committee Stage decided this matter by 32 votes to six.  Therefore, like the majority of Senators I see no merit in the amendment.  I am as anxious as Senators Crowley and Sheehy Skeffington to see a proper system of ground rent purchase and to ensure that this system of tenancy will disappear.  Already the signs are that it is disappearing with the knowledge that this Bill is in draft and that it has been discussed in both Houses: people are getting out of ground rents and there is a general effort by landlords to get rid of them to such an extent that deflation is setting in in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out now that this <Col N="804" /> 13.2 years is not a mandatory purchase figure.  It is the maximum.  The phrase used in section 8 (b) is that the compensation price shall not exceed the formula price &mdash; this will encourage more and more arrangements of the sort Senator Lenehan cited: landlords will have to come in and deal with their tenants.  Where the landlord has to convince hundreds of tenants of his need to sell, in any such package deal the compensation price will be considerably below 13.2 years purchase The 13.2 figure is the price which will decide the recalcitrant landlord to deal. In such a case it is legitimate and desirable to fix a ceiling which will adequately compensate the landlord for a right which he does not want to yield.  Surely we should give him sufficient to enable him to maintain his income by investing in a type of security traditionally equated with ground rents &mdash; Government stock.  If you have a willing tenant and an unwilling landlord it is only right to compensate the landlord adequately.</P>

      <P>And you horse-traded him down to 10½ years.  The landlord in Belmullet wanted 16 years purchase and they horse-traded him down to 10½ years.  If that happened ten years ago it is only reasonable to assume that the maximum of 13.2 years provided in the Bill will work out at ten years or even eight years in negotiation.  As to the purchase price of ground rents, immediately after the war it was 25 years purchase but prices have been gradually depressed since then particularly since this Bill was introduced.  Senator Sheldon mentioned people who were not creators of ground rents but purchasers of them.  Often they involve charitable institutions who have invested in ground rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some institutional investors in ground rents bought them immediately after the war for 20 years to 25 years purchase.  I have been speaking about inflated ground rents <Col N="805" /> in that sense &mdash; not in the sense of the tenant paying a higher ground rent but in the sense that there was an inflationary market in ground rents. Some twenty years ago ground rents were seen as a good source of institutional and private investment.  The market fluctuated between 25 years and 20 years purchase and a good many institutions and individuals bought at these prices.  Now they are being brought down to a maximum of 13.2 years.  The principal point to note here is that the formula provision, which works out on current rates at 13.2 years, is a maximum and will encourage landlords to get out of ground rents.</P>
      <P>We shall have many arrangements for group purchase of ground rents during the next few years.  All the advice I have got is to that effect.  All the advice I have got from every person I have interviewed is that once this Bill becomes law ground rents will go, that it is only a matter of time.  That is my feeling also because common sense dictates this will be so once you have this compulsory right of purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Sheldon that here there is no discretionary power being asked for, that this, to use his phrase, will catch everybody as it were, I am fully aware of this and recognise that in suggesting something less, ten years purchase, I may be unjust to some tenants and unjust to some ground landlords.  What I object to is the principle in the Bill as at present drafted making absolutely sure that no ground landlord will lose anything by it.  His income has to be protected and he does not have to pay even a portion of the costs.  Whether his ground rent was justified, whether it was a racketeering one or a modest one, he will be paid down to the last penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing ten years purchase, I feel I am making a big concession because many tenants have paid over and over.  Senator Lenehan said that ten years ago they arranged in Belmullet for the buying out of ground rents and it is obvious that if similar <Col N="806" /> arrangements had been made ten years ago throughout the country all tenants would have by now bought out.  Now we are told the purchase price will amount to something like 13 years. Senator Sheldon pulled my leg about the 7½ years I mentioned and pointed out that this is not half of 13.2.  What I had in mind during the Committee Stage debate was what the Minister had in mind on Second Reading when he mentioned 14.8 years.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that 14.8 years was mentioned by the Minister as the ceiling.  I am aware that the figure will vary and I said on Committee Stage that 7½ was half of the upper figure having in mind the Minister's figure of 14.8.</P>
    <P>What I am now asking is ten years purchase and this seems to be fair all round.  Deputy Sheldon referred to innocent investors &mdash; I am surprised he did not mention widows and orphans because there is a great preoccupation nowadays with widows and orphans who turn out to be the main owning class in the country.  I remember that when we were talking about derelict sites it was pointed out that practically every derelict site in the country was owned by widows and orphans.  This preoccupation with widows and orphans seems to be more prevalent on this Bill.  I am not convinced that ten years purchase would do an injury solely to the landlord.  I feel it is too high a figure for many tenants but it would at least be a compromise and would provide some incentive, as Senator Crowley said, to tenants to buy out their ground rents.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenehan, quite rightly, spoke about legal costs.  Of course, the legal costs under this Bill fall entirely on the tenant.  I quite agree with Senator Lenehan that it could transpire in many cases that the legal costs would be very high.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the Bill which would prevent the landlord from making a present to the tenant but the understanding <Col N="807" /> under this Bill is that the cost would be paid by the tenant.  The picture painted by the Minister of landlords anxious to sell, and being beaten down by horse trading well below the maximum of 13.2 years purchase, is something which I am afraid I cannot see.  I am afraid this is an illusion.  The Minister also says that ground rents will disappear under this Bill but I am afraid he is deluding himself when he says that.  I regret that the basic preoccupation in the Bill, as it stands unamended, would appear to be that whatever else is sacrificed the ground landlord must be protected and must not lose a single penny.  For that reason I wish to press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for recommitting this is that it was not substantially raised on Committee Stage.  We had a look at the section since the Committee Stage and have devised those three amendments to tighten up the prohibition proposed by section 30 of the Bill on ground landlords confining lessees to insuring with a particular company or through a particular agent.  The object of the section is, of course, to prevent a situation in which a lessee who wishes to borrow money subsequently from another insurance company will find that he may have to insure twice.  I do not want this prohibition avoided by the device of the lessor putting the restriction to a particular company or agent in a separate contract or by providing, not that the lessee shall insure with a specified insurer or agent, but with any insurer or agent to be selected or approved of by the lessor.  This amendment should stop these two particular loopholes.  At the same time, I do not want the extension proposed by the amendment to be so wide as to bring in mortgage contracts which are independent of the granting of the lease, and these are, therefore, being excluded.  The important thing is to make sure that collateral agreements are included here in the prohibition. That is the reality of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the text of this amendment.  I have always thought it a particular imposition and something in the nature of an impertinence on the part of landlords to have the right to prescribe the insurance company with which tenants must insure, and that failure to do so would probably mean the forfeiture of the lease.  That, to my mind, was one of the irritating things of a lease which needed to be rectified.  I am glad to see that this Bill is doing that.  One can, however, see that in ancient times landlords, because of all the maligning <Col N="810" /> statements which had been made about them, had some justification for nominating the insurance company.  In those days insurance companies were not as well prepared as they are in recent times.  I begin to wonder whether or not insurance companies, who are falling like ninepins in England at the present time, are as good as they were.  The onus was on the landlord about insurance companies and if an insurance company collapsed that was his business.</P>
      <P>In modern times and in an economy that watches its affairs apparently somewhat better than our neighbours in the matter of insurance &mdash; though we have had that unfortunate experience with the Equitable Insurance Company &mdash; perhaps this restriction is not so necessary.  For that reason I support it. In fact, I think this restriction was put in not so much at the behest of landlords as at the behest of people who were drafting the laws, who were in fact agents for the particular insurance company.  I do not think it removes from landlords any protection and I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is another amendment of section 32 which was amended in earlier stages in the Dáil and Seanad.  When the House accepted an amendment to section 32 of the Bill on Committee, I expressed the hope that we had now got down to a final <Col N="811" /> draft of this section which is intended to secure that no party to a lease shall be obliged to pay the solicitors' costs of the other party to the lease.</P>
      <P>That is the intention.  It has been pointed out to me that, as the section stands, it would extend to mortgages by subdemise which are in the form of leases though only so because mortgages of this kind have some advantages over mortgages by assignment. It was not the intention of the Law Society, which pressed for the inclusion of this provision in the first instance, that it should cover mortgages but, rather, the ordinary kind of lease.  Accordingly I propose in this amendment to exclude from the application of the section mortgages by subdemise.</P>

      <P>Now that we have come to the Final Stage and the end of the Bill, there are a few matters I should like to say about the Bill and what it contains.  It will be generally agreed that we have had a good debate on the Bill.  There were 51 amendments put down on Committee Stage and 47 on Report Stage.  I estimate that about 35 amendments have been made to the Bill during its passage through this House.  For that we on all sides of the House can take a share of credit.  It would be ungracious of me were I not to pay tribute to the Minister for the manner in which he has met a number of amendments. Everybody in the House, though we have not got all the amendments we would like, appreciates the manner in which the Minister has met these amendments.  He has had the open-mindedness to depart from the original text of the Bill as passed by the Dáil after a good debate and has acceded, in some measure at any rate, to the wishes of the House.  I can only regret that the Minister is so weighted down with <Col N="812" /> Ministerial advice that he will not follow his own good sense in relation to matters of principle.  I believe that as a politician if the Minister were to shake off the shackles imposed on him by the cautious advisers who surround him, he would be a far better Minister.</P>

      <P>I agree, but he comes into this House and mentions the names of certain identifiable officials.  Perhaps it is not good parliamentary practice but I do not want to dwell on it.  Speaking for my colleagues, we appreciate the manner in which the Minister has met a number of matters we suggested.</P>
      <P>The Bill, to my mind, is almost the last stage in the campaign long waged in this country to make people owners of their land.  In this Bill we are going a stage further in making most dwelling-owners or giving them the opportunity to become, as far as the law can make them, full owners of their dwellings, and we are extending that to a number of businesses.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the view expressed by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others, that this Bill, because of the financial provisions in it, is so costly that it is not worth anything to a great number of persons who hold no leases.  The contrary is the position. The Senator may perhaps be excused for expressing that view because there are other things which this Bill will enable the owners of leasehold premises to do which up to now they could not do.  Most of the leases drawn up by landlords long ago, and indeed by modern landlords, were carefully drawn in the interests of the landlord. The lease was prepared by the landlord and the tenant paid for it.  We have rectified that in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these leases there were restrictions, so that if a person wanted to <Col N="813" /> do anything with his property, even with the walls inside, he found he was prevented from doing that by covenants in the lease.  The Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, provided that in certain cases there should be written into the lease that the consent of the landlord should not be unreasonably withheld. Very often that involved people going into court.  With this Bill all these restrictive covenants go and people become full owners of their property and are able to do all these things, subject only to the restrictions imposed on them by the Town Planning Authority. There are a wide variety of things they can do which up to now they could not lawfully do, or do only at risk so long as they remained tenants.</P>
    <P>We should go forth from this House on the passage of this Bill in the knowledge that it confers wide benefits, much wider than not having to pay ground rent.  It makes people full owners and gives them greater freedom to develop their property than they had heretofore.  If a person owns a house at the present time, it is for use as a dwelling only.  If it happens to be the much talked about widow, she cannot take in a boarder without the written consent of the landlord.  All these restrictions will go once the fee simple in the property is acquired.  I hope that message will go across to all persons who have to pay ground rent at the present time so that they will reap the benefits of this Bill in a form more advantageous than in terms of £s.d.</P>

      <P>They are.  They relate directly to the attitude we adopt to landlords in the past and in the future.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington who apparently was all against landlords saw a defect in the Bill.  He was all in favour of them as far as the future is concerned and wanted to give them compensation where I would give them none.  This is one of the anachronisms that developed in the course of the debate.  On another occasion someone suggested that the Fine Gael Party and <Col N="814" /> the Fianna Fáil Party were a great conservative Party coalescing together. That, of course, is not so.  You have the Fianna Fáil Party at other times saying that Fine Gael and Labour are the Coalition Parties.  The only thing to be deduced from that is that, wherever there is reason, you find people coming along to Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and siding with them.  The Minister and his Department will, I am sure, have a close look at the operation of and the manner in which this Bill works out in practice.  There remains the problem of future ground rents which is left dangling for future action under the provisions of this Bill.  I hope that, in time, the Minister &mdash; and more particularly his colleague, the Minister for Local Government &mdash; will take the appropiate action to provide that the scarce commodity of land in the vicinity of Dublin and other towns will be made available at reasonable prices for the building of houses, shops and other necessary structures of that kind. I think that the question of the price of land, equally with the prices of other commodities, requires Government action if the matter is not to get out of hand.  In so far as this Bill permits the creation of future ground rents, I hope the Minister and his colleagues in the Government &mdash; for whatever short time they will be there&mdash; will take note of these developments and take appropriate action when that is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the best we can do with this Bill.  In many ways, it is a great experiment. We have all had our say upon the Bill.  It may well turn out that there are defects in it.  If they do manifest themselves in any short space of time, I trust that if the Minister is still Minister for Justice he will not hesitate to come into this House about the matter.  I am all for experimenting within reasonable limits.  I am sure no Member of the House will blame the Minister if it becomes apparent that amendments to this Bill are necessary.  If they are, we ought to have them at the earliest possible <Col N="815" /> date that a sizeable number of them, or any important one of them, become clearly necessary.</P>
    <P>The amendment which has been made to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1860, Deasy's Act, is one which will be received with universal approval by the legal profession.  They know the unconscionable use made of it in the past by landlords and the tremendous hardship that has been caused to tenants because of the provisions that were contained in sections 10 and 18.  I rather gathered at some stage that the amendment to Deasy's Act was not in order having regard to the Bill as read a Second Time.  I rather gather that that was an interpretation that was open to the Cathaoirleach in deciding upon these matters.  At the same time, this amendment will be very welcome.  It may not be the best amendment possible to these particular sections but I think it should be borne in mind that it is the best that can be done in a short space of time and pending the more widespread amendments and the more through and far-reaching amendments that we hope will be the result of the deliberation of the commission which is at present sitting to consider general landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for their help on this Bill.  Legislation of this kind is very proper to Committee Stage debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Any legislation concerned with the property rights of people needs to be looked at very carefully.  That is what the Oireachtas is for.  I think we should welcome constructive amendment of such legislation.  We had constructive proposals on this Bill, particularly in relation to what Senator O'Quigley stated at the end of his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Seanad that this is a new departure.  There may be difficulties in the operation of the Bill, when enacted, but they are difficulties that can be remedied fairly quickly. I intend to come forward within the next 12 months with further landlord and tenant legislation arising out of the present commission's deliberations. <Col N="816" /> I expect an interim report very shortly from them on certain improvements to Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  The intention, then, is to have a comprehensive Act dealing with all the landlord and tenant laws since Deasy's Act, 1860.  It is very necessary that we should have that at this stage because modern society is finding that our present landlord and tenant legislation does not entirely equate with our present needs.</P>
    <P>There is no question here of my being influenced by over-cautious advisers.  The main point of difference in this House involved Senator O'Quigley advocating the retention of a court system and my advocating a form of statutory arbitration by county registrars.  That was a new departure whereas Senator O'Quigley was advocating the old conservative, retain-the-present, approach.  I was personally involved in the decision to have arbitration.  It will make for a more expeditious and less expensive procedure which will be to the benefit of the tenant.  There was no question of my advisers being in on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Export Promotion Acts, 1959 to 1963.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable it to continue its work of promoting Irish exports.  The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála was established, limited the total amount of grants to which the Board was entitled to £1 million.  The amending Act of 1963 increased this sum to £2,500,000.  By the end of the last financial year, grants made to the Board and amounted to £2,081,000, leaving a balance of £419,000, which is not sufficient to meet its requirements for the current year at the existing rate of expenditure. <Col N="817" /> This Bill proposes to raise the limit to £4,500,000.  I am confident that the House will agree that Córas Tráchtála has made a valuable contribution to the expansion of exports in recent years and that it will support the provision of further funds to enable it to continue its work for the development of exports.  In recommending that provision be made for an additional sum of £2 million, I am having regard to the part Córas Tráchtála is expected to play in the promotion of exports over the next few years and particularly to the fact that the development of the Irish economy depends to a great extent on the achievement of increased exports.</P>
      <P>The next aim of the measure is to give Córas Tráchtála power to borrow for capital expenditure.  This will enable the Board to borrow the sum required for the capital expenditure on Ireland House, London.  The existing legislation empowers the Board to dispose of premises or portions of premises not required for their own use.  The Bill gives power to the Board to alter premises in order to facilitate their disposal.  This will remove doubts entertained regarding the Board's legal power to alter premises to facilitate their disposal by way of letting or otherwise.</P>
      <P>As part of its general assignment of promoting, assisting and developing exports, Córas Tráchtála was given the task in 1960 of promoting and assisting improvement in the standard of design in Irish industry.  In furtherance of this responsibility Córas Tráchtála, in 1963, set up Kilkenny Design Workshops, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, operating a number of design workshops for the production of well-designed prototypes for industry.  The work being done in Kilkenny is already proving to be of value to Irish industry, not alone in export markets but also in the home market.  Another purpose of the Bill is to make it clear that the statutory powers and functions of Córas Tráchtála include the promotion and assistance of improvement in the standard of industrial design whether for home or for export purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> Apart from the major proposal in the Bill to provide an additional £2 million for Córas Tráchtála, the Bill is largely a tidying-up measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, of course, one of the Bills which one has pleasure in welcoming here because Córas Tráchtála is one of our State bodies which has been particularly effective in its work and the provision of additional funds for its work is something, therefore, which we have no difficulty in supporting.  I have myself had contacts with Córas Tráchtála in different capacities: providing statistics to the Board, seeking market research grants in connection with market research projects, in connection with Adaptation Council work, and I must say that in all the contacts I have had with the Board, I found it efficient and imaginative in its approach to problems that do require imagination.</P>
      <P>I think it a pity that in introducing a Bill such as this the Minister has followed what seems to be the standard practice in a Second Stage debate of limiting himself very much to the terms of the Bill.  Certainly, his explanation of the Bill is, as usual, adequate and competent and gives us what we need to know about the reasons for it but it seems a pity that he did not take the opportunity of introducing the Bill to say more about export policy, about how he sees Córas Tráchtála developing, about its development programmes for the next five years, which it has published at the back of its annual report, about its role in securing diversification of Irish exports so that they are not concentrated solely in the UK market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A debate like this provides an opportunity for this and this tradition by which Ministers confine themselves in opening the debate rather rigidly to the terms of the Bill and, in replying to the debate, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the Minister and what kind of form he is in, I suppose, reply more widely to the matters raised in the debate, is not entirely satisfactory. A House of the Oireachtas is entitled to hear the Minister's views on <Col N="819" /> broad policy when introducing a Bill of this kind, before the debate, and not to hear them, perhaps, after the debate or perhaps not, depending on how wide-ranging the debate has been and on the Minister's predilections in replying to it.  Ministers frequently speak of these matters of policy in other places and at other times.  They ought to make more use of the opportunity provided by debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss these general policy matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister, indeed, could have reviewed our progress in the field of exports and given us some idea of how he regards the Córas Tráchtála contribution to this progress.  I think it has been important.  It has not, of course, been the only factor.  Even had the Board not been there, we would have achieved expansion in exports over recent years, including exports both by established firms and new firms, but I believe its contribution to the expansion of exports has been significant, that it has helped Irish firms to a more sophisticated approach to exporting, more appropriate to modern conditions, and without the Board, our export progress would have been much less than it has been.  It has, indeed, been impressive over this period. Over the past ten years, exports of manufactured goods have risen 7½ times, from £12 million to £90 million. This is something of which any country could be proud.  It is a remarkable achievement and, as I say, to which Córas Tráchtála has made its contribution.</P>
    <P>One irritating feature of the information we have about our exports is that in respect of more than a quarter of our exports, we are in the unique position in the world of not having any accurate information about the nature of these exports or where they are sent to.  It may be Rhodesia for the amount of information one can get in any detail about the exports from Shannon Free Airport, which has been a remarkable success.  Almost £29 million worth are exported from Shannon without any adequate record being kept of them.  The reason for <Col N="820" /> this is, of course, that these firms have come to Shannon Airport because there they will find, among other things, a situation in which they are free from the formalities of customs on imports and of filling up forms in regard to exports. This is one of the attractions of Shannon.</P>
    <P>One does not want to do away with that and to weaken the power of Shannon to attract outside industries but it does seem that we could do more than we are doing in order to document the activities at Shannon Airport.  All the information we have is an annual figure prepared by the Statistics Office with the co-operation of firms at Shannon &mdash; a global figure of total exports, more recently augmented by some indication of the volume of imports of material coming in to be processed at Shannon.  There are no details of their nature or where they are going to, no attempt to assess whether the progress of Irish export trade is inhibited.  We cannot say how exports of a particular kind are going. There is no information at Shannon as to how trade is going with particular countries.  There is no information on this one-quarter of our exports. We cannot say how export trade is going in various kinds of products because there is no indication of the amount and the nature of the products exported from Shannon.  It is a pity that more is not done in this connection. The Statistics Office collects information quarterly from firms at Shannon but if we want to assess progress in the export field we need rather more in the way of information in respect of these exports.</P>
    <P>There are obvious difficulties &mdash; disclosure of confidential information in respect of the work of individual firms&mdash;although this feature of our present exports does not apply to an article produced in Ireland by only one firm, for example a fork truck manufactured by Steinbock Limited, at Galway.  We have full details of the activities of that factory because this type of machinery is separately distinguished. That is true of many exports in which there is only one factory involved and there is no difficulty <Col N="821" /> as regards disclosure, as if they were secret munitions or something, because there is only one firm producing them.  That information is already available in our export statistics.  This should not be such an inhibiting or limiting factor in the publication of statistics in respect of Shannon.</P>
    <P>It would not matter if Shannon were an unimportant source of exports. It is now producing over one-quarter of our manufactured exports and the absence of adequate data in respect of these is a most unfortunate and extraordinary feature of this country's export trade.</P>
    <P>One wonders, indeed, and I should like to ask the Minister, whether the activities of Shannon Airport are included or not in our export targets for the Second Programme.  We have in that programme specific export targets and I should have thought that the exports from Shannon would have been included in this, or counted against it, because if the Government expect to meet the target, they had better put them in since they will form a large part of the total by 1970.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Córas Tráchtála report a graph published showing the trend of exports <i>vis-à-vis</i> the target. From what I understand of that graph, it seems to me it does not include the Shannon figures, with the result that we are shown as falling below the export target in 1965.  There is no need to make things look worse than they are and, if the Shannon activity is to be part of our export programme, and if it is to represent some part of the achievement in relation to the target in the Second Programme, then we should be clear about that and we should have adequate information in respect of it.</P>
    <P>The function of Córas Tráchtála is to assist firms into export markets by means of a wide range of grants and services.  I was depressed when I read part of the debate in the other House and found two Government Deputies, Deputy de Valera and Deputy Molloy, telling the House in no uncertain terms that Córas Tráchtála made no grants whatsoever to private industry and a Deputy on the other side of the House <Col N="822" /> was under a misapprehension in thinking Córas Tráchtála were responsible for any kind of grant to the private sector.  It is a bit depressing at this stage of our history to find that Government Deputies should be so misinformed, so unaware of the wide range of grants Córas Tráchtála are providing.</P>

      <P>Possibly that is the interpretation, but it is not my reading of what actually happened. If the Minister's interpretation is correct, then those concerned managed to be very unclear in their statements. The statement made &mdash; I am not now standing over it &mdash; was that the Deputy suspected some firms got grants from Córas Tráchtála more because of political considerations than because of ability to deliver the goods.  I do not, in fact, believe that that statement is correct and a quick denial from the Government benches would be understandable.  What is not understandable is the statement made by Deputy Molloy: &ldquo;They do not issue grants&rdquo;.  And Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;You said they give grants.  They do not.&rdquo;  Again, Deputy Molloy repeats: &ldquo;Córas Tráchtála does not issue grants.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They would have been shorter, had the Minister not provoked me.  It did appear to me there was a misunderstanding.  Córas Tráchtála is responsible for grants.  I want now to make a point which is very much part of the Minister's responsibility. As a result of CIO recommendations some four or five years ago &mdash; I had some responsibility in this myself &mdash; the range was extended from <Col N="823" /> market research grants for export purposes to market research grants in the domestic sphere.  This was done in recognition of the fact that the export and home market are essentially the same and it was, therefore, essential that firms should establish themselves firmly in the home market and should tackle that market in the most up-to-date manner and as effectively as possible. Because of that a scheme of grants was introduced paralleling the export grants.  In effect, Córas Tráchtála is concerned primarily, though not exclusively, with exports and design has been administered by the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>I wonder if that decision really took the point made by the CIO that, in conditions of free trade, when goods are freely importable, the home market and the export market are for all practical purposes identical.  Whether you are selling goods at home and keeping out foreign goods or selling goods abroad in free competition, it amounts to the same thing, and it seems to me we now have to begin rethinking some of the functions of Córas Tráchtála in these conditions.  I welcome the fact that the Government have rethought the position in relation to design and have not attempted in any narrow way to limit the work of Córas Tráchtála in design for export because that kind of approach would be unrealistic.  I shall come back to that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the market research grants, the approach is somewhat cumbersome.  I have a case in point.  A firm is undertaking a survey in respect of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Both are, after all, the one market under free trade conditions.  They are at the moment effectively free markets for many products.  There are virtually no restrictions now.  Nevertheless the firm must make two applications, and that involves a breakdown of home and export because Northern Ireland is regarded as export.  The same is true in relation to any research project to the whole of this island or even further afield.  This breakdown is unrealistic. When we have broken through in the case of design, we could now tidy up <Col N="824" /> the whole position and give Córas Tráchtála responsibility for market research grants.  They are geared to this.  They have the expertise.  They are very helpful to firms.  Firms seeking assistance go to Córas Tráchtála and Córas Tráchtála not only provides the grant but tells the firm whether they are getting value for their money, whether the consultancy firm is doing the kind of job that should be done, and whether the fee is reasonable.  It is giving the kind of service which possibly runs beyond that which the Minister's Department could provide and it would be helpful now if responsibility for home and market research grants were handed over to Córas Tráchtála.  This is something the Minister may not have had an opportunity of considering so far since he has not been very long in the Department.  I do not expect him to say &ldquo;Yes, done,&rdquo; right away but I hope he will look into it and consider the entire matter on its merits.</P>
    <P>With regard to design, I am all for Córas Tráchtála undertaking the work it is doing in the field of design.  It has been particularly imaginative in its approach and very effective indeed.  On a purely administrative point, I am a little puzzled as to why it is being given this function in 1967.  As I understand it, the original Act gave the Board two functions &mdash; to promote, assist and develop exports and to advise the Minister on matters affecting or in any way connected with the development of exports.  The Minister in his opening speech said that Córas Tráchtála was given the task in 1960 of promoting and assisting improvement in the standard and design of Irish industry.  I am not quite sure by what authority it was given that job.  I would not quarrel too much with that because it would be unfortunate if every new job that turned up required a special Act being put through the Oireachtas.  No one would want to insist on that.  The Minister's predecessor introduced an Act in 1963, the Export Promotion Act, three years after this.  As far as I can see &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; that does not contain any reference to design and it is now seven years after the original Act and four years after the last Act <Col N="825" /> that Córas Tráchtála are authorised to do what it has been doing for a number of years.  I should have thought the opportunity would have been taken in the Act that was brought in three years after the parent Act to legalise the position and give the Board the necessary authority.  Would the Minister comment on that?  Would he say why it has taken so long to legalise what Córas Tráchtála has been doing in this respect?</P>
    <P>The work it is doing is first class, as any Senator knows who has had occasion to visit the Kilkenny Design Centre.  The impact of its work there on design will be considerable.  If it is not as great as it should be, the fault lies not with Córas Tráchtála but with Irish industry not having taken advantage of the facilities available there, and the great willingness of Córas Tráchtála to make these available in the most flexible way possible. I had occasion to visit them in connection with one industry and we sat down afterwards with the Córas Tráchtála people and discussed how the Kilkenny Design Workshops could be used for the benefit of industry.  No matter what difficulty cropped up, Córas Tráchtála found a way around it and worked out an <i>ad hoc</i> solution as to how we could best make use of the facilities in question.  If they are not widely enough used, and I do not believe they are, it is because Irish industry has not been quick enough to use them and to see their advantages.</P>
    <P>There is one puzzling aspect about the accounts of the Kilkenny Design Workshops, that is, the scale of depreciation of premises.  In the 1964-65 balance sheet, the premises were valued at over £54,000, but in the year following that the depreciation on the premises was £10,119.  I admit that in that year the value of the premises increased considerably, to £83,607, but even at that, this is a very high write-off of premises in a country where the Revenue Commissioners do not generally offer much encouragement to the rapid writing-off of premises, desirable though that may be.  I wonder why the premises have <Col N="826" /> such a high write-off.  It is not as if it were a piece of equipment like a motor car which would fall to pieces in five years.  I know that the premises are rather old &mdash; they are the stables of the old Kilkenny Castle &mdash; but they seem to be sufficiently strong to stand for another five or ten years.  I do not understand why they have to be depreciated at this extraordinary rate.</P>
    <P>More broadly, on the question of co-operative export marketing, it is a pity that we have not made more progress in this regard.  One cannot fault the Government in this regard because they have endeavoured in various ways to promote active work in this field and to get Irish industries working together in regard to their exports.  However, it is very difficult to get firms to work together in the export field because one firm will be suspicious of another, as to what they will get out of it, and about what the firm in question will have to pay for its share of the work.  These are problems that can be overcome.  In the absence of these export co-operatives, many exporters are operating on such a small individual scale that they cannot hope to promote their goods effectively in external markets.  Córas Tráchtála pointed out that in the last decade as much as 60 per cent of Irish manufactures have been sold under the distributors' seal.  This means that the manufacturer has no hold on the market and the distributor in England, America, or France could change his source of supply overnight and nobody would be any wiser.</P>
    <P>The average Irish exporter is in such a small way that for him to promote or put across an Irish brand in a foreign market would be so expensive &mdash; in regard to the cost of television advertising, for instance &mdash; that he cannot undertake it.  This can only be achieved in many cases by the co-operative efforts of the firms concerned and here the reluctance of industries to co-operate leaves Irish industries at the mercy of foreign distributors and industry is not getting the firm, safe hold on foreign markets which is required.  Here, perhaps, Córas Tráchtála may not have done <Col N="827" /> as much as would have been desirable but I would not fault their efforts because indeed they have made a real contribution to some of the co-operative efforts that have been undertaken.  I do not think that everyone in Córas Tráchtála is equally convinced of the merits of co-operative efforts; some are rather unenthusiastic in this field and a somewhat greater effort could be made, even if the first or second attempt does not always succeed.</P>
    <P>From time to time in debates here, there has been a good deal of criticism of the Department of External Affairs on the ground that it has not pulled its weight in the export field.  There must be some truth in this and there is a danger, and it is worth stressing, that the existence of Córas Tráchtála and its active work in certain markets &mdash; and it is limited to certain markets&mdash;may have encouraged the Department of External Affairs to lose sight of the importance of playing its role also, particularly where Córas Tráchtála is not active in the development of exports.  I remember meeting one Ambassador who was so full of enthusiasm that he was almost willing to visit stores with a box of samples in order to get Irish exports sold. That is not true in all cases and while I would not go along with the thesis that their only purpose is to sell Irish goods and not to engage in any diplomatic work &mdash; because this is nonsense and it is the line taken by people who wish to denigrate their work &mdash; more could be done, particularly where Córas Tráchtála is not responsible.</P>
    <P>More could also be done to train staff in the Department of External Affairs as commercial attachés.  We do not have a separate consular service as other countries have and perhaps there is not sufficient emphasis placed on this side of the work.  I say that somewhat tentatively because I should not like to support the type of argument which is made so often here that all that these people should be doing is going around promoting the sales of Irish goods instead of engaging in <Col N="828" /> diplomatic work, which can, of course, be of great importance to this country.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I wonder whether more might not be done in relation to Eastern Europe.  I know that one can overstress the importance of trade with Eastern Europe.  Efforts in this regard can be very disappointing as these State trading companies are very often unwilling to buy the kind of things we produce and past efforts have not been very successful.  These efforts may have been somewhat inhibited by a lack of diplomatic contact.  While there are certain countries with which this country would not wish to have diplomatic relations, such as Eastern Germany, nevertheless, we may have been too inhibited from developing diplomatic contact with these countries which are nevertheless desirable for trading reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a country like Ireland, which is endeavouring to play some part in the United Nations, should cut itself off, for instance, from that listening post in the diplomatic world, Warsaw, the listening post of the Cold War, the one place where even the Chinese talk to the Americans and where so much of value can be exchanged between East and West. Apart from that, which does not concern us in this Bill, there is the trade potential of Eastern Europe which, while it can be exaggerated, does exist and could be developed more if we were less inhibited from making more contact with countries such as Poland which shows some possibility of developing trade.  It is not the best way to develop trade to treat a country as if it did not exist, and while there were reasons for not developing contacts with some countries in the past, they have not continued to exist with the same force, and our policy might be considered from the trading point of view as well as a diplomatic point of view.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make relates to the diversification of our export trade, something about which we talk a lot but about which we do not do very much.  It is a fact that our exporters, and I think this is true particularly of our manufacturing <Col N="829" /> exporters, tend to concentrate to a very high degree on the British market and to some lesser extent on the American market.  There is a reluctance to tackle the Continent of Europe as a market for manufactured goods and the range of Irish manufactures which is exported to Continental countries is extremely thin and consists in regard to a number of these countries of a handful of these products.  One could name the firms on the fingers of one hand who bother to do any business with these countries.</P>
    <P>This came out very clearly when the Federation of Irish Industries reviewed the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area arrangements on the prospects for Irish industry and trade in the years ahead.  In the course of that review, it emerged that the value put by Irish firms on free access to the countries of the EEC in terms of extra exports that could be secured in 1970 if we had free access to that market was extraordinarily low.  I think it did not run to more than £8 million or £10 million. This I think was an under-estimation of the potential and an indication of the extent to which Irish firms continue to look towards Britain and America to the exclusion of the much more difficult but also probably eventually more rewarding markets on the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>One can understand this because our export trade is at an early stage of development.  Despite the enormous growth of exports of manufactures in the past ten years, many Irish firms feel, rightly, that they are only scratching at the surface of the British market.  I think that even today less than two per cent of Britain's imports of manufactures come from Ireland.  That percentage is something we have increased greatly in the past ten years and many Irish firms think they can go on increasing it.  They feel that to such a degree that they are inclined to neglect other markets.  Here of course Córas Tráchtála has made a real contribution, with the Government's approval and as a result in part of Government initiative by the provision of extra grants for firms who are prepared to seek to develop markets <Col N="830" /> other than the UK.  I wonder if the Minister could say anything about the success of these efforts.  Have those diversification grants had the effect necessary or have Irish firms continued to concentrate exclusively on the UK market?  The actual trade returns suggest some improvement in exports to the Continent of Europe but not by any means as rapidly as one would wish.  I wonder if the Minister could say something about this and about Government policy here because it does seem there is a danger that the Free Trade Area Agreement which brings us certain benefits as well as certain disadvantages could concentrate the efforts of our exporters even more wholly on the UK market to the detriment of the expansion of exports to the Continent.  I should like to hear the Minister's ideas on this point.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wished to raise.  I would repeat what I said at the outset that I regret that the Minister did not adopt a broader approach here.  I recognise that in sticking to the terms of the Bill, he was following a practice as I have seen it in this House but I think it is a practice which perhaps might be reconsidered when a Bill of this kind deals with a subject which has broader implications. We are not really concerned here solely with money for Córas Tráchtála and stop there.  We are concerned with what Córas Tráchtála will do with the money, with the effect of this on our export trade, our export policy, and a Bill of this kind gives the Minister an opportunity to speak on these and if in the future he felt less inhibited in his opening speech he could tackle particular policy issues and it would help the debate, stimulate the debate and give us a more fruitful debate here than one launched on this rather narrow note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to thank Senator Garret FitzGerald for his generous tribute to the value of the work of Córas Tráchtála. Although I say &ldquo;generous&rdquo;, I do not mean it is undeserved.  I think it is well deserved.  I found in the other House that there was on all <Col N="831" /> sides a wide appreciation of the work done by Córas Tráchtála.  In a way this is rather surprising because obviously one cannot measure accurately what the effect of the work has been on our exports.  We do not know what, if Córas Tráchtála had never existed, the rise in our exports might have been but most people who are concerned with this matter seem to be well satisfied that their contribution has been substantial in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the question of occasions such as this being used for a general review of export policy, I appreciate Senator Garret FitzGerald's desire to have such, but frankly, Sir, I was under the impression that even if I had wanted to give such a review, I might well have been out of order.  Perhaps I would not but I was under that impression.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment briefly on some of the points raised by Senator Garret FitzGerald.  With regard to the exports from Shannon, the reason that these are not detailed is, as Senator FitzGerald suspected, that it is not desired to identify the industry involved. I should mention perhaps that the policy in this regard is one which is not dictated by me or by my Department. It is dictated by the Central Statistics Office for which I have no responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think their decisions are not taken on statistical grounds but on grounds of deference to industry's feelings which I would think were a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is on statistical grounds because of the belief that if there was disclosure, firms would not give the information required to establish statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> Senator Garret FitzGerald asked whether the exports from Shannon are included in our Second Programme target figures.  They are.</P>
    <P>The question of the market research grants in so far as they relate to the export market being handled by Córas Tráchtála and in so far as they relate to the home market being handled by my Department was raised.  I want to explain to the House that the Córas Tráchtála functions in this regard are by statute limited to exports.  Therefore, to make any change in the matter would involve legislation.  I am coming to a point which was raised by Senator Garret FitzGerald that illustrates this. I will have a look at it to see if it has been causing any great difficulty.  I am not aware that it has been but if I decide that it should be changed and want to change it, I believe that it would need new legislation.</P>
    <P>The matter to which I intended to refer which I think illustrates this is the question of design.  Córas Tráchtála were free to engage in design aimed at assisting our exports but considerable doubt was raised as to whether they were entitled to do anything in the field of design which could be related only to our home market or even perhaps partially to our home market and this came to light unfortunately after the introduction of the last Bill, the Bill of 1963, because the Kilkenny Design Workshops were set up in 1963 and had not developed to the stage where this came to a head, and when it did, the Bill had gone through.  It is for that reason that the provisions relating to design and the finance of Córas Tráchtála are spelled out in this Bill to cover both the home and export markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="833" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can take it from me that this was so.  The point was raised that their functions in regard to design were subject to their overall function which was related to the promotion and expansion of exports. It is for that reason that the specific provision is in this Bill, to put an end to those doubts.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald also made reference to the functions of the Department of External Affairs in regard to our exports.  As the House knows, this is not my responsibility, but I should like to take the opportunity of pointing out that on more than one occasion Córas Tráchtála have paid generous tribute to the assistance which they have received from the Department of External Affairs and its representatives in promoting Irish exports abroad.  I suppose we can accept that, human nature being what it is, there will be some of our representatives abroad who will be more effective in this branch of their work than others but, by and large, my own personal experience has been that our representatives abroad are very conscious of their duties in regard to the promotion of Irish exports and that they work as effectively as is open to them to assist our exports.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the fact that a high proportion of our industrial exports are being sold under foreign brand names, and this is of considerable concern to us.  Córas Tráchtála have been making strenuous efforts, and indeed I have endeavoured at times, when the occasion seemed suitable, to stress to our manufacturers the importance from a marketing point of view of selling their exports under a brand name readily identifiable with the firm concerned and with Ireland. I am convinced that this is of advantage not only to Irish exports in general but to the exports of the firm concerned, and these efforts will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the diversification of our exports, Córas Tráchtála have been endeavouring to assist this process by giving extra grants, particularly in regard to store promotions in countries other than Britain.  I cannot say that <Col N="834" /> we have achieved a great deal of success in this regard, but we have achieved some success.  While it is true that the value of our industrial exports to Britain has been steadily rising, it is also true that the proportion of our exported goods going to Britain has fallen, with a consequent increase in the proportion of those going to other countries.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator FitzGerald in what he said about the necessity for our manufacturers to export to the countries of continental Europe.  As he said, some of our exporters are doing so but the scale of our exports there is much smaller than any of us would like.  It is particularly important in the next year or two that our exporters should make a special effort to get some exports into continental Europe.  With the advent of membership of the Common Market, which seems to me to be inevitable, whenever it comes, they are going to find those markets of tremendous importance to them.  They have an opportunity at the moment, with a protected home base, of finding their way in those markets.  I know they are very difficult markets at present, with the tariffs operating against our goods there; nevertheless, for firms which hope eventually to make an impact in those markets, now is the time to explore the possibilities there and learn all the snags while they have a protected home base from which to operate, because this situation is not going to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny Design Workshops are, in my opinion, a development of tremendous importance.  They have already proved themselves to be of great value to us both on the home and the export markets, but I believe their potential is not realised generally, and I believe that potential is enormous.  It is for this reason, amongst others, that recently there have been certain changes, as a result of which the former chief executive of Córas Tráchtála is now in charge, as executive chairman, of Kilkenny Design Workshops.  Even greater emphasis is going to be given to the work of the workshops and, I hope, greater impetus to their efforts, with <Col N="835" /> greater effect on our exports and on our home manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House by dwelling at length on those possibilities, but I am quite convinced of the enormous potential, and I would suggest to any members of the House who are interested that they should, if they can at all, visit the Kilkenny Design Workshops. It is very difficult to describe the work going on there; one would want to see it, but I should be surprised if anyone who does so does not come away more than impressed.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several points on section 2, which I should like to understand before making any comment on it.  It says:</P>
      <P>The aggregate amount of the sums that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may pay to the Board for the purpose of enabling it to exercise or perform its functions (excluding any sum paid to it under section 4 of the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1963) shall not exceed four million, five hundred thousand pounds...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to think what that means. I am left in some doubt.  First of all, what are the sums paid to it under the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1963?  I think the Minister said in his opening speech that of the total sum of £2,500,000 authorised under that Act, including, I think I am right in saying, the original £1 million under the 1959 Act, all but £411,000 has been expended up to March last.  I take it, therefore, that at this stage, bearing in mind that the annual expenditure of Córas Tráchtála is about £500,000, the <Col N="836" /> full £2,500,000 virtually has been exhausted.  Does this mean they can now spend £4½ million on top of the original £1 million in the 1959 Act? We exclude from consideration the £1½ million they have got since.  It seems to me to be an odd way of doing business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The total sum, including the original £1 million under the original Act, would be £4½ million.  Section 4 of the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1963, provides for the giving of guarantees by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in respect of losses sustained by the Board in subletting or failure to sublet portion of premises acquired by them.  It was considered that the owner of the premises would seek a guarantee that the necessary funds would be available to the Board.  It was not anticipated any loss would be incurred.  The purpose of the provision was to ensure that the Board would get the best possible terms when entering into the lease.  In fact, no money has been paid under that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fault is mine for not having referred back to section 4.  I assumed wrongly it was in fact the section providing for the £2½ million.  I take it that what the Minister in effect is doing is making provision for Córas Tráchtála for a period of three to four years ahead? Adding to the £1 million their present rate of expenditure of half a million pounds per year, this should see them through for three years.  I assume the Minister will be back in three years' time looking for more, in accordance with the general method by which the financing of State bodies is carried on.  The accounts of Córas Tráchtála, as far as I can see, do not show this at any time.  There is no indication in them of the cumulative grants received or the relationship of that to the total amount.  They show what they have received in the year under consideration and what they did with it.  Of course, there is a balance sheet which includes the capital reserves built up out of the grants they have received. <Col N="837" /> Perhaps it would be a good thing for State bodies to show in their accounts how much of the total cumulative amount they are entitled to under the relevant Acts they have in fact received up to this point.  It is something that could be looked into.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little more information about this.  At the moment the Córas Tráchtála premises are leasehold premises. According to the accounts, they have spent £101,000 on the development of leasehold premises.  First, this seems a very large sum to expend on leasehold premises not their own property. One wonders if that is a prudent way to house the Board.  One wonders, indeed, what kind of development of leasehold premises could absorb as large a sum as that.  Could the Minister comment on that?</P>
      <P>Secondly, this obviously has been financed effectively by a bank loan, because the liabilities of the Board at 31st March, 1966, include a capital reserve of about £28,000, sundry creditors of £28,000 and bank overdrafts of £140,000.  It seems the Board are borrowing money from the bank in order to develop a leasehold premises they do not own.  I am wondering whether or not that approach has been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole method of financing is in fact a little unsatisfactory in that the Board receive a grant which they use mostly for current purposes but some of which they set aside as a reserve for capital purposes.  It is quite an inadequate capital reserve.  One wonders, in fact, whether, if the Board are going into the property business &mdash; as they now are from what the Minister has said &mdash; it would not be more appropriate for them to receive a capital sum for this purpose instead of a current grant which is so inadequate as to leave little or nothing for capital purposes.  As I said, when the Board have leasehold premises, <Col N="838" /> they have to borrow a large sum in order to put those premises into the condition they require.</P>
    <P>This Bill, apparently, is to permit the Board to borrow such sums as they may from time to time require. It is not to permit the Minister to advance capital sums.  Am I right in thinking the Board will be borrowing in the market?  Is this the correct approach for a Board which have no source of revenue of their own but are entirely dependent on a grant-in-aid and whose function it is to administer this grant-in-aid to provide export promotion facilities?  It does not seem appropriate for such a non-economic &mdash; I will not say uneconomic &mdash; body to be borrowing externally funds to finance buildings.  I do not mean externally to this country but from outside the public sector.  One would have thought the appropriate method of finance would have been by an advance from the Exchequer, instead of which they seek to proceed by the odd method of financing borrowing from the banks for the development of leasehold premises and then some other form of borrowing from outside not specified in order to buy premises in London.</P>
    <P>If this clause is now necessary, under what authority did the Board borrow such a large sum from the banks to develop their leasehold premises?  Here it says:</P>
    <P>The Board may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, borrow such sums as it may from time to time require for the purposes of its capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>This does not appear to be an amendment of some previous provision; it seems to be something new.  If it is something new and is not any existing provision, how did the Board in fact get authority?  What authority had they to borrow this sum for capital purposes, as was apparently done?  One can say the Board may have under existing Acts a provision for borrowing from the banks to meet immediate current requirements pending payment of the grant-in-aid, but they seem to me to be using bank borrowing as a form <Col N="839" /> of financing permanent capital development. Have the Board got authority to do that and, if so, why do we need this clause?  We need some explanation of the whole procedure adopted, which seems to be a little unsatisfactory, both in the past and as it is proposed to carry it out in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember, first, in regard to this that it is extremely unlikely Córas Tráchtála will be indulging in that kind of activity as part of their normal business.  This particular transaction to which I refer relates to Ireland House in London.  It is conceivable there could be some similar operations, but if any such should take place, they will obviously be few and far between.  Therefore, the machinery required is not the kind of machinery that perhaps might be necessary and appropriate for a body which was going to indulge in this as part of its day-to-day operations.</P>
      <P>The position appears to be that the Board have not got at the moment statutory authority to borrow for long-term for capital purposes.  The overdraft which they have is a short-term arrangement, presumably in anticipation of the provisions of this Bill, in order to enable them to carry on the job they have to do in Ireland House. The provision in the Bill is to allow the Board to get the statutory authority to borrow for capital expenditure, which is a power they do not appear to have had up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement in regard to Ireland House is that Córas Tráchtála have taken a 39-year lease of the premises at 151 New Bond Street, London, to be used as Ireland House in association with other State bodies and Irish commercial interests.  The proposal is that various floors of the premises would be let to these different bodies at economic rents.  Of course, the Board would be enabled to borrow on a long-term basis to finance the expenditure they would have to incur in adapting the premises to the requirements of the various lettings.  The passing of this Bill would give such authority to Córas <Col N="840" /> Tráchtála.  They would complete arrangements to borrow on a long-term basis and repay the bank overdraft which at present exists but the operation would be based on these rents from the various tenants and as far as I understand the position be a self paying operation.  In other words, the repayment of the capital would not as far as I know be expenditure from its normal annual grant but the operation of Ireland House would in itself be an economic operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a suspicion that the Minister is aware that his reply was in some measure unsatisfactory and evasive.  The question I asked in respect of this matter was what authority had the Board at the moment to finance their capital activities by borrowing from the bank. The Minister avoided replying to that but, by implication, said that it has not such authority because he said the need for this authority is the point that this provision is intended to cover. While he was speaking, I checked back on the original 1959 Act &mdash; I had not done so before &mdash; and it does in fact say that the Board, with the consent of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.  The fact is that the Board have incurred capital expenditure on fixed assets amounting to £133,000 and that the only finance of their own for that purpose is a capital reserve of £28,000, the remainder being provided by £140,000 bank credit, for the sum in respect of sundry creditors and accruals on the liabilities side is exceeded by the figure for current assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident from the balance sheet that the Board has in fact borrowed from the bank to finance capital development which they are not entitled to do under the Act.  If that is the case, the Minister should say so when he is asked, and not evade it.  A Board of this kind should not get itself into this position and the Government should make adequate provision for it. This is not something unexpected.  The <Col N="841" /> Board have premises, leasehold or otherwise, in a number of places, as well as in Dublin, and have been developing these premises for some time past and the current level of development involves something like five times the amount of capital it has had available for this purpose.  It is puzzling that the Government could allow them to run so far beyond their own resources as to be requiring bank financing which the Board are not authorised to obtain for this purpose. We are entitled to a somewhat franker explanation on the point than the Minister gave in the first instance; perhaps he would like to develop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Senator FitzGerald is, as I think anyway, mistaken in thinking that my answer was evasive.  It may not have been as clear as he would like but it was not intended to be evasive.  I did say that the Board had not got power at the moment to borrow for capital purposes. I also said the Board had financed the expenditure they had incurred which could be regarded as capital expenditure on Ireland House in London by way of bank overdraft but clearly what is involved in borrowing for capital purposes is long-term borrowing. The Board have not got power to engage in long-term borrowing at present, and because they have not got that power, have not done so.  They have borrowed on short-term overdraft. If one wants to say more clearly what is involved, one could visualise a situation where this provision would not be passed by the Dáil and Seanad and one would see what would happen then. What would happen is that Córas Tráchtála would dispose of their interest in the 39 year lease at a very enhanced figure and a considerable profit, pay back the bank and that would be the end of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was unfair to the Minister in describing him as evasive in my first intervention, I apologise.  Unfortunately, I have to say now that he is being evasive by any standards because he has attempted to say that the Board simply have not got power to borrow long-term and <Col N="842" /> have borrowed short-term and are now getting power to borrow long-term, and that is all there is to it.  The 1959 Act says that the Board may borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.  It is the latter part of the phrase I am concerned with.  I do not think the Minister can evade it completely in this way.  The fact is that they have borrowed money which was not for current expenditure but clearly, on the face of the balance sheet, for capital expenditure.  There was legal authority for this and we are now legalising something which could not be done under the 1959 Act.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, I would point out that the operation involved here is one of very considerable value and Senator FitzGerald, I think, would have been the last person, if he had been asked for his views at the time this project was being embarked on, to have said: &ldquo;No, you cannot do this until the legislation is passed.&rdquo;  I do not think he would have said that.</P>

      <P>One sees the Minister's approach, but I am sorry because I have always had the feeling that arguments for evading the law when it is inconvenient are ones we must not accept.  For a country whose people are extremely legalistic in many ways, there is an extraordinary tendency in this country to say that if the law is inconvenient, we can ignore it, and it is the number of people from Ministers of State down, who adopt this line, this kind of attitude, that leads to the kind of ignoring of the law that we have seen in recent weeks if example is given in this way. I do not think the Minister's reply was satisfactory.  If he said a mistake was made and it was put right, one could accept it, but to say it was justified on the ground that it was inconvenient <Col N="843" /> to do otherwise, and that therefore the law should be ignored, is an approach that I do not think we should accept in this House.</P>

      <P>Further, I should like to point out that in so far as the people of this country may be legalistic, I have given the legalistic explanation which the Senator required on that score.  He is not happy with that and he is not happy with the other explanation.  I am afraid I cannot help him any further.  I have made the position quite clear to the House as to what occurred and as to why this section is required.</P>

      <P>The section, as the House will see, enables the Board to alter or adapt or reconstruct any premises held by it for the purpose of facilitating the disposal by it of any estate or interest in premises or portion of premises held by the Board.  This again arises out of the Ireland House operation in London. I said earlier that lettings were being made to various high standing companies and commercial interests.  It appears that legal doubts had arisen as to whether the Board was empowered under existing legislation to carry out alterations or reconstructions of the <Col N="844" /> premises which they might have acquired merely to facilitate the disposal of those premises by way of lease or otherwise.  They have power to do so for their own purposes but to do so in order to make a lease would seem to be doubtful and this is the reason for this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the word &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; at a quick reading, to mean actual selling but I understand from the Minister that it is with a view to leasing part of the premises, and that makes sense.</P>

      <P>This brings us to the question of industrial design and I am back to the questions I raised in the first instance about Córas Tráchtála and industrial design.  The Board itself in their annual report for 1965, have said that the functions of Córas Tráchtála are to promote and assist in the improvement of standards of design in Irish industry. I am wondering what is the status in that.  The Minister has suggested that they are not entitled to do it except for export; they were entitled to do it and, moreover, they have been doing it.  It is quite difficult to see what else they can do.  It would be ridiculous if the Board or the Design Centre had to ask every manufacturer to promise he would not sell at home anything designed in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, what puzzles me is the naïveté with which apparently the project was approached if the Minister says it was set up on the idea that it would design for export, and it was only after the 1963 Act was introduced, it was suddenly realised that some of the designs might be for the home market.  It does suggest a lack of thought about the whole question of design because the Board could not be involved in the question of design for export without involving the position, incidentally, for the home market.  However, it puzzles me <Col N="845" /> that this situation could ever have arisen and that the Board could have been launched in 1960 into design work and even three years later, when the Act was being introduced at that stage, for the home as well as for export markets, it was not recognised that a home market existed.  It does not very aware of what the Board was doing when it came to drafting that legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the question involved here about the operation of Kilkenny Design Workshops in regard to the home as well as the export market really came to a head only after the setting up of the Design Workshops in 1963 but the point at issue is one of legal doubt rather than legal certainty.  A point was raised about this and the object here is to set any doubts which may exist at rest.  I do not propose, nor indeed am I able to say with authority, what is the legal position.  All I can say is that there are some doubts about it and this is designed to remove those doubts.</P>

      <P>This is to be welcomed in any event.  If there are any doubts on this score, they should <Col N="846" /> be removed.  I would hope that the Minister would look at other issues, like the market research grants, where the existing legislation may be unduly restrictive on the Board as it moves into an era of free trade.  This is a question which should be looked at as a whole.  We should look ahead to the future, instead of putting things right some years later.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to consider this, so that, if necessary, further legislation should ensure that Córas Tráchtála need not be in any way prohibited in coping with the problems of free trade, which are by no means export problems only.</P>
