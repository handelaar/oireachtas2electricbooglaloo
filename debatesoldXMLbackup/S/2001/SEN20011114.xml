      <P>It is my privilege and honour, on behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann, to welcome the Commissioner, David Byrne, to the House today. It is an opportune moment to recall that this is the third occasion on which we have welcomed Members of the European Commission to this Chamber. In October 1996 Commissioner Neil Kinnock was with us, followed by the President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, in November 1998.</P>
      <P>However, today is a particular occasion for celebration and rejoicing in that in welcoming Commissioner Byrne we have among us a distinguished Irishman who has served the Irish State and people in a number of eminent capacities, not least of which was as Attorney General from 1997 to 1999. As Commissioner with responsibility for Health and Consumer Protection, Commissioner Byrne's mission statement is to ensure a high level of protection of consumers' health, safety and economic interest as well as public health at the level of the European Union. This is a wide and significant portfolio of responsibilities encompassing, as it does, core issues of health and well-being, issues which are of paramount and critical concern to us as legislators.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we tend to think of the institutions of the European Union as being concerned almost exclusively with macro-economic realities, yet the truly human face of their activities is evidenced by an address which Commissioner Byrne made on 25 October last at a European conference on mental health in which he spoke eloquently and passionately on how the Commission is determined to respond positively to challenges in the mental health area, in his own words &ldquo;an area of life that has perhaps too long not been the centre stage of the policy agenda&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragic events in the United States on 11 September and the effects of that disaster serve only to remind us of how interdependent our <Col N="706" /> world has manifestly become and how it is incumbent on all of us to work ceaselessly to achieve peace and prosperity, ideals which, at its heart, the European Union symbolises and serves.</P>
    <P>It gives me great please to invite Commissioner Byrne to address Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. A Chathaoirligh, Sheanadóiri, a dhaoine uaisle, agus a chairde Gael, it is a great honour to be the first Irish Commissioner to be invited to address Seanad Éireann. It is all the more appropriate as we are at a crucial stage in the development of the European Union. This has been recognised in Ireland, particularly with the establishment of the National Forum on Europe, and I am delighted a Member of the House, Senator Maurice Hayes, has agreed to preside over this important endeavour.</P>
      <P>I would like to share with you some ideas on the future of Europe. A completely new era in the history of Europe began when the European Community was founded over 50 years ago. It was the response to centuries of a precarious balance of powers on the Continent which again and again resulted in terrible wars culminating in the two world wars between 1914 and 1945. The core concept of Europe after 1945 was, and still is, a rejection of the historical ambitions of individual countries. Fifty years on, the process of European construction is probably the biggest political opportunity facing the states and peoples involved. Our success or failure will be of crucial importance to the future of each and every one of us, but especially to future generations, because what Europe stands for and where it is going are now being called into question by many.</P>
      <P>Democracy is enduring. It has endured through thick and thin. We Irish know this only too well, yet many of the countries hidden from democracy for so many years in eastern Europe are now on the threshold of joining the democratic force of the European Union. As several European political figures recently stated, we now have a crisis of European identity and an increasing disillusionment on the part of European people. The challenge and opportunity for us political leaders are to address these issues and devise a credible vision for the future. President Prodi did so on Monday in an important address to the College of Europe at Bruges in Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is now ripe for shaping a new Europe. In doing so, however, we must not forget all the positive achievements of the past and the present. We have credible and effective policies in a whole host of areas that are reaping benefits, namely, regional and cohesion policies, for example, education and training, laying the foundations of Ireland's success; agriculture, giving Ireland the opportunity to export 90% of its beef production; a Single Market of 370 million consumers, afford<Col N="707" /> ing much greater choice and competition; justice and home affairs, economic and financial issues, with strong money-laundering legislation; and policies on safe food and consumer protection, such as food labelling and, of course, the developing European Food Authority. Through these policies, conducted by the Union's institutions, Ireland can bring its influence to bear. This can be done directly and through building alliances with other member states.</P>
    <P>The referendum result of 7 June on the Nice treaty came as a great disappointment to me. It sent shock waves through the rest of the European Union, but particularly in the candidate countries. I have always been convinced that we are not anti-enlargement in Ireland. My belief was confirmed by the results of the recent opinion survey undertaken on behalf of the Commission. Nevertheless, this same survey points to an information deficit about the Nice treaty, in particular, and the European project generally as being the biggest factor on people's minds. This debate and the establishment of the forum provide excellent platforms for debate and information.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote are so enormous that we need to reflect fully on their implications. Is Ireland saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the European Union? I cannot believe this to be the case. Is Ireland saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to enlargement? It seems not. Then, to what was the electorate saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;? If we leave things as they are now, then the effect of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote could be seen and interpreted by our partners as a &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Europe and a &ldquo;No&rdquo; to enlargement. Before we embark on such a fundamental change in what has been our policy for the past 40 years we need to make sure that this is what the majority of Irish people want.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that from 2004 we are aiming at an enlarged Europe with up to ten candidate countries joining progressively. A stronger Europe will be possible through the strengthening of certain policies, for example, justice and home affairs and food safety. Moreover, a more democratic Europe can be created with better participation of citizens in the decision making process. This will be possible notably through national parliaments, stakeholders and, more generally, in the choice of the most effective level of decision making. I will return to this aspect.</P>
    <P>People are increasingly seeking more clarity on the direction of the European project. When I think about this I am reminded of the design of a railway where one has built a network of track with a number of stations already built. The train has covered many kilometres, stopped at many stations, taken many new directions, but we must now take stock to ensure we are heading in the right direction. We also need to ensure that the train can stop every now and then at new stations to facilitate enlargement. From my own experi<Col N="708" /> ence of the European project I see the European network revolving around three concepts: competition, to stimulate, co-operation, to strengthen and solidarity, to unify. These very concepts are the tool kit of the European Union. They serve the ideals of developing a people's sovereignty, a people's democracy.</P>
    <P>It is useful to recall the European context. The National Forum on Europe provides an excellent platform for debate on the future of Europe and Ireland's place in it and, most significantly, Ireland's contribution to this evolution. Why is this debate so important? It is important because we should aim to develop a sovereign Union in the people's hands, shaped, I suggest, as a federation of nation states. It will mean having flexible and democratic structures which allow for regular adaptation without going through the heavy process of an intergovernmental conference. Last December in Nice the heads of state and government recognised the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions. The purpose was to bring these institutions closer to the citizens of the member states. They called for a deeper and broader debate on the future of the European Union. All concerned are therefore encouraging wide-ranging discussions with interested parties including representatives of national parliaments, those reflecting public opinion such as political, economic and academic representatives, and representatives of society at large such as political parties, trade unions, associations and religious groups.</P>
    <P>At Nice four specific areas were identified for examination by a convention. The first is the role of national parliaments in the European architecture &ndash; the Cathaoirleach is very familiar with this subject. Some member states such as the UK, Denmark and Sweden already have parliamentary scrutiny of draft Community legislation before adoption. This issue was addressed in the report of the constitutional review group of 1996 on which I had the honour to serve.</P>
    <P>The second area to be examined is the simplification of the treaties. This is encompassed in the general aim of bringing Brussels closer to the citizen. It includes changes such as the simplification of legal texts, an appropriate level of decision making and using governance mechanisms to their best effect. This is something that could lead to the drafting of a constitution for Europe, to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>The third area to be looked at is the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed at Nice. This should involve a clearer identification of those rights which could usefully be recognised as genuinely fundamental. The fourth area to be scrutinised concerns a clearer demarcation of the powers exercised by the European Union and the member states. Together with the role of national parliaments this issue is politically one of those <Col N="709" /> most immediately necessary. The starting point for this exercise is Article 5 of the Treaty of Rome. This article states that the Community must act, within certain limits &ndash; the limits of the powers conferred on it by the treaty &ndash; in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Most Community competencies are shared between the European Union and the member states.</P>
    <P>We are not starting this exercise from the beginning. To pick up on my analogy, the train is already well down the line. What we are seeking to achieve for the future is that the train takes the correct track and stops at the appropriate stations. There is, however, no ready-made railway map for the future. We must construct our own unique constitutional model, setting out clearly who is responsible for what and how the responsibilities of member states and the Community's responsibilities interlink. The political responsibilities should, as a matter of fundamental importance, be set out in a manner that is comprehensible for citizens.</P>

      <P>May we have copies of the Commissioner's speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there are copies available. They are being circulated.</P>
      <P>I hope the Laeken convention will be firmly set in train by the Heads of Government and State meeting in Laeken next month. The composition of this convention is likely to be largely based on elected representation, with two members of the national parliaments of each member state, one representative of each Government, 16 Members of the European Parliament and one representative of the Commission. This will give a total of 62 members, including 46 representatives of Parliament. Candidate countries will be fully associated. The Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee will be represented also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention will meet from the beginning of next year to prepare for future reforms, and it must also seek to establish a link between work on reform and the expectations of society at large. Representatives of the regions and society generally must be fully involved and must help to define what the European Union is to become. The convention must listen to those expectations, say how it views them and explain frankly and clearly why it accepts or rejects proposals that are the product of grassroots discussions. In a wider context, the convention will have to meet the expectations of citizens. Often, quite rightly, they stress that the European Union should be effective in implementing policies they consider necessary. On the other hand, they express doubts and anxieties with regard to the European project, but surveys show that they want European answers, <Col N="710" /> even above and beyond what is possible or necessary.</P>
    <P>Given the background I have sketched, I believe the convention should have as broad an approach as is necessary to satisfy our citizens' concerns &ndash; for example, a Europe equipping itself better to meet the challenges of globalisation or to handle international crises, such as those that have confronted us since 11 September, and a Europe that is more consistent in its economic and employment policy. The Declaration of Laeken will establish the guidelines and raise the questions that will enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>An important function of the convention should be to establish clear, simple and permanent tools for the treaties to adapt in the future according to needs as they arise. This could involve agreement on a fundamental text that will form the constitutional basis of the European Union. All necessary ancillary texts could then be approved through a simplified procedure not requiring repeated ratification. Of course, any change to the fundamental text would require full ratification.</P>
    <P>Europe should be wary of concentrating all its efforts on its institutions and should break the never-ending cycle of reviewing its structures and operation. The Treaty of Maastricht made provision for the reforms of Amsterdam and, in turn, the Amsterdam treaty bequeathed us the Treaty of Nice. This non-stop activity suggests a real sense of collective dissatisfaction. We would have a better Europe for the citizens if we managed to bring about one reform with clear objectives and parameters.</P>
    <P>The European Union now has the opportunity, perhaps for the first time, to reflect on a number of fundamental questions &ndash; what it wishes to become, the repercussions of doubling its size and how it can maintain the momentum of its founders as well as the unity required by the unfolding new international dimension. We need to strike the right balance of shared power between the member states, which will reflect national identities and interests, and the European Union, which will represent the shared interests of all Europeans. The European Commission has a key role in mediating the interests of all member states. This is particularly important in respect of smaller member states to ensure their interests are fully taken into account in the development of policy and legislation.</P>
    <P>The European Union of the future will not come into being without the support of its citizens and the commitment of its national political leaders. It is true that the crisis of political legitimacy is making itself felt throughout political life. Turn-out at national, local and European elections is declining. In many member states political parties are emerging which are challenging <Col N="711" /> the democratic foundations on which our societies are built.</P>
    <P>People have different aspirations and different ambitions in Europe and for Europe. At present not all the member states want to adopt the euro. Some member states are not members of NATO. Not all want joint arrangements for defence with the same degree of commitment. Not all the member states have the same views on the issues of asylum and immigration. The treaties reflect these differing national perspectives. This shows that Europe has a flexibility to design common policies while accommodating real concerns of member states. While member states may clearly wish to retain competence in certain fields closely linked to sovereignty, we need to clarify to what extent the EU should be involved in, for example, military, social or taxation issues. On abortion, for example, there is no reason there should be an EU initiative, despite what some people claim.</P>
    <P>Possible Union involvement in other fields of competence may well be difficult to define. For example, the field of justice and home affairs is closely linked to national sovereignty. However, the fight against cross-border crime or an efficient immigration policy necessarily requires co-ordinated actions at EU level. The role of national parliaments will be crucial in building the right connections. If Europe is to be more tangible than ever before, citizens and parliamentarians have to play a bigger role at European level.</P>
    <P>The subject of the role of the national parliaments is not new and those who negotiated the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties will recall the debates which led to declarations and then a special protocol being drawn up on the role of national parliaments. What is worth highlighting, however, is the passion and level of detail with which various leading European politicians are now tackling this issue. This amounts to an inquiry into the democratic legitimacy of our system. The steady expansion of the powers of the European Parliament may not be enough to address the certain lack of legitimacy associated with our institutions.</P>
    <P>There are three avenues which are seriously worth exploring. First, no doubt national parliaments need to play a more active part in monitoring European affairs. To exercise this role, it seems the national parliaments could have greater input to national positions when the Council exercises its legislative powers. I believe in the value of an early warning system for national lawmakers and this approach would be the most tangible expression of this principle. At any rate, it is important to ensure that the national parliaments are as well informed as possible. This is, of course, the responsibility of the member states and, indeed, is one of the reasons I am here today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" />Second, there is a need to improve the way national parliaments are involved in shaping European fundamental texts. As I mentioned earlier, this will be done this time by means of a convention. Finally, we have to think about the exercise of European legislative power. The national legislative body will gain respect if European laws focus on general objectives and leave as much leeway as possible on implementation. This means respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and making room for national parliaments. However, in special circumstances where technical issues may be involved, directly applicable regulations may be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>We also need to identify more clearly the legislative role of the Council of Ministers. The decision making role of the Council is likely to remain an important element of the Union's institutional architecture. Improving the way the Council operates falls into the category of essential reform. Various ideas have been floated in various quarters, one of which is to appoint specific Ministers of European affairs regularly meeting in Brussels to ensure coherence in all legislation. This could help strengthen interministerial co-ordination within each member state and facilitate a better involvement of national parliaments. It could also ensure that each government takes greater political responsibility for decisions adopted by the Council. Regardless of the means chosen, the key issue is not to lose sight of the objective. Moreover, the European Council itself should become more focused on issues of principle and get less bogged down in the detail of specific issues. Unless this happens we are in constant danger of paralysis.</P>
    <P>The Commission has often voiced its desire to expand the legislative role of the European Parliament, which represents the people of Europe. In the institutional triangle Parliament ought to play its full part on equal terms with the Council by representing the member states and the Commission, which in turn represents the European public interest. We must remember the very special role conferred upon the Commission by the current system. In reinforcing that role we need to reflect on how the Commission can be given greater popular legitimacy. One suggestion is the election of the Commission President.</P>
    <P>These institutions should be examined with a view to consolidating the institutional triangle of Parliament, Council and Commission. The Union method should also be strengthened because it has been proven to be effective. The Union method can surprise and irritate because it works. It surprises by proposing legislation that is innovative and it irritates by taking court actions against those who fail to live up to their promises.</P>
    <P>This method has worked in a highly satisfactory way for the Internal Market for goods and in terms of the free movement of persons and capi<Col N="713" /> tal. Business is benefiting greatly from the European open market and consumers have greater choice. The Union method has also worked for the common currency which will become a reality across almost all Europe in only 47 days. These policies help to create a unified Europe rather than a standardised one while demonstrating solidarity. On the other hand, for some member states the issue of transferring foreign policy to the Community pillar is quite simply a non-starter. Any steps in this direction could prompt them to act outside the European Union's institutional structures. The EU needs to be vigilant against external challenges. In matters of trade the USA is an important partner. It is essential, however, that trade negotiations are conducted by the Union as a whole to strengthen our position and to guarantee a better outcome.</P>
    <P>Another threat to Europe would be certain bilateral co-operations on political matters. This has been the case recently with countries such as the UK, Germany and France and that has been a cause of concern for smaller member states. A strong Commission fully supporting its President is an effective counterweight to emerging inter-governmentalism.</P>
    <P>Ireland can represent, and often does represent, a model for Europe to follow. Ireland has succeeded in encouraging very many foreign companies to establish bases here. The country is often cited in Europe as a model, not just because of its economic advantages. Multinational companies find Ireland attractive for its efficient, flexible administration and for its capacity for speedy response. We are all well aware of the benefits Ireland has reaped since accession in 1973. That year our exports of goods and services accounted for 37% of gross national product. Almost 30 years later we are exporting just over 110% of GNP. Britain, our traditional export market, accounts for only 20% of exports, whereas the rest of Europe accounts for over 40%. Would this type of transformation have been possible without tariff free, unimpeded access to the Single Market? Would it have been possible without EU Structural Fund assistance? Would Ireland have had the strength to break with sterling in 1979 without the support of the Union? Twenty years later, could one envisage the Irish pound existing as a separate currency from the euro? I think not.</P>
    <P>Sovereignty is a very difficult concept to define precisely. Certainly it involves the free giving of allegiance by citizens to a state and that state acting in the interests of its citizens on that basis. It also involves the exercise of self-determination. These are visceral concepts as we know only too well in the context of Northern Ireland. In many respects the arrangements set out in the Good Friday Agreement borrow very heavily from the Union method, including as they do intergovernmental co-operation, North-South bodies, the Council of the Isles and devolved administration. <Col N="714" /> These are heavily influenced by the sharing of sovereignty in a balanced and agreed way.</P>
    <P>What does sovereignty mean in the modern-day, interdependent world we inhabit? We have learned to share certain aspects of sovereignty. Even on the deeply historical &ldquo;national question&rdquo;, the Irish people have foregone their constitutional territorial claim on Northern Ireland, but they did this in the context of the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; something they saw as understandable, of benefit and manifestly fair. It is in such circumstances that I see people being capable of sharing sovereignty, that is, if they understand the issue and feel they have a personal stake in it. This is the challenge we face in reaching out to our citizens in the European Union.</P>
    <P>As a starting point, being sovereign should imply understanding the governing rules. I believe strongly in the need to clarify and simplify our fundamental texts. I believe this in spite of the undoubted complexity of treaties stemming from the various exceptions and derogations granted to certain member states or from the co-existence of Community and intergovernmental procedures. Also, as regards the national ratification process, it ought to be possible to reserve the formal procedure for the most fundamental amendments of our treaties. I favour making provision for a simplified procedure for minor amendments. I mentioned earlier the idea of giving such a power to the convention, in bringing forward a distinction between a constitutional text and ancillary texts.</P>
    <P>This would be a significant change, but the question has to be posed. The question of powers and responsibilities brings to light various deficiencies in our method of decision making. However, in entering into such a debate, which I consider to be legitimate and necessary, a few points need to be borne in mind. First, Europe is not a state. Everyone in Europe is in agreement in condemning the prospect, or rather the myth, of a European superstate. Let us therefore avoid proposing for the European Union models copied from the practice of federal states, because the building of Europe is actually the building of a sort of hybrid community of peoples and states committed to diversity and the identity of their nations.</P>
    <P>Second, the relative flexibility of the European Union's treaties should be preserved to facilitate subsequent stages in the development of Europe. This is a duty for generations to come. Can we, therefore, draw up a list of what the European Union should never do and which should consequently remain within the exclusive competence of the states? That would, on the whole, be better than adopting the restrictive list of our joint actions, but lists, whether negative or positive, are liable to become obsolete quickly.</P>
    <P>Third, the diversity of national systems, pro<Col N="715" /> tected by the principle of institutional autonomy, must be taken into account. Not all states are organised in the same way and each administers its territory as it sees fit. As I said earlier, Ireland is making a great contribution in Europe &ndash; as an economic model and as an alliance-builder with other countries, in particular with the so-called big member states. Its role will be even bigger after the next enlargement when it will be among the wealthiest member states.</P>
    <P>Europe is not an edifice of big against small member states. It is, rather, a community of interests better served when pooled. International trade, third world development issues and competition policy spring immediately to mind in this context. Let us take international trade as an example. The World Trade Organisation is, as I speak, completing its work on launching a new round of trade negotiations in Doha in Qatar. In this context, we in Ireland find it very important to ensure that the interests of the less developed countries are taken care of at international level. In discussions with world powers, only the Community can be heard and conduct a policy favourable to these countries.</P>
    <P>Another example of how Irish interests are better preserved through participation in the European process is in competition policy. By keeping in check the power of large multinational companies, rules on competition and mergers are essentially applied for the benefit of consumers. While some member states could easily resist the power of these big companies, only an authority representing the 15 member states can impose this in respect of consumers' interests. My area of responsibility also underlines the added value brought by Community action. There is a need for strong and efficient food safety measures and robust consumer protection. BSE, foot and mouth disease and the health issues we have had to face in recent times could not be dealt with only at national level. A European response is necessary. We are proud to have made a major contribution to addressing these challenging issues.</P>
    <P>I have covered a lot of ground. Let me attempt to draw some conclusions. The debate upon which we are embarking concerning the future of the Union is vital for every man, woman and child in Ireland and throughout the Union. Unless we succeed in shaping a Union which captures our imagination and fulfils our dreams, we are on the road to nowhere. My famous train will simply run out of steam. The opportunity must now be seized to put our stamp on the future direction of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Many of those who are no longer captivated by the ideals of ever closer integration fear with some legitimacy that the project lacks direction. As soon as they see one intergovernmental conference finished, more ideas for another one start <Col N="716" /> emerging. Understandably, this causes anxiety and fuels suspicion about what is going on. Imagine if the Irish Constitution was to be amended radically every few years. How could people keep up with such developments? How would they know to what they were subscribing their allegiance?</P>
    <P>The time has now come to put the procession of intergovernmental conferences behind us once and for all. The post-Laeken process now gives us all the chance to do this. Perhaps we will see proposals emerging within a few years for some type of constitution for Europe. Perhaps such a constitution or treaty would fix the broad issues of major importance for us all. This would give us our guiding light, our beacon of certainty, our unifying force. This type of development would leave subsidiary issues to be dealt with through the normal process of legislation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, if shaping the future direction involves us all and we all feel we are being listened to, we can construct a powerful, dynamic and peaceful system of governance for Europe which sets clear levels of power and responsibility for the centre, national capitals and parliaments, the regions and individual citizens. The debate initiated in Ireland, partly as a result of the Nice referendum and the debate on the future of Europe called for by the Nice treaty, is welcome and timely. In many respects, perhaps it is a debate in which we all should have engaged before. We now have the chance and must exercise that opportunity vigorously. I see the opportunity to lay down a new track for Europe into the future. I hope Members will react to the issues I have raised and look forward to a lively exchange of views.</P>

      <P>I thank the Commissioner, who has kindly agreed to take some questions from Members. I will proceed on the basis of allowing a number of questions before calling on the Commissioner to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Commissioner to the Upper House of the Oireachtas. As far as we are concerned, this is a mould-breaking day because, to my knowledge, no Irish Commissioner has addressed either House of the Oireachtas until today. I had the great honour and privilege of serving on the legislation committee with David Byrne in his position as Attorney General. Our experience was that we were both able to work together to formulate and advance the business of both Houses successfully. Ireland and Europe are well served by our Commissioner who is a dynamic, energetic person committed to serving the people of Europe, especially the Irish people who are extremely proud of his achievements and on which I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Commissioner is no doubt aware, the <Col N="717" /> health and safety of the Irish people are of great concern given the range and scale of activity at the Sellafield nuclear plant. In that context, has the Sellafield nuclear plant ever been fully and comprehensively investigated by the European Union? If so, does the result of such an investigation warrant action on the part of the European Union in terms of having the plant closed down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Commissioner and compliment him on the job he is doing in Europe. He has many fine qualities, among which are his superb presentational skills. We saw proof of the latter this morning when he managed, in a short period, to cover most of the major issues, particularly those which affect us in the aftermath of the Nice referendum.</P>
      <P>For someone who has long advocated greater integration and sees Ireland's place at the heart of Europe, these are bleak times. There is an air of uncertainty abroad and no guarantee that the next referendum on the Nice treaty will be carried. There is also no guarantee that Ireland will not make what I and others see as a catastrophic decision which would greatly affect not alone our national interests, but also deprive Europe of one of the forces that has given it momentum in the 30 years since our accession. It is worth noting that the major parties in both Houses have been wholehearted in their commitment to Europe during the period.</P>
      <P>We have reached a dangerous stage. I wish to raise two of the points to which the Commissioner adverted. He raised many points, but I wish to deal with only two and perhaps seek further elaboration in respect of them. The first is the role of the Commission. The Commissioner was clear about the key role the Commission plays and highlighted the fact that it has been an enormous force in aiding the transformation of our economy and those of many other countries and that it has played a leadership role. In that context, however, a number of questions immediately arise. For example, why is the Commission held in such low regard? Why is there no affection for it? Why is it seen as being remote and why is the good news it has to offer taken for granted by people who perhaps are more likely to complain about what it has not done or about its interference in certain areas? Is this just a question of how the Commission's work affects us? I do not believe so. I know this question has obviously exercised the minds of the Commissioner and his colleagues in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major problem in the fact that a body which has so much good news, etc., to give finds itself in a position where people are either indifferent or hostile towards it. Why is it that in the debate on the Nice treaty all of the passion seemed to be on the side of those who did not want the referendum to pass? Is there a case for a greater degree of leadership, up-front commit<Col N="718" /> ment and passion from those charged with running the Commission?</P>
    <P>The second issue to which I wish to refer is the point the Commissioner made about national parliaments. As far as this Parliament is concerned, he was far too polite. Our treatment of European issues during the past 30 years has been a disgrace. We are little better off now than we were when the old Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation was established in 1972. We must shoulder a great deal of the blame for the low turnout at the referendum and the failure of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; camp to achieve the desired result.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs works very hard, but is seriously and grossly under-resourced. Senator O'Toole and I visited Stormont last week and saw at first hand the facilities to which every committee in the Assembly has access. The total resources of all the committees of these Houses would probably only match those of one committee at Stormont. The message for us is that if we want to ensure European affairs are treated seriously, our committees must be resourced to the level at which they can operate properly.</P>

      <P>Second, there is the question of this House. My party and I have long advocated that this should be the European House of the Irish Parliament. Members of the European Parliament should have right of access to and right of audience in the Seanad and be allowed to speak on European issues. There should be standard, set times for debates on Europe. People such as the Commissioner or his top officials should visit the House on a regular basis to brief us and thereby, through the medium of television, brief the Irish people on how issues are progressing and any difficulties which may arise. Unless we have this constant interaction, the message will not get across and the issues will not be addressed.</P>
      <P>We have a great deal to learn, as parliamentarians, from working closely with members of other European parliaments, especially the smaller parliaments, because we all have a great deal in common in dealing with the Commission, the Council and our own Governments. I thank the Commissioner because he has started an important debate today. I look forward to his observations on the two points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to respond supportively to the Commissioner being here and his thoughtful address. I would like to bring it down to ground level, as it were, because what he said on the structure is very important. I would like to ask him a personal question. Are his fellow Commissioners aware that he is the only Commissioner who cannot travel home by train and the only Commissioner who cannot get back to <Col N="719" /> his homeland without flying or going by boat? Do they recognise we have special and different needs from others? This is the only island state in the Community.</P>
      <P>In terms of where the Commissioner stands, the anti-competitiveness and the fact Irish people now see the stress in the airline industry being used by the European Commission to pursue its agenda for a smaller number of carriers in Europe, that changes the attitude towards the Commission and, as Senator Manning said, it immediately deteriorates as regards how people see and engage with it. People cannot understand &ndash; perhaps the Commissioner will explain it to us &ndash; how the American Government can make tens of billions of pounds available to support its airline industry. We are supposedly on the same playing pitch. We, in this country, have a particular strategic interest, as the Commissioner will be aware, as will others. I do not want to get involved in that debate now because the Commissioner knows it as well as I do, but I would like to hear from him on it.</P>
      <P>In terms of budgetary policy, does the Commissioner's fellow Commissioners understand that until such time as convergence is achieved in all sorts of areas, especially in infrastructural and other areas, the idea of having an inflexible budgetary policy will not take account of the fact that budgetary policy will always have an asymmetric impact on our island, the Irish economy, and that, therefore, there needs to be a flexibility which we have not seen so far? I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on that issue also.</P>
      <P>Does the Commissioner support the view outlined by Senator Manning, but which I will put in perhaps sharper terms, that this is just fuelling euro-scepticism in this country and creating something that has never been seen before? Will the Commissioner respond to this? </P>
      <P>A section in the Commissioner's presentation was headed, A Federation of Nation States. It is an issue in which I am very interested. Will the Commissioner explore what exactly he means by this? It is not completely clear in the script and I think he shied away from it. He gave it a headline to get us interested and then made sure he said nothing that might be quoted in tomorrow morning's newspapers. In the very last days of the last British election Monsieur Jospin helped things along wonderfully with his famous comment on a<i> fédération </i>of independent sovereign states. I have been trying ever since to work out whether the translation of <i>fédération</i> allows for confederation as well as federation. I would like the Commissioner to indicate his views on the difference because there is a significant difference between a confederation and a federation. Perhaps one is less threatening than the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Commissioner agree that this type of engagement with parliamentarians at Com<Col N="720" /> mission level is crucial and that people need to see Commissioners getting down and dirty, as it were, with politicians in nation states? We are unclean here and the Commissioner has to be part of that also. We need an active interactive engagement. I would like to hear the Commissioner's views because we have been at great pains to get Commissioner Solbes to come here to discuss budgetary policy but to no avail so far. If he is not prepared to come and talk to us publicly where the people we represent can be seen to bring their views to the leadership of Europe, then that sense of isolation will not be bridged. These are the types of issues at which we are looking in the European forum. This is the kind of place in which we need reassurances from the Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Commissioner to the House. It is an historic day. To continue from what Senator O'Toole said, it is important that Europe is involved in our national institutions and our national Parliament and we should support any mechanism that can be devised to ensure that happens. It would be great to have all the Commissioners here at one time or other in the course of every year so that they could be questioned on their activities and that the divide between the European institutions and the national parliaments can be bridged to some extent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Commissioner's speech and the honesty with which he says that the European Union now has the opportunity, perhaps for the first time, to reflect on a number of fundamental questions, what it wishes to become; the repercussions of doubling its size and how it can maintain the momentum of its founders. These are fundamental questions which should have been addressed in an appropriate manner in terms of various countries, such as Ireland, before the Nice treaty was put to a vote. We have to find a mechanism to ensure we do not have a situation again where there is a huge deficit of information and such hostility builds up that the institutions and the principles on which Europe was founded could be in danger.</P>
      <P>I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner. The Commissioner could be the last or the second last Commissioner automatically appointed for this country. The proposal was that once the European Union was enlarged to 27 member states there would no longer be automatic commissionerships for any country. In the context of that decision, will he assess for us &ndash; he has not addressed it in his contribution &ndash; the value of the collegial aspect, which apparently was the reason the decision was taken, as distinct from the importance of having a Commissioner for each individual country and how that might be reflected in the operation of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" />In relation to his brief, health, safety and consumer affairs, he referred to the importance of Europe operating in the context of responding to international crises. The greatest international crisis for a long time was on 11 September and it has been responded to in different forms. One of the fallouts from it is the arrival of bio-terrorism, that is the scourge of the United States in the form of anthrax powder which is being distributed extremely easily. It appears there is easy access to it and that it can be easily distributed throughout the country. Will the Commissioner give the House an indication of the steps he is taking to ensure something of this nature does not arrive on the European mainland? There could be many more dangerous forms such as smallpox which would be easier to distribute and would become far more deadly. What steps are being taken to control the availability of such substances?</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest threat to the lives and health of this nation is Sellafield. The Commissioner stressed the importance of pooling our sovereignty and of big nations not exercising any undue power over smaller nations. We have a big neighbour who in the midst of an international crisis decided to commission a MOX facility. This is seen as an unfriendly gesture by a neighbouring country. While that country is gung-ho in the pursuit of terrorism in Afghanistan, it is leaving a timebomb on our doorstep which could have enormous implications for the lives of everybody on this island. What steps can be taken under the Commissioner's brief or by the European Union to deal with a threat of that nature? It seems we are virtually helpless in trying to take positive action to counteract it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>At the heart of the Commissioner's address is the question of sovereignty and the need for clarity as to how it is exercised. The Commissioner did clarify that in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to contributions to the recently established Forum for Europe and it seems there <Col N="722" /> is a perception that we, as a State, do not have an input into decisions. The Commissioner spoke of the triangular architecture of the Commission, Parliament and Council and pointed out that we can bring our ideas to these bodies. However, there is a perception that everything emanates from Brussels rather than being contributed to by the people. It is a two-way street. It is also the perception that our views are represented on the Council when matters are debated but do not seem to have a genuine input into the basic legislation introduced. I would be interested in the Commissioner's views on that and the question of a democratic deficit in relation to the input of the citizen.</P>
    <P>This remoteness is copperfastened when members of the Council visit us, stay in exclusive hotels and eat good dinners, sweeping in and sweeping out in their large motorcars or helicopters. This reinforces the view of citizens that Members are &lsquo;over there' and not part of what we are. I do not think there is an information deficit as the Commissioner suggests. There is a deluge of information but there is a comprehension deficit. The information is framed in language that the citizen does not understand. Again this reinforces the perception of remoteness.</P>
    <P>The concept of a federation of nation states stood out in the Commissioner's address. It was qualified later by his observations on federalism and I was reassured by it. This was central to the debate on the Treaty of Nice and I would be interested in the Commissioner's response to Senator O'Toole's question in this regard. The important question regarding the institutional architecture of the EU will become fraught in circumstances where there is a large membership.</P>
    <P>Another question arising from that, which was at the heart of the Treaty of Nice debate, was that of qualified majority voting and the use of the veto. It is not a view I subscribe to but there is a fear that smaller states would be swamped. I believe that a coalition of smaller states can be very effective and will be even more effective in an enlarged Union when countries like Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia are involved.</P>
    <P>There seem to be contradictory signals coming from the world trade talks in recent days as to whether there has or has not been progress. We have a central interest in the questions of demolishing tariff barriers and export subsidies and, on a global level, our commitment to the developing world. Some people seem to be saying that we are not going far enough in this direction. The Commissioner spoke about strengthening our position and I am interested to know how that can be achieved within the WTO and what his hopes are for the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If my speech was wide ranging, the questions have succeeded in matching it. I will do my best to answer this series of very important questions. Senator Cassidy asked me about Sellafield. I am aware that this is an issue of considerable concern in Ireland. Sellafield was last <Col N="723" /> inspected by the EU in 1993. The responsibility for this rests with my colleague, Commissioner Margot Wallstrolm, the Commissioner for the Environment. She is considering whether it is necessary to have a further inspection at this stage and I am in discussions with her on this issue. We have had one or two conversations about it and my people have been talking to her people about it. I know how deeply this issue is felt here. Commissioner Wallstrolm will be visiting Ireland on 28 or 29 November. No doubt there will be people who will ask questions in relation to this issue and I am sure she will be able to respond. I will convey to her that this issue has been raised by Senators and the likelihood that it will be raised by others on her visit.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the role of the Commission itself. He makes the point that it is a force for transformation and asks why we do not get more from it and why there is not greater acceptability of it. This is a complex question. There is a feeling that the Commission is remote and that there is no affection for it. That is probably, although not always, the case by and large. If there is so much good news, why can we not get benefits from the consequences of that? There is a number of reasons for this. Traditionally, when government ministers visit Brussels, either in the context of Council of Ministers or bilateral conversations with Commissioners on issues of concern to them, they return with either good news or bad news. If the news is bad, the minister will blame the Commissioners; if it is good, they praise themselves. This means that we are not always supported by government ministers in the Commission, even though there is a two-way process between the Commissioners and the ministers involved.</P>
      <P>We recently brought forward a proposal in relation to dioxin in fish. It was an important proposal for the protection of consumers and for reasons of health and food safety. Some member states, particularly the Nordic member states &ndash; who are, by reputation and image, at the forefront of food safety &ndash; had difficulties with the proposal. I will not go into details but they made a good case for derogations for a short period of time. We granted those derogations but I was not overwhelmed by gratitude when we did. I am not in the business for the sake of gratitude but it was sold by those member states on the basis that the derogation was a success achieved by the government rather than a response from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to do more to sell what we do and to become more visible. It is an obvious physical fact that there are only 20 of us. There are 626 Members of the European Parliament and therefore it is more difficult for us to be visible all the time. A unit has been set up in the Commission, comprising a group of Commissioners under the leadership of my colleague, António Vitorina, to address the question of effective communication <Col N="724" /> with the public, from which I hope we will get some good results.</P>
    <P>A press conference is held every day at the Commission at 12 o'clock. The spokespersons on the portfolios in the news at a particular time are available to answer questions. I am present quite regularly, as normally is one of my spokespersons. Any questions asked by the press have to be addressed in a full and complete way. In many respects the systems are in place, but the Senator is right in saying that for some reason there does not seem to be a good result from all this activity. There is a willingness and a desire to make sure the policies we are pursuing and the issues we are considering are not only made available to the public, but discussed with it.</P>
    <P>In this context we must bear in mind that it is the responsibility of Commissioners to be answerable to the European Parliament rather than to the parliaments of individual member states, which we seek and are happy to visit the parliaments. I have done this before, although I have not addressed a plenary session. I have addressed committees. To a large extent it has become the duty of Members of Parliament not only to question Commissioners in the context of the normal relationship between an executive and a legislature &ndash; the surveillance and monitoring of which are also important in the European Union context &ndash; but to convey the responses to the questions posed to Commissioners to their electorate. I am not fully convinced that that part of their job gets the same degree of attention as the surveillance role of the work of the Commission. That is a matter that might be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the role of national parliaments being involved more closely with European affairs. I mentioned briefly in my address that this was considered in the context of the Constitution review group in 1996. I examined it again last night. We said that Parliament should be involved and even identified Senators as having a role. Certainly that was a view I held at that time, but I do not know if it was written down.</P>
    <P>Parliaments have a role in reviewing legislation to be transposed into national law. Directives have to be transposed into the laws of member states. Parliaments have a function, not only in that area, but in the contact Ministers have before they visit Councils. They are required to visit a week or two in advance of meetings to identify the issues and the line a Minister is taking. A number of member states, including the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, do this. I have appeared before the committee in Sweden and it works very effectively. This is something that would be worthwhile instigating to bring national parliaments closer to the workings of the institutions of the European Union. Members of the European Parliament can be invited to a plenary session of the Seanad or parliamentary committees. I have appeared before parliamentary committees of this House and in many member states of the European Union, as have my colleagues. <Col N="725" /> That is as it should be, but MEPs might also be drawn more into the process.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the fact that I am the only Commissioner who cannot travel by train to my member state. He is probably right, particularly since the bridge was built between Denmark and Sweden. My colleague, Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, who lives in Finland would have a long trip by train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless we can joke. He would probably need to use a week of his holidays to achieve that. This is an issue of which people in the European Union are aware. I am sure the Senator raised this question in the context of the problems relating to Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a number of discussions with my colleague, Vice President Loyola de Palacio, who is responsible for this issue and she is conscious of this question. She is also conscious of the fact that a major proportion of Aer Lingus's traffic is with the United States and of the state aids and supports put in place in the United States arising from the events of 11 September for the benefit of the airline industry there. It must be borne in mind that member states and their Governments made the state aids rules, not the Commission. This comes back to what Senator Manning said. To some extent we end up having to implement the legislation put in place at the request of the Council of Ministers and when we do so we are the ones who bear the responsibility for the bad news. These state aid rules are in place and have to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner, but account must be taken of the factors the Senator raised. In the event of there being any area of discretion or margin of appreciation in coming to conclusions as to how to best respond to these problems, the types of considerations the Senator addressed such as the island status of Ireland must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Similarly on the question of budgetary policy, a matter for which I do not have responsibility, we must be careful in the euro zone to ensure there is budgetary discipline, otherwise we will have serious problems in relation to the status, standing, credibility and reputation of the euro. My colleague, Pedro Solbes, takes this aspect of his job very seriously. We have to go with the stability pact in place and the requirement that there will not be a deficit greater than 3%. While some of the larger member states are not exactly in difficulty in terms of this issue, nonetheless they have to be more vigilant about it, as has Ireland. This has not been lost on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the federation of nation states, one Senator asked the difference between &ldquo;federation&rdquo; and &ldquo;confederation&rdquo;. The classical difference is that in a federation power is in the <Col N="726" /> centre while in a confederation there is a regional situation. The word &ldquo;federation&rdquo; means different things to people. I understand what the Senator means by it, but the federal structural in Germany is quite different from the federal structure in the United States. The federal structure in the United States is as the Senator classically described it. The federal structure in Germany is more of a confederation than a federation, but called a federation. Similarly in Spain, power is devolved to 16 or 17 regions. I understand the concept of a federation of nation states to be closer to what the Senator understands it to be than what is traditionally understood to be the concept of confederation rather than federation. However, it depends on the area in question.</P>
    <P>If the powers devolved to the competence of the Commission were not devolved in the way they have been, in that, if parliaments of the member states were involved in the decision making process, I do not know if we would make the type of progress we need to make in those important areas. The process would be fractured. Enormous pressures would be brought to bear in areas of importance such as trade and competition by the individual member states. If parliament was involved in the process, there would be even further pressure that would fracture the process. This area, more so than others, is one where there is a more federal type of situation.</P>
    <P>To some extent it depends on what is agreed to be transferred to the competences of the Commission. This is done in an intergovernmental conference arrangement where each member state has a veto. I am not convinced that the way we did it in Nice was the right way to go about it. That is the reason a convention has been put in place to try to achieve a more broader discussion and to bring more stakeholders into the game, including Members of the European Parliament, parliaments of member states and other stakeholders, as we did with the drafting of the Charter on Fundamental Rights. There is a precedent for doing so again. If at the end of the process, member states agree with the other stakeholders that these are the powers that we will devolve in an exclusive competence to the European Union to be exercised and implemented by the Commission, that is the way it will be. Whereas I understand that people are concerned about decisions made in that context, we must always get back to the origin of this. This is what we have agreed to do, and what the Commissioners are undertaking is what they have been asked to carry out. That must always be taken into account.</P>
    <P>On engagement with the Commissioners, I fully agree with the Seanad on that, as do my colleagues who have spent much time visiting member states and addressing parliaments. I have done that in nearly all member states. I have met parliamentary committees either in the member state in question or when they came as a delegation to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked whether Com<Col N="727" /> missioners should be questioned here. I stress that our answerability is to the European Parliament. Nonetheless, there should be contact with parliaments in member states and whereas an occasion like this is hugely important and valuable, perhaps more contact could be made in the context of parliamentary committees dedicated to particular issues. I have spoken to committees on agriculture, food safety and health issues, my area of responsibility, and my colleagues have done the same. I suspect that might be a model for the future.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether I will be the last or second last Commissioner automatically appointed is raised in the context of the Nice treaty. What was said there was that on the arrival of the 27th member of the European Union, which I think is some distance away, there will be fewer Commissioners than member states, so I could be the 26th. That has not been decided. That will be decided in the context of a later discussion and it will also be decided with a veto, so Ireland will have its full say in relation to that. I have thought about that in the context of the Nice debate and it occurred to me that if there were 26 Commissioners and Ireland was chosen as the country not to have a Commissioner in the next Commission formed after the arrival of the 27th member, given that the length of the Commission is five years and that multiplied by 26 comes to 130 years, it would not be our turn for another 130 years. I am not so sure whether the Seanad is very agitated about that, but I am not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Commissioner learnt something in Newbridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important from a visibility point of view, but from a political point of view I am not sure it is. It is also important for each member state to have the maximum number of Commissioners. The Senator asked a question about the interplay between collegiality and the need to have somebody present from member states. Of course, we do not represent our member states. That would be completely wrong. On signing on, I signed a declaration to the effect that I will not take instructions from my member state &ndash; all of us signed that. That is the way things operate. At the same time we all know that if one comes from a particular member state, one has a feel and an understanding for matters relating to it. Members of the Seanad know this as well as I do. It is, therefore, important to have that reflected at the table because important decisions are taken there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side of the argument is that, taken to its logical conclusion, one could have a small college of Commissioners who are totally separated from their member states and who operate strictly as a college. That is probably what the Senator was getting at in his question. In theory that is certainly the case and maybe over time it might evolve in that way, but it would take some <Col N="728" /> time to get to that point. In considering this in the Commission in the context of our attitude to Nice, a number of us thought about this and there were a number of discussions on it. It crossed my mind that during what has become known as the beef war, where France and the UK had a difference of opinion about the importation of British beef into France, if we had, let us say, a college of ten or 12 Commissioners and there was neither a French nor a UK Commissioner at the table, acceptance of the decisions taken would have been much more problematic for the citizens of the member state most affected. That creates a political perception problem, particularly for smaller member states. This applies more to smaller member states than larger member states.</P>
    <P>The visibility in terms of the role of the Commissioner at the Commission is an issue of considerable importance. A number of my colleagues accept that view &ndash; even some from the larger member states express that view. It is an informal view but a strong view in the Commission that there should be the maximum number of Commissioners. There will be more debate on that issue when the time comes.</P>
    <P>In response to the question about 11 September, the Commissioners responded well to this. A General Council was held on 21 September when strong statements were made by the Council of Ministers and by the Commission. From my own point of view, I have been very heavily involved in this from the beginning. The Ghent European Council produced a statement requiring the Commission to respond to these issues. I have since visited the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which is the foremost institution in the world in relation to communicable diseases and these kinds of issues. I also attended a G7 Plus meeting in Ottawa last week where the Secretary for Health from the United States and his equivalents from Canada, Mexico, Japan, France, Germany and Italy were present to discuss these issues. Our technical people at member state level and the Commission have met. The Ministers for health and I had a meeting about ten days ago on this. The Health Council will meet tomorrow to discuss this issue. There will be a conclusion from the Health Council and there will be a press conference, and information will be conveyed in that context.</P>
    <P>To summarise, various networks for surveillance, particularly of communicable diseases, have been in place since 1998. There is also an early warning and response system network in place. They are my responsibility. There is a rapid response network for problems in relation to food and dangerous products. These will now be drawn together in conjunction with a further network that exists under the responsibility of my colleague, Commissioner Wallstrolm, the Commissioner for environment, a network on civil protection. We want to better co-ordinate these networks and work together with networks that exist in individual member states, of which there are many, to ensure that if there are problems on <Col N="729" /> the horizon in any individual member state they are identified and the Commission and other member states will know about them in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In addition, I had a meeting yesterday with the chief executive officers of a number of pharmaceutical companies who have formed a task force to identify availability of vaccines and drugs, capacity for the production of drugs and emergency response to requests from the Commission or member states in relation to this. We are looking at the need to put in place a system for the stockpiling of vaccines and relevant drugs at Commission level to be available wherever an outbreak takes place, not just relying on the stockpiles that exist in individual member states where they may look after their own citizens, in circumstances where a member state may not be well endowed with drugs or vaccines.</P>
    <P>We need to look at this at Union level and that is what we are doing. I will bring a communication to the Commission for discussion of the outcome of the 27 November talks. We are working at present on that with our people and with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that we have the best possible systems in place for rapid response and for alerts, and to ensure the availability of such medicines as may be necessary to respond to issues like this that may arise. We are taking this very seriously. We are working very hard on it and we are bringing forward proposals. It is not just that we are responding to the events of 11 September. These networks such as the one on communicable disease were in place before 11 September. What we are doing now is examining the system, fine tuning it and adjusting it to make sure it will work in response to events that might arise similar to the issues that we are concerned about arising from 11 September.</P>
    <P>I was asked about Sellafield and I may have answered that question.</P>
    <P>My fellow countyman, Senator Dardis, mentioned the perception that states do not have an input into the decision making process of the European Union. Actually, 90% of the legislation and initiatives that go through the system are requested by the Council of Ministers or by the European Parliament. This is something that is not fully understood. The Commission has the treaty obligation and responsibility for initiation of policy but it is often triggered by reference to this kind of contact.</P>
    <P>I agree that there does not appear to be the necessary delivery of information back to member states and citizens. I do not wish to appear critical but it is important that there are only 20 Irish members among the 620 members of the Parliament. We should not lose sight of this. It is their role to question Commissioners and, when they get answers, to convey those answers to their electorate. We do not strictly have constituents, although we take seriously the responsibility for conveying information to the public. I think we should do more.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to Senator Manning, we have <Col N="730" /> press conferences every day and we are setting up a strategy to improve our communication with the public. People are genuinely aware that there is a problem in this area. Under President Prodi's responsibility we recently published a White Paper on governance which I would encourage the Members to read. It is a valuable lesson in how decision making is carried out, explaining how we go about our business, how we come to conclusions, how we develop policy into legislation and who should be involved. I hope we will make more progress on this issue. I have long been an advocate of simple language, particularly for legislation. It was also one of my hobby-horses as Attorney General. I believe we can all do better &ndash; short sentences and small words are best.</P>
    <P>Development in world trade is important for Ireland. I referred earlier to some statistics showing that an enormous amount of what we produce is exported. The World Trade Organisation is of great importance. Given our size &ndash; Ireland contains 1% of the population of the European Union &ndash; we can have a greater influence on world trade development through the mechanism of the institutions of the European Union, particularly through the Commission where there is an exclusive competence in this area exercised by my colleague, Commissioner Pascal Lamy. All the concerns of the member states are taken into account. As I came here this morning I was told that there may be a conclusion but the outcome is not certain. Export subsidisation is certainly one of the issues of concern. Our trading partners, including the USA and the CAIRNS group, are very concerned about export subsidies. There are of course other forms of supports for agriculture that our trading partners sometimes tend to forget to put into the pool for discussion. My colleagues, Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, make sure these issues are on the table whenever the European Union is unduly pressurised on export subsidies.</P>
    <P>The commitment to the developing world is also something we have discussed. Commissioner Lamy introduced a proposal earlier this year, known as the Everything but Arms proposal, which effectively means that there is now the possibility of tarriff-free importation of everything but arms from identified and designated countries, including the very poorest of developing countries. This is an important development and is well appreciated by the countries who benefit. Curiously, those countries who are better-off than the selected countries and developing themselves considered it unfair discrimination against them. Sometimes when one feels one is moving in the right direction and producing good results there are spin-offs and side-effects that have to be addressed, which is what Commissioner Lamy is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy that the Commissioner made about the railway track is one that could be reversed. Once on a Seanad cam<Col N="731" /> paign we came across a car crash. We pulled an American from the side of the road and she asked whether she was on the right road to Tralee. My companion said, &ldquo;Yes, but you are going in the wrong direction.&rdquo;  One must be careful when talking about being on the right or the wrong side.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has been very open in his address to the Seanad and in his answers to questions. The House has been addressed by other Commissioners who gave set piece responses which meant nothing. There is a democratic deficit emerging in Europe. It was emphasised here by the low turnout for the Nice referendum but it has also been demonstrated in every election throughout Europe over the last five or six years. There is a remoteness about the role of national parliaments and of the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission. Nobody knows what they do except when they see the results. The Commissioner stated that there is a press conference every day.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning mentioned the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation which I was on from 1977 under the chairmanship of Mary Robinson. We received reams of stuff from Europe. I am now on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I have never had one communication from the Commission or from a Commissioner except when I asked for something. The Commissioner mentioned effective communication with the public. Surely there should be some communication with representatives of the public.</P>
      <P>Those who gain most from the trade in arms are members of the European Union, some of which are probably the biggest exporters of arms apart from the USA. If poorer countries are allowed to export everything except arms to Europe tariff-free the European arms industry, which is a huge problem, will be built up. How many countries in Europe have signed up to international conventions on the storage and production of chemical weapons? What is Europe doing to make certain that the international convention is adhered to by bigger countries who are now suggesting that anthrax is being spread in the USA? How much anthrax is under the control of the American Government? How many biochemical weapons are under the control of the American Government and why has it not supported the international convention on their storage and production?</P>
      <P>A huge number of questions could be asked here but I have been asked to be short. We get very little opportunity to discuss European or world affairs in the Seanad, which is not because the Leader does not allow us. I ask that Commissioner Byrne and his fellow Commissioners be more open with national parliaments and their committees. Equally, the Commissioner should suggest to the Council of Ministers that it be more open with us before it makes decisions that affect us all.</P>

      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Commissioner to the House. He has shown that he can speak in an easy, communicable way, but also very honestly. He has also given us clear answers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of transport in terms of the problems with Aer Lingus. I would like to be more specific on the question of regional disparity. As a Senator from the mid-west, I hope there will not be regional disparity and in that regard echo the fears of Senators west of the Shannon. The message I would like the Commissioner to bring back to the appropriate Commissioner for regional affairs is that account must be taken of the problems of transport and linkage. Let me give an example. There are now no early morning flights to Dublin, or 10.15 p.m. night flight, to facilitate the small and multinational companies which have chosen to locate in the mid-west region because of the closeness of Shannon Airport. This means that a businessman or woman from the mid-west travelling to Paris &ndash; we no longer have a direct flight to Paris &ndash; will only have one and a half hours for a business meeting compared to at least eight or nine for his or her equivalent in Dublin. What does this say to business people in the mid-west and the west? As they stated at a major meeting the other night organised by IBEC, SFADCo and Aer Rianta, they will not locate west of the Shannon because it is not competitive for them to do so due to the difficulty in getting to their European meetings. That is a simple fact.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner referred to an Irish model for Europe. While I understand our attractiveness in terms of our efficient and flexible administration and capacity for speedy response, I would have liked the Commissioner to raise the issue of transport because there will not be a speedy response west of the Shannon. People will not be able to travel to the European power houses, which is a major problem for people west of the Shannon in terms of the next time we vote in a referendum on the Nice treaty. It will be seen specifically as the European model not looking at the regions that are not part of the greater Dublin area. I have to state this repeatedly because the warning bells are ringing. If businessmen and women cannot get to their appropriate meetings, their companies will not locate west of the Shannon. That is what they are saying. They say that tourism interests are very much to the fore in making their case in terms of America, but their voices have not been heard. I hope the Commissioner will bring my concerns to the attention of the appropriate people.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Commissioner. This is a useful and excellent exercise, if I can call it that. There is no doubt that Ireland has benefited from Europe since its accession in 1973, but I am concerned about the warning from the European Court of Auditors, mentioned by the Commissioner in his address, that Ireland and other EU countries tolerate an unacceptable level <Col N="733" /> of accounting errors when dealing with EU funds. It also said that all EU countries do not treat taxpayers' money from Europe with the same diligence shown to national corporate funds, and annual reports warned of problems with both Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy for the seventh year in a row. Seven years is a very long time. If a farmer made an error in an application for area aid or a premium payment in one year, he would correct it.</P>
      <P>Why do these accounting errors occur? Is it because of fraudulently based claims or simple accounting errors? These substantial errors are unacceptable and the penalties are severe. Why do the countries concerned not try to correct them and be more vigilant?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Commissioner to the House. He could not have anticipated that his portfolio would become so active so quickly with the problems that have arisen in the area of food. Is his department of the Commission addressing the situation regarding the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria in many animal products? I bring this matter to his attention because it has become a serious issue in America where many animals are treated on a broad basis with antibiotics, and I do not just mean growth promoters. I read in a recent report that 80% of ground beef in America contains antibiotic resistant bacteria. That is a shocking figure, especially when they can show that infections in America are being caused by this bacteria. I have not seen anything of the same taking place in Europe, but, as a doctor, I monitor the situation carefully. Are we monitoring it on an international basis in Europe, and is the Commissioner's department ready to respond? It has been suggested in America that the treatment of animals by antibiotics in food and water should be stopped immediately. Have we examined this issue?</P>
      <P>Senator Costello should be reassured regarding anthrax because there are hundreds of times more anthrax in many facilities throughout the United States than is available in Europe. It is very easy to obtain anthrax in America, but not here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>All right. Senator Lanigan started his contribution by saying nobody knows what I do, but I hope I have done something to alleviate that problem this morning. On a serious level, it is important that we make sure there is good contact between those of us who work at European level and those working in member states. It is a two way street in that there is an obligation imposed on us to make sure that we make citizens aware of what we do. There is also a responsi<Col N="734" /> bility on elected representatives in member states &ndash; Senator Manning may have touched on this &ndash; to inform themselves about what is happening at European level and seek to determine what are the issues going through the system. I realise this can be difficult in the sense that at a national level politicians in member states are more concerned about national issues, but my office is always responsive to queries made by elected representatives from member states. I have a rule that we respond to those queries quickly, and we do so. I am aware that my colleagues accept the same responsibility in answering these questions and respond quickly to any questions from members of parliament.</P>
      <P>I accept the import of the Senator's criticism that not enough is being done in this area. There is a belief that those of us in Europe are in a remote place and that we do not have proper contact with people in terms of what is going on. This is something about which those of us in the Commission, and the European Parliament, are very concerned. I indicated that perhaps one of the ways we can address this is by having an elected President of the Commission, either by general franchise or elected by members of parliament. We are examining many different issues and our White Paper on governance addresses it. It is an issue of particular concern, but I also urge institutions such as this to issue invitations, through the committee system, to my colleagues and MEPs to make presentations in the way we have done today.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;anything but arms&rdquo; proposal was designed to help the poorest countries identified in order that they could get the products they produce into the European Union tariff free to pursue the issue of trade as well as aid. It is a good proposal. Although I was not responsible for leaving out arms, the reason was probably a desire not to build up the arms industry in other countries. I do not believe it was intended to protect the arms industry in the European Union and have certainly not heard that interpretation before.</P>
      <P>We have no competence with regard to chemical weapons. The availability of anthrax and similar matters concerns me in that I have to determine the nature and size of the problem to which we have to respond. We are examining the question. I am slightly more concerned with smallpox because it is a communicable disease which could, ultimately, cause more problems than anthrax.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman asked me about flights. The routing of flights and related matters are determined by an interaction between regulation and market forces. While these are often governed by the open skies policy of the EU, this policy is almost exclusively a matter for the member states. As it is governed by the Ministers for transport, my colleague, Commission Vice President de Palacio, does not have much control over it. She administers the policy, but essentially decision making lies with member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reference to &ldquo;speedy response&rdquo; related to <Col N="735" /> decision making, notably at an executive level, for which Ireland is renowned.</P>
    <P>I believe Senator Rory Kiely's question related to the report of the Court of Auditors published in Strasbourg on the night before last. It identifies a number of accounting errors by member states. My understanding is that the errors, at least as they related to Ireland, are identified as errors. Fraud or anything of that nature does not arise. This issue is always addressed by the Court of Auditors. Its function is to identify these kinds of problems and publish information on them so that they will, hopefully, be addressed. That is the purpose of the exercise. The auditors focus on the errors taking place in member states. Their work is not directed at the Commission, but at the way in which the administrations in member states handle Structural Funds, CAP transfers and other large funds which go through the system.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about antibiotic resistance. I am aware the Senator is concerned about this issue, having written to me about it. The Commission is also very concerned. Antibiotic resistance is constantly discussed. Recently, I spoke on it in the European Parliament and legislation on the subject is being processed.</P>
    <P>We have eliminated all antibiotics in animal feed which have a cross-relationship with antibiotics used for humans. This leaves only three, perhaps four, antibiotics, none of which has a cross-relationship with antibiotics used in human medicine. We have decided to phase these out as well, which means there will soon be no antibiotics in animal feed. We are monitoring this issue. Our objective is to reach a point at which antibiotics are used only for medicinal purposes.</P>
    <P>We have introduced a ban on the importation of beef from the United States which contains hormones. That does not mean we do not have a programme for importing cattle from the United States which have not been treated with hormones. The issue is taken very seriously and I am regularly questioned about it on the Agriculture Council. Several Ministers regard it as extremely important, as do we in the Commission, and a number of Members of the European Parliament follow this dossier very closely. I assure the Senator the matter is very high on the agenda.</P>

      <P>As Leader of the House and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I express sympathy on the occasion of the death of Dr. Patrick Quinlan, a former Member of this House who passed away at Cork University Hospital last week. Patrick, who was a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1957 to 1977, was elected to the National University of Ireland panel and served on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges between 1965 and 1973. He was also a member of the Library Joint Committee from 1957 to 1965.</P>
      <P>Patrick was professor of mathematical physics at University College, Cork, and a leading figure in the academic world. He was a member of the governing body of the college, chairman of the Cork branch of the graduates association between 1960 and 1964 and a fellow of the Institute of Advanced Studies from 1971. Perhaps he will be most remembered for his many publications, of which <i>A Dynamic Model of the Irish Economy,</i> published in 1961, and <i>The Edge Function Method,</i> published in 1968, were but two.</P>

He was a brilliant mathematician and used his expertise in this field in the design of aircraft wings. When America set up its space centre in Cape Canaveral, it was anxious to recruit Professor Quinlan because of his expertise. He was highly regarded in the academic world. He was also a traditionalist in the very best sense of the word. He held very strong views on many social issues, but nevertheless was very tolerant of other people's views.</P>

I was very much in awe of him as a Senator, professor and doctor of mathematical physics. I met a man who was fun and strongly opinionated about the lovely island of Ireland. He served in the Seanad for 20 years &ndash; I did not realise he was here for so long until I read of his death. Those who got to know him in the university area of Cork admired him for his good nature as well as his wonderful abilities, which were outlined by Senators Cassidy and Joe Doyle.

He was an academic person who got very much involved in committee work, published various works and had an enormous contribution to make in an intellectual fashion with regard to the workings of this House.

He was called Tubby Quin<Col N="738" /> lan, which was a term of endearment as much as anything else. He died in the fullness of his years. He had a long and very productive life. He was a fine scholar and academic, but he was a great deal more than that, as was said by others, particularly Senator Joe Doyle. His academic ideas were more than theories in a textbook. They were applied practically. He oversaw the practical application of many of the theories he and his colleagues worked out.</P>
      <P>His contribution to the development of science and engineering was immense. During his time in UCC, the faculty of engineering was the envy of every university in the world, and I hope and believe it still is. That was due in no small part to the leadership he gave. Like a number of people who came to this House from that college &ndash; such as Professor Dooge, Professor John A. Murphy and Professor Joe Lee among others &ndash; he made a great contribution to political life. That, I suppose, is why we particularly remember him today. Very often, his ideas were those that may have sparked off a good reaction in others, but they were always very worthwhile.</P>
      <P>In essence, he made a great contribution to scholarship, learning and civic, political and cultural life, and his legacy will endure.</P>

We have not had a full debate on traffic arrangements and how effective the Government's policy is in dealing with the problem. Will the Leader consider inviting the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to outline the plans in this regard? It could also be done in conjunction with a debate on road developments, which are likely to take place. Senators have asked for such a debate before. In the meantime, it would be appropriate not to toll traffic going through the toll bridge during the peak hours in the morning and afternoon to get a free flow of traffic on the M50, which caters for people from all over the country travelling to Dublin, as well as Dublin people.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate on the economy? This has been requested on a number of occasions. Developments are taking place from day to day that warrant debate, the most recent one being an indication by the Minister for Finance that he may cut back on the national development plan. There is a whole range of issues in terms of services and the commitments that will be made by the Government. Coming up to the budget on 6 December, it would be worthwhile if we had a decent, broad ranging debate on the issue so we can hear what the Minister is thinking and make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the waste management strategy, which seems to be falling apart? The recent Supreme Court decision in the Cork Corporation case which indicated that the corpor<Col N="740" /> ation was not entitled to penalise householders by not collecting their household waste if they refuse to pay will cause a logistical nightmare if any of the local authorities proceed with it. Dublin Corporation has collected only about a quarter of the amount billed for this year alone. Clearly the number of bills outstanding is more than 100,000. Imagine that number of cases going through the courts. We are faced with a nightmare and we need to know what is taking place, especially as we are approaching the adoption of estimates in local authorities. A range of issues needs to be addressed but first and foremost is the waste management strategy of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>There has been a number of calls recently from Members, including Senator Burke, for a debate on the insurance industry. I repeat that call to the Leader. Will he make arrangements for us to discuss personal injuries claims? The editor of the <i>Irish Medical Directory </i>alleged recently that personal injuries claims cost this country £1.2 billion last year. That is very serious. The same doctor alleged that a number of doctors are being bullied by solicitors in the manner in which these claims are advanced. Doctors are under a sufficiency of pressures with the increased expectations of patients on the one hand and shrinking resources on the other without being bullied by even one solicitor. This is an issue which causes me grave concern and it needs to be debated fully in the House. Will the Leader attend to that?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate certain education issues? A specific matter was raised with me recently and I would like to know where responsibility lies in the Department of Education and Science for the vetting of textbooks used in schools. I will give an example so that the Leader can see the enormity of the problem.</P>
      <P>Inappropriate and controversial language was used in a little poem meant to stimulate students. In the poem a computer is asked what it thinks of grandparents, and it answers that they should be exterminated because they are useless and not of any value. I consider that emotive and inappropriate language for a young child who possibly believes a computer does not tell lies. No one seems to know where this book came from, how it was included in the curriculum and who vets the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know when Gemma Hussey was Minister that she gender proofed textbooks and vetted them with regard to inappropriate language relating to males and females. I would hate to think issues such as this might creep into textbooks because someone was not keeping a watchful eye. Is it the responsibility of the National Council for <Col N="741" /> Curriculum Assessment or is left to teachers? Do the Minister's officials check these books? It is time for a debate in light of this controversial issue.</P>

      <P>We should have a debate on the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture and on insurance. We had a debate on this topic a few years ago and many of the things I said then are now being said by the doctor to whom Senator Quill referred. We all know lawyers would not advertise &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; services were they not making a great deal of money. Unfortunately, the awards people receive amount to very little once lawyers, doctors and banks are paid. Lawyers encourage people to borrow money on the basis of the awards they will receive. They borrow for two or three years and, when they get the money, they must pay back double what they borrowed and the entire award is squandered. It is a system which should be abolished.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to explain to the House the working of the law on asylum? I will give one reason it is of immediate urgency. In light of the fact that he concluded an agreement with the Nigerian authorities recently and that he apparently regards that country as a safe place to which to return people from here, I highlight the case of a young woman, Safiya Hussaini Tungar-Tudu &ndash; it may be a funny name but what happened to her is not the slightest bit funny &ndash; who had sexual relations outside marriage and became pregnant. She has been sentenced to death by stoning. The court has decided that, immediately on delivering the baby, the woman is to be stoned to death. This is an outrage. The House ought to investigate the thinking behind the apparent belief of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it is safe to return people to a jurisdiction which has laws such as these and which implements them fully.</P>

Does the Minister have a strategy in mind for the Dublin region whose traffic <Col N="742" /> problems will peak between now and Christmas? Unless there is a traffic management plan and gardaí implementing it from early on, there will be a complete stalemate within a week. It is timely for the Minister to come to the House and give us a warning about what plans he has in mind so that the public will understand something will be done about this.</P>

      <P>I also support calls for a debate on the insurance industry. Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to explain to us how the Government plans to deal with the implications for many bodies throughout the country, such as local authorities and voluntary agencies and groups, of the massive increase in insurance costs, especially since the events of 11 September? It is clear that insurance costs have doubled in many cases, especially public liability insurance costs. The Government will have to take a view on it at some stage because many groups will make a case to it that they cannot afford to meet these insurance costs.</P>
      <P>Can we get clarity at some stage on where the national development plan lies given the confusing signals we receive from different sources at Government level? Members are entitled to know over what timescale the Government intends to roll out the national development plan and how it plans to fund it. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to explain this to the House so that we would at least have clarity on the issue?</P>

      <P>My concern, which might be related to and could be raised under the issue of transport, which was raised by Senator Ormonde, is the cost of parking in Dublin city. A pay and display system is in operation. Last night I saw six cars clamped near the hotel where I stay. I am sure they could have been country people who came up to Dublin and, in their innocence, did not know that one must pay and display from 7 a.m. until midnight. It would not be too bad if it were from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. but until midnight is a pure disgrace. It is an unfair means of exacting money from people. Those whose cars were clamped had to pay a large amount of money to <Col N="743" /> have the clamps removed. Will the Leader use his influence to ensure shorter hours are introduced for the pay and display system so as to be fair to everyone?</P>

Will the Leader give us a likely date for that debate and indicate when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can come to the House? People are extremely concerned about this matter, a debate on which would provide Members with the opportunity to discuss the question of the fluoridation of water and whether we are able to challenge this rather than assuming that what we have accepted in the past will automatically be the case. The fact that we are not reaching EU requirements in regard to water quality is a matter worthy of serious consideration by everyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on the insurance industry. I know the Leader has a keen interest in this area and ask him to arrange a wide ranging debate on all aspects of the industry. We are faced with a ludicrous situation where young people who do not have insurance are driving cars. In addition, business people are either unable to afford to pay for public liability cover on their premises or cannot obtain such cover.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss local government, particularly in light of the fact that most local authorities are in the process of adopting their estimates? Great pressures and additional costs are being placed on them on foot of the requirements in Better Local Government and their responsibility for the disposal of refuse. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has imposed a £15 per tonne charge on local authority waste delivered to dumps. Nobody knows to where this money will go, but the charge is placing an added burden on local authorities. Will the Leader, as a matter of urgency, ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter?</P>

      <P>Senators Costello and O'Meara requested a debate on the economy. As everyone knows, the Minister for Finance may have been misrepresented, misread or misheard on radio in recent days. There will be no cut backs on the national development plan, it is merely being realigned. I can only guess that the reasons for this came about on foot of the events of 11 September. There has never been as much money available and never will there have been as much money spent in the history of the State as will be spent during the next five to six years, particularly on the development of roads and other parts of our infrastructure. Those Members &ndash; there are few enough in the House &ndash; who provide employment and are involved in job creation are looking forward to work beginning in earnest, I hope, in the third quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also called for a debate on waste management. As I have already stated, this is the single greatest challenge facing local authorities.

      <P>Senators Quill, Farrell, Coghlan, O'Meara and Burke asked for an urgent debate on the insurance industry.

    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on water quality. I welcome the statement by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, on this matter in the past week. In light of the sentiments expressed in that statement and also the request from Senator Quinn, I will have no difficulty in making time available for such a debate.</P>

    <Title>Youth Work Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to propose the Youth Work Bill, 2000, to Seanad Éireann. Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, I have given priority to the Bill. Today, Seanad Éireann has the opportunity to debate this ground-breaking legislation aimed at giving a sound framework to the provision, co-ordination, monitoring, evaluation and development of youth work programmes and services.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the end result of many years of effort entailing detailed research, consultation and discussion among everybody interested in youth work. It is the culmination of an extensive consultation process. The report of the national youth policy committee, which was chaired by Mr. Justice Declan Costello, issued in September 1984, was the first important document on youth work in Ireland. It was followed in 1993 by a report by the consultative group on the development of youth work which made a number of recommendations on the development of youth work provision, particularly as regards definitions, underlying principles, characteristics of youth work, evaluation and youth work structures. Much of what is contained in the Bill draws to a significant degree on the consultative group's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be recalled that the previous Administration was responsible for the Youth Work Act, 1997, which was a follow-up to the consulta<Col N="746" /> tive group's report. However, this was predicated on the establishment of education boards. After the change of Government in 1997 it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of education boards and, instead, base the local youth work provision with the vocational education committees. Accordingly, the Youth Work Act, 1997, had to be revisited when it became evident that a replacement Bill, rather than an amendment Bill, was required. This being the case, I began discussions with relevant youth work organisations and bodies in order to give them an opportunity to subscribe to the new Youth Work Bill, 2000. In addition, my officials and I met representatives of several of the interest groups. The submissions, meetings, etc., that formed part of my comprehensive and widespread consultative process fed into the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of very important features. First, it gives a clear definition to youth work by defining it as being a &ldquo;programme of education designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation and which is (a) complementary to their formal, academic or vocational education and training, and (b) provided primarily by Voluntary Youth Work organisations.&rdquo;  This definition was arrived at after exhaustive consultation and because of this, has met with general acceptance.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation outlines in comprehensive detail the youth work functions of the Minister. These include responsibility for the development and co-ordination of youth work policies, programmes and services; co-ordination with education and other programmes; research; monitoring and assessment of youth work programmes and services; gender issues; particular regard for those aged ten to 21 years of age and those socially or economically disadvantaged; directions on the manner of youth work; joint action by two or more vocational education committees and the establishment of a national youth work advisory committee. As I have already mentioned, these functions are comprehensive and detailed.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of education boards. Because of this, it was decided that the appropriate local body in the case of youth work would be the vocational education committee. Thus, vocational education committees will have a central and pivotal role to play at local level in the delivery of youth work programmes and services. The vocational education committees will have a number of functions.</P>
    <P>A very important provision in the Bill is that relating to the appointment of an assessor of youth work. The Minister will be enabled to appoint such an assessor who will have a key role to play in the evaluation of youth work programmes and services on grounds of efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the appointment by the Minister of a national youth work advisory <Col N="747" /> committee. This committee, which will have equal representation from the statutory and voluntary youth work areas with an independent chairman, will primarily have an advisory role to the Minister in terms of youth work provision, development of policies, establishment of criteria for the approval of various designations of youth work organisations, etc. It will, therefore, be the major independent source of advice for the Minister on youth work matters and, accordingly, is of crucial importance. Such a committee was established under the provisions of the Youth Work Act, 1997, and continues to operate.</P>
    <P>At this point I express my appreciation of the work the present committee has done and the continuing advice it is giving to me on matters relative to youth work. At my request, it is in the process of finalising a national youth work development plan which will chart the way forward for youth work over the next five years or so. I understand this plan is nearing finality and look forward to receiving it. Again, I extend my thanks to the committee members who have given selflessly of their time and expertise towards delivering this plan.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the legislation will be the creation of VEC sub-committees described as youth work committees. These committees will have equal representation from statutory and voluntary youth work organisations. Their main purpose will be to advise and make recommendations to the vocational education committees on matters relating to youth work provision in their respective administration areas. It is intended that the composition of the youth work committees will reflect the major players involved with youth work provision at local level. One half of the youth work committee will come from the voluntary sector and the Bill allows for the creation of voluntary youth councils to enable this to take place. Guidelines and regulations on elections may be issued by the Minister following consultation with the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. We will thus have a structure more responsive to the needs of local areas and closer to community interests.</P>
    <P>What follows in the Bill relates to the categorisation of youth work organisations. First, there is the issue of prescribed national representative youth work organisations. As the National Youth Council of Ireland represents the majority of youth work organisations, I have named it in the legislation to be the prescribed national organisation. This situation will be reviewed every three years. Provision is made in the Bill for the Minister to grant authorised organisation status to organisations which might from time to time engage in the provision of a youth work programme or service.</P>
    <P>The third category is that of approved national youth work organisation. This refers to national youth work organisations such as Fóroige, the National Youth Federation, etc., grant-aided by my Department. The last category refers to desig<Col N="748" /> nated local youth work organisations where the power of designation is entrusted to the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The resource allocation function exercised centrally by the Department in regard to local and regional youth work programmes and services will, therefore, be devolved from the Department of Education and Science to the vocational education committees. As a result, not alone will decision making take place at the more appropriate local level, but the Department will be freed up sufficiently to enable it to concentrate more closely on vital issues such as national policy formulation, overall planning and development, assessment of performance, financial management, quality assurance and the national distribution of funding. This will be in full accordance with precedents of devolution in other European countries, most notably, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, many of which had previously, like ourselves, a tradition of highly centralised control of all aspects of the education system.</P>
    <P>The Bill also underpins the primacy of the volunteer in youth work. The most significant way in which the Bill will do this is through the establishment of voluntary youth councils of volunteer youth leaders throughout the country. These councils will have several crucial functions, including the power to nominate 50% of the members of each vocational area youth work committee, the duty of advising the relevant vocational area in relation to its youth work planning and the role of providing a forum for local voluntary youth work organisations. In this way, the Bill should help to ensure volunteerism will continue to flourish in the youth service. This is a major concern for me because volunteerism is the key to real success in the provision of youth work services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the voluntary youth councils, among the innovative provisions of the Bill are that at least one fifth of the membership of each council will be set aside for volunteer youth leaders under the age of 25 years and that there will be special provision for volunteer youth leaders working with the Traveller community. Hence, the council will encourage youth participation and assist in the empowerment of the Traveller youth work sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill does not neglect the all important issue of accountability in the expenditure of public money. Several of its provisions, especially the provisions regarding monitoring and assessment, afford a means of demonstrating the benefits and the value for money of youth work and ensuring public funds expended on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed the Bill in the Lower House. During the Dáil debate I indicated my acceptance of various amendments proposed to give equal prominence to the issue of reports in Irish, persons living in Gaeltacht areas and representation on the youth work committee from <Col N="749" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta where a vocational education committee functions in a Gaeltacht area and representation on voluntary youth councils. I also moved an amendment in order to distinguish the two groups to which particular regard should be given in relation to youth work requirements, that is, those aged between ten and 21 years and those socially or economically disadvantaged. This occurs in a number of places in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I reconsidered the membership of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. I was satisfied that as part of this review, the membership for the Irish Vocational Education Association should be increased from two to four. I have allowed also for a commensurate increase in regard to representation for voluntary youth work organisations. I also moved an amendment to section 19 to give greater clarity in relation to the working arrangements between vocational education committees and youth work committees. Furthermore, amendments to provide for the appointment of the chairperson and vice-chairperson by the youth work committee from among the VEC representatives were accepted.</P>
    <P>In relation to youth work committees &ndash; section 20 &ndash; I moved an amendment to provide for additional nominations to the committee by the Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. These additions will serve to enhance the activities of the youth work committees at local VEC level. I also undertook to reconsider the composition of voluntary youth councils as provided for in section 22. I am satisfied that as a result of this re-examination, the composition of the council, as I have advanced it in the Bill, strikes the right balance as to the representation between volunteers and paid youth workers.</P>
    <P>The issue of ethnic groups was raised in regard to the voluntary youth councils &ndash; section 22(7) &ndash; and I promised to consider the matter further. On the basis of the advice I have received I am satisfied that any concerns on this issue may be addressed under the terms of the Equal Status Act, 2000, and do not, therefore, propose anything further on this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the prescribed national representative youth work organisation. In this case, I moved an amendment on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann to the effect of prescribing the National Youth Council of Ireland as the prescribed organisation. Such prescription will be subject to three year renewal periods.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the prescribed national representative youth work organisations. In this case, I moved an amendment on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann to the effect of prescribing the National Youth Council of Ireland as the prescribed organisation. Such prescription will be subject to three year renewal periods. I did this as I was satisfied that the National Youth Council of Ireland represents the vast majority of youth work organisations in this country. This prescription has, of course, been welcomed by the NYCI.</P>
    <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to <Col N="750" /> section 13(4) dealing with the categories of young persons to be catered for in the VEC development plan and to say that formal correction is required in section 13(4)<i>(a) (iii) </i>with the insertion of the words &ldquo;young persons&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;who are living in a Gaeltacht area and or whose first language is Irish&rdquo;. This correction arises from the need to clarify and remove any ambiguity in interpretations in the text of the amendments put forward in Dáil Éireann by Deputy Creed, which I accepted. I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, under Standing Order 121 to direct the Clerk to make this correction.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent from what I have said in relation to amendments that I adopted an open mind on constructive amendments in Dáil Éireann. This is reflected in the amendments that I have accepted or proposed. I have been prepared to accept amendments where, for example, they have given greater clarity to the provisions of the Youth Work Bill, 2000. I am satisfied, therefore, that the Bill before the Seanad today adequately reflects the widespread consultative process resulting in the proper philosophy and structures for a modern youth work policy and provision in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the Bill which is long awaited. The Youth Work Bill, 2000, will provide for a national youth work advisory committee to report to the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science on youth work programmes and services. It will formalise procedures and arrangements to enhance youth work already being carried out by organisations and agencies. Investment in youth work is vital if we hope to deal in a proactive rather than in a reactive manner with the many problems in society. Youth work can help reduce crime and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, vocational education committees will have to prepare three-year costed youth development plans to be reviewed annually and an assessor of youth work will examine the efficiency and effectiveness of existing youth work programmes. Each VEC will be empowered to appoint youth work committees. The vocational education committees will have to submit youth work budgets to the Minister for approval, detailing their programmes and services. The Minister will be empowered to make annual grants available to vocational education committees, approve national voluntary youth work organisations and designate local voluntary youth work organisations and will publish an annual list of all approved voluntary work organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party welcomes the Bill, which is long overdue. The Minister of State said this Bill was pub<Col N="751" /> lished when he decided not to proceed with the establishment of the education boards. It has taken four and a half years to bring this Bill forward. It is a pity it was not brought forward earlier and that he did not proceed with the establishment of the education boards. There is no point in introducing a Bill and promising everything in the absence of a financial commitment from the Government and there is no point in depending on VEC resources because they do not have them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's definition of &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; as the planned programme of education, designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation and which is complementary to their formal academic or vocational educational training and provided primarily by youth work organisations. The word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is important. The words &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;community&rdquo; have almost disappeared from everyday use in society. We put a price on everything and a value on nothing.</P>
    <P>This legislation covers the active participation of up to 40,000 in youth work groups, assisting and liaising with up to 600,000 to 700,000 people. We are all aware of the enormous work done by voluntary groups and the benefits which have accrued to the country as a whole. Many commentators have said there is a price on everything and that time means money. That was never more true. Youth work is carried out on an almost exclusively voluntary basis at a time when work tends to be measured in terms of its commercial value. The concept of voluntary work is strong in the youth work sector and long may it continue. I hope with the passing of the Bill the necessary structures will be put in place to ensure the continuance of voluntary work in society.</P>
    <P>The focus which the Bill places on the role of the vocational education committees is welcome, given that vocational education committees have a long record of assisting in the field and endeavouring to become the ideal vehicle for implementing this legislation. They will be at the core of the operation of the proposals in the Bill. I am aware of the commitment of the majority of VEC members and VEC chief executive officers to youth work and the development of the sector. Being at the helm, chief executive officers will play a major role in bringing this Bill to the people at large. I have no doubt they will meet the challenge and that VEC members will be eager to play their part on the youth work advisory committees as they are aware of the value of youth work in their communities.</P>
    <P>This legislation was flagged as far back as 1984. Excellent work was done in researching the topic and many problems were highlighted and possible solutions flagged, but in the interim successive Governments did not act on them. It is only right that voluntary groups and youth work should be recognised. To date there has been a degree of duplication in the delivery of services <Col N="752" /> in this area by various Departments. One of the advantages of the Bill is that the delivery of such services will be streamlined. This will allow the Minister of State and his Department, a youth work assessor, the voluntary education sector, various committees, the youth work advisory committee and the youth work committee of each VEC to ensure best value for money is obtained. Although record resources are available at present, that may not always be the case. A structure must be put in place to ensure money is spent effectively and that there is no duplication or waste of resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the role of the assessor of youth work which is of crucial importance. I look forward to the reports of the assessor on youth work around the country. In some regions youth work is being done more effectively than in others. When there is a national referee who can comment, adjudicate and advise in the areas where youth work is not as strong as it should be people will be able to act on that advice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill and look forward to its enactment. It is of crucial importance that the vocational education committees have the funding and staff to deliver on the commitments and plans they make. Those plans will be ambitious, particularly when the local youth work committees combine with the voluntary youth council. There will be a huge range of new proposals and plans, even if those ambitions are not realised in the first year or two. The vocational education committees will be expected to chart a new course and, without the necessary personnel and financial resources, they will not be able to meet their targets. Where there are well organised, funded and structured youth services young people will have an alternative.</P>
    <P>Despite all the information on drug abuse, substance abuse and under age drinking, these problems are increasing. One of the many ways of encouraging young people to be active in other than anti-social behaviour is to introduce them to youth services, as the Costello report pointed out. Generic youth work should be available to all young people. Most youth work in Ireland is driven by volunteers, in some cases with the support of paid youth workers. I urge the Minister and the Government to do something positive to encourage volunteerism. The number of volunteers is falling because of the pressures of modern life and the fact that people are doing other things. The last two budgets have been anti-volunteer, in the sense that they have penalised those who have decided to stay at home. Most people who act in a voluntary capacity are not appreciated and do not get due recognition from the system or perhaps from the parents whose children they look after. In many cases, all they get is criticism.</P>
    <P>In this age of litigation there are youth workers volunteering to take young people to football matches and sporting events who are ending up in court because of an accident. There are huge <Col N="753" /> obstacles in the way of volunteerism. While there is still great community effort, in that people devote time to football clubs, youth clubs and so on, there is not the same enthusiasm as there was. I understand that the national youth work plan is in place and will come into operation shortly. There must be clarification in the budget for youth work and, in addition, a budget must be set aside for the implementation of the plan. There are more plans than there are buildings for youth workers or facilities for sport and recreation. There is no commitment in the Bill or elsewhere to provide a realistic budget to ensure that all the proposals and recommendations in the national youth work plan will be properly funded.</P>
    <P>There are many Departments involved in the funding of youth work: the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. There are probably other Departments involved also and it is very confusing. For example, social workers work under the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is involved in drug programmes and other justice projects. If the health boards have to depend on various Departments for help, their work in this area will not be as focused. In the past, professional youth workers have been employed by the various national organisations. They are committed and dedicated people, however I understand there are no salary scales applicable to them, there is no pension scheme and there appears to be little security attached to the work.</P>
    <P>Most people take up such work at a young age and as they get older it may be more difficult to continue. The necessity to interact with children means that the job becomes more pressurised with age. There is a need to clarify the position on the status of youth workers including their terms and conditions of employment, pension rights and so on. Youth workers are very good and enthusiastic people. They are targeted by partnership boards and Leader programmes. They have available to them a number of alternative forms of employment that were not previously on offer and as a result, youth organisations are finding it difficult to retain them. If a job is not secure and there are no incentives to continue, the youth services will lose very important core workers. Far too often, the national media and Members who represent urban areas give the impression that disadvantage is confined to large urban centres. This is not the case because, unfortunately, throughout rural Ireland there are many disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister and his Department, officials and the various committees will ensure that there is an adequate and proper spread of facilities. The Minister has referred in the Bill to &lsquo;gender-proofing'. I emphasise that there is a need to &lsquo;rural-proof' the Bill also. Youth services, clubs and work provide opportunity for young <Col N="754" /> people to socialise and to get to know one another in a healthy and, possibly, supervised atmosphere. This could also be a freer, looser atmosphere than is found in schools which is important. Youth organisations such as Foróige, formerly Macra na Tuatha, have through the years done great work. These youth organisations and clubs need places where young people can go to do their work and socialise. This must be addressed. Youth work is as important as formal education. It should be treated with the same importance as formal education. This is informal education. In the same way that schools are provided for formal education, youth centres should be provided for this type of informal education.</P>
    <P>Perhaps many of our schools could double in function as many of them are closed from three or four o'clock in the evening. I welcome the vocational education committees' involvement and believe that we should co-operate so that the facilities schools use during the day can be available to youth services in the evenings. The Minister should also examine grant-aiding community centres in rural areas. Members of a community council from Ballyheane outside Castlebar recently contacted me. They are trying to build a community centre but they have no funding. They have tried several Departments for funds to provide a much needed community facility but to no avail. Our streets at night have become violent places with young people under the influence of drink and drugs. I urge the Minister to make a block grant available nationally which would be disbursed through the vocational education committees, so that communities like Ballyheane could get some form of grant aid to supplement local fundraising. The community centre could be used not just for youth work but for many other purposes.</P>
    <P>This is the type of structure that is needed but will not be built with local funds alone with just 500 people in the hinterland. I am delighted that the Minister mentioned that grant aid is an option. I appeal to the Government to make a sizeable fund available because these projects can take people off the streets and help to re-habilitate young offenders, keep their minds active and keep them away from the culture of drink and drugs. While youth work is very important to the deprived, it is equally important to those who are not deprived. Very often those who are relatively well off have nowhere to go in the evenings to socialise and learn informally from their peers. There should be an all-encompassing approach by the Department and others involved in establishing proper youth services to ensure they provide not only for those who are deprived but for those who are well off and need to avail of youth services.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this Bill, which is much needed. Most people are in favour of it. The Minister of State said that the resource allocation function exercised centrally by the Department at present in regard to local and regional youth work programmes and <Col N="755" /> services will, therefore, be devolved from the Department of Education and Science to the vocational education committees. He also said that as a result not alone will decision making take place at the more appropriate local level, but the Department will be freed up sufficiently to enable it to concentrate more closely on vital issues such as national policy formulation, overall planning and development, assessment of performance, financial management, quality assurance and the national distribution of funding. I welcome the inclusion of that in the Bill and the fact that the Minister of State has decided to devolve this responsibility to the vocational education committees. However, that will not happen, unless this is properly funded. It cannot be stressed strongly enough that the necessary funding must be put in place through the vocational education committees, which are currently strapped for cash. Unless there is a structure of on stream funding in place to ensure they will automatically get funding and not have to go to the Department cap in hand seeking it, this will not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It will be good legislation. When all sectors, communities and groups work together, it can only be for the betterment of our youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on introducing it. Having checked preparation work on this matter for the past ten to 15 years, I note this is the first Minister who has brought forward a budget for financing youth projects. That deserves mention. The Minister of State should be congratulated on being the first Minister to make a commitment to this area, on which there has not been a handle for the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to look after the youth and to consider how best we can establish a structure in the lives of young people between the ages of ten and 20 outside education. Youth work will play an important role in determining their personality and reinforcing their self-esteem. It will give them a sense of identity in the workplace, be it voluntary or otherwise, and a sense of gaining confidence and assertiveness in their thinking. It will also give them training in how to work without receiving money for it. Too often the concept of life is preparation for the world of work with pay. It is important that one should have time in one's thinking for working without pay, giving to the community and giving of oneself as a person, not only giving with one's hand out and from the point of view of what is in it for oneself. This Bill is about what is in it for other people and what can be done for other people. At long last there will be a structure in place that will give young people a concept of how they should give of themselves to a com<Col N="756" /> munity, how to be a team player and help develop the community of which they are a part and to be aware of the community of life rather than focused on themselves. This Bill will do that.</P>
    <P>Addressing the needs of young people and organising voluntary work in a more systematic and comprehensive manner represents a fresh start. Youth organisation projects provide the means by which this development can take place. Youth work is young people's voluntary participation in the services provided by youth work organisations. This framework will detail the policy, budget, research, monitoring and assessment in this area. The Minister of State said these will become part of his functions and the functions of his Department. The vocational education committees will play their role in work procedures and will be responsible for the planning, prioritising, funding and implementation of their plans. The vocational education committees will establish a work committee in each VEC area. I welcome that type of structure because at long last there will be moves to ensure this takes place.</P>
    <P>Another leg of this framework will be the setting up of the national advisory committee, which will oversee policy guidance for vocational education committees in terms of the constitution of the local voluntary organisations and the standard to which they must adhere. This committee will be mostly concerned with how best to achieve a greater degree of co-ordination to provide for the best return on investment in our young people. Its membership will be wide ranging and there will be many interested agencies and bodies within its remit. The Minister of State will ensure that the committee will reflect the widest possible representation of interested parties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that its membership will include a representative from the IVA and the chief inspector of the Department of Education and Science. Will ongoing special projects such as the drugs task force, Garda projects, projects that come under young people's facilities and services funding come under the remit of the vocational education committees or will they be stand alone projects operated under different guidelines? They should be grouped under the remit of one Department with an input from other Departments. I would like the Minister of State to clarify that position. I note the committee will have representatives from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Social, Community and Family Affairs. From my reading of the section, that aspect was not clarified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the committee will have the widest possible representation. That will ensure all bodies concerned will be aware of what is happening and will allow for co-ordination between formal and non-formal sectors of the community. It will reflect the spirit of co-operation between the State and voluntary sector. <Col N="757" /> That level of co-ordination is reflected by guaranteeing that 50% of the representatives of the voluntary youth work organisations will be members of the committees. The VEC will establish the local advisory committees, which will reflect the statutory and voluntary agencies that will participate in determining the needs of youth work.</P>
    <P>Another leg of this framework is the establishment of the youth councils, which will represent the needs and demands of the voluntary sector at local level. These councils will be made up of people involved in voluntary youth work. They will have a membership of 75% volunteers, at least one fifth of whom should be under the age of 25. I welcome that provision. One might say it is only a detail, but it is important that the thrust of this Bill reflects youth work in voluntary organisations. Initially I thought of this Bill in terms of work experience for young people, but it will deal with the voluntary aspect. It is important that message is sent from this House today. We are talking about people doing voluntary work, not about receiving money for work done.</P>
    <P>The voluntary youth committees will nominate half the membership of work committees, which indicates how tight the structures will be working in the delivery of youth work. I welcome the concept of a national assessor of youth work in the provision of youth work programmes and services. Up to now there was little accountability for how funding was spent on voluntary activities. Now we will get better use of resources and a more formalised system of decision making for the VEC and the Minister, and rightly so because the VEC has a strong tradition in youth work and is ideally placed to respond to local needs in the youth work provision. The vocational education committees will ensure within their administrative areas the provision of youth work programmes and services in co-ordination with voluntary youth organisations. I understand that a three year development plan must be put in place. That is visionary and imaginative and will give structure to the overall plan for delivering these services.</P>
    <P>I note that the national committee membership is to establish a five year plan on implementing voluntary work, but that the vocational education committees are to have a three year plan. Would it not be wiser for them all to work together on the basis of a five year plan coinciding, perhaps, with local elections when vocational education committees are dissolved? In addition, giving more power to vocational education committees by way of funding and assistance would give them the flexibility to adapt to prevailing conditions in their area. I note that money is to be provided annually. Could we not consider implementing that over a three year period? I know it must be done in accordance with the budget. However, we have three different timescales &ndash; five years, <Col N="758" /> three years and one year &ndash; and that might result in some confusion. Would it not be better if planning were more structured by having just one timescale?</P>
    <P>I understand the VEC will take into account those between the ages of ten and 20 and give priority to socially and economically disadvantaged areas. I welcome that because young people in such areas may not have the resources to structure their leisure time when they are not in education or at work. It is very important and is to be welcomed that the VEC should give priority to young people who are not working and thinking things out for themselves.</P>
    <P>The question as to how these programmes will be resourced in terms of staff and expertise must be asked. It is important that the staff who run these types of youth services and programmes are knowledgeable about youth work, that they have a feel for dealing with young people. This is an old hobby horse of mine and I turn to it again. We have unsuitable remedial teachers doing remedial work and resource teachers who should not be put working on a one-to-one basis. We even have career guidance people in the counselling world who are not suitable. It would be of concern to me if the wrong people were doing the wrong kind of work where young people are concerned. It is important that people are well selected and that those running these courses are well briefed and have a feel for the work. Technically, everybody is good &ndash; anybody who has a brain can read books &ndash; but that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about empathy, about knowing how to handle young people, how to set up the programmes, how to lure these people in and involve them. In giving instructions to the national committee, the Minister should reflect on this aspect. In setting up the programmes, the people selected to run them is one of the core aspects. Technically it can be done and it may look beautiful on paper, but it will not work on the ground if the wrong people are doing the wrong kind of work. I ask the Minister, therefore, to take up that point in particular.</P>
    <P>I know comparisons are odious, but another question comes to mind. Having worked with the City of Dublin VEC for many years and having been a member of the County Dublin VEC, I have always felt that the City of Dublin VEC had more resources and that the County Dublin VEC was the poor relation. The Minister may say that is not so, but the perception is that even in the context of youth programmes and services, the City of Dublin VEC seems to have more staff than the County Dublin VEC which is dealing with a vast area, taking in South Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council areas, which means all County Dublin. I know the County Dublin VEC will do a good job, but I hope it will have the expertise in terms of staff and know<Col N="759" /> ledge. If it gets them it will certainly do a very good job.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It has been a long time in gestation and that is evident in the detail. I found it hard to get the detail into my head &ndash; it took much reading and rereading. However, there is a good framework there. There are many steps and many ways of keeping the whole programme together, of keeping the structure in terms of the national committee, the role of the vocational education committees, local education committees and youth councils, and of co-ordinating and co-operating in setting up the programmes. The Minister did a good job in that regard. This has to work, given the time that has been taken to allow for full and mature consideration of what is needed to consolidate the youth work sector and the comprehensive process of consultation to address the wishes of the voluntary organisations, as well as catering for the needs of those charged with its implementation. The Minister has got it right and I thank him for putting in so much time and effort. It was not an easy Bill to put together. There are many areas that needed much thought to ensure that all areas work well. This is a success story for the Minister and I have no doubt that it will stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. In this International Year of Volunteers, it is very good that at last this Bill has come before the House. We are appreciating the voluntary sector properly only now when we are finding it so difficult to fill positions within it. I am sure there must be many other Members of the House who, like myself, are involved in voluntary organisations where there is no fight for the chairmanship of the organisation, no fight to be on the committee and grave difficulty in getting members to partake in the work of the organisation. This is one of the downsides of the great increase in employment and the fact that so many people have to work overtime. However, in giving more status to the voluntary sector in this Bill, the Minister has done a great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to note in the press the other day that Michael Webb, a former president of the National Youth Council of Ireland, speaking to the construction industry &ndash; he is a leading construction economist &ndash; said that the Government must continue to invest in education and health care. I was interested to see this because one would expect someone involved in the construction industry to try solely to promote the construction industry within Ireland and to say we must keep building <Col N="760" /> roads and houses. However, he stressed in his speech to Plan Expo in the RDS that it was absolutely essential to put money into education and health care. This is as good as putting money into both those areas and I hope the Minister fights his corner and makes sure that the resources are made available because it is very important. The Youth Council of Ireland has welcomed this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is one area I would like to address, that is the involvement of the vocational education committees. The only VEC in which I have ever been involved is the one in Dublin. It has been most helpful to me in my capacity as president of Cherish, the organisation for single mothers, in giving us support for education for these young mothers so they can make a better effort to find employment. It was supportive, not just about things which were obviously important for employment but also about making the lives of these mothers more fulfilled. It has a very enlightened attitude.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State intends to look at amendments put before the House. I suggest that it is not essential for both the chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the advisory committees to be from the vocational education committees. Maybe the Minister of State has a good reason for that, which we can go into on Committee Stage, but it should be possible for somebody from the voluntary sector to become chairperson or vice-chairperson. I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for giving me time to speak. The Minister of State may be interested in a story told by the American actor Kirk Douglas of his arrival in the USA as an immigrant from Eastern Europe. Very badly off, hungry and on the street, he was taken in by an American citizen who looked after him, gave him food and work and sent him on his way a few days later with a hundred dollars in his hand. A year later he came to pay back the hundred dollars only to be told that he did not understand; this was not to be paid back but passed on. This is a lovely story because it is the idea behind voluntary work. We do not always do everything for monetary benefit and it seems that the Minister has recognised this in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with an important subject and is of concern to anyone who has the future of our nation at heart. It has to do with the education and training of young people, particularly young people from a disadvantaged background and those who are outside the formal education system. It seeks to build on and co-ordinate the vast amount of literally priceless voluntary work carried out in this area. These are the nice things I am going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given its importance, I find it extraordinary that it has taken the Government this length of time to bring the legislation to this stage. The process started out with the relatively simple task of amending the Youth Work Act, 1997, which <Col N="761" /> focused on the provision of youth work services through a network of regional education boards. That idea was abandoned by this Government when it came into office, making the implementation of the Act impossible, so that new or amending legislation was required to switch the focus for providing youth work services to the vocational education committees. One would not think that would take very long. When they got down to the task of amending the legislation they decided it was worth making other changes as well, which is fair enough. What is not fair enough is the extraordinary amount of time it has taken. This Bill was not introduced into the Oireachtas until this time last year, a delay of over three years. Since then its progress has been extremely slow &ndash; for no good reason &ndash; and meanwhile, the existing Act was never implemented.</P>
    <P>There have been four years of total inactivity on this issue which everybody agrees is important. Either those four wasted years did not matter, in which case one must wonder about the fundamental need for this legislation, or the delay did matter, in which case the Government must explain why it has been dragging its heels. What was so important in this new legislation that justified freezing the development of youth work services across the country for those four long years? Reading through the Bill, I cannot find any clues to the answer. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions that will create an absolute monster of a bureaucracy to oversee its task. I am not suggesting that the task is not important, but are these elaborate structures the best way of getting the work done? It has been my experience in both the private and the public sectors that committees with too many members rapidly disintegrate into talking shops, with each member clinging desperately to his representative hat and refusing to bond with the others in addressing the common challenge faced. A committee with 20 or 30 members never rises above the status of 20 or 30 individuals squabbling together. Because each member gets so little talking time, the incentive to attend such meetings regularly and to put serious effort into making a contribution is usually undermined. I have found that if anything is to be achieved the membership of the committee must be kept down to fewer than ten people. With such a size people find it easier to take off their representative hats and to work together as a group, sharing their diverse experiences and pooling their resources to achieve their aim. Such a size is also one where every member will have a fair chance to have his say and make a contribution. The smaller size of the group puts pressure on each person to contribute.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to find in this Bill provisions for about 60 bodies, each with 20 members or more. The National Youth Advisory Committee is to have between 27 and 29 members and in each VEC there is to be a youth work committee with <Col N="762" /> between 12 and 20 members as well as a voluntary youth council with between ten and twenty members. In my experience the maximum number of members is always appointed and I do not expect any difference in this case. At national level the advisory committee will have 29 members and every VEC area will have both a youth work committee and a voluntary youth work committee with 20 members each. That is a total of 60 bodies and 1,200 members. Every one is likely to become a nothing more than a glorified talking shop.</P>
    <P>The argument I often hear for creating large and cumbersome bodies is that it is necessary to make them fully representative of the range of interests involved. The first five places on the proposed youth work advisory committee go to the Minister, as he appoints the chairman, two other members experienced in youth work and two officials from his Department. Straight away this could be cut to two. I suggest that the Minister appoint only the chairman and one official from his Department. I see no reason the Minister, in addition to appointing the chairman, should also appoint two other members experienced in youth work given that this committee will be awash with people with such experience. One civil servant should be quite enough to hold the Minister's brief. The next proposal is for two representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association. Why two? Are they like the Legion of Mary, who have a rule about always going around in pairs? Let them have one seat which they can share between two people if they wish.</P>
    <P>So far we have seven members proposed by the Bill, whereas my suggestion is for three. Next, seven more members are nominated by relevant Government Departments and one from FÁS. I have no quarrel with any of this but that brings the proposed number up to 14, plus the chairman. That number is then doubled by the addition of an equal number of representatives nominated by what the Bill describes as the prescribed national youth work representative organisation. I shall pass over the Stalinist ring of that title and concentrate on the numbers. The representative organisation gets 14 representatives, merely to balance the numbers between it and the official side of the table. This is important because, given that there is only one organisation involved, nobody could make the argument that they need 14 members to represent their interests. They only need 14 to keep the size of the teams equal. If the suggestions I made to cut down the numbers were accepted, the number needing to be balanced would be reduced to ten, not 14, giving a total of 21, including a chairman. That would be a good deal better than 29, but still too large.</P>
    <P>I will now outline a way to reduce the committee to a tight, businesslike group. All the representatives of Departments, other than the Minister's own representative, should be observers rather than full voting members of the committee. That would create a group of seven &ndash; the chairman, the Minister's representative, the Irish <Col N="763" /> Vocational Education Association representative and the FÁS representative, and three balancing representatives from the prescribed representative organisations. We would then have a tight, cohesive group of seven persons, backed up by the resource of seven observers from the various Departments. If we want the national advisory committee to be effective, that is the way it should be structured. If we want it to be nothing more than a talking shop, without any real effect, it should be kept to 29 members.</P>
    <P>The same principle can be applied to the bodies at local level &ndash; I would recommend doing so &ndash; but what I really want to criticise is the idea of having two bodies rather than one at local level. Why not roll them into one? That would reduce the number of bodies throughout the country to 30, from the mind-boggling 60. I cannot believe that amalgamating the youth work committees and the voluntary youth council would not be an improvement. It would have the effect of leveraging the work of the people concerned and, therefore, increasing the results on the ground, which is what we all hope this long awaited legislation shall achieve. I speak from an anxiety to make it effective, and believe my suggestions are worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the Bill. It has been said that it has been a long time in gestation. That happens to be the case, but it must also be said that, as presented to us this evening, it is the outcome of a great deal of consultation on the part of the Minister of State with those who have a hands-on approach to youth work, a great deal of experience in the field of youth work and know from that experience what is and is not attainable, does and does not work and is the best type of legislation required. For that reason it has to be a good Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill has gone through all Stages in the other House. As it has already been amended, there is not much we can do by way of amendment, but we can comment on it. I will return to the comments made by a previous speaker because the issues he raised need to be addressed. I am particularly pleased with the Bill, but I have two messages to give to the Minister of State. First, he should work now for a speedy enactment because the Bill is overdue and has the potential to do a great deal of good. Second, he should work hard to ensure its provisions will be properly and adequately resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are constantly being told that our greatest resource as a nation is our young people. That is the truth. Our greatest asset is our young people. That being the case, we should argue strongly for proper investment in them, not just in their future as adults, but in their developing years because that is the investment that will determine the kind of adults they will become. They are the next generation who will run this country when we have passed on. They are worthy of the best invest<Col N="764" /> ment we can possibly make, not just in terms of education, the importance of which is constantly stressed, but also in terms of informal education in the context of well-structured and well-delivered youth work. It is sad but true that in many cases, due to the enormous pressure put on schools in terms of points and college places, mainstream education prepares young people for examinations. Youth work prepares them for life. Which of the two is more important? It is important that we bear this in mind when we argue for resources to ensure the aspirations of the Bill are fully met.</P>
    <P>I do not regret the delay in bringing forward the Bill for a number of reasons. I could never give my full consent to the establishment of the local education committees, and I am delighted there will be a stronger partnership, in the context of this legislation, between the vocational education committees and voluntary youth work. During the years they have built up an enormous corpus of expertise in terms of the needs and potential of young people. They have gone beyond the parameters of formal education, and through their outreach programmes have reached out to a number of young people who would otherwise have fared badly in education. They have the expertise to deal with young people often labelled as disadvantaged because they do not fit the prescription of mainstream education, often to the neglect of a range of other gifts they may possess. The vocational education committees are excellent at developing alternative and successful programmes for young people such as those I have mentioned. They do it through the outreach programmes, in the way they have developed PLC courses and a range of education provisions under the VTOS and other programmes. In so doing, they have built up valuable relationships with young people and schools.</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience, the knowledge they have gained and the will they have demonstrated, they are the best people to act in partnership with voluntary youth workers to make the aspirations of the Bill a reality. I am delighted they are the people who have been given this role because they have the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for it. When dealing with young people it is important to be able to communicate with them. Being able to listen and understand them is half the battle. It has never been more important that we make this kind of investment in young people.</P>
    <P>When I was young we shared our problems with our parents, most of the time, and listened to what they had to say. Nowadays young people confer with their peers. It is with their peers they talk about their problems and, importantly, it is to their peers they look for support if they hit a bad patch. We must make an appropriate investment in youth work, acknowledge the voluntary input in terms of well designed youth work and, most importantly, make an investment in professional youth workers.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde made a profound statement, the first politician with the courage to do so. She <Col N="765" /> talked about remedial education. We have had 20 years of remedial education, but what has been the outcome? Those who needed remedial education 20 years ago no longer need it. In fairness to Senator Ormonde, she explained that we simply did not have the people with the necessary skills, expertise and art of communication to deliver remedial education, as demonstrated by the outcome. We should not allow this to happen again in the context of youth work. We must support voluntary effort, which has immense value, with a hard core of well trained professional people to give direction, structure and definition in terms of what needs to be done. It is important we ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>Obviously I did not read the Bill as closely as Senator Quinn, although I was struck by the fact that it appears to create an immense number of large committees. Senator Quinn's comments have a great deal of merit. The Minister of State and I have extensive experience of dealing with committees. Both of us, I believe, would concur with Senator Quinn's view that the committees will be overpopulated and top heavy. While I am not formulating an amendment, I strongly support the Senator's request that the Minister of State reconsider this element of the Bill. It is clear the Minister of State is more anxious than most to ensure the outcome of the Bill is both purposeful and positive for young people and that the structures are right. I ask him, therefore, to examine this matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that both the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the youth work committees will be drawn from the membership of the VEC. This might work in many cases, but may not be the best approach in others. It is possible there will be people in a VEC area prepared to do a great deal of youth work, including planning and policy making, and have considerable expertise to offer, but who are not members of the VEC. Others might have a strong proven track record in dealing effectively with young people by reaching out to them, giving expression to their aspirations and leading them in the right direction. If the people concerned are not eligible to become vice-chairperson of a committee, we limit ourselves by failing to draw upon this expertise and experience. The Bill would be better if it stipulated that the chairperson must be drawn from the VEC, while allowing non-members to become vice-chairperson. I am sure an amendment to this effect will emerge on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As it is late afternoon, there is no merit in repeating what others have said, except to commend the Minister of State for the spirit of partnership in which he approached the Bill. He involved the relevant people in all the discussions as the building blocks of the Bill were put in place. I commend him for this and the opportunities which, I hope, this legislation will open for volunteerism.</P>
    <P>Reading between the lines, one ascertains that young people learn a great deal from example. They will understand the value of voluntary work <Col N="766" /> if they see people working in a voluntary capacity for the well-being of young people in the community, which is the well-being of everyone in the community. I cannot remember how, when I was teaching long ago, we used to sum up the idea that young people learn from what they see going on around them. They will act as they see others act, not in the way they are told. If young people see a value placed on voluntary work, they will be tempted to do such work when their turn comes. Is that not one of the best forms of education we can give them?</P>
    <P>It is critically important that the Bill is enacted speedily and well financed. These are strange times. Young people nowadays have more and better opportunities and challenges than ever before. They also have more difficulties to contend with, pitfalls to avoid and difficulties to confront and surmount than we did when I was young. They need support, which the Bill, once enacted, will give them. I commend the Minister of State for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him sincerely for introducing what I and other Senators consider to be most important legislation. Most important of all is what it will do for the personal development of children as they grow into adulthood. The work carried out prior to introducing the Bill has played an important role in helping young people realise their full potential. Very few of us have not voluntarily participated at some stage in our lives in some form of youth work. This helps shape us and give focus and discipline in life.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State outlined, a central part of youth work is voluntary participation. We all know from childhood that coercion tends to lead to rebellion. There is merit in the fact that the Bill allows one to participate on a voluntary basis. I was surprised, however, to read a survey carried out in the north east inner city which found that one of the system's weaknesses was the absence of an obligation on young people to participate in these projects. At the time participation in a programme was generally ordered by the courts. I was surprised the authors considered this a weakness.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of the House not to compliment the hundreds of thousands of wonderful volunteers who have given much of their lives to youth work. I note with satisfaction that the Minister of State believes youth work is essentially delivered within a framework of voluntarism. The vocational education committees should also be complimented on the fine contribution they have made, with the minimum of resources and funds, to youth work in communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure of any good Bill stems from the degree of consultation the initiator takes on board before its introduction. The Minister of State must be complimented on the degree to which he did so and the number of agencies he addressed before proceeding with the legislation. The proof of this lies in the fact that he was <Col N="767" /> unable to amend the 1997 Act, which forced him to introduce new legislation. I assume this was due to the number of amendments and the volume of input from several of these agencies.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to define what youth work means in a concise and clear manner and to give effective, unambiguous guidelines on policy, budget and research. It also defines the functions of the vocational education committees regarding youth work, particularly the procedures for planning, prioritising, funding and reporting the provisions of youth work programmes and their services. The Bill further sets out to establish special youth work committees in each VEC area to provide for the continuation of the national youth work advisory committees and to expand the committees to reflect to a greater extent the current composition of the youth work community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's proposition that a minimum of 75% of the members of the Voluntary Youth Council should be volunteers. It is an excellent suggestion. I hope the voluntary organisations will be open and democratic enough to allow young people on to their councils. That has not been the case in the past and boards have been top heavy with bureaucracy and administrators.</P>
    <P>If I were to ask if youth work has had the desired effect on the problems facing young people over the last ten or 20 years, the answer would probably be yes, to an extent. However, as a system it has had little impact in addressing the societal inequalities that create the problems faced by young people. Despite the outstanding work of many individual youth workers, organisations and agencies, they have had limited influence on national policy as it impacts on the lives of young adults. These organisations may have worked in isolation and their requirements have perhaps been tailored to specific local needs. I hope a spirit of greater co-operation in relation to information and collective aims will be fostered. If that happens it will help to shape amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the lack of research into needs that manifested itself in the inner city survey. I am glad to see that being addressed in the Bill. The survey referred to a lack of co-ordination and that is also being addressed. It referred to the lack of parental involvement and that is not unique. We parents are not always the best when it comes to getting involved in the activities of our children.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the great contribution which the vocational education committees have made through the years with limited resources and I am therefore delighted to see that the Minister of State is providing them with the opportunity to supervise, monitor and co-ordinate the systems the Bill is putting in place. They will be allowed provide grant aid, withdraw finance and use their own flexibility to determine programmes and projects. That is a very good thing. The survey <Col N="768" /> singled out poorly resourced programmes as a weakness. If there is a co-ordinating body such as the VEC with the autonomy to pull rank, so to speak, and to monitor programmes that are up and running, it is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I hope funding is shared equally throughout the system, as far as possible. All bodies should get a crack of the whip. Even though I usually spend my time here arguing on behalf of the disadvantaged area I represent, it is sometimes true that disadvantaged areas, particularly in circumstances such as those under discussion, get a greater crack of the whip. If you do not have a child who is causing problems you do not get any recognition at all. I say that with soccer clubs in middle class areas of the city in mind. They tend to have to do their own thing and go their own way with very little recognition. Many of their managers have done a wonderful job babysitting people and looking after them. We need only look at a club like Stella Maris FC, which has nurtured players such as Liam Brady, Dave O'Leary and Steven Carr. They discovered the discipline that comes from being involved in the community of a football team. Managers there were volunteers who gave of their time and shaped their family holidays around the participation of those kids in a structure. There are many such examples across the board, not just in football.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion in the Bill of programmes for people with disability. I am open to correction on that. I realise that many programmes do not have a physical dimension and probably could adapt to the needs of people with disability. The unfortunate thing is that even if the programmes were there, those with physical disability do not live in an environment which enables them to participate. If they did, they might not have the necessary transportation. Hopefully, those are things we will address along the way.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has been to the fore in the integration of people with disability into the mainstream educational system. I see the area covered by the Bill as an extension of the educational system and it would be a shame, now that we have done such good work in mainstream education, if we could not facilitate those with disability to participate meaningfully in youth work. It is something that may not have received attention. If that is the case, I encourage the Minister of State to bear it uppermost in his mind that people with disability have similar needs to the able bodied in this regard. The only relevant programme I know of is run in the Central Remedial Clinic. It is funded by the clinic itself and the response is absolutely excellent. Other such programmes would be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the <Col N="769" /> Senators who have contributed to this debate. Their comments generally were constructive .</P>
      <P>On the question of why it took four and a half years to bring this Bill before the Houses, it was necessary to look again at the Youth Work Act, 1997 because it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of education boards. It was therefore preferable to introduce new legislation rather than attempt to amend the 1997 Act. I was faced with this scenario when I came into office. Delegations came to me from all sorts of organisations, particularly from those representing young people. They told me, quite frankly, that the previous Bill was a disaster and a mess which had not been thought out properly. What was needed was a much more comprehensive approach. I decided to give that to them and that was the main reason for the delay.</P>
      <P>My Department engaged in an extensive and comprehensive consultation process so the Bill would be the result of widespread consultation and represent up-to-date thinking on youth structures etc. The Bill is far better than the legislation that preceded it because of these consultations and considerations. While I would like to have been here to take Second Stage sooner, that is the price we pay for creating proper legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to finances, I intend to secure appropriate funding for the implementation of the Youth Work Bill, 2000, and I will do all in my power to achieve this. Some of the issues raised today in relation to volunteerism, the status of youth workers and the provision for rural areas are matters of concern to me. I expect that these matters are being examined by the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. I have asked that committee to prepare a five year national development plan for youth work and I hope to have it next month. I anticipate that the plan will address many of the issues raised today.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde raised the question of future funding in terms of the young people's facilities and services fund and diversion projects. While the schemes in question will continue to be funded as they are at present, the composition of the VEC youth work committees will include all the major parties, statutory and voluntary, thus ensuring the best cohesion and co-operation at local level by the delivering agencies, including vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The question of whether there should be a three year plan or a five year plan was debated. The reason I have opted for a three year plan is to have regard to the programmes and services in youth work, some of which might operate for one year only. Extending the plan period to five years could make assessment almost impossible in some instances because the course-project participants could have left the informal youth work system. The three year period would also dovetail with the requirements for the assessor of youth work to assess, at least once in every three year period, youth work programmes and services provided by voluntary youth organisations that are funded by vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" />The prescription of the National Youth Council of Ireland as the prescribed national voluntary youth organisation is for a period of three years, subject to renewal. Thus, there is consistency in the Youth Work Bill in relation to three year periods. If the implementation of the VEC plan were to be coterminous with local authority elections, this would mean that the VEC youth work development plan would have to wait until July 2004. In addition, it would not be appropriate to have a plan starting in the middle of the financial year.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial provisions, Senator Quinn suggested that youth work programmes and services were frozen since 1997 because of the non-implementation and failure to bring forward this legislation. That is a blatant untruth and I am sorry Senator Quinn is not here because I would like him to withdraw it. The truth is that since I took office, there has been a significant increase in the amount of State funding made available for youth work. In real terms, discounting inflation, the figure is 25%, which is very significant indeed. I have precise figures and percentages if the Senators are interested, which I will have on Committee Stage next week. I emphasise again that the increase has been significant.</P>
    <P>As an indication of my commitment, I introduced a local youth club grants scheme in 1999 to help local youth clubs meet start-up costs, particularly youth clubs in disadvantaged areas. I am glad £1 million was allocated for this very worthwhile scheme in 2001. Furthermore, my commitment to youth work was manifested when I asked the National Youth Work Advisory Committee to prepare a national youth work development plan, which will be a vision for youth work over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also referred to the size of some of the committees and I accept there is a certain logic in what he said. He noticed the National Youth Work Advisory Committee is large, which is correct. However, if he examined a little more closely circumstances at ground level, he would discover that it generally performs the bulk of its duties at sub-committee level. This has proven to be very effective, as the Senator would realise if he took the trouble to find out.</P>
    <P>The national youth work development plan was prepared largely by a sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. The full committee has the final say in all matters. Therefore, its size is an advantage in that all the major players in voluntary youth work effectively bind themselves to the findings of the committee by their presence. It also facilitates the flow of information between the members.</P>
    <P>The prescribed national youth work representative organisation, the National Youth Council of Ireland, has 14 members. It is correct to say the National Youth Work Advisory Committee has 14 members, but the NYCI itself consists of representatives of 60 full and associate member organisations of remarkable diversity. The num<Col N="771" /> ber pertaining to youth work committees is 16 to 20 members and that pertaining to the voluntary youth council is ten to 20 members. It is considered that these numbers are desirable on a number of grounds &ndash; for example, the importance of youth work, openness and transparency and, perhaps most importantly, democratic reasons. The measures in the Bill are the result of extensive consultation with people who have a vested interest in making the system work. I have no doubt that the size of the committees will not deter from the members achieving their objectives.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an upper limit on the number of meetings per annum in the case of those committees, except when the Minister specifically sanctions otherwise. People will simply not have time to let the committees degenerate into talking shops. If they want to get the business done, they have only six meetings per year in which to do so. They have a vested interest, an all-consuming interest, in getting the work done and making the structures work, and I am confident they will be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their comments. I have proved amenable to amendments in the Lower House. Some of the amendments suggested by the Opposition in that House were constructive and, by accepting them, I think we have finished up with better legislation. I will adopt an equally open and liberal approach to constructive amendments supported by solid arguments in this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make a financial commitment to extend the Corrib gas transmission line to Ballina and Sligo with spur lines to the smaller towns <i>en route,</i> in view of the statement by the chief executive officer of An Bord Gáis that this extension of the gas pipeline from Pollatomish in Mayo to Craughwell in Galway will not happen without direct Government funding.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this motion. He replied to a question on this issue in the other House a few months ago by stating:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Government decided, in principle, that the gas network should be extended to the north west. An evaluation carried out by Bord Gáis has determined that this <Col N="772" /> would require grant aid, as the demand for gas in the long term would not be sufficient to pay for the capital cost of extending the system. Such grant aid would require State aid clearance from the EU Commission. Last month the Government announced that it was moving ahead with the next stage in the project which is to conduct a detailed study on extending the gas network to Sligo <i>via</i> Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry, which is expected to be served by a pipeline from Belfast. Bord Gáis is being asked to carry out this study, the purpose of which is to fully define the pipeline extensions and to give an accurate assessment of the levels of grant aid that would be necessary. At the same time it is proposed to submit a State aid case to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>Since this time last year, various Ministers attending functions throughout Mayo, Sligo and the north west have referred to this issue of bringing gas to Mayo. We have been so long listening to debate about the issue that someone will write a song about it soon. What will happen is that gas will be brought out of Mayo and there is no financial commitment from the Government to extend the pipeline to areas within the county.</P>
    <P>The excuse has been given by the Government on various occasions that it is examining the costings of this extension. I can give them. They are well known. We are not dealing with rocket science. These transmission lines have been priced and any pipeline construction operator can say what it will cost to within a few thousand pounds per kilometre. It will cost between £300,000 and £500,000 per kilometre to lay the transmission line, with the average being £400,000 per kilometre. The Government knows the cost involved and any prevarication is only an excuse to delay this further.</P>
    <P>We all know that both Bord Gáis and Enterprise Energy are well advanced with the initial stages of the laying of the pipeline. Much of the preliminary work has been done. All either is concerned with is the line from Galway to Pollatomish in Mayo. There is nothing else on their agenda. That is the reality of the position as regards gas in Mayo. We have heard commitments of £100 million for a pipeline but the fact is that Enterprise Energy and Bord Gáis are funding the original line from Mayo to Galway.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises is that the Government saw fit, presumably after evaluation, to sanction the second interconnector from Scotland to Ireland because the Kinsale field was running out. Some £200 million was invested in the project and, in light of the economic downturn and the dramatic decrease in worldwide energy demands, it must be asked why we could not wait just one more year for the Corrib field to come on stream. The second interconnector will only become operational towards the end of 2002 and <Col N="773" /> the Corrib gasfield is scheduled to come on stream in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government has seen fit to invest £200 million in this pipeline. Would it not be better to invest the bulk of that money in the west to pay for the extension of the pipeline to Ballina, Belmullet and the other towns adjacent to the main transmission line? People in the county have been agitating for the Government to provide a definitive statement or a concrete commitment in respect of this project.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger passed through Mayo almost unnoticed, although he stopped in a few places along the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that did not keep him alive. Mayo needs this vital item of infrastructure. Nothing helps attract industry or improves an area more than a good road network, an available source of power and an accessible workforce. These are the important ingredients required to create a vibrant economy.</P>
      <P>It is 20 years since the Kinsale gasfield, which has made a major contribution to improving our balance of payments and helping develop our energy infrastructure, came on stream. Given that the supply from Kinsale will be exhausted in the next few years, it is great that the Corrib gasfield will be coming on stream. We do not want to see a situation in County Mayo where, after the construction workers have returned home, gas will be transported out of the county via an underground pipeline. We do not want the ultimate result of this major gas find off our coastline to be the creation of only 40 or 50 jobs at the reception terminal situated on the northern shoreline of the county.</P>
      <P>We are expecting a definite commitment from the Government in relation to this matter during this evening's debate. It is not a question of waiting around for costings to be carried out. Any builder worth his salt can estimate the cost per square foot to build a house, be it a bungalow or a two storey dwelling. If he looks at the site, he will be able to provide, within a few pounds, an estimate of the eventual cost. Likewise, it is totally implausible for the Government and the Minister of State to indicate that they do not know the cost because the costings involved are available to anyone who wishes to see them. We do not want further prevarication on this matter. We want a solid commitment that the pipeline, which is a vital element of infrastructure, will be laid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated, there was great anticipation in the county when this find was originally announced. However, the air of expectation waned during the past year or so when people realised that the actual benefit to the county may be negligible unless there is a substantial commitment to invest <Col N="774" /> in a new transmission line. Bord Gáis has a commercial mandate and will not, of its own volition, engage in an extension of a pipeline if this is not justifiable under certain criteria. There is an onus and an obligation on the Government to ensure that the pipeline is laid through Mayo and Sligo and to consider possible extensions to Donegal and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to undergo another winter of listening to after dinner speeches by Ministers informing us that there is a commitment in principle. Enterprise Energy and Bord Gáis are on-site carrying out work and if a decision is further delayed there will be no way to incorporate the extension of the transmission line in the initial phase of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. When the first tests were carried out on gas from the Corrib field, there was a great air of expectation and hope that it would lead to the creation of jobs and would help to rejuvenate certain parts of County Mayo. That will not be the case unless the Government takes action. In taking such action, it will be obliged to comply with the terms of the motion put forward by Senator Caffrey. The amendment tabled by Senator O'Toole draws attention to the need for a spur line to Belmullet, but this is covered in Senator Caffrey's proposal.</P>
      <P>As Senator Caffrey indicated, a sum of £100 million is required for the extension of the pipeline. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources indicated that a certain amount of money would be required to run a spur line to Ballina. Two or three days later that statement was contradicted by the Minister, which is not good enough. As it stands, gas will be brought ashore at Broadhaven or Pollatomish in County Mayo and will be piped to Galway, other areas throughout the country, Scotland, England and the other places to which it is carried by the interconnectors.</P>
      <P>The Government allowed Bord Gáis to decide to build a new pipeline from the east coast which runs through County Meath, Athlone and on to Galway. The company has provided spur lines to various lines along that route. In this case no provision has been made for spur lines to towns such as Belmullet, Ballina, Westport, Castlebar, Claremorris and Ballinrobe, or, as Senator Caffrey said, for extensions to Sligo and Donegal. The Government has not even given a commitment in this regard. However, this is not the first occasion on which the current Administration has failed to provide such a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The west has been badly treated. The railway line which serves the region leaves a great deal to be desired. Eircom was sold without any commitment to provide broadband services to the west. The Government received a massive sum of money from that sale, but the west has been placed at a complete disadvantage because it does <Col N="775" /> not have a broadband service. The Mayo county manager is currently putting proposals before the members of the county council to help improve the position, but this will come at a considerable cost to ratepayers and taxpayers in the county. The remainder of the country has access to broadband services which were paid for with taxpayers' money. Eircom should not have been sold without a firm commitment being put in place to roll out broadband services to the west.</P>
    <P>The ESB does not run high power cable lines into the west, which also places the region at a complete disadvantage in terms of its ability to attract heavy industry because such industry requires access to a major supply of power. The east coast is again at an advantage in this regard. As Senator Caffrey indicated, the extension of the gas line would do much to change this. It would bring in an efficient fuel and would allow industry to come to this part of the country which is most disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, when it was put together in 1992, made no provision for upgrading the national primary route from Longford to Westport, even though the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources stated recently that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government could, at any stage, issue a direction to the National Roads Authority to change or upgrade it. This has been refuted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The west is hugely disadvantaged. The Government, which has probably served the longest term in the history of the State and will run almost a full term, has done little or nothing to provide facilities such as roads, railways, gas and electricity. The west is completely disadvantaged in all those areas when one compares it to the east coast.</P>
    <P>I second the motion tabled by Senator Caffrey and believe the Government should make an announcement as quickly as possible and that it should give a commitment to put in place the necessary funds to make sure spur lines go to the major growth centres in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann welcomes the unprecedented level of investment in natural gas infrastructure that will bring gas to many new areas of the country, and the Government's decision to move forward to the next phase of bringing gas to the north west.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. Before I speak to the amendment, I would like to comment briefly on what my colleagues opposite have said. I assure them that the sentiments and views conveyed and the concerns <Col N="776" /> expressed in their motion are laudable. It is commendable that they should speak up so forcefully and vigorously for the west and the region they represent. Because of the programme upon which the Minister has embarked and which is rapidly progressing, their concerns are not well founded. Although I am a frequent visitor to the west, as those opposite know, I am not as intimately familiar with its topography as they are.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge their concerns, the arguments they have put forward in terms of their commitment to and support for the extension of the Corrib gas transmission line throughout the west and the north west and the economic, social and environmental cases they have advanced, which are contained in Senator O'Toole's amendment to the motion, this question has to be seen in the context of a national plan which is incorporated centrally in the Government's national development plan. It is laudable to identify specific areas and highlight serious infrastructural weaknesses, but it is not possible, because of what we are dealing with here, to speak of them in isolation. As I said, it must be looked at in the context of the overall national development plan. It is for that reason we, on this side, will support the Government amendment.</P>
    <P>Nobody with any grasp of the importance of balanced regional development, which is unambiguously promoted in the national development plan, could do anything other than ensure that all regions get fair and balanced development. Those parts of the west and north west included in the motion and in Senator O'Toole's amendment are an integral part of that plan. However, when we promote any region, we must do so as part of this plan. With the development of any national development plan, a start must be made somewhere. Routes must be planned and, in this case, the pipeline and the spurs must be put in place. Choices must be made about these routes which may be unpopular in areas. The overall determinant must be what gives the best deal to all the people because that is what a national plan is all about, as well as value for money, while seeking to adopt as balanced an approach as possible.</P>
    <P>We must remember it has taken 20 years to develop Ireland's natural gas grid to its present standard. The first gas transmitted came from the Kinsale Head field, where the gas find originated, to Cork city. A 240 kilometre pipeline to Dublin was built in 1982 which took in towns en route such as Limerick in the mid-west. The expansion of the grid has continued to other parts of the north east, north central areas and the midlands. The most spectacular development of all in the expansion of the grid was, undoubtedly, the construction of the interconnector from north County Dublin to Scotland. It is important to emphasise that. It was a landmark project for late 20th century Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all agree with the claim forcefully articu<Col N="777" /> lated by Senators Caffrey and Burke that gas has become an increasingly vital component of our overall energy needs and it is vital that we manage the sector, continue the rapid expansion of the infrastructure and cope with the dramatic growth in demand. There has been spectacular growth in demand for gas as an energy and fuel source. In keeping with the need for infrastructural development, total expenditure by Bord Gáis on the construction of the new pipelines over the next two years will be over £650 million of which approximately £200 million will be invested in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>I think I heard Senator Caffrey correctly when he said that perhaps this should be set aside for local emergency and priority. We are dealing with a national situation of which this is an inherent part. The best experts and consultants who have been employed have stressed the need for the various aspects of the national development plan in terms of infrastructural development to proceed. It would be difficult, therefore, to simply pluck out that amount and devote it to a region of the west which we all agree needs rapid assistance in terms of infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>The existing network took 20 years to build. Over the next couple of years the second interconnector, the ring main between Dublin, Galway and Limerick and the pipeline between Pollatomish and Craughwell outside Galway, over which the Government deliberated at length on the basis of consultants' reports, will add 750 kilometres of new pipeline to the existing network to bring the Corrib gas to market. That is a huge commitment by any standards in the space of a couple of years and a substantial part of that will go to the west as part of the BMW region. The onshore extension of the natural gas network will greatly increase the number of households and businesses which will have access to natural gas both across the midlands and into the west.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, I referred to the Government's decision to move to the next phase, extending the gas network to Sligo and across the Border from Derry to Letterkenny. This is indisputable evidence of the Government's very definite commitment to improve the energy infrastructure in the BMW region. However, we must recognise that these extensions will require substantial grant aid. Senator Caffrey rightly referred to the commercial mandate of Bord Gáis. Detailed planning will be carried out by Bord Gáis Éireann and I understand this work will establish an accurate figure for the grant aid required, although figures have been mentioned by Senator Caffrey which I am not in a position to dispute.</P>
    <P>Overall, it is proposed to complete what will be a national ring to connect Galway, Mayo and Sligo and to bring the other connection from the North through Letterkenny. The commitment is <Col N="778" /> manifested in a £10 million investment which the Minister and his Department have made to the Northern Ireland development. Consultants have emphasised the strategic importance, nationally and in terms of the all-island market, of having a connection between the North and South pipelines. There is a very firm commitment there.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that demand is phenomenal and has exceeded the wildest expectations of An Bord Gáis. The anticipated demand of 23.5% per annum in the next two years is expected to double by the end of the decade. It will be difficult to keep pace with that level of demand. Those who have said there is a shortfall in infrastructural development to match demand have conceded the shortfall is not due to a lack of a commitment on funds, but to the democratic deficit in planning which is working its way through the system. There is no doubt that demand will continue apace irrespective of the downturn which I expect will of short-term duration.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government on the commitment they have shown, not only to the national grid, but to the investment in infrastructure in the west and north-west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole, asked me to propose his amendment, but I understand that, for technical reasons, it may not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Dr. Henry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your guidance. I propose to do so, but first I wish to put the wording on the record because it is important. The amendment Senator O'Toole, supported by you, Acting Chairman, and me, wished to move was the following:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in recognition of the acceptance by the people of north-west Mayo of the significant environmental impact on their countryside caused by the Corrib gas pipeline and of the need for an improved infrastructure in that area demands that the Government financially supports extending the pipeline to the west as far as Belmullet and also&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put this on the record because, apart from anything else, Senator O'Toole and I who happen to live in Dublin should show a kind of fraternal concern for the people far removed from us in the west. The reason Senator O'Toole is not with us this evening is that he is engaged in official business in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we demonstrate our commitment to people in the west. There will be an impact in this area. They will have to pay a price <Col N="779" /> in terms of a certain amount of environmental change that not everybody would see as positive. In other words, the physical structures will pass through sections of this area. It is important when a natural resource is discovered the area in close proximity to it should be allowed to benefit as much as possible. I know there is an argument about the national plan, but is it not extraordinary when there is something positive to be put into the pot, it is grabbed for the national plan? If what was discovered there was negative, I do not think there would be the same appetite to grab it for the national interest.</P>
    <P>In terms of north Mayo, particularly north-west Mayo, there is, as my colleagues on this side have said, a significant lack of infrastructure. There has been a consistent falling out of the system and an inability to benefit from tourism, infrastructural and development grants, all of which are fairly thin on the ground for people in north-west Mayo. What Senator O'Toole was concerned about was that the benefit seemed to be travelling very rapidly eastwards and he wanted to ensure that at least a certain level of benefit deriving from this natural resource remained in the area from which it derived. Of course, where it derives from is out in the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that technology has advanced to a stage where there can be deep water drilling. These resources are very important. I understand the find is off the coast of Broad Haven, that it is extremely significant and may well last for a good number of years and that it is of the same magnitude and significance as the previous discovery at Kinsale which had an appreciable impact on the economy of Cork. It is only fair that people in the area should be allowed benefit from it.</P>
    <P>It is a significant resource in a world where energy resources are becoming rarer, more expensive and often environmentally detrimental. When a country like Ireland is lucky enough to discover such a resource it should be exploited in such a way that local people benefit.</P>
    <P>On the subject of gas &ndash; I do not wish to raise the ire of the oil interests &ndash; I regard it as the best and most efficient method of heating. I use it for cooking in my own house. It is by far the best for cooking. I am sure the housewives of north-west Mayo would agree with me and would be delighted to get their hands on this resource. Apart from anything else &ndash; better than electricity, most of which is generated from oil nowadays &ndash; one can vary the temperatures immediately if one is trying to cook. In terms of home heating there is much less nuisance in respect of spillage, smell and so on. It is a nice clean consumer friendly method of exploiting these resources.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government gives consideration to allowing the benefits which derive from this geographical area to be thrown back <Col N="780" /> into it to the extent that that is possible rather than simply grabbed for the national interest. It reminds me of the mantra one hears on a certain satirical television programme when something unpleasant is coming up and a voice of a well known colleague from the Lower House is heard intoning &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo;. It must be particularly galling for people living in places like Belmullet to find when they have the goodies that across the airwaves from Dublin comes the voice &ldquo;in the national interest we have to grab all your resources and repatriate them and you will get sweet damn all out of it.&rdquo;  I think there would be general consent in the House that the Government should look at this to see if it is possible to develop an area of the country that has its own beauty, its own remarkable people and that has had proportionately smaller investment than the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by Senator O'Toole to make these few remarks. I regret it will not be possible to move the amendment, but I always try to be a political realist. There is a sporting chance that the Government will win the day on this one when we all troop through the lobbies in the next hour or so. I appeal to it to consider the people of this part of our island as having a special entitlement to consideration. If one finds something outside one's front door, one should share it with others, but I think one is entitled to a slightly larger cut because it is in one's territory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator Liam Fitzgerald. There is little between the two proposals in the sense that they have a common interest in trying to support the development of the gas find off the north Mayo coast. One seeks a financial commitment in respect of the field while on the other side the Government is committed to supporting the development and providing the necessary State funding.</P>
      <P>The contribution of Senator Norris was laudable, upright and fair. There is a great fear in the west. We have come through the Celtic tiger and witnessed tremendous job creation and a huge repatriation of our people. In view of the downturn in the economy and substantial job losses in the IT and high tech sector there is a fear that the west will never realise its true potential. While it is included, specific and definitive decisions have not been made in relation to the national development plan in the BMW regions and the grant support structure. There is a fear that the region will be left out because of the emphasis on cities, where substantial losses have occurred, and that the people in the west will not gain as they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gas find off north Mayo provides an opportunity to the people of the west. Bord Gáis, as the agency developing the pipeline to the <Col N="781" /> source in north Mayo, has been up front and informative in its deliberations with Mayo County Council in terms of its development and progress is being made.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing the money, subject to regulation from the responsible authorities at European level. It will provide the necessary funding to allow Bord Gáis install the main pipeline into the source and extend it when they have assessed the feasibility of providing service into the north-west and Northern Ireland. Like our tourism sector, we are now beginning to look at our gas and natural energy sectors on a national basis. This is good news for our long-term energy supply, its management and the range of sources, particularly in an open economy where we can buy and sell our energy on the open market internationally.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that things are not happening fast enough, as evidenced by the motion before us from Senator Caffrey and others. It is understandable because there have been substantial objections to the development of the gas terminal in the north Mayo area. While constructive arguments have been put forward and concerns expressed, Enterprise Oil has tried to deal with the specific worries of the people concerned who live in close proximity to the terminal's intake in the Belmullet region. It is important that is done because this area lacks major economic activity and people must be dealt with in a reasonable and fair way and compensated for disadvantage or interference with their land or property.</P>
    <P>I understand from Enterprise Oil that discussions are on-going and that progress is being made on a daily basis. The company is advancing its environmental impact study. It is looking at the issue of its foreshore licence and will be applying to the Department of the Marine to advance that aspect of the development. This is to be welcomed. I understand that the necessary professional advice has been taken in the EIA and I hope that the requirements, concerns and needs of a high quality environment are being considered and incorporated into the EIA.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis has made the necessary compulsory purchase orders for the laying of the pipeline to where it meets Corrib Oil and there will be an oral hearing later this month in relation to the CPOs and necessary compensation. Progress is being made. While there may have been a duplication of statements at some stage, this Government is fully committed to providing the necessary money, through Bord Gáis, to extend the services and provide the supply. It will provide a substantial number of jobs in north Mayo during its construction. Mayo County Council recently welcomed the decision by Rolls-Royce to apply for planning permission to build a new electricity terminal in the north Mayo region and we hope that will be positive in the long-term and will take <Col N="782" /> advantage of the gas that will be brought onshore in the region.</P>
    <P>There are certain constraints in that area in the lack of jobs and the jobs that will be lost with the closure of Bord na Móna and the peat-burning power station which has been of such importance to the area. Any jobs that can be created by the increase of power and infrastructure in the region will be of great benefit to the county as a whole. We will see substantial benefit to the county when it is in place and substantial rates being paid to the county council as our major industries and growth centres avail of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I respect the views expressed in relation to service to smaller towns. Bord Gáis indicated at our last meeting that they would connect the main centres immediately and then progressively connect the smaller centres of population where economies of scale apply. Substantial jobs will be created in those areas. It is important that Mayo benefits, through job creation, from having the necessary infrastructure in place from that natural resource which will play a major role in our economic development and its maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to outline to the House the very significant progress that is taking place in the development of the natural gas network. Over the course of the next couple of years, Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) is planning to spend more than £650 million (&euro;825 million) on new gas infrastructure. Of this, £450 million (&euro;570 million) will be spent on the Dublin-Galway-Limerick ringmain and the Mayo-Galway pipeline incorporating an investment of £200 million (&euro;250 million) in the BMW region. In addition, the Government recently decided to move forward with the next stage in extending gas to the north-west.</P>
      <P>In order to place the developments now under way in context, it is worth reflecting back on the Kinsale discovery in the 1970s, because it acted as a catalyst for the development of the gas network as we know it today. The first gas came to Cork in 1978 and to Dublin four years later upon completion of the Cork/Dublin pipeline. Subsequent extensions were to Limerick and Waterford in 1986 and to the north east in 1988. This incremental growth reflects the usual development pattern of gas networks. By the early 1990s projected gas demand exceeded Kinsale's projected supply capacity and an interconnector with Scotland was completed in 1993, allowing for imports of North Sea gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dramatic expansion of the network now under way is a positive endorsement of the Government's view that improved infrastructure is one of the key elements in ensuring a solid foundation for the economy into the years ahead. The scale of development of the network should not be under-estimated. Between the second <Col N="783" /> interconnector, the ringmain and the Corrib pipeline, over 750 kilometres of new pipeline will be added to our gas network.</P>
    <P>As the Kinsale field depletes, an increasing amount of our gas is coming through the interconnector. BGE estimates that 80% of our gas this year will be imported through the interconnector. With Corrib not due to begin supplying gas until 2003, the Government decided that the Bord Gáis proposal for a second interconnector from Scotland was the only supply project capable of ensuring that projected gas demand in the winter of 2002 could be met. This project is going through the statutory approval process and is on schedule to be completed before the end of 2002. I have kept under review the need to proceed with the second interconnector with Scotland in the light of revised economic forecasts and supply-side developments and I am satisfied that the case for proceeding in the envisaged timeframe remains valid.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are now relying so much on imported gas is a prime example of the critical importance of the network in connecting consumers with the sources of gas. This reliance on imported gas will lessen when Corrib comes on stream, but the network will remain critical. It will allow consumers to have a choice of supply, which will exert downward pressure on price, thus improving competitiveness, and it will enhance security of supply, thus improving investor confidence.</P>
    <P>Much of the onshore network development currently being undertaken by Bord Gáis is in the BMW region. In 1996 Bord Gáis began examining the possibility of extending the network to the west. Following extensive research and analysis it concluded that the optimum development and enhancement of the network would be to build a pipeline between Dublin, Galway and Limerick, thus completing a ring main. This project will strengthen the network and enhance security of supply, open up new markets in areas of the country previously without a gas supply and enhance their attractiveness as investment locations.</P>
    <P>The gas network here has grown progressively since the first gas came to Cork in 1978. The current period of development is a different proposition. The network is being expanded dramatically to encompass increased security of supply through the new interconnector, and the ring main and Corrib pipelines will see both the midlands and a corridor from Limerick to north Mayo connected to the gas network for the first time. These developments signal a very significant change in the focus and pace of development of the gas network. In all, it is estimated that the number of households with access to gas will increase from 500,000 to more than 750,000 by 2010. In addition, countless small businesses, <Col N="784" /> shops, pubs and so forth not currently connected will have access to gas.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House a brief update on the status of the development of the two onshore pipelines. An environmental impact statement for the Dublin-Galway-Limerick ringmain has been submitted to me by BGE. This has been appraised by independent consultants who have confirmed that it meets all statutory requirements and will not have significant environmental effects in the long-term. I convened an oral hearing on 24 September last to inquire into BGE's application to construct this pipeline and its associated applications for acquisition orders. This hearing has concluded and I am considering the independent inspectors' report and recommendations. BGE has a scheduled completion date of October 2002 for this pipeline.</P>
    <P>Independent consultants have also concluded an evaluation of the environmental impact assessment for the Mayo-Galway pipeline, which will bring Corrib gas to the network. The consultants have indicated that it also meets all statutory requirements and will have no significant effect on the environment in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The public consultation process on this pipeline, which is separate from the planning process, concluded on 29 October last. Seventeen objections were received during this process and I have decided to convene an oral hearing to inquire into this application on 11 December 2001 in Castlebar, County Mayo. BGE has a scheduled completion date of August 2003 for this pipeline. It has signalled that Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry are likely to be connected in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the extension of the gas network to the north-west. Earlier this year the Government decided, in principle, to extend the natural gas network to the north-west. Having considered the issue, the Government has now decided to move ahead with the next step in this project. The first phase of extending the pipeline network to the north-west has begun. BGE was asked to conduct a detailed planning exercise on the extension of the network to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny via a cross-Border pipeline from Derry, which is to be served by a pipeline from Belfast, planned by the Northern Ireland authorities. I will return to pipeline developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Preliminary analysis carried out for BGE has confirmed that these extensions would not be viable on the basis of anticipated gas demand and that considerable grant aid would be required. The level of grant aid depends on the balance between the capital and operating costs of the extension and the estimated gas demand in the new area being served.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a broad view of these projects. Clearly it would not be commer<Col N="785" /> cially sustainable or financially feasible to extend the network to all towns in the north-west or in any other area of the country for that matter. However, given the wider regional and socio-economic benefits of extending the network to Sligo and Letterkenny, the Government has taken a positive view of the project and has decided to proceed with the next stage of it. Detailed engineering and planning for the project will define the pipeline extensions in greater detail and identify the level of funding which would be required. The accurate carrying out of that exercise is crucial. I understand this phase of the project will take between six and nine months to complete. I emphasise this will give an accurate picture of the level of grant aid which would be necessary to proceed with the project.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the detailed engineering is being carried out, my Department is preparing a State aid case, which will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval. This is an infrastructure project which, when constructed, will be available to all gas suppliers. It will be capable of supplying indigenous and imported gas and will enlarge the total customer base for the liberalised gas market. Once the detailed engineering phase has been completed, the issue of grant aid will be considered again by Government, provided the necessary clearance has been obtained from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to proposed developments in the Northern Ireland network, BGE and Questar, an American pipeline company, have applied to the Northern Ireland regulator to build two pipelines, one linking Belfast to Derry that would supply the planned new Coolkeeragh power station and the city of Derry and the other comprising a South-North interconnector from Gormanston, County Meath, to Antrim to tie into the proposed Belfast to Derry line. Having regard to the wider benefits of cross-Border links, the Government supports these pipeline proposals and has decided to make a £10 million grant available towards the development of the Northern Ireland gas network. This contribution recognises the benefits such developments will have for energy supplies in the north-west and for the development of an all-island energy market which is a shared aspiration, North and South.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced the outcome of my review of gas transmission tariffs following widespread consultation with interested parties. Under the new arrangements the current single overall transmission charge will be divided into separate charges for onshore pipelines and for entry points to the Irish network such as Corrib gas in the west and the interconnectors from Scotland. This was necessary to ensure a level playing field in the gas market and to underpin the largescale expansion of gas pipeline infrastructure, including the ring main and the second interconnector from Scotland. The new arrangements are <Col N="786" /> in line with the recommendations in the report by the Brattle Group on Third Party Access Tariffs. We now have a gas transmission tariff model that accommodates multiple entry points, a development that reflects the growing maturity of the Irish natural gas transmission system.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the tariffs, I decided to reduce the rate of return Bord Gáis would be allowed to earn on its transmission assets from 7.5% to 6.5%. This reduction in the rate of return will limit the increase in tariffs needed to finance the new pipeline investment. The return of 7.5% at present allowed to Bord Gáis was high given the cost of debt in the euro zone and by reference to the rate of return allowed to other utilities, including electricity networks.</P>
    <P>The review of transmission tariffs will result in increases which would be spread over two years, this year and next. This will see a rise in gas costs of about 1.7% for power stations and about 2% for large industrial consumers in each of the two years. Because An Bord Gáis has a price freeze in place for domestic consumers up to 2003 the new tariff arrangements will mean no change in the price of gas to these customers. An Bord Gáis confirmed that this would not result in cross-subsidisation of charges to domestic customers by other categories of customers.</P>
    <P>The tariff directives place a transparency obligation on An Bord Gáis to publish underlying data in order that interested parties can understand how the tariffs are derived. The directives are available on my Department's website. An Bord Gáis has also placed the new tariffs on its website and has announced that it will be holding an information seminar in the near future.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill which passed all stages in this House recently. The Bill will establish independent regulation of the gas sector and speed up the opening of the market to competition. The contributions of Senators during the passage of the Bill through the House were very constructive and I would like, once again, to express my thanks.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure and regulatory changes now under way in the natural gas sector will be seen as an investment in the future. The creation of a mature and robust gas network will serve as an important element in Ireland's infrastructure that will help to underpin the economy for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned the pace of what is happening. I emphasise that the pace has been incremental over the past 23 years. Indigenous gas was first brought ashore at Kinsale. Only two weeks ago I launched the new gas infrastructure in my constituency in County Wicklow. It took 23 years to get there. The neighbouring County Wexford, as Senator Walsh has reminded me many times, is devoid of any gas infrastructure. He and his colleagues and other public representatives in the constituency have been beavering away to secure that most important infrastructure <Col N="787" /> for their county. I met them and their county manager some months ago and suggested how they might go about achieving their very meritorious aspiration. The pace at which matters are moving now cannot be compared with the pace of the past &ndash; the current pace is dramatic.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Government is resolved &ndash; the Taoiseach has taken a particular interest &ndash; to bring this necessary infrastructure to the west and north-west. Its decision to extend the gas network to the north-west was taken in the full knowledge that it would not meet the commercial criteria to which Senator Caffrey and others referred, and that an input of funding would be required. Consolation, comfort and confidence should be taken from this fact. There is a resolve. The decision has been taken by Government to bring the natural gas infrastructure to the north-west, and the necessary work is going on apace. What BGE is required to do is being done and what needs to be done with regard to preparing applications for State aid is being done within my Department. There is a resolve and I am quite satisfied that it will be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little difference in content or substance between the proposal and the amendment. The proposal seeks the extension of the gas pipeline to Ballina and Sligo and recognises that the financial viability of this is a question that must be addressed by Government. The amendment rightly recognises that in this area of activity the Minister of State has been strenuous in his efforts to ensure a comprehensive policy of developing the network is in place. Bord Gáis Éireann also deserves certain commendations for its effort in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that 80% of gas is now imported. It is in the national interest that this be redressed as soon as possible. Gas is a great natural resource. Those areas that have had the benefit of it in the past two decades will testify to its social, economic and environmental benefits &ndash; gas is a very clean fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to invest of the order of &euro;825 million is significant by any standard of investment today, and the ringmain pipeline which will connect Dublin, Galway and Limerick will also benefit the west. Although I am from the south-east, I concur fully with those who believe that the west needs infrastructure to facilitate economic development. It is lagging behind the rest of the country. It is a phenomenon in many European countries and also in Asia that the biggest challenge facing governments is to achieve uniform regional development. Recently the Deputy Prime Minister of Slovakia spoke about the fact that Slovakia's <i>per capita</i> income is about 49% of the European average, which accords approximately to where Ireland was when it joined the European Union. However, Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia, is on a par with the European average. This indicates that right across Europe <Col N="788" /> there is a need to focus on areas that need assistance to bring them level with other areas.</P>
    <P>We talked today about decentralisation and encouraging people to disperse to different regions within the country. However, if we do not address the economic imbalances, it will be difficult to achieve this. To succeed in keeping people living in their areas is a laudable aspiration for any government. The BMW region will benefit significantly from the Corrib gas pipeline. It will represent an investment of the order of &euro;250 million in the area. I compliment the Minister of State on ensuring Bord Gáis Éireann has proceeded to the next stage of establishing a detailed plan for the pipeline to examine its viability and assess the economics of the projected use of the gas in the area. This is a fundamental first step if the European Commission is to be persuaded to allow the necessary grant aid which will be essential to bringing the project to fruition.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the fact that this sector is an example to other areas of the economy in the context of developing North-South co-operation and addressing the imbalance of trade. We trade more abroad than with Northern Ireland and it does likewise. There is a huge potential economic benefit to people on both sides of the Border if we can generate greater co-operation and activity in the area of business. Many in Northern Ireland aspire to do this because they have seen how well the economy here has progressed, particularly in the past decade. Because of political instability and the troubles they encountered, their growth has been retarded by comparison.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on availing of the opportunity presented by the North-South gas pipeline. The extension from Derry to Letterkenny is to be welcomed because Donegal, as a peripheral county, needs the assistance this will provide to develop economically. The Department's contribution of almost &euro;13 billion could be used as an example to other Departments dealing with other sectors of the economy. This money has been a significant factor in the decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Kinsale gasfield which was developed 23 years ago. It has serviced many parts of the country since and is now servicing County Wicklow. The Marathon platform from which the gas is brought ashore was built at Ross Company shipyard in New Ross. It is an anomaly that 23 years later, County Wexford is one of the few counties which has not benefited from it. While we were instrumental in providing the infrastructure and the platform in order to facilitate Marathon, we are still awaiting the arrival of the gas into our county. As a county which has a very low industrial base it is essential that we get it.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what the Minister of State has said and thank him for his assistance to us, particularly at a recent meeting where he gave us good advice about how we might pursue the issue. I hope that in the not-too-distant future he will be instrumental in ensuring that both the north-west <Col N="789" /> and the south-east receive this sought-after infrastructural facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am delighted that the gas supply will be coming to Sligo and Ballina on the Corrib gas transmission line. However, I worry about objectors who could delay its arrival. It is becoming difficult for the west to survive among all the objections. It is not this Government's fault as it has been going on for the last 20 years. It is impossible for any development to take place.</P>
      <P>Many of the worst objectors are national outfits with no connection to the area, who object, for example, on environmental grounds. In Sligo, if the hospital has to do any amount of work they must bring in heavy generators as there is not enough power to operate all the equipment at once. The ESB has been trying to build a line for the last ten years but the objections have been so great that it has not happened. We tend to blame councillors or the Government, but I appeal to the Western Commission, to all the chambers of commerce in the west and all organisations with an interest in developing the area to give support to the Government and the councillors.</P>
      <P>In Mayo the county council has given permission for gas to be brought ashore but there have been 17 objections. I am sure this was discussed with Mayo County Council if those people had any case to make. The council felt it was right, yet it has been held up again. It is the same in my home town in Sligo. A through road and a bridge were held up for over 20 years before being built. There were always objections in the way, but none of the objections voiced at the time has any relevance now. None of it was true. Now the road is held up again for another 20 years. Objectors are becoming so strong that we must find another way.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with farmers whose land is affected, because land is near and dear to the Irish, but it annoys me that the objecting organisations are often based here in the metropolis of Dublin. They go down to these areas and object. It was once attempted to put a little bit of a runway into one of the hundreds of acres of derelict bog in the Gaeltacht. Groups from Dublin went down and objected to it and that airstrip could not be built. It would have been very useful to Mayo and to the whole area in attracting people for the purposes of showing them development land and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is to be congratulated on the amount of money it puts into development in the west, but it is hard that we cannot spend it. I have spent my lifetime campaigning for the west and I made my living there, refusing to go to England or any other country despite the popularity of the emigrant ship. The slogans at election times concerned the flags of our railway stations which were washed with mothers' tears as they bid goodbye to their loved ones. I have seen all that and worked hard for development. It hurts me to the bone when I see organisations objecting to a <Col N="790" /> farmer building a house for his son or daughter. A way must be found to put an end to the hold-ups, otherwise we will never be able to spend any money and the west will stagnate even more.</P>
    <P>There are parts of the west where the addition of another light bulb would nearly put out all the lights in the area. The electricity shortage is acute, yet people object to hydroelectric or turf-fuelled power stations. Why do we not have wind or wave-fuelled power? We have enough wind in this country. Those who have never seen a wind farm are objecting to them. They wonder how people could stick their noise, but they are absolutely silent. There is no noise. The west's e-commerce industry is at a standstill due to lack of power. We are not allowed to spend the large amount of money the Government is making available and we cannot have the services we need because everything is being held up.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all people with an interest in the west to take control of the area and tell those people who come in from outside to object that their day is done. We will not listen to them. We will run the west of Ireland and we will not be dictated to by cliques and groups of well-heeled and comfortable people living in beautiful suburban homes, driving Jaguars and Mercedes, coming down for holidays to the west and objecting to the very thing we want, which is to create jobs and create work.</P>
    <P>No Government can do what is required. The county councils are doing their best but they cannot succeed unless we take a grip and do not allow any more interference from outside objectors. We are the people who live there. If we could live on scenery we would be very fat and would have no need to worry, but scenery is not everything. As the poet once wrote,</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay. . .</P>
    <P>. . . But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.</P>
    <P>Unless the people of the west make positive decisions about development, it will not happen. We cannot blame Governments. I thank the Government again for the amount of money it is making available. I hope we will be allowed to spend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. There has been much comment in the debate about the north-west, but as the person in this House who comes from the most northerly area of the north-west, I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined the position clearly for Senator Caffrey. It is impossible for the Minister to give a financial commitment, or indicate the amount of that financial commitment, until the studies and the necessary planning have been carried out. When that is done, he will <Col N="791" /> know the shortfall and the subvention the Government will have to give to Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting four or five months ago at which the Minister of State gave a commitment to public representatives and others from the Sligo, north-west and Mayo region. He said the Government had discussed the matter and it would do its best to ensure that gas would be brought to the north-west. I am delighted the Minister of State has fulfilled that promise with the recent announcements. We all accept that it is not viable to bring gas to Mayo and into Sligo, and it may not even be viable to bring it from Coolkeeragh to Donegal, but the commitment has been given and when the financial, design and planning issues have been dealt with, the Minister will be in a position to indicate the amount of the financial commitment.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I have spoken on the issue in this House. When I first became a Member four years ago, I met the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his office about a lot of work that had been undertaken by a body based in Killybegs, which was confident that gas would be found off the Mayo cost. It wanted Killybegs to be developed as the harbour where all the service industry involved in this project would take place, in the same way as Aberdeen was used in the north of Scotland when oil and gas was found there. The Minister told me at that time that the commitment for Killybegs Harbour would be enormous and that information available to him indicated that it could be up to ten years before any gas would come ashore. Both the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have delivered in that regard. Even though it will not get off the ground before the next general election, at least the commitment has been given.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I attended a special meeting of Donegal County Council at which the group of 22, which was formed in Derry city because the Coolkeeragh power station was to be closed, was present. At that stage it had been pushing for at least 20 years to get gas piped from Belfast across to Coolkeeragh. That commitment, through cross-Border co-operation, is now about to be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I believe the gas pipeline will reach Sligo, Derry and possibly Letterkenny, and if the Minister of State continues in his position after the general election, I know he will do everything in his power to ensure that what I seek comes to pass. The pipeline should continue from Sligo, eventually connecting with the pipeline coming into Letterkenny. I do not want a gas pipeline in every small town and village in Donegal, but I want gas for the principal towns on that route such as Bundoran, Ballyshannon, one of the largest towns in Donegal which has been starved of industry over the years, and Ballybofey, which has suffered much as a result of unemployment over the past year. Ballybofey is one of the best commercial towns in Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" />Because the gas pipeline is being extended to Letterkenny, everybody believes it will be extended to Donegal also. Most of the jobs created in Donegal in the past two years were in Letterkenny and I am aware, from working in Letterkenny, that the delays one encounters as a result of traffic are almost as bad as those in Dublin. Letterkenny can take only so much. The other towns I have mentioned in Donegal should be given a chance. When the studies are completed and the financial commitments are decided on for the line to Sligo, and what is happening in relation to the line to Letterkenny, I hope the Government will consider extending the Sligo line to Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>When the original gas pipeline was installed from Kinsale to Dublin and on to Dundalk to connect with the pipeline from Scotland, there were plans to extend the line from Dundalk to Sligo. Unfortunately, it only got as far as Kingscourt due to financial restraints. Even though we are currently experiencing a minor downturn in the economy, the pessimism expressed in the motion before us tonight will not be fulfilled. Things will get better again and I hope that we will succeed in bringing gas into the whole north-west area.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a number of other matters. I come from the area with the highest level of unemployment. Senator Farrell mentioned objectors earlier. Those of us living in the BMW region have always suffered in that regard but in Donegal, particularly Donegal south-west, it appears we will continue to suffer. If there are cutbacks in terms of the national development plan, we believe we will be put to the bottom of the list again. That is not the reason we sought to obtain Objective One status. It was because of regions such as ours that Ireland received Structural Funds over the years. If they are not prepared to take funding for roads in the South due to objections by landowners, we will gladly take it to improve our road infrastructure into Donegal.</P>
    <P>Recently, An Bord Pleanála refused to give permission to the ESB to bring the new 110 kv line around the north-west coast to Letterkenny. The ESB stated recently that Letterkenny needed the power. We have an industrial estate in Gweedore with more than 1,000 people employed and we are not able to attract new industry because of the lack of power.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also mentioned wind power. It has been proven that Donegal has the greatest source of wind power in Europe, and the Minister of State has opened windmills on two or three occasions in Donegal. Last year, when debating the Donegal county development plan, I fought tooth and nail to get changes approved in relation to wind power and the location of wind farms, but an Independent Member of the Oireachtas on the other side of the House objected and said that people should be refused permission to build wind farms if they were above a certain height level. I succeeded in getting that objection removed because the issue is not the height of the <Col N="793" /> windmill but the effect on the landscape. There are many fine mountains in Donegal behind which windmills can be hidden.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has always delivered anything that was asked of him. If he continues in his position after the election, I ask him to ensure that when the line is brought to Sligo and Letterkenny, it will also be extended to Bundoran and into Ballybofey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's honesty in acknowledging the current situation, but unfortunately I did not get any great joy from his contribution. The essence of what I wanted to say tonight was highlighted by Senator Walsh who said that even though Wexford was instrumental in getting the Kinsale gasfield off the ground, it has waited 23 years for its own supply of natural gas. I have visions of that happening in Mayo if we do not get in on the first phase of the development because in the normal course of events few towns in Mayo and Sligo, apart from Sligo town, would qualify for a gas pipeline on strictly commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the rolling programme of gas pipeline extensions the Minister of State mentioned will continue, possibly unabated. This gives me no consolation because I believe that, in the normal course of events, the rolling programme will not include the towns in Mayo to which I referred. We want to be included in the first phase of the development. We do not want to wait on commercial assessments or projects assessed on strictly commercial criteria. We need to be included in the initial phase of the rolling programme, not placed in a queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are special reasons for giving us a high <Col N="794" /> priority in the first phase of the development. As Senator Norris said, the gas is on our doorstep. We are entitled, perhaps not legally, but certainly morally, to special consideration and positive discrimination with regard to the location of the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated it will take between six and nine months for the assessment to be completed by the consultants drawing up the plans, including engineering plans and the pipeline way leaves. The fact remains that the cost of these pipelines is well established. One might need a consultant to advise on the location of the pipeline, but certainly not to inform one of its cost.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell's comments on planning hit the nail on the head. At a recent meeting of Mayo County Council I called for the abolition of An Bord Pleanála and its reconstitution in regional appeal boards which would have more empathy with the people living in the locality they represented. Senator Farrell referred to the objectors. They have a platform. The final arbiter is An Bord Pleanála. In the county I represent we waited 14 years to get a bypass scheme on the drawing board. An Bord Pleanála has been sitting on this for another year, bringing the total wait to 15 years. These are the types of timescales which concern me.</P>
    <P>The sole reason I tabled this motion is to get the first phase of the development in Mayo launched. I do not doubt this programme will continue, but it will continue solely on commercial lines possibly without our demand for special consideration being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am somewhat disappointed the Minister for Education and Science is not here in person because the issue I am raising is very important in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. It has been a matter of considerable debate for some time, and it is important that it be addressed urgently. It concerns the need for the Minster for Education and Science to ensure Newtownforbes secondary school remains open and continues to provide a second level education for the children of Newtownforbes and the catchment area.</P>
      <P>I am raising this issue in the Seanad tonight as a result of major public debate, numerous public meetings, and a level of representation from the action committee of the people of Newtownforbes, all of which hammer home to any public representative that there is a great passion to have St. Joseph's secondary school in Newtownforbes continue as a second level facility.</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's secondary school was established in 1950 by the order of the Sisters of Mercy. Since then it has gained an excellent reputation for its standard of education. The school is unique in its size and rural setting. The caring approach of dedicated teachers ensures every pupil is recognised, cherished and encouraged in every way. Academic excellence and a holistic approach to education have been the school's hallmark from the outset. It has served the parish with distinction for many years, as well as hundreds of students beyond the boundary of the parish. It promises a great future for its students and should continue its excellent service of providing a sound educational and moral environment to meet the needs and demands of modern life for many years to come.</P>
      <P>Currently, the school offers the standard curriculum, in addition to other activities, which include sports, music, personal development, debating, drama and many study skills. All this has been put in jeopardy because, on 4 December last, the Sisters of Mercy informed parents of students gathered at St. Joseph's secondary school they would act as trustees of the school only up to 2003, because part of their plan to wind down the school would not allow them to have an intake of students in September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reasons were given as to why they decided to close the school. The primary reason was the trend towards declining student numbers in the school in the past five years. Other reasons included a decline in the general population in Longford and surrounding areas and the long-term viability of the buildings. The parents were <Col N="796" /> also informed the decision to close was made solely by the Sisters of Mercy, who informed the Department of Education and Science thereafter. The Department accepted this decision. As was expected, the overwhelming response from parents was not to allow the school closure.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the meeting, parents from the area formed a steering committee to assess carefully the prospects of keeping the school open. Its first undertaking was to contact the principals of 21 primary schools in the catchment area, who were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The survey shows a stable population projection in coming years in Newtownforbes and the catchment area. It is also worth noting that the number of baptisms in the Newtownforbes parish alone has risen dramatically in the past four years. From 1992 to 1996 there were 58 baptisms and over the following four years &ndash; 1997 to 2000 &ndash; there were 90 baptisms, an increase of 56%. These figures do not include the increasing number of families moving into the Newtownforbes area, including those from abroad and those who have children of schoolgoing age.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months, due to major industrial and commercial announcements for significant direct inward investment and a newly designated tax status for County Longford, there has been unprecedented growth in housing and commercial and industrial projects. The number of residential planning applications for new houses approved between 1990 and 2000 was 4,906. Eighty per cent of these new housing developments will be in the outlying areas of Longford town. These figures can be obtained from and verified by Roscommon County Council.</P>
    <P>The official accepted factor for population determination for houses is 3.5. Projecting the population increase in the next five years, the picture that evolves is one that the town has never experienced before. Given that there were 30,166 people in the county in 1996 &ndash; based on CSO figures &ndash; this would increase to 47,337 by 2006. In Newtownforbes more than 100 housing applications have been approved by Longford County Council. It is the fastest growing village in rural Ireland according to the council. Furthermore, the Newtownforbes side of Longford town is predicted to grow out to the village and, even now, transit times from the Newtownforbes side of Longford are shorter than those to the other secondary schools in County Longford. This is important because, if Longford town is to develop in the direction of Newtownforbes, obviously a strong case can be made for having a second level school in Newtownforbes.</P>
    <P>At present Scoil Mhuire is operating at maximum capacity. It is one of the two schools in Longford. St. Mel's is just slightly under capacity. Given this, there is no doubt there would be a capacity problem for second level education in <Col N="797" /> the Longford catchment area if population projections are realised in the short or medium term.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the steering committee &ndash; to which I have something to add &ndash; that if St. Joseph's secondary school stays open for at least five years, student numbers will increase. It is clear that the following actions are required: a clear statement from the Department of Education and Science must be made stating it is prepared to support the school in the long-term; a long-term development plan should be prepared for the school, with particular emphasis placed on niche areas of education to differentiate the school from others. A long-term development plan has been prepared for the school with emphasis placed on these areas of education to differentiate it.</P>
    <P>The people of Newtownforbes have requested for some time that the Minister for Education and Science meet the steering committee and representatives from the area. Will the Minister accede to this request as soon as possible and take the decision regarding the independent assessor, Mr. Murphy, who has examined the school? For the case to be made properly and for the Minister to understand the depth of feeling and the positive proposals put forward for Newtownforbes, a deputation from the area should be received.</P>
    <P>Longford will experience an unprecedented increase in population in the next five years. Without St. Joseph's secondary school, there will definitely be a problem accommodating second level students in the short to medium term. Given this imminent population increase and its effects, we do not understand how the school's closure can be justified. The steering committee, speaking on behalf of the community, has said that it will endeavour to ensure the school remains open. The Minister should indicate that the school will remain open and that he will meet a deputation of the steering committee and representatives of the people of the Longford and Newtownforbes areas as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Finneran on raising this important issue. I know that the Minister for Education and Science would dearly like to have been present to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the provision of post-primary education in Newtownforbes, County Longford. St. Joseph's secondary school, Newtownforbes, is situated approximately 2.5 miles from Longford town and is one of four post-primary schools in the area. It was established in the early 1950s. Formerly an all-girls boarding school, co-education was introduced during the 1970s and in 1989 the boarding element of the school was closed. Enrolments at the school peaked in the early 1990s at more than 450 pupils. However, in the intervening period <Col N="798" /> there has been a steady decline in numbers to the extent that enrolment now stands at 125 pupils.</P>
    <P>In December 2000, the trustees of St. Joseph's, that is, the Sisters of Mercy, Western Province, announced the closure of the school. They decided that closure was to be on a phased basis over the next two years with final closure at the end of the 2002-03 school year. Accordingly, there was no intake of first year pupils last September, but all existing pupils will be in a position to complete their junior or senior cycle, as appropriate, at the school.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of a phased closure by the trustees, a local action group made a case to the Department of Education and Science for the retention of the school. The issue for the Minister for Education and Science is whether a post-primary school in Newtownforbes is required or whether other schools in the area have the capacity between them to provide for the educational needs of all the pupils in the catchment area. It is also apparent that retaining a post-primary school in Newtownforbes will require significant capital investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science was conscious of competing arguments about issues such as future demographic trends and the impact of housing and industrial development in the Longford town area, and he decided to arrange for a comprehensive, independent analysis of all the relevant data and to consider submissions which interested parties wished to make. The facilitator has recently completed his report and a decision will be taken on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to bring this matter to the Minister's attention. I see some very good friends from north County Dublin in the Visitors Gallery. I am pleased to see them visiting the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter I raise concerns the need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional classrooms at Clonmellon national school in County Westmeath to cater for an increasing number of pupils attending the school. In 1996 Clonmellon national school had 160 <Col N="799" /> pupils on the roll with five class teachers and a shared learning support teacher. In terms of facilities, it had a general purpose room for physical education and other activities, tennis and basketball courts and a large playground. It also had a staff room, a kitchenette and a learning support room.</P>
    <P>Five years later I am pleased to inform the House that 215 pupils attend the school. It is the only school in north Westmeath which has not declined in population in the past five years. Staffing has improved dramatically. There are 11 teachers, including an administrative principal, eight class teachers, a shared learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. There is also a part-time resource teacher, a visiting teacher for the deaf, a secretary and a classroom assistant.</P>
    <P>However, equally dramatic is the deterioration in accommodation. The school no longer has a general purpose room because it has been divided up to create a new classroom, a tiny resource room and a staff room. The former small staff room was not large enough and this is now the principal's office. There are two prefabs in the middle of the yard which means that the tennis and basketball courts had to be dismantled to create a playing area. The secretary is accommodated in the kitchenette with all the various utensils which must be stored there. The resource teacher is in a cubicle measuring 2.5 metres by three metres. There is nowhere to accommodate a part-time resource teacher and the rest of the special needs children must use the learning support room or the resource room when available and the staff room on the other days. This is unacceptable and it is no way to treat children, especially those with special needs.</P>
    <P>The school has no accommodation for the visiting teacher for the deaf who calls to see two children with hearing difficulties. The two infant classes are still accommodated in an inadequate building which was built in 1936 and is due to fall into disuse when the proposed extension is completed. In 1998 the Department sanctioned a major job on the heating system in this building, but this work was deferred because of the impending building work. Unfortunately, the school must deal with the consequences of this decision.</P>
    <P>The teaching staff in this school has almost doubled in the past five years, but the only improvement in accommodation has been an addition of two prefabs. The facilities on offer to pupils have deteriorated seriously and, with no general purpose room, the school can have physical education only when the weather is favourable. Other school activities such as concert and drama activities and the choir have also been adversely affected. The parents' association, which meets regularly and organises fundraising activities, for which it is to be congratulated, has been seriously hampered in its activities. There <Col N="800" /> are also serious health and safety issues which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The new plans include major work on the existing building to bring it up to present-day standards. This work will include fire doors and fire screens which are essential, especially in the two storey building. It is also intended to provide a safe playing area for the children behind the building and well away from the road. The younger children play in front of the building which is next to the very busy N52. The current prefabs are a safety hazard as they create blind corners around which children run. Provision for parking is also included in the new plans because at present staff must park their cars on the main street in Clonmellon.</P>
    <P>Clonmellon is a developing small town on the border of counties Westmeath and Meath. A scheme of 38 houses has been completed and there are many other housing schemes in the pipeline. Unfortunately, however, there are few facilities on offer. Members of the local community previously had use of the school's tennis court and were naturally upset to lose it. The general purposes room at the school was available for community events, but that is no longer the case. The parents of the children who attend the school, who made a tremendous effort to raise the local contribution of £25,000, were devastated to learn that the building project may now be delayed indefinitely. I compliment the parents, students and teachers who have shown great patience.</P>
    <P>I know the Department believes that the eight classroom school is a most desirable unit, both educationally and economically. I ask the Minister to accelerate matters within the building unit of the Department in order that progress can be made on building a school of the size required in Clonmellon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cassidy for raising this important issue and welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the building project for Clonmellon national school.</P>
      <P>At present the school has a staffing level of one principal, eight mainstream classroom teachers, one teacher, ex-quota, Breaking the Cycle and one resource teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 215 pupils. The school's current facilities consist of six permanent classrooms and two small prefabs. The Department of Education and Science recently informed the board of management at the school to instruct its design team to seek planning permission for the proposed building project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the building programme at all levels. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the project to which the Senator refers, will be taken, as in previous years, <Col N="801" /> in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes at the conclusion of the forthcoming budgetary process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for coming to the House at this late hour.</P>
      <P>The long-awaited Mental Health Act was passed this summer. It was necessary to introduce the legislation because we were in great trouble with the European Court of Human Rights regarding the detention of people within our mental hospitals The legislation under which we were working at that stage and, unfortunately, under which we continue to work had been found by the European Court of Human Rights to be an aberration. It was introduced 50 years ago when psychiatry was not the discipline it is now. As the Minister of State is aware, huge progress has been made in that area of medicine and great changes, therefore, had to be made in our treatment of patients in mental hospitals.</P>
      <P>The legislation under which we were working, which we were obliged to change and under which we continue to work, had no mechanism whereby a patient who had been involuntarily admitted to a mental hospital could have his or her admission or case reviewed. There was no method whereby he or she could initiate his discharge, even if those responsible for this care within the mental hospital considered that there was no further need for him or her to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature of the Mental Health Act, 2001, is that it deals with involuntary admissions. I recall that the Labour Party sought to have the Title changed to the involuntary admissions Bill. However, the Act also deals with a number of other important areas. While the legislation has been enacted, none of its provisions has been implemented by the Minister. This is leading to great difficulties for both patients and those working in the profession. Involuntarily detained patients are objecting to their detention before the courts on a weekly basis. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this from reports in the press. Senator Farrell complained last week about the fact that psychiatrists are releasing patients out of hospital who, when discharged, are committing violent crimes. The Senator has a point, but, unfortunately, psychiatrists are not in a posi<Col N="802" /> tion to detain those who have been involuntarily admitted because, as has been shown, this is an area fraught with legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>I invested a great deal of time and effort in the debate on the Mental Health Act and it is dreadful that, four months after its passage, we continue to operate under the old legislation. Surely we should implement some of the provisions contained in the Act. It is difficult for those of us involved in this area to know the reason there has been such a delay. What makes matters worse is that we were promised that after the Act was passed, immediate action would be taken to bring legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding mentally ill people who are before the courts and being held in custody. However, nothing has happened in that regard. Mentally ill people are coming before the courts and not being appropriately dealt with. The European Court of Human Rights has already stated that we are in breach of its regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will provide a sensible reply. I have been trying to discover from the Department the reason for the delay, but have not received an adequate response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter on the Adjournment and her interest in the Mental Health Act, both during and since its passage through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As the Senator indicated, the Mental Health Act, 2001, which was signed into law in July this year will significantly improve safeguards for mentally disordered persons involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment and bring Irish mental health law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The enactment of this new mental health legislation is an important milestone in the development of our thinking in relation to mental illness in modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for the establishment of an independent body, the Mental Health Commission. The primary function of the commission will be to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and ensure the interests of detained persons are protected. The commission will appoint a number of mental health tribunals, composed of consultant psychiatrists, lawyers and others, to carry out independent reviews of detention. It will also operate a scheme of legal aid for all detained patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act also provides for the registration by the commission of all hospitals and other centres where in-patient psychiatric care and treatment is provided. The commission will employ the inspector of mental health services and a number of assistant inspectors, who will inspect all approved centres once a year. The commission will be responsible, through the inspector, for ensuring regulations regarding standards and good practice are adhered to and for taking legal <Col N="803" /> action against service providers who do not comply with regulations. The inspector's annual report and review of mental health services will be published with the commission's annual report.</P>
    <P>The first priority under the Act is the establishment of the Mental Health Commission. Various representative organisations will be contacted shortly with a view to seeking their nominations for membership of the commission. The Minister expects to be in a position to formally appoint the members of the commission within the next few months. The commission will then be required to recruit a chief executive and administrative staff to assist it in carrying out its functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act is designed so that different commencement orders can be made for different parts of it. The practical effect of this is that the commission will not be required to take on all its functions immediately on its establishment as it will take some time to put in place the necessary administrative and other structures which will be required to carry out those functions.</P>
    <P>The first priority for the Mental Health Commission, once appointed, will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of the new mental health tribunals. The commission will need to ensure that all patients currently detained in psychiatric hospitals will have their cases reviewed by the new tribunals within six months of the commencement of Part II, as required by section 72 of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, with approximately 2,400 involuntary admissions per annum, there will be <Col N="804" /> an estimated 2,000 cases per annum to be reviewed by the tribunals and 100 cases appealed to the Circuit Court. In 2000, a total of 2,450 patients were involuntarily admitted to psychiatric hospitals. However, the rate of involuntary admission is in decline and it is anticipated that once the Mental Health Act is implemented, the number of involuntary admissions will decline further.</P>
    <P>Once the system of review has been successfully established and bedded down, the commission will be expected to put in place the registration of approved centres, as provided for in Part V of the Act. Section 72 of the Act provides for the temporary registration of existing centres for three years to allow the commission time to establish the new system.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Mental Health Commission, as proposed in this Act, in conjunction with the enhanced inspectorate, will enable us to develop in the years ahead a mental health service which is in keeping with the needs and requirements of a modern society.</P>
