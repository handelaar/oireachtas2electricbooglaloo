      <P>I have received notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the reasons for the reduction in Garda personnel at Newport Garda station, County Mayo and the reason the sergeant who retired some years ago has not been replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason the Minister's list of chiropodists has been closed with the result that GMS patients, some with serious systemic conditions, have problems getting treatment.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the operation of community policing, which is causing serious concern in rural areas due to the low number of Garda personnel available.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason for the delay in a heroin addict (details supplied) being received into a detoxification treatment programme at the Mews Clinic, North Circular Road, Dublin, and the reason waiting lists for treatment of addicts are growing.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. The matters raised by Senators Chambers, Henry and O'Meara will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 2, motion re Information to Voters, to be taken without debate as it was debated in conjunction with Second Stage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001; No. 3, Family Support Agency Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 4, Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time, with Committee and Remaining Stages of this Bill to be taken at the conclusion of No. 5; and No. 5, Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The vote on today's Order of Business took place yesterday and the House has agreed to it, therefore I, as a good democrat, will not make any objection to it. I note that the Seanad speeches of W.B. Yeats have just been published. We should have a debate on that in <Col N="1628" /> the next session as he was one of our most distinguished Senators and his speeches still read very well. As a Member elected to the cultural and education panel, I feel that such a debate would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary to take No. 4 today? Yesterday we said that the business tabled could not be concluded and that was proven to be the case. I ask the Leader to indicate why it is necessary to take the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill, 2001. It puts additional pressure on business and takes the symmetry away from the day. Unless it is absolutely necessary, the Bill should not be taken today. The business will be impossible to conduct because of Ministers' commitments and we will have the same difficulty as we had last night with them waiting for their Cabinet colleagues to finish. It gives a very bad impression of the way business is ordered in this House. I do not have any objection to the Bill being taken, but only if it must be.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked for a debate on Northern Ireland and in the middle of the afternoon the report on the Omagh bombing by the Northern Ireland police ombudsman came out. That is another reason for us to address this issue. We, as elected parliamentarians, have a duty to instil in people a confidence in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. If we lack conviction ourselves, as we certainly do after the killing of Mr. Stobie and the publication of the report, we must address the issues here in order to satisfy ourselves that we can have confidence and trust in the system. We should and can have that. We should debate this in a non-partisan way as everybody in the House surely has the same sense of duty and loyalty to the country, North and South. We need to ensure that we know the answers to questions about the police service and that we can tell people what is involved. If people are at fault we should single them out from the rest of the police. We also need to call for an independent inquiry on the Pat Finucane case. Many issues are building up in that regard and I ask the Leader to prioritise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed the Order of Business yesterday and put it to a vote on the basis that far too many items were on the agenda. We could not possibly deal with them in a decent period of time. It is unfair to Senators and staff that we should sit until almost 4 a.m. Many people left the building bleary-eyed and are here again today. The Leader of the House should have taken that into consideration and ordered business so that we would not have a heavy day again today. I am quite unhappy with the number of items on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I too express my concern and request a debate arising from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman's report on the Omagh bombings. It raises very serious questions about investigative procedures, and police co-operation and communication. I link the report to the case of the <Col N="1629" /> Dublin and Monaghan bombings which has been going on for 27 years without a proper inquiry having been established and about which the same questions were raised regarding police co-operation. The trail in that instance ran cold once it reached the Border. These are the two single greatest tragedies in terms of numbers killed that have taken place in the context of the Northern Ireland conflict over the last 30 years. There must be a full-scale investigation into those cases. It is an absolute disgrace that the families and relatives of those who died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings are still no closer to getting any answers. It is time we addressed that in this House and brought it to the attention of the powers that be, including the relevant Minister. We want action on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As we head towards a new session, will the Leader begin the new year with a statement that this House fully supports family-friendly policies? I ask him to have a debate on that in the first week of the new session to give us the opportunity to talk about how men and women can manage to strike a balance between looking after their families and working. We could also look at the things happening in our society that are affecting children and discuss advertising aimed at children, a subject on which I requested a debate a number of weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was alarmed this morning by a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> which stated that girls were being excluded from what are considered to be traditionally male subjects, such as woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing and construction studies. Senator Quill requested a debate on the number of schools in which students were not taking science subjects. This is an added dimension to such a debate. As a teacher I realise that there is a time-tabling issue involved, but it is time, as schedules are constructed for the next school year, to debate whether or not girls are getting equal access to the traditionally male subjects. We should debate whether there is equality at second level and, in the case of science, at third level. I hope such a debate will be taken in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning noted the publication of the speeches of W.B. Yeats and we can certainly allow time for statements on that in the new year. The reason I have included No. 4 on the Order of Business today is to allow for amendments. If the House wants to take all Stages when the Bill comes before it, I will have no objection. Senators O'Toole and Costello called for a debate on Northern Ireland and I will endeavour to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs attend this House before the Christmas recess to discuss the police ombudsman's report. We owe it to those who lost their lives and to their nearest and dearest to find out what happened. I will include such a debate on the Order Paper in the coming days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" />Senator Cox called for a debate on advertising standards and especially advertisements geared at children. It is a very good proposal and I will include it for debate after the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on education, especially the lack of student interest in science. I can also include this for debate after the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim leasú a <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>I leathanach 6, idir línte 6 agus 7, an méid seo a leanas a chur isteach:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4º Chun críocha an airteagail seo ciallaíonn &lsquo;gan breith' beatha gan breith tar éis ionphlandú i mbroinn mná.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 6 and 7 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4º For the purposes of this article &lsquo;unborn' means unborn life after implantation in the womb of a woman.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This arises from our discussion yesterday and the concerns expressed by me and others, including Senator Henry who probably expressed her concerns with more coherence, that once this amendment to the Constitution is passed, the impact of the Bill will be such that the morning-after pill and IUD, among other things, which it is believed prevent the implantation of a fertilised ovum in a woman's womb, will still be under threat from Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is perfectly right in a free society, there has been an ongoing campaign in this country concerning the rights of the unborn and it has focused entirely on the idea of a constitutional amendment to protect those rights. That had many tentacles and expressions, one of which was <Col N="1631" /> a vigorous campaign against forms of contraception regarded as abortifacients. I accept that, under the definition of abortion contained in this proposal, they could not be classified as such, but they most assuredly could be regarded as a threat to unborn life if one accepts the principle that unborn life begins at the moment of conception and not at the moment of implantation.</P>
    <P>We do not want to become involved in too many technical discussions, but our concern is that if we do not make the definition of the unborn coterminous with the definition of the period in which unborn life is protected, it is an invitation to someone to raise the possibility of Article 40.3.3º being used to prohibit the sale and distribution of what are regarded as methods of contraception. While it is not something I have seen done, a well organised political campaign is attempting to deal with the issue. If the campaign is satisfied with the amendment as far as implantation onwards is concerned, it will turn to the issue of what we regard as methods of contraception.</P>
    <P>The bishops said yesterday in their statement that unborn life from the moment of implantation would be further protected by this amendment and unborn life, prior to implantation, would continue to be protected by the existing amendment. This is how their lordships found a way to support the legislation. If the bishops are correct &ndash; the issue does not arise here but I presume they have good legal advice &ndash; and unborn life before implantation is protected by Article 40.3.3º, then any medical procedure, medicine and so on which puts unborn life between the moment of conception and implantation at risk is effectively prohibited by Article 40.3.3º. If our intention is to say that is not the case, that these items are contraceptives and will remain legal, then the correct view is to define unborn life as protected in the Constitution from the moment of implantation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Ryan's concerns are similar to mine. I dealt last night with my concerns that many people think this legislation will ensure the morning-after pill and the post coital IUD are legal. At one stage I thought this was the message from the Minister and that the legislation would help in this regard. However, he was clear last night that this is not the case. I can see why it does not make the legality of the morning-after pill or the post coital intra-uterine device more certain. Neither of them, as both he and I interpret their action, work as abortifacients; they work through preventing implantation. The Minister clearly specified that an abortion can only take place following implantation. I am pleased people have come round to my point of view because I said in 1983 that it was impractical to try to protect the fertilised egg. I went through that argument yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given what was said initially, I thought the legislation helped in regard to the legal status of <Col N="1632" /> the post coital IUD and morning-after pill. I also thought it made the situation regarding <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation better. My theologian, who thanks me for my continued interest in this topic, does not share all my views. She wrote me an interesting letter saying she believes that in this life we should bring in legislation so there is no creation of &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; embryos beyond the one that will be implanted. This would have very serious implications for the practice of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation in this country. We usually implant three zygotes or fertilised eggs because the results are better. There is also the freezing of zygotes.</P>
    <P>She goes on to say that it should also ensure no freezing of early embryos, as happened in Ireland for some years despite the guidelines of the Medical Council. Freezing at the &ldquo;pronuclear&rdquo; stage, before syngamy at around hour 18 of fertilisation, does not have the ethical problems of embryo freezing and provides an alternative to two problems. The risks of superovulation and egg harvesting incurred by the potential mother should be reduced as far as possible as should the high risk of causing multiple births by replacing three embryos. I query what she says about the replacement of three embryos because, while one sometimes gets triplets, more often one or two of the embryos are implanted, which is usually a better way to proceed. Senator Ryan is concerned that some people are looking at the legislation with a view to obstructing common practices in this country.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say that children have a protectable right to conditions which do not obstruct the formation of their identity. Having identifiable parents belongs to these conditions. It goes on to talk about law suits which have been taken in various jurisdictions by children conceived by anonymous gamete donation. We know that sperm donation has been practised in this country for many years. While the hospital with which I am involved, the Rotunda, does not practise egg donation, there is a possibility that other clinics may practise it. There are practices in this country which a large number of people may prefer to have discontinued. Does the Minister believe the legislation will make the practice of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation more or less likely to be challenged?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back again to what took up most of the day yesterday, that is, the harmonious reading of Articles 43.3.3º and 43.3.4º. According to the Minister, this is how the amendment should be read. However, even following what the bishops said, we are again debating Articles 43.3.3º and 43.3.4º. I am as confused today as I was yesterday when we sought clarification from the Minister on the interpretation of both Articles. I await clarification from him in light of what Senator Ryan and Senator Henry said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan's amendment is eminently useful in that it defines what we mean <Col N="1633" /> by the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; in the context of the legislation. The Minister told us how everything is to be taken in the context of the Constitution and the constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>The statement yesterday from the bishops raises some questions. It seems from what the Minister is suggesting that unborn human life begins after implantation in the womb. While that seems to be the intention of the section, there is no clarity in the absence of a definition. However, the bishops made it clear that they do not consider it to be unborn human life after implantation, but prior to implantation. Why has the Minister refused to accept an amendment which will clarify the position in relation to the application of the legislation? It is essential to give a definition of what unborn human life means. The Minister has shied away from doing so and this will cause enormous legal difficulties and challenges. It would be a simple matter to provide such clarification at this stage. Therefore, I urge him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed these issues yesterday and in the other House. The amendment tabled by Senators Ryan and Costello would mean inserting an Article in the Constitution, a definition, and that itself would be an unusual step. The wording of Article 40.3.4º, as already set out in the First Schedule, stipulates that it is life in the womb which is being protected and the detail of how this protection will be effected is contained in the envisaged legislation which appears in the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>We have already stated that Article 40.3.3º and the new Article 40.3.4º would have to be read together &ndash; the doctrine of harmonious interpretation. That is not mine, I did not invent it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the ongoing practice of the Supreme Court and that is the manner of the methodology by which it interprets the Constitution. It does not look at Articles separately. The impact of Senator Ryan's amendment would be for the purposes of the entire Article 40.3.3º. I am not sure if that is the intention. Is the amendment intended to justify the unborn for the purposes of subsection Article 40.3.4º or for the entire Article 40.3.3º?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the purposes of Article 40. There is only one reference to the unborn in Article 40 so it makes it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to cover the entire Article. We came at it from the perspective of bringing in a criminal law covering abortion. In our view or in any practical analysis of this, it would not be achievable or practicable in law to bring in a criminal statute to prohibit abortion prior to implantation because of the obvious difficulty of determining when human life or conception begins. Who is to know or how could we intervene or prosecute? There is no practicable application of a law against abortion during that period of three to ten <Col N="1634" /> days. It makes no sense to suggest we could bring in a criminal law to prohibit abortion up to implantation and that is what informed the use of the term implantation in terms of criminal law.</P>
      <P>We set out not to define the unborn in that sense but to define abortion for the purpose of the Act. That is the purpose. We did not set out to redefine Article 40.3.3º and we are not putting that proposal before the House.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt? I apologise. Senator Henry made a point which was discussed last night and our advice is that the manner in which we approach this makes the situation more certain in relation to the morning-after pill and the IUD. I made that point last night. I also pointed out that nobody in the House can say that any legislation or constitutional amendment we pass here is not subsequently subject to interpretation. Someone can bring a challenge at any time. That is life. If citizens want to challenge anything they are free to do so. Given the doctrine of harmonious interpretation, particularly if we read Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º together, our advice is that the situation now is far more certain than it was prior to this legislation being brought forward.</P>
      <P>I answered the question on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation last night. This Bill does not deal with the evolving area of embryo research, the freezing of embryos, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation etc. I pointed out that the commission on assisted human reproduction is the vehicle to resolve the many complex issues surrounding that area. We never said this Bill would deal with that area.</P>
      <P>In any proposal such as this we are concerned with balance. We are trying to achieve support from the majority of the middle ground on this. We knew from day one that in trying to achieve balance in these legislative referendum proposals we would never achieve unanimity or acceptance by all sides. We anticipated that people would have difficulties and those difficulties have manifested themselves in communications and letters on the issue of definition of unborn and so on. On the pro-choice side there is dissatisfaction on the suicide issue and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under no illusion but that there would be concerns around the full range of issues. It is our judgment and we are satisfied that we have put forward a practical set of proposals that adds to <Col N="1635" /> the protection of the life of the mother, particularly in terms of medical procedure and constitutional backing to that, and that also brings greater certainty to the situation than has existed since 1992. I accept that people have different perspectives but that is our call.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Apropos</i> something the Minister just said, I saw a lorry going up Kildare Street this morning carrying portraits of the Minister and the Taoiseach. It was quite revolting and is entirely wrong. I do not believe any Member of the Oireachtas would support it. I want it known that I believe it is wrong and unfair.</P>
      <P>I do not believe and never have believed in a woman's right to choose as it is interpreted by most of the lobby. My objections date back to 1983. The complexities of the issue make it impossible to deal with through constitutional law. The Minister said that it would be unusual to put a definition into the Constitution and that is precisely the reason it should not be in it. It should not be there because the question of who or what constitutes the unborn is vague and undefinable. I remember Deputy Spring was almost guillotined by one part of the anti-abortion lobby because he used the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; rather than he or she. He had to withdraw it and apologise but perhaps we have moved on since then.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to define in this amendment when life begins but simply trying to clarify what the Constitution means when it speaks of unborn life. It is not a question of a universal definition but just for the purposes of this Article. I accept that other people have different views but if we are to spring to the barricades to defend something we should at least know what it is we are defending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the Government proposal is a proposal <Col N="1636" /> to prohibit abortion as defined. Whether I agree or not, that is an issue. It is not the total of what the State says it proposes to do to defend the life of the unborn but is an important part of it. As the Minister said, it is a call the Government has made. We can disagree and respect each other's positions but it is not the sum total of the defence of the unborn. I believe the Government responded incorrectly to a lobby group before the last election and I am certain that the same lobby group will now move on to other issues and will use constitutional and other devices to try to have things prohibited that they believe conscientiously pose a threat to the life of the unborn, as they understand the term to mean.</P>
    <P>All I suggest is that we clarify that the practicalities of constitutional law are that the best we can do under the Constitution is protect unborn life from the moment of implantation in a woman's womb. That is what this is all about. It is quite limited. It is not meant to enter into profound philosophical debates about when life begins. It is simply an attempt to make sure that the Constitution means something.</P>
    <P>I was here in 1983 when varying interpretations were put on what Article 40.3.3.º meant across a spectrum of opinion ranging from extremely conservative to extremely liberal, whatever those words mean. None of them forecast the interpretation that the Supreme Court put on it. Nobody mentioned it. Nobody thought in that way. We have to be extremely careful with the Constitution. The matter will be out of our hands once the people decide on the issue. The Supreme Court will have to deal with the result. This amendment seeks to crystallise precisely what form of life we are defending.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 12, to delete &ldquo;at an approved place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister on this amendment, which he said he would examine overnight. I went into great detail on this amendment yesterday in terms of my concern, particularly regarding haemorrhage. This is such a common emergency that I felt an amendment was necessary. I also pointed out to the Minister the near-miss maternal mortality studies carried out in the Coombe Women's Hospital which indicated that there was a near-miss case in three out of five emergencies regarding the death of the mother and that all these cases required over five units of blood. That is a lot of blood. Ectopic pregnancies were not included in this data, nor were early pregnancies, and not all these emergencies had taken place within the confines of the hospital. Indeed, there was no predictability in the majority of the cases. These women did not have any major obstetric or medical problems. These bleeds occurred totally out of the blue so they were what one would describe as a definite emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no clear definition of &ldquo;an approved place&rdquo;. The Taoiseach gave us one definition and the Minister has given us a more expanded definition, but I am concerned about the life-threatening situation that can occur with haemorrhage in the most unexpected of places. I am not asking the Minister to open up approved places throughout the country because I do not believe he can do that. One wants to have the patient in the place of optimum care, but with the best will in the world one may not get the person to the place of optimum care and I would not like to think that any medical practitioner would feel constrained from acting because he or she was not in an approved place. Interestingly, a Fianna Fáil backbencher in the Dáil told me that a doctor would always act in these cases. However, one has to consider the level of medical litigation. I pay more than £1,200 for Good Samaritan insurance. Even if one goes to help someone on the side of the road, one is at risk of being sued. It is appalling but that is the position nowadays. It is because of such scenarios that members of the medical profession who may become involved <Col N="1637" /><Col N="1638" /> in an emergency which does not happen near an approved place should be trusted. I have confidence in these doctors. If they have not carried out illegal procedures in the past, why would they start now? Why would they do something illegal in future if they have not done so in the past? I have not heard anybody accusing a member of the medical profession of doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Henry outlined the medical problems involved. The location of approved places was also debated at length last night. A woman whose life is at risk could have difficulty getting to an approved place and that has not been given consideration. There is a difference in what the Taoiseach stated in his reply to Deputy Noonan. He referred specifically to hospitals and responsible management possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology. They are not located in the four corners of the State. The Taoiseach's response is limited. I hope the Minister will give a more specific assessment of the amendment in light of Senator Henry's contribution last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Senator Fitzpatrick said the best case scenario for pregnant women to receive treatment is that they would go to where there is the optimum level of services. I did so when I had my children and that is what we would like to happen. If a procedure must be embarked on because a woman's life is in danger and an approved place is not nearby, what will happen to the woman? Even in Dublin, because of traffic congestion, it can take considerable time to travel from Killiney to Holles Street Hospital. It is more likely that where the services described in the Taoiseach's reply are not available, a woman may have to travel 80 or 90 miles to an approved place, thereby putting her life under greater threat. This is a serious issue. We want women looked after in approved places that have the best facilities but we are very anxious that in an emergency a procedure can be undertaken by a suitably qualified medical practitioner to save the life of a woman or a child, who is a woman under 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a difficulty. He could define such a large number of approved places by order that the notion of identifying them would be meaningless or he could adopt such a restrictive definition that the issues raised by Senators Keogh, Jackman and Henry would become concerns. He could extend the definition so far that the notion of regulating an approved place would become meaningless or he could restrict it so much that it would become an issue. I do not know how he will ensure women's lives will not be put at risk unnecessarily unless he introduces such a broad range of approved places by order that will make the idea of approving the places meaningless. That is why I support the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated he would examine the issue overnight and he appeared to be amenable to the points raised. I hope the procedure involved in sending the Bill back to the Dáil is not an impediment to him giving these amendments due consideration. A strong case was made last night. The Minister indicated he would more than likely define approved places as &ldquo;current maternity hospitals&rdquo;. Senator Henry provided definitive detail from a survey carried out by the Coombe Hospital. Of a total of 50 women surveyed, 31 suffered haemorrhaging. She also pointed out that five units of blood were administered to each woman.</P>
      <P>If the Minister proceeds to define &ldquo;approved places&rdquo; as maternity hospitals only, serious difficulties could be created in rural Ireland. Last night I suggested to him that by doing so he could diminish the right to life of the mother and discriminate against women living in rural areas who are not close to maternity services. I instanced women from Loop Head or Black Head in County Clare who have to travel 70 or 90 miles to maternity hospitals in Galway and Limerick respectively. I would hate to think that because we, as legislators, provided for approved places, a woman's life could be lost because of the distance she has to travel to an approved place. It is not in the interests of women that this definition should remain in the legislation. I ask the Minister, if he has not drafted a better definition, to delete it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We rehearsed the arguments in depth last night. However, &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo; is a staple phrase in most legislation. There is always a get-out in terms of how something should happen. The optimum scenario is that a medical practitioner would engage in the medical procedure at an approved place. That will not be possible in all cases and Senator Henry has outlined a considerable number of detailed examples of how such medical procedures may have to take place in circumstances other than in the optimum scenario.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not making provision for such procedures other than in approved places. There can only be a limited number of places on cost grounds alone. These medical procedures cannot be carried out in various hospitals because the expertise is not available. There can only be a limited number of places. Why can the Minister not accept Senator Henry's amendment, which proposes to delete the reference to approved places and, therefore, leave open the option of the procedure taking place elsewhere or accept the Labour Party's amendment which would provide for the procedure to be carried out in any other place in emergencies? It will not dilute the legislation, but will help ensure that people's lives are saved.</P>

      <P>I indicated last evening, without making promises, that I would reflect on this overnight, which I did as well as again consulting <Col N="1640" /> on it. I also made it clear that prior to publishing the legislation, I examined this issue and sought the advice of the masters of the three main maternity hospitals. They were emphatic that there would be no such emergencies. They said that these rare life-threatening conditions only occur three or four times a year and that no immediate decisions are ever taken. The decisions are taken overnight after consulting with colleagues with particular expertise, assessing the woman's condition at the time, monitoring and evaluating, and agreeing on an approach with the aim of taking it as far as one can before intervention. That is taking into account pre-eclampsia, Eisenmenger's syndrome, cancer of the womb and so forth. This issue was also considered in detail by the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Henry's point about haemorrhaging, my advice, from experts who deal with this on a daily basis, was that this has been part of routine pregnancy management from time immemorial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another strong point that all speakers have overlooked and which I invite Senator Henry to reflect on, as she said that she did not want it happening everywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator cannot then propose an amendment to delete approved places, which will leave nothing. It makes no sense. People are being paradoxical. Senator Costello, for example, says that we know that there is not expertise everywhere. It is not on Loop Head and will not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be in many rural places. The safety of both the mother and child is crucial. To have a <i>carte blanche</i> with no specific provisions would jeopardise their safety. It is as much about women's safety as anything else. This has been consistently put in the medical advice I received. There are strong arguments in favour of an approved centre with the necessary expertise, <Col N="1641" /> facilities and multi-disciplinary teams to make the correct interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about emergencies in which there is no time to get to an approved place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relaying the medical advice on emergencies to the House and I am convinced by it. However, we are also talking about trust. There have been difficulties in the past. The Irish Medical Council has dealt with individual practitioners, most recently with one who came here from abroad. It is always a possibility that a practitioner from abroad would not or could not subscribe to our code of practice. If this amendment were included it would leave a loophole for someone to carry out the procedure in his or her own clinic, in effect to do what he or she wishes because of the defence clause that it is an emergency. It is no use Senators saying that it could not happen. If we took out approved places, we could be opening the door to illegal abortions being carried out without proper care in place for women's safety.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the mother is not endangered by the insertion of approved places. Senator Henry conceded yesterday that the issue of legal action against a practitioner was not her major concern. I pointed out that in the Bill, given that the person would have the defence of necessity and the presumption of intentional destruction and of rebuttal would have to be present, the DPP would decide on whether to take a case. That was acceptable yesterday. I am not disposed to accept these amendments because there are significant dangers in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister, given the length of time that I am in practice, I would not propose anything which I thought would put women's lives in danger. I am sure he is not suggesting that, but I would resent any such suggestion. All my professional life, I have worked for women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the Senator was doing that. I merely said that it could be one consequence of the amendment. I hope that she would also accept that I would not do anything to endanger a woman's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that. However, there is more concern about a person entering the country and performing illegal abortions than there is about the case I am presenting. I said that my main concern was not about legal action being taken against the doctor because more legal actions are taken against doctors here than in any other country. This is no surprise as we have a higher level of every kind of litigation.</P>
      <P>The problem with spontaneous abortion is where another party objects to the termination of the pregnancy when the foetal heart is still there. I have seen this once and that was enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" />The last inquest we had into a maternal mortality found that death was due to bleeding. Bleeding should not be underestimated. There was another inquest recently into the death of a 12 year old child in Wicklow who was stabbed by a nine year old. The child was taken to the doctor who simply sutured the wound because it was small and had been inflicted by a child, for which I do not criticise the doctor. However, the child soon collapsed because of internal bleeding and was dead before he could be taken to hospital. This is what I mean when I refer to medical emergencies involving bleeding. I am not saying that the child's death has something to do with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am trying to highlight the rapid deterioration in patients who are bleeding and the reason they should be brought to the first possible place, even though ideally they should be brought to the best possible facility. I am sure the Minister did not mean to insinuate that I had no care for women's lives. It is because of my concern for women's lives and that in just one case sometime in the future I will be asked to do my very best to ensure the woman concerned is treated that I tabled the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered about the grouping of amendments in this House. If on Report Stage that were to involve proposers of amendments not being able to reply, the simple expedient would be to refuse to agree to grouping. As that would be even more unhelpful, perhaps we have the lesser of two evils.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is unhappy with the idea of eliminating an approved place, our amendment is a safe compromise. It recognises that there may be emergencies. As Senator Henry said, where a practitioner believes that the welfare of his or her patient so requires, she should be treated other than in an approved place. I cannot see what the problem with this would be. I do not often quote the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, but I listen to advice, as I am sure the Minister does. I must listen to advice on these matters in the context of my experience.</P>
      <P>I have seen quite extraordinary statements being made by former masters of maternity hospitals which are at variance because of the language used and they way in which they define words. I have heard an emeritus professor say that a woman has never had a medical condition which necessitated an abortion. That is a fine statement to make except that it means a whole series of things in terms of definitions of words quite different from what we are talking about here. Experts give advice from the point of view of their experience, not from the point of view of law. The real difficulty lies in translating what the medical professionals say into law without changing its meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" />To have it rigidly defined as a certain number of approved places is making something excessively rigid and not dealing with the possibility of an emergency. Our amendment is quite conservative and suggests that in an emergency a medical practitioner ought to be able to carry out such procedures if he or she deems it necessary in order to save the patient's life. I cannot see what could possibly be objectionable about this.</P>

      <P>I explained this matter in great detail last night. I tabled the amendment because a female person over 18 has a totally different legal standing from a female person under 18.

      <P>We dealt with this issue at length on Committee Stage yesterday evening. My view is still the same, namely, that in essence there is no difference between Senator Henry's definition and the definition in the Bill. The definition in the Bill is that a woman means a female person. Senator Henry's definition is that a woman means a female person over 18 years of age and a female child under 18 years of age. The definitions are no different because they both encompass females of all ages. It adds nothing to the definition. It created a debate which, as Senator Norris articulated yesterday evening, is good. There was no attempt to camouflage, as I said yesterday evening. It deals with minors and those of all ages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <P>At least it achieved debate and recognition that it deals with a broad spectrum of female persons. It would have been worthwhile to have included it. The Minister said he sees no difference, but there is a difference under the law between the two groups of people. Most of the legislation we pass in the House is different for minors and adults.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3<i>b: </i>In page 8, between lines 26 and 27, to insert &ldquo;&lsquo;womb' means the uterus of a woman excluding the fallopian tubes.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was moved to table the amendment. It is always interesting and important to look at the terms chosen to be defined in legislation. It struck me as strange that we have a definition of a woman in legislation but not a definition of a womb. I tabled my amendment because one of the major procedures, which involves the deliberate and direct destruction of an embryo or an unborn human life, is in the case of a woman whose life is threatened by an ectopic pregnancy. My understanding is that there are perhaps 1,000 such procedures carried out in any one year around the country. That is a large number of terminations of pregnancy. It should be clear that those pregnancies and terminations are done of necessity to save the woman's life and do not involve anything other than the removal of the embryo from a woman's fallopian tubes. That caused considerable difficulty for many pro-life people. Modern procedures and techniques mean that damage is <Col N="1646" /> not caused to a woman's fallopian tubes and she can have children in the future, which was not the case in the past.</P>
    <P>It is an area of considerable concern and, therefore, it seems sensible to introduce a definition which excludes the possibility of ectopic pregnancies having the protection of the phraseology for abortion. I understand and fully accept there is an argument that the language is clear-cut. However, it would be more simple to ensure that an ectopic pregnancy is not regarded as unborn human life after implantation in the womb. Senator Henry informed me that if most medical students were asked to describe the womb, they would be expected to include the fallopian tubes. I see eminent people sitting behind the Minister dissenting, but there is an eminent person behind me who told me the opposite. As the Minister said, politicians make the call. If there is a number of different views among medical practitioners about what we mean by a word, the best thing is to include a definition which makes clear what we mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. An ectopic pregnancy is a serious issue. I said most medical students would be expected to describe the fallopian tubes if asked to explain the womb. I remember the lecture we had on this topic and the lecturer was wearing his gown. He put his arms out and told us to look at his body as the body of the womb, his arms as the fallopian tubes and the folds of cloth in between as the round ligament. One can be well taught a long time ago and remember the definitions. That is why I said I thought it would be wise to include it. Ectopic pregnancy is a serious common issue. Unfortunately, the recent report on the confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom states that eight deaths were due to ectopic pregnancies. It points out that there were 15 such cases in the previous report. It is a common cause of maternal mortality. Senator Ryan's attempt to get clarification is important.</P>
      <P>Would there be a problem with the use of methotrexate to deal with ectopic pregnancies? We do not know how it works, but would it be described as working like a medical abortifacient or would it be allowed? It seems to be a useful way to deal with ectopic pregnancies without surgery if the ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed early, which is possible now with scanning techniques. I want to be sure that such a method, which is successful and least invasive, would not be challenged by the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought advice early this morning when the issue emerged at the penultimate stage of the debate on the definition of the womb. The fallopian tubes are outside the womb and have always been described as separate anatomical entities in all obstetric textbooks. There is clearly no difficulty dealing with ectopic pregnancies after this legislation is passed because the section specifically refers to the &ldquo;intentional destruction <Col N="1647" /> by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a concern regarding amendment No. 5. What would happen if a doctor was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses and he refused to give a blood transfusion? In other jurisdictions people have to give prior notice that they are conscientious objectors and cannot be refused employment on that basis. Notice must be given because hospitals have to be run on the basis that patients will be treated. A scenario could not be allowed to develop where everyone suddenly announced that they were conscientious objectors. If a person is treating obstetric patients they should be obliged to make it clear to their patients that they are conscientious objectors and will not become involved in life-saving procedures. We only ask them to treat mothers whose lives are at risk. The Minister said that this matter will go before the Medical Council, but I do not want a hiatus between the enactment of this legislation and the next time the Medical Council's guidelines are published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point. We do not want to incorporate all the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council in the Bill because ethics change over time. The ethical guidelines of the Medical Council are not statutory and it is not legally sound to attempt to link them to a criminal statute in the way suggested by the amend<Col N="1648" /> ments. I accept the bona fides of those tabling the amendments, but they would, in essence, give the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council the automatic protection of the law despite the fact that those guidelines can change. The last guidelines were published in 1998 and a new text is on the way. Given that they change over time, a permanent construction on them through a constitutional amendment Bill should not be sought. Under the ethical guidelines a conscientious objector is obliged to ensure continuity of care for the patient and to pass the patient on to a team that is willing to treat him or her. That has been long-standing medical practice. The concept of conscientious objection has existed since time immemorial and it is a cherished one irrespective of what side of the argument people are on. People do not want to change it overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>One is supposed to refer patients, but I pointed to a case last night where a woman doctor in the west of Dublin refused to refer patients, although the cases were not life threatening. The Medical Council's guidelines do not cover hospitals and I want the Minister to ensure that hospitals are not completely staffed by conscientious objectors. What would happen if everyone decided to be a conscientious objector? Does the hospital not have an obligation to the patients to ensure there will be people there who will carry out life-saving procedures? The Minister is in charge of that area, not the Medical Council. A gap has been left here.</P>
      <P>When one is taking up employment in England in hospitals where therapeutic abortions are performed, one can be asked if one will perform such procedures, but one cannot be discriminated against in applying for a job there because one will not undertake such procedures. However, such hospitals must ensure they have people who will carry out therapeutic abortions. I want hospitals here to ensure they have people who will provide life-saving treatment to women because there is nothing that says hospitals must have retain such people.</P>

    <P>We did not debate this on Committee Stage. It is very loose to state that &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;an order' means an order made by a member of the Government authorised in that behalf by the Government.&rdquo;  We do not know if the referendum will take place two months after the Bill has passed in February. Perhaps it will, but it may not. If there is a change of Government within the 180 days allowed, I will not be happy and Fine Gael Party members will not be happy if the member of the Government referred to is an Independent or a Member who does not share the views we have debated here. I would like the definition to be tightened up by requiring that the order be made by the Taoiseach.

      <P>I am perplexed by this amendment and I do not see any need for it. The Senator is saying that the Taoiseach should sign the orders rather than the Minister. Surely it is up to the Minister responsible for the specific area and that is currently the Minister for Health and Children. The reason we do not refer to the Minister for Health and Children is that the title of that Minister might change. The Minister for Health and Children has to be authorised by the Government to make the regulations that go before the Oireachtas. The regulations then have to affirmed by the Oireachtas. This amendment may have been tabled prior to Committee Stage in the Dáil as people may not have realised that I intended to bring forward an amendment requiring positive affirmation of the orders by both Houses.

As the Minister stated last night, it is unprecedented outside the Good Friday Agreement. It is the kernel of our objection to the Bill. We could talk forever about it, but I said enough yesterday, as did other Members. This goes to the heart of the powers of the Oireachtas and the President. We still feel very strongly about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. It is essential it is included in the Bill because what is being proposed is unprecedented in terms of the legislative process. There are two Bills rolled into one in this procedure. The second one, included in the Second Schedule to the Bill under discussion, is separate and should stand alone. However, it is has been rolled in with the Bill under discussion to give it the type of protection a constitutional amendment would receive under the Constitution. The reality is that this legislation will be protected by the Constitution and, despite this, is not being afforded the normal process laid down in the Constitution for consideration of a Bill. The five Stages of the Bill have been debated here and in the other House, but it has been excluded from being referred to the President who, consequently, will not have the power to refer it to the Supreme Court. The amendment attempts to reintroduce the constitutional power of the President in this case. It is vital it remains.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested in the course of the debate yesterday that this was not unprecedented and cited the Good Friday Agreement as a previous example. The Agreement is not statute law and a declaration rather than a Bill. It is erroneous to use it as an example. In the interests of protecting the Constitution, preserving the powers of the President and protecting the Bill from constitutional challenge, something to which it is open on a number of fronts, we should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Bill in the Second Schedule is put to the people in a referendum and they pass it, it will form part of the Constitution. The people will then have decided, and for the President or the Supreme Court to interfere with that would be ludicrous. It is important this opt-out should remain because the people will have made a decision and, while a rejection of the constitutional amendment would mean the legislation would not form part of the Constitution, if it were accepted, for the Oireachtas to involve the President or the Supreme Court would show mistrust of the people's decision. It would be con<Col N="1653" /> trary to the meaning of a constitutional amendment. I understand the Senators' motivation, but this is a sensible and necessary provision to ensure the voice of the people is not eroded or diluted.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I made the point which I will not labour that there is no doubt the Bill has serious implications for the Constitution and threatens the withdrawal of certain fundamental rights. My legal advice is that it contravenes Article 26 of the Constitution, which deals with the President's right to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court to see if it is repugnant to the Constitution, and thereby undermines it. The President will not be allowed to refer the legislation to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. This negates one of the most important powers of the President as defined in the Constitution. If enacted, the legislation will not be susceptible to challenge in the courts which, again, denies a key democratic right enshrined in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This amendment does not deal with the debate we had last evening. It is separate from that about referral of legislation to the President. It deals with the certification and validation of ministerial orders. The amendment seeks to ensure ministerial orders keep faith with whatever decisions the people make. It is unnecessary and takes matters to a level which could potentially involve the President, the Council of State and the Supreme Court in vetting ministerial orders. The safeguard of a positive affirmation by the House is sufficient in terms of ministerial orders which would be made. Senator O'Donovan made the point that this is not a diminution of the President's powers. It is erroneous to suggest it is. The President's powers remain in terms of being the guardian of the Constitution once the Constitution has been decided upon by the people. If the people agree to the insertion of articles into the Constitution, they form part of it. The Supreme Court does not decide what goes into the Constitution and has never attempted to do so. Neither has the President.</P>

      <P>We debated this matter yesterday and are aware that it involves ministerial orders, but referral of the legislation to the President is still ruled out. I do not understand the reason that is being ruled out simply because ministerial orders are involved. We are aware they are. They form part of the most contentious aspects of the Bill, which Senator Henry highlighted, concerning approved places, the definition of &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and so on. There is no reason to believe any of these areas would not be problematic in future. I believe they will. It has never been done before that we would bypass the President. We are eroding her powers.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party and I oppose the proposal to pass the Bill, not because of any deeply felt liberal instincts I might have &ndash; I hope they would apply to more practical matters than this &ndash; but because this is the wrong way to deal with the issue. If even one of the points made on this side turns out as we envisaged as distinct from the advice the Minister received, the house of cards will collapse in a considerable mess. We must remember in the context of the Constitution that this measure will be out of our hands once the people make a decision and it will be interpreted by the Supreme Court. It will require just one interpretation by that court of one of the many issues with which we believe there are ambiguities, for us to be in a greater mess and with legislation we cannot amend other than by a further constitutional referendum.</P>
      <P>That is the reason it is my party's view &ndash; has been for some time and on which we are open to the accusation that we talked and did nothing &ndash; that there is no virtue in doing something if it makes the position worse. This proposal could end up doing this. I am not getting involved in political issues. This became a political issue because someone agreed to do something. It was a wrong decision. This legislation will not solve the problems but create them if any of our points are dealt with in a manner other than that which the Minister says they will be dealt with. It is not an issue appropriate to the Constitution. I will, therefore, vote against the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Bill is constitutionally flawed, it would be irresponsible of us, as legislators, to vote in favour or support it in any way. On all Stages we have made a strong case on the reasons it should not be presented in its current form. If passed, within 12 months it will be challenged on a number of fronts. Given that <Col N="1655" /> it is so flawed, it is astounding that any Attorney General or Cabinet would present it to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It attempts to do something in relation to legislation which is unprecedented since the establishment of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 20 of the Constitution is the only one which precludes the House from amending a money Bill. In regard to the reference of Bills to the Supreme Court, Article 26 applies to any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, other than a Money Bill, or a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution, or a Bill the time for the consideration of which by Seanad Éireann shall have been abridged under Article 24 of the Constitution. In relation to that article, the Bill is violating a fundamental principle. In violating that principle it is violating the anchor and cornerstone on which our democracy and the Legislature are founded.</P>

      <P>I am speaking on the Bill. This is unprecedented legislation. Never in the history of either House has something been done in this manner. Two Bills are rolled into one. The Second Schedule to the Bill should be stand-alone legislation for consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas when the amendment to the Constitution has been passed. The Minister has clearly indicated to the House that the only section of the Bill that will be put to the people is Article 6.1º of Part I of the First Schedule. We are now legislating for a referendum. This is the only section of the Bill that will be put on the ballot paper for consideration by the people and on which they will vote.

      <P>The following subsections shall be added to section 3 of the English text:</P>

      <P>We are on Fifth Stage and about to say whether we support the passage of the Bill. As a legislator, I want to be free to outline the reasons the Bill should not be passed. It is unprecedented. For political purposes, the Government is presenting a Bill to both Houses of the Oireachtas and contravening all the procedures, legislative and constitutional, that normally apply to legislation being put through the House. It is an affront to the Constitution and will be a source of embarrassment in the future. As legislators, we should not stand over this, and should be allowed to articulate our concerns on the issue. It has been argued repeatedly that it will be a matter for decision by the people. Amendments were introduced in an attempt to bring back into place the position of the President in relation to orders in relation to which, I understand, there were difficulties. The reality is that the Bill diminishes the powers of the President, usurps those of the Oireachtas and acts in an unprecedented and unconstitutional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn has more than adequately outlined the constitutional position to which I have referred already in debates during the past ten weeks. I concur with her that bringing forward a Bill that undermines the Constitution is not something of which any of us could be proud. I regret that it ever came before the House, particularly in its present from. I also regret that, following its passage, there will be the potential that women's rights will be reduced. I strongly regret the exclusion of a provision to deal with suicide as a threat to the life of a mother. It was useful that Senator Henry attempted to make a distinction between a child and a woman. By means of the Bill we are criminalising suicidal children. I regret that this has come to pass.</P>
      <P>This unnecessary Bill is not compassionate towards women in crisis pregnancies. It denigrates them. There is no consensus on it. If and when it is put to the people, it will be defeated, rightly so, because Irish women will not stand for their rights being abused in this way. I have long since had a commitment to women's rights and will not allow Irish women to be denigrated through the passage of the Bill which I will oppose tooth and nail. I am convinced that the people will see through what is a cynical, political exercise designed to placate the four Independents propping up a Government that I hope will be out of office as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for giving so much time and attention to the Bill in this House. We went through it as well as poss<Col N="1657" /> ible. From what I have said, the Minister will be aware I cannot possibly support the Bill and regret it is being put before the people to be inserted into the Constitution. Anything like this is not suitable for insertion into the Constitution. I have pointed out what I regard as errors and if I am right on even a small part of one error, we will have problems in the Supreme Court and there will be no method of redressing it except by another referendum.</P>
      <P>What the people will be shown and on which they will vote is limited. While it will be hard, I intend to explain the difficulties. The problem with the Bill lies in the detail in which there is danger for women and difficulties for doctors, neither of which will be further addressed before the referendum, but which will be addressed by the Supreme Court very rapidly if the amendment is passed. I certainly hope it is not.</P>

I am disappointed that, despite our staying almost all night in the House in a genuine effort to tease out issues and detail outside the constitutional aspect in relation to women and how they will be affected, not one amendment was accepted throughout Committee Stage here or in the other House &ndash; at least in this House.</P>

      <P>The amendments in the other House came through the Seanad. There was a second chance on the amendments for the Minister to comment &ndash; there was no time in the other House because of the guillotine aspect of Committee and Report Stages. It was not so much the guillotine but the fact that the Bill was not brought back to the floor of the House. I will not go through that but there was great annoyance over the shortness of time given to the debate in the other House.</P>
      <P>We have always seen ourselves in the Seanad as being reflective and as taking time with legislation. I thought the Minister would take the opportunity to make improvements. He listened but it was as if, no matter how he felt, the amendments were not to be accepted. I believe he felt moved by certain amendments proposed here and would have taken them &ndash; I am convinced that last night his body language showed that he was sympathetic to our suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is honestly how I saw it, yet here we are now at the end of the debate and we are taking this to the people. Who will explain the constitutionality aspect to the public? I do not know who will explain to women the human life issues debated here. At the end of the day it will come down to the issue of whether a person is <Col N="1658" /> pro-abortion or anti-abortion. We might as well have not debated it here and that is what saddens me. We could have made it worth our while to put genuine legislation before the people. It would have been legislation that would protect the rights of the mother and it would have looked at the issues that led to this legislation in the first place &ndash; the X and C cases. Those have now effectively been written out as if they never happened.</P>
      <P>We now have to try to explain this to the people who will vote on the matter in two months' time. There has not been a word throughout the debate as to how the people will know and learn about the issues. They will not have the time. I am sure we will be back again within a couple of years in relation to a constitutional referral.</P>
      <P>Another point is the balancing of the rights of the mother and child. I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn. I cannot understand the rolling of the two into one. That will be extremely confusing to people. They barely know what Article 40.3.3º is and now there is an Article 40.3.4º and they have to be read harmoniously. The language being used is not people friendly. It is a sad day for us that we spent so much time on the issue and it has come to nought.</P>

When it comes in front of the people they will choose to vote in favour of the referendum or against it. Voting in favour of the referendum is accepting the law that has passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, while voting against the referendum is not to accept the law and to leave the situation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope a balance will be brought into this debate given that it is concluding. Tensions appear to have erupted, which is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we have reached this stage. I sat on the committee that produced a 700 page document. There were differences of opinion from different shades of the political divide and we heard evidence from medical experts, psychiatric experts, etc. A charge was made that some of this work was rushed through, but that is not the case. A great deal of thought and time was devoted to it. A Cabinet sub-committee was set up and chaired by the Minister. I hope that when this issue is put to the people, there will be constraint in the remarks made by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Senators who contributed to the debates on all Stages of the Bill. Many of the points made by Senators Ryan, Henry and others <Col N="1663" /> were balanced and fair. We had exchanges, but there was no rancour.</P>

      <P>As spokesperson for Justice on this side of the House, and irrespective of who will be on the winning or losing sides, I caution that adjectives used in the heat of the moment should be more constrained.</P>
      <P>The issue will be put to the people. We have had a good and lengthy debate. The House sat last night until nearly 4 a.m. I compliment the Minister on dealing with the Bill in great detail. He was balanced in his approach. While listening to some of his remarks, I wondered if he was a medical doctor in addition to being the Minister for Health and Children. While I do not necessarily agree with the points made by Members, I respect them. I will forgive Senator Taylor-Quinn for calling me Senator Donovan rather than Senator O'Donovan. I respect the points Senators opposite made and I ask them to respect the view of Senators on this side of the House, particularly the views of a Senator who has given his life to the concept of having an abortion referendum. He has seen the fruits of his work and I respect that type of commitment. He has committed the last 25 years of his life to this campaign. Some people in this House and outside it may not agree with him, although I am very close to his views.</P>
      <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill and I compliment all those involved. I hope when the matter goes forward from here that the debate among politicians and the media, whether in the press or on radio and television, will be balanced and fair and that there will be no rancour in terms of the use of adjectives to condemn people personally. It is fine to condemn a party. I can condemn the Fine Gael Party or it can condemn the Fianna Fáil Party, but it would be regrettable if some Members were to condemn me for my personal views. I hope that will not occur as we face a debate that will not be Utopian. Even if this measure is passed, after it is put to the people in a referendum, I do not think we will be clapping ourselves on the back and saying &ldquo;well done&rdquo;. If it is rejected by the people, it should be acknowledged that we dealt with the issue by way of referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that we will not have another opportunity during my lifetime, irrespective of my political future, to put this issue to the people in a referendum, regardless of whether it is passed or rejected. This is a last ditch effort. One Senator mentioned that this Bill is a result of the Fianna Fáil-PD coalition Government responding to a demand from the four Independent Deputies. That is an unfair comment. When this document was being prepared, 110,000 sub<Col N="1664" /> missions were made. Evidence was given by a broad spectrum of people, ranging from medical experts to representatives of the various religions. It is unfair to pin the proposed referendum on a demand from the four Independent Deputies. This was a Government decision, over which the Taoiseach stood. We are delivering on a demand that has existed for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Most members of the all-party Oireachtas committee believed that the current position, whether one was on the left or took a more conservative view, was unsatisfactory. The proposed referendum may not be the ideal way to deal with this issue &ndash; it may not be Utopian &ndash; but, like the song, it is as near to perfect as one will find.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, if any of the remarks I made to any individual on the other side has caused personal insult or injury, I withdraw them categorically. It was never my intention to make either a political statement or to be a political opportunist. I felt it was important to put my personal view on the record. I was unable to participate in the Second Stage debate as I was out of the country last Friday. I would have done so if I had been here. I never intended to introduce a level of rancour to the debate. I would not do that to any of the Members on the other side of the House whom I respect. I fundamentally disagree with a number of points they made. However, that does not mean that I do not accept their validity and the value of making them. If I said anything that upset the Chair or caused a difficulty, I am sorry. I certainly did not mean to cause upset to any Member on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach, his office and the very efficient chairpersons who oversaw the debate. My colleague from Cork, Senator Cregan, was one of them and I thought the eye contact between him and Senator Taylor-Quinn was worth capturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very good debate. We accepted <Col N="1666" /> amendments in the other House, but it is a very complex issue. People have said this is somehow a cynical political exercise, but it is not. I chaired the departmental committee for a year and I often thought the easy, cynical thing to do would be to avoid dealing with the issue. To be fair, the Taoiseach has a strong personal commitment to dealing with the issue. He said that even before the general election and the election of any of the Independents. Some of the Independents have very strong views on the issue, but the Taoiseach made his commitment clear on coming into Government. A process was put in place involving the Green Paper and the Oireachtas committee, which took a considerable amount of time to deal with a range of public submissions. Judgments were made in terms of how we have balanced this particular set of proposals.</P>
    <P>I have said from day one that I never anticipated unanimity on the issue and there are views on both ends of the spectrum that differ from what we have brought forward. I anticipated that and I defy any group of politicians to come up with a resolution that would enjoy unanimity. We have made a particular call on the balances involved and in that context we commend them to the people. I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and for the good spirit that informed it. I can safely say it is a debate I will not forget in a hurry.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) to support and develop Family Resource Centres according to principles of community development and to promote social inclusion,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, I do not wish to oppose the Bill, but those working in family resource centres have serious concerns arising from a lack of consultation about how they will operate under the new structures. We all know <Col N="1670" /> that the heavy hand of bureaucracy often has a deadening effect on the work of agencies. They need reassurance on this.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that this amendment was proposed in the other House. However, the Minister now has a greater understanding of the concerns of those involved. Is he minded, therefore, to accept the amendment? Will he address the anxieties of those working in family resource centres?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever there is change or bodies are amalgamated, there is always a fear of what it will entail. I understand the fears of those involved in family resource centres and acknowledge that they have done outstanding work. However, I listened to the Minister's contribution to the debate in the other House and accept that their position will not be undermined. At the same time, the new agency must respect the identity and ethos of the centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their remarks. Section 4 (1)(<i>e</i>) provides for the Family Support Agency's role in supporting, developing and promoting family resource centres which are included because in the Government's previous budgets significant funding was given to the family support area. We increased the number of mediation centres from two to 11 and quadrupled the money available to the mediation service. Also, grants, such as those for marriage counselling were extended to include bereavement, child, marriage preparation and suicide counselling. In all, funding for voluntary groups has increased fivefold. The programme for Government contained a commitment to increase the number of family resource centres, of which there were ten in 1997. There are now about 80 either operating or in preparation.</P>
      <P>The Government thinks it is preferable to provide for family resource centres within the remit of the new agency rather than the Department. I hope Senator Keogh was not referring to my Department in applying the dead hand of bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The centres do not wish to leave behind my Department's helping hand. However, the Government considers it ludicrous that they should be outside the remit of the agency. Having committed all the extra resources to which I referred, more expertise is needed than that available within the Department or the Minister's office. The board will consist of those with expertise in various areas and can study international experience. We have come a long way in the last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assured the recently established forum, which represents about half of the family resource centres, that their role would not change and that <Col N="1671" /> they would not be required to provide family mediation or marriage counselling. This does not mean that they cannot contract in such services if they so wish. However, for some reason, those involved in the centres fear that the agency will force them to provide these services. Their role will not change and their distinct characteristics will be respected.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this amendment in the Dáil I explained that my advice was that it was not possible to include this laudable sentiment in the Bill because it might restrict the future development of the centres. There is already a strong statement in section 4(2)(<i>c</i>) that the agency must have regard to the Government's social inclusion policy, which means that family resource centres will continue in their present role and develop with the help of the agency and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully what the Minister said. Those involved in family resource centres were seeking reassurance and it was helpful for the Minister to declare how he sees the agency developing in relation to the centres and that their ethos will be respected. Therefore, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) No action of the Agency under <i>subsection (1) </i>shall amend, change or otherwise alter the existing criteria for the operation of Family Resource Centres without the full, informed and prior consent of the centres concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are back to the need for reassurance. There was very intensive lobbying on behalf of family resource centres in which those involved prefer to be fully informed and consulted. I have always found that within the voluntary sector there are different levels of expertise and experience and that those involved have to be reassured continuously. At all stages they wish to be up to speed and fully informed about what may happen. The amendment would give them further reassurance. It may seem like a belt and braces approach, but I have a long association with voluntary bodies and know that the more reassurance they get the more open they are to accepting change. Many voluntary agencies are very professional in their work and it is important that they are encouraged to participate as much as possible.</P>

      <P>We need voluntary bodies which play an important part in society. To a certain extent I agree with Senator Keogh that in the marrying of statutory and voluntary bodies there is always a fear that the layers of bureaucracy involved will lead to a breakdown in communications. Those working on the ground in voluntary agencies may feel they are not included. We have been reassured that there will not be extra layers of bureaucracy. Given these reassurances the amendment is probably not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 requires the agency to establish criteria in order to avail of financial assistance under section 4(1)(<i>h</i>). The criteria are subject to the approval of the Minister and the agency. The agency is required in subsection (3) to comply with directives. This provision is intended to enable the agency to establish the most appropriate criteria. The legislation requires a strong level of accountability in the matters of establishing criteria for funding and the provision and disbursement of financial assistance. It would be totally inappropriate to make the exercise of the agency's function to set criteria for financial assistance subject to the consent or approval of any one beneficiary or sector of the groups as suggested in the amendment. I wish to reassure the Senator about the position on the centres which will continue to receive funding as before. There will be no change in the funding commitment made to them or in the conditions set out in the three year contracts for funding which they hold with the Department as a result of the transfer.</P>
      <P>My Department successfully reached agreement with the Department of Finance to allow multi-annual budgeting. The Department of Finance would generally be of the view that the financial operations of agencies under its remit should run from year to year. The criteria already laid down for marriage and bereavement counselling grants and family resource centres have worked pretty well and it is anticipated that the agency will continue to review them. Obviously, it will have to be responsive to new and emerging needs in family support. It will take into account the views expressed by the membership.</P>
      <P>The amendment would lead to more bureaucracy and could cause difficulties. The type of operation which has worked fairly well up to now will continue and will, I hope, be strengthened by the new agency.</P>

This would not include the many voluntary groups also funded by my Department which are funded year to year based on their applications for grant aid. There is a huge desire on the part of groups to enter into core funding arrangements on a three year contract basis. The White Paper on voluntary activity which the Taoiseach and I launched in September 2000 contains a strong commitment to extend multi-annual budgeting to voluntary and community groups.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 7, to delete &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;12 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill states:</P>
      <P>As soon as may be, but not later than 6 months after the establishment day, and thereafter not later than 6 months after each period of 3 years that falls after the establishment day, the Agency shall prepare and submit to the Minister, for approval with or without amendment by the Minister a strategic plan.</P>
      <P>I note that a period of twelve months has been requested by some, but I am in two minds. While a realistic deadline is needed, when dealing with voluntary bodies it is often difficult to keep to such a short period of time. Voluntary agencies are becoming very professional in their activities. Will the Minister reassure me that the agency will be confident about having a strategic plan available within the specified time period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a nutshell, if we were to agree to the amendment, the agency would be operating without a strategic plan in its first year of operation. There would also be an inordinate delay of up to one year before the second and subsequent strategic plans would be available. Work is under way in the family mediation service in consultation with officials of the family affairs unit in order to chart the possible further development of the service in the context of the new agency. Similarly the first steps of developing the counselling service have been initiated by my <Col N="1674" /> Department in partnership with the voluntary providers of the service. Similar suggestions have been made by officials to the family resource centre programme. I believe this can be operational in the first six months so I suggest what is in the section is better than the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) be prepared in full and open consultation with Family Resource Centres and other voluntary and community organisations which fall within the remit of the work of the Agency,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to ensure the plan is prepared in an open way. It will give reassurance that those who have been involved are consulted fully on the development of strategic plans. This would give reassurance about the type of consultation that some of the resource centres felt was absent earlier. I know that the Minister, with his officials, embarked on a considerable period of consultation, which was very welcome. Having this in the Bill would be very beneficial to the agency, particularly in planning for the future.</P>

      <P>The agency will draw up its strategic plans taking account of the needs of families in the local communities that form the focus of its activities. It will work in co-operation with other public bodies that have a shared interest in family matters as provided in section 4(2)(<i>b</i>). It will work in partnership with the voluntary community groups for which it is responsible as envisaged in the White Paper Supporting Voluntary Activity.</P>
      <P>Section 4(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that the Family Support Agency will have regard to Government policy. It would be normal practice for stakeholders to be consulted in the development of a strategy statement and I expect the views of the family resource centres as well as the counselling services and the family mediation service will be included. There are fairly extensive discussions going on with the mediation service on strategic planning. The providers of marriage and relationship counselling have also been involved in discussions with my Department in relation to the development of the grant aid scheme, the establishment of best practice, the issue of professional standards, which is something I am particularly keen to see go ahead, and the further development of marriage counselling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent discussions with family resource centres, officials of my Department have broached the possibility of preparatory work being undertaken to consider how best the work of the centres can be advanced under the new agency. This preliminary work will be important <Col N="1675" /> to the agency on its establishment. Obviously the agency will follow the template of other agencies in this regard. I assure the Senators this amendment is not necessary. The agency will be consulting with the various bodies in this area.</P>

      <P>I may sound like a broken record, but this amendment is once again an attempt to be inclusive.

      <P>It could cause difficulties if all sections were represented in the membership of this agency. Each counselling section has its own views. There would be requests from bereavement counselling, marriage counselling, parents groups, etc. The people chosen for this committee must take into account the views of those from the community sector in the family resource centres and from the mediation service. The ethos of the family resource centres must be maintained so that one body is not dwarfed by the other.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their views. We gave this matter great consideration. I want to set up an agency that individually and collectively will have skills, talents and expertise in family policy. I am confident the conditions laid down in the legislation will fulfil that. I and future Ministers should appoint members with experience in counselling, family mediation and work in the resource centres. However, I cannot be prescriptive because of the different components of the sector.</P>
      <P>The family resource centres have indicated their willingness to suggest, through the forum, a number of individuals who might have experience and expertise in the working of family resource centres. They are reasonably happy with that. I wanted to have representation from the staff, which is catered for in section 10(5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have restricted the number of persons to be nominated by Ministers and Departments to three. There was much discussion on this. In a <Col N="1676" /> family support agency, there could be at least five Departments which would want representation. The point made by Senator Leonard about the other sectors is very valid and I suggest to Senator Keogh that the Minister should have flexibility in appointing people in that respect. If someone who was too closely aligned to one sector were appointed to the agency, he or she might believe that his or her remit was to represent just that sector and to a certain extent forget about everything else. We want to keep it as broad as we can while having some people on the board who have come from family resource centres, family mediation, marriage counselling and all the other components.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Restricting nominees from Departments to three is very wise. I am pleased to hear the forum is open to this approach to representation. Perhaps the same attitude may be taken by the other disciplines in relation to that. We do not want it overloaded with representatives from one discipline. That would not be appropriate. We need the widest range of expertise and the best representation possible. The Minister has been open on this issue. I accept his bona fides in this regard and I am happy with his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the House giving time to the Bill at short notice. It is vital legislation without which aviation services into and out of Ireland would quickly come to a halt. We are working to a tight deadline. As the Minister did not have the legal power to issue indemnities straight away on 24 September, the Government approved the issue of letters of comfort for one month. These letters of comfort have been renewed on two occasions since then and the current letters are due to expire on 23 December. It is important, therefore, that this Bill be enacted this week so that the letters of comfort can be replaced by actual indemnities before they expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House will be acutely aware of the commemoration ceremonies that took place in the United States and around the world on Tuesday, three months after the appalling terrorist attacks on New York, Washington and Philadelphia. Those attacks have had enormous repercussions for the aviation industry and for economies across the globe. One aspect of those repercussions was the decision of aviation insurers to withdraw insurance cover in respect <Col N="1678" /> of third party damage caused by acts of war or terrorism with effect from 24 September 2001. It was immediately clear that this would result in the grounding of almost all civilian air transport around the world. There was a universal response by governments that this should not be allowed to happen. The Government, in common with those in other EU member states, in the USA and in many other countries decided at short notice to step in to fill the gap left in the insurance market.</P>
    <P>Following extensive consultations with the Attorney General's office, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it was clear the Government was not legally empowered to indemnify the airlines and airports. Consequently, it was decided to issue letters of comfort in which the Government undertook to introduce the legislation that is now before the House and, in the event that the Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas, to then issue indemnities to the firms that have received letters of comfort.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, introduced the Bill in the other House, she indicated that, in addition to the insurance problems which are the focus of the Bill, the events of 11 September also impacted on security measures and on the economics of the aviation business. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks the most immediate response related to security measures at airports. The US authorities closed their airspace and airports for four days. Before the airports reopened, the US and other Governments had established requirements for much stricter security checks for passengers and luggage before boarding flights. Those stricter security measures are continually being reassessed and enhanced and look likely to be the norm from now on.</P>
    <P>The Garda and airport security authorities also responded immediately to the events of 11 September. The national civil aviation security committee convened a meeting on 12 September and has held eight further meetings since. That the committee normally only meets about twice a year puts those meetings in perspective. A wide range of extra security measures have been implemented at all airports and the committee continues to review them. Precise details of the new security arrangements cannot be disclosed on security grounds. However, in general terms, the additional measures have involved the deployment of extra gardaí, enhanced passenger and baggage screening, extra airside and ground patrols and tighter controls on cockpit access. The procedures controlling access to the airside of the airports have also been tightened up.</P>
    <P>Prior to 11 September many airlines were beginning to feel the effects of one of the usual cyclical slowdowns in the aviation business. The terrorist attacks greatly accelerated this slowdown and occasioned immediate costs through lost business on the days the USA's airspace and airports were closed and the additional security measures put in place. The impact on Aer Lingus has been disastrous. Senators will be aware of the <Col N="1679" /> intensive efforts being carried out by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to find a lasting solution to this difficult problem.</P>
    <P>As well as reducing the war risks insurance cover to a fraction of previous levels, the insurance industry greatly increased the premium for the cover that remained. This is a further economic burden on an already hard-pressed industry. Prior to the withdrawal of cover airlines generally enjoyed third party war risks insurance cover of up to $1.5 billion per aircraft, generally included as part of the overall insurance premium. Third party war risks cover indemnifies the policy holder against claims by third parties, on the ground, who suffer personal injury or material damage. It is important to note that the insurers have made no change in respect of war risks cover for passengers on aircraft, which remains fully in place. It is also important to note that there has been no change to insurance cover for accidents and events that have nothing to do with war or terrorism.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the new circumstances in which civil aircraft could be used as weapons, insurers gave the minimum seven days notice required under the insurance contracts of their decision to unilaterally reduce cover to $50 million per airline with effect from midnight on 24 September 2001. An airline with, for example, 30 aircraft would previously have had cover of $45 billion, but would now have cover of $50 million. In addition, the insurers imposed a charge of $1.50 per passenger for the new low level of cover. While, at first, this may not seem like a lot, over a full year it almost trebles an airline's total insurance bill, despite cover being only a fraction of what it was. The withdrawal of cover also applied to airports, air traffic control and ground handling activities such as baggage handling, refuelling, maintenance and security.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement by the insurance industry that it was going to reduce war risks cover it quickly became apparent that the net result would be almost a complete cessation of civil aviation services. There are a variety of reasons for this, the most directly relevant perhaps being that, in most countries, certainly in the European Union, airlines must have adequate insurance cover to qualify for an operating licence. In addition, many airlines now lease their aircraft rather than buy them outright and the beneficial owners, the lessors, in order to minimise their risk, include in the leasing contracts a requirement of high levels of insurance for each leased aircraft.</P>
    <P>It was clear to the directors of the airlines that they would be placing the future of the entire business in jeopardy if they continued operations without insurance cover. It is no exaggeration to say that governments around the world were united in the view that the terrorist attacks should not be allowed to bring normal life to a halt, which was just the effect the terrorists were trying to achieve. The Government, in common with its <Col N="1680" /> EU counterparts, took the view that arrangements should be put in place to allow the airlines to continue flying beyond the 24 September deadline imposed by the insurance industry. The immediate response, in most cases, was for governments to step in and take on the insurance burden insurers were no longer prepared to carry.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the House aware of the EU dimension to this insurance matter. On 22 September the matter was first considered at an informal ECOFIN meeting at Liège and the following guidelines were issued. Government support will be limited to addressing a specific short-term failure in the commercial insurance market, to ensure third party cover for war and terrorism remains available. Governments will charge a reasonable premium, which as far as possible reflects the risks involved, for the schemes they introduce, although it is possible that this will be waived in the short term. The schemes will be introduced for one month with work continuing on a sustainable solution and to encourage industry to return to the market as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, on 14 September, the Transport Council asked the Commission to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group to examine aviation security issues and ECOFIN asked the Commission to extend that work to include the insurance issues. The matter was discussed by the Transport Council on 16 October and, most recently, on 6 December. It was concluded that member states may continue to operate temporary government schemes on a month-by-month basis up to 31 March 2002. At the same time the Council would like to see a speedy and concerted return to commercial insurance arrangements in preference to the government schemes.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings of the <i>ad hoc</i> insurance group have now taken place. At a meeting on 23 October guidelines were issued in relation to appropriate levels of charging by governments and these will form the basis for the charges to be imposed by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance when the Bill is enacted. In keeping with the Transport Council's conclusions, the guidelines are intended to encourage the airlines and insurers to return to commercial insurance arrangements as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is clear from my summary of the various EU interventions in this matter that policy has had to evolve at short notice to reflect the realities on the ground. Initially, at the time of the informal ECOFIN meeting, it was assumed that intervention by governments for one month would be sufficient. At that meeting it was not yet appreciated that insurance cover was also being withdrawn from airports and ground handlers. On 16 October it was still hoped the insurance market would have returned to normal after two months or, at worst, by the end of this year. However, insurers continue to be cautious and the need for government intervention may extend well into the early part of next year. The Government, in <Col N="1681" /> common with its European partners, would like to see the return of normal commercial insurance arrangements as soon as possible as the government schemes are very much an essential measure to fill the gap in the insurance market for the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill designed to deal with the immediate insurance problems in a comprehensive manner. It does not deal with any other aviation issues. The House will appreciate that, while my Department has endeavoured to keep the Bill as short as possible, this is by no means trivial legislation owing to the enormous sums of money involved.</P>
    <P>Basically, the Bill will authorise the Minister for Public Enterprise to issue indemnities to airlines, airports, the Irish Aviation Authority and ground handlers to make up the gap between the insurance cover they have and what was available before the problem arose. In current circumstances this means the normal cover available prior to 24 September 2001. Many of the indemnities amount to $1.5 billion per aircraft. The amounts of cover for airports and ground handlers are between $100 million and $500 million. This creates an enormous potential liability for the Exchequer when it is realised that more than 70 aircraft are covered, as well as nine airports and 15 ground handlers. The potential liability is clearly beyond the capacity of a small country like Ireland. Therefore, the aggregate maximum amount that may be paid out on foot of indemnities is limited by the Bill to &euro;9 billion.</P>
    <P>While there is the potential for enormous claims under these indemnities, the decision of the Government to give the letters of comfort reflected the low probability of claims arising, and the charges to be made for the indemnities also take this into account. There will be no requirement for the Exchequer to make any payments unless a terrorist attack involves an Irish airline or an Irish airport.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the huge financial exposure, the Bill contains a number of important safeguards in addition to providing the legislative authority to issue indemnities. First, the underlying requirement before the issuing of indemnities is the need for the Government to decide that a problem exists and to make an order to that effect. Second, each Government order can last only six months unless a continuing order is made. Third, each indemnity may only last a maximum of 31 days. In other words, indemnities of this magnitude cannot be issued by the Minister without careful consideration and must be reviewed every month. The collective decision of Government must be revisited at least once every six months as long as the problem continues. Finally, the entire Act will become ineffective after 12 months unless its continuation is approved by the Seanad and the other House. This will provide elected representatives with an opportunity to consider whether they wish the Government to continue to have the authority to enter into this type of financial commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" />In the course of its passage through the other House a number of amendments were made to the Bill. I take this opportunity to thank all the Deputies who spoke on the Bill. Many of the points made by the Opposition represented significant improvements to the Bill, and I am pleased to inform Members that they have been incorporated into the text before this House.</P>
    <P>I will briefly summarise these changes. Section 2(7) now provides that orders made by the Government to declare the existence of a state of difficulty may be annulled by the Oireachtas within 21 days, as is common in many Acts. Section 12 has been modified so that the Minister is not absolved of liability if there is an unreasonable delay or default in the issue or renewal of an indemnity. Section 14 has been modified to replace the possibility of immediate termination of indemnities with a short period of notification of termination or suspension. Section 16 was extended considerably to provide a mechanism for applying the limit of &euro;9 billion which is a vital protection for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the principal sections of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 provide the powers necessary to issue indemnities. Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 19, provide a variety of safeguards for the Exchequer. The remaining sections are routine provisions that feature in most legislation covering such matters as definitions and the management of moneys.</P>
    <P>While section 1, dealing with interpretation, is a routine section, I draw the attention of Members to the four categories of company identified who may apply for indemnities. These are airlines licensed in the State, the Irish Aviation Authority, airports with scheduled services and other companies that provide ground handling services. These companies include baggage handling, maintenance, refuelling and security. The indemnities to airlines licensed by Ireland will also cover any services that they operate between non-Irish airports.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives the Government power to make an order to declare that a state of difficulty exists affecting the supply of insurance relating to air navigation services. The requirement for the Government order reflects the enormous levels of indemnity required to match the insurance that was in place prior to 24 September &ndash; up to $1.5 billion per aircraft. The maximum period for such an order is six months. A continuation order can be made after six months, if necessary. Section 3 empowers the Minister to give or renew indemnities during the period when an order under section 2 is in force.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 an indemnity may only be issued in a case where the undertaking requesting the indemnity had insurance immediately prior to the state of difficulty that gave rise to the order under section 2. This is to ensure that the indemnities are limited to cases where insurance cover has been withdrawn or reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 5 allows the Minister to impose conditions when issuing an indemnity. The Minister <Col N="1683" /> may declare an indemnity void if the conditions are not complied with. The letters of comfort that have already been issued contain conditions, such as a requirement to comply with whatever conditions were in the original insurance policy, a requirement to notify the Minister immediately an event arises that might give rise to a claim, and an entitlement for the Minister to withdraw the indemnities if a terrorist attack should involve an Irish airline or airport.</P>
    <P>Section 6 limits the State's liability to whatever limit previously existed under the original insurance cover. Furthermore, when all indemnities are taken together, the State's liability will be limited to &euro;9 billion. This is the approximate euro equivalent of the aggregate limits on indemnities under the existing letters of comfort &ndash; £5 billion for the airlines and £2 billion for the airports and service providers. The Bill provides that, if the total claims from indemnified undertakings were to exceed &euro;9 billion, the payments from the Exchequer would be limited to a proportion of the claims made. The detailed arrangements for applying this limit are in section 16.</P>
    <P>Section 7 limits the period of any one indemnity to 31 days. This is to protect the Exchequer by requiring renewals to be based on the most up-to-date information about the availability of and need for insurance. Indemnities may be renewed. Provision is also made to cover the retrospective period back to 24 September 2001.</P>
    <P>While section 8, which allows the Minister to impose charges for indemnities, is a routine provision, I would like the House to be aware that this is in line with the ECOFIN and Transport Council conclusions. In common with most member states, it is not proposed to make any charges in respect of the first month of cover.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 the Minister may only issue indemnities to Irish licensed airlines and to airports and service providers whose services are essential to support civil air services. Again, the objective is to limit the exposure of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is another important protection for the Exchequer. It gives the Minister all the defences against claims that would have been available to the insurance company if the insurance cover had continued in place. Subsection (2) ensures that the issue of an indemnity by the Minister does not give any additional rights to a person compared with those they would have had if the insurance had continued in force.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is a very important section. It allows the Minister to terminate or suspend indemnities at any time. However, an indemnity in respect of an aircraft in flight will not terminate until it lands. If indemnities are terminated, airlines must get their aircraft to land at the nearest airport, which may be the one from which they have just taken off, as soon as possible unless they get specific permission from the Minister to fly to another airport. This is, perhaps, the most important element in limiting the Exchequer's exposure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" />Section 15 allows the Minister to reinsure all or part of the liabilities associated with the indemnities. No plans exist to do this immediately but it may be an appropriate way to reduce the risk to the Exchequer if an insurance difficulty were of long duration and if reinsurance is available.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the cessation of the operation of the Act 12 months from the date of its coming into operation, unless extended by a resolution of the Oireachtas. As I mentioned in my overview, this is another important part of the protections built into the Bill as it provides an opportunity for the Oireachtas to consider the matter on a regular basis. This legislation is essential to keep Irish civil aviation in operation in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the House shares the Government's strong belief that terrorists should not be permitted to curtail our freedoms. Freedom to travel is an essential part of the modern economy. It is also an essential part of the freedoms we enjoy as citizens of the European Union, as part of our long-standing kinship with the United States and as part of the goodwill that Ireland and its people have earned throughout the world by our support for human rights.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this very important legislation which is in response to the events of 11 September over which none of us had control and which have had a major impact on all the western economies, including the United States. It brought into clearer focus what was happening in the airline industry for a number of years. It was evident that even without this massive terrorist onslaught on the twin towers and the Pentagon and the failed attempt in Philadelphia, the airline business was slipping into disarray. In respect of domestic flights in America there was little or no control over passengers and how one could board a plane. Irrespective of what instruments one had, one could get on a flight.</P>
      <P>This was all brought into focus after the events of 11 September. As a result safety procedures have been tightened up by all the aviation authorities throughout the world. Consumers will feel more at ease when flying in that some of what was happening prior to 11 September will not now happen. Given that there had been access to cockpits and that pilots were vulnerable to attack from any type of madman, terrorist or deranged person, it was vital that access to cockpits be closed off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation before the House is a response to all I have said. It is due to the fact that insurance companies have withdrawn cover for a terrorist-related incident. Having known insurance companies down through the years and that they always look at the bottom line, once Governments in the west carry a particular liability they may be left to carry it much longer than anticipated at present. In his contribution, the Minister of State said the Government, in com<Col N="1685" /> mon with other EU Governments, took the view that arrangements should be put in place to allow the airlines to continue flying. The immediate response in both cases was for the Government to step in and take on the insurance burden that the insurers were no longer prepared to carry.</P>
    <P>He also stated that at a Transport Council meeting on 16 October it was concluded that member states may continue to operate temporary Government schemes and at the same time the Council would like to see a speedy and concerted return to commercial insurance arrangements in preference to Government schemes. There does not seem to be any mechanism by which Governments, or a particular Government, can decide at a future date that no act of terrorism is looming, that conditions have returned to normality and in such a context that the insurance companies should assume the responsibilities they had heretofore in relation to the aviation industry. I am concerned that there appears to be no mechanism by which they can be forced to assume those responsibilities. If there is such a mechanism, perhaps the Minister of State will tell the House when responding to the debate. There is no mechanism in force to redefine for insurance companies at what juncture they should come back into the marketplace and allow the normal arrangements to continue as heretofore. That is one aspect of the legislation about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>If the industry here is to continue it is essential that this legislation is passed. We are all aware of the plight of Aer Lingus due mainly to the attacks on the United States and the consequent downturn in the aviation industry. This has a serious effect on Aer Lingus finances, on morale within the aviation industry as a whole and on workers in Aer Lingus who will lose their jobs as a result of this heinous attack that occurred on 11 September. There had been a downturn but, nevertheless, it was exacerbated to an enormous extent by these events.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, as the national carrier, has to be safeguarded because the economy, including the tourism industry, is almost entirely dependent on it and its flights from the US. It is unfortunate to note the curtailment already planned for next year. The number of seats which will not be available even if people want to come here is extraordinarily high. It will put the tourist industry back ten years if other arrangements cannot be made to bring people in from the Continent on low cost flights to stimulate the domestic market here, which might take up some of the slack as a result of the non-appearance of our friends from the United States who were big spenders in respect of gifts and many other purchases. The dollar was always valuable, especially when the economy was not nearly as strong.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the speed and efficiency with which the Minister has presented it. It will go a long way towards ensuring our air traffic will continue. As the Minister said, it is legislation which, I hope, will be short-lived. In <Col N="1686" /> view of the reservations I have expressed, however, I see it extending much longer than anticipated.</P>
    <P>I could not conclude without making some reference to our local Knock airport which is always a cause for discussion and concern in the west. It is one of the major airports in the west along with Galway and Sligo, which are minor in comparison to the runway facilities at Knock. It is regrettable that the airport is not bringing in the numbers of people originally envisaged by the promoters. I do not blame the airport board for that and I know the chairman, Mr. Cathal Duffy, is one of the hardest-working chairmen of any company. It is not a State company but a private company in trust for the people of Connacht and Mayo in particular.</P>
    <P>The Government should re-examine the position of Knock in relation to how its viability can be improved and how it can reach its potential. We complain constantly about our national road network in the west. Our airport is a vital piece of infrastructure for bringing people into the west. There are now also public service obligation flights taking place on a daily basis, courtesy of Aer Árann, from Knock to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example which I hope is not a general symptom of what is happening in Knock. Last Friday morning I booked a flight from Knock to Dublin but I could not get to the airport on time because there had been a head-on collision which blocked the road. I drove to Dublin only to discover that the flight had not left Knock until 9.15 a.m. so I would have been in plenty of time for it. However, I discovered later that it did not leave Dublin on Friday night at all so if I had made the morning flight, I would have been here until Saturday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention that example to illustrate that aircraft companies do not appear to consult the public when drawing up schedules. Do they consult the public? The public does not want the type of flights they are providing from Knock at 7 a.m. where one has to get up at midnight to get to the airport and then arrives in Dublin at 8 a.m. What can anyone do in Dublin at 8 a.m.?</P>
      <P>This legislation is necessary and it will ensure, at least in the short term, that our aviation industry will survive. It will be helped also by the Aer Lingus action plan which I hope will be implemented. We cannot allow what happened to Swissair and Sabena to happen to Aer Lingus. If we do, our tourist industry will be back in the Middle Ages. For the sake of tourism we must ensure that Aer Lingus is kept in the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" />The Minister said the Government would review the legislation regularly and I am sure it is hoping that there will be no major claim under it. The possibilities may seem remote but the State's exposure, to the extent of £9 billion, is considerable. Every effort should be made to ensure there is constant vigilance in the area and that it is revisited as often as possible. It should be done with a view to getting insurance companies to take up the slack.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to charges being imposed in relation to this legislation. Where will those charges be levied? Will they be on insurance companies or on the aviation industry? When things return to normal, will there be any clawback from insurance companies in relation to the State expenditure incurred in underwriting this risk in the aviation industry? In previous cases, such as the collapse of ICI and AIB, there was no question of reimbursing the State for its loss when things got back to normal. The State was not reimbursed for the loss it incurred in preserving the corporate viability of these particular institutions. The Minister should examine the possibility of a clawback situation when events return to normal.</P>
    <P>How will we determine normality in this era when what is normal today is abnormal tomorrow? The events of 11 September were in the realm of science fiction up to that date but now they are a reality. We face these realities every day of the week. Determining what is normal, and when the aviation industry has returned to normal, will be a headache for the Government and insurance agencies. This legislation is essential. Knowing insurance companies and their habits, I believe that the cover will go on for longer than the Government believes. All Governments in the EU will have to be careful about that in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and this important Bill. In my many years in the Oireachtas I never anticipated that a Bill of this significance would have to be brought before us, although many pieces of emergency legislation in response to terrorist acts or threats have been introduced.</P>
      <P>If anything has been highlighted by the horrific events of 11 September, it is that the world we live in is a small global village. I am not the first to say that. Those events put that concept in perspective. The events, horrific as they were, occurred in the United States, yet they had a devastating effect all around the world, not just in Ireland. They had not only a devastating effect directly on the airline industry but directly and indirectly on industry and commerce throughout the world and they were a threat to our way of life, our quality of life and civilisation. The primary aim and thrust of the terrorists' agenda seemed to be to disrupt and destroy our civilisation and replace it with a terrorist type civilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" />To take up a point made by my colleague, in terms of what we would have envisaged for the present or the future, these events were in the realm of science fiction. None of us would have believed what we read by science fiction writers or saw on our screens, small and large, would have come to reality in such a horrific and horrible way, caused such devastating chaos and wreacked such havoc around the world, threatening our very existence. The threat posed went right to the root of our civilisation.</P>
    <P>That raises a question as to how well we have coped or how well we would have coped but for the fact that we live in a global village. If it were not for the evolution of the concept of the global village, we might not have coped. Determined and professional as our Ministers were in response to the terrible tragedy caused by the terrorist acts, if they had happened a decade or two ago, it might not have been possible for us to respond in such a cohesive, practical and realistic way as we did. What has helped the Government and the country enormously in their response has been the evolution of the global village and the understanding, realisation and acceptance of what Prime Minister Blair likes to profess but does not practise too often, the interconnectivity between nations. We are all so interconnected and interdependent that instead of panicking and rushing as individual nations to salvage our bit out of the wreckage of the terrible crisis of 11 September, the immediate response was that nations looked to each other to work together and respond to the crisis through their interconnectivity. That has been the greatest source of strength to us in facing up to this crisis.</P>
    <P>In the absence of that, blind selfishness and a lack of enlightenment would have taken over. There would have been a much greater incidence of catastrophe in terms of economic downturn, particularly in the airline industry, than there has been. I compliment the Government on the mature and enlightened way in which it approached this crisis. Its approach was founded on the evolution that has been in place in relationships among nations within the EU and between the EU and the rest of the world in terms of trade and how we promote and enhance our own civilisation.</P>
    <P>An immediate effect of the 11 September crisis was the withdrawal of insurance cover by the airline insurance industry. That was a major additional crisis for an industry which Senator Caffrey and the Minister rightly said was already in serious difficulty, particularly our domestic airline, Aer Lingus. These events threw it into a crisis, as they did the airline aviation industry around the world. To take a simple example: prior to 11 September insurance cover was US$1.5 billion per airline compared to a phenomenal reduction in insurance cover to US$50 million per airline post-11 September and following service of a seven day notice. There was a trebling of aviation insurance cover with a multiplier reduction in the level of cost. The implications of <Col N="1689" /> that were startling. It could have grounded the airline industry. These circumstances posed a nightmare scenario for the Government as they did for other governments in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. An added difficulty for the Government was that we did not have legislation in place to effect immediate indemnity. That caused further complications. Nevertheless, positive and effective action was taken.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the terrorists was to wreak havoc on our civilisation. It is clear from the Government's action, which must be strongly commended, that it was determined, as were other governments in Europe and abroad, that there was no way terrorism would prevail and succeed in its primary objective of ruining our quality of life, way of life and civilisation. Their actions and determination to date is a clear manifestation of that.</P>
    <P>I commend the decisiveness with which not only the Government and officials but governments of other member states of the EU came together at the Transport Council meetings and the ECOFIN Council in Liège and on the arrangements they succeeded in putting in place, under enormous pressure given the panic experienced by the insurance industry, to deal with this national, international and global emergency. The evolution that has taken place in the relationships, particularly among states within the EU and between the EU and others, significantly enhanced their ability to come forward with these arrangements. There was an understanding, appreciation and acknowledgement of the need to co-operate and help each other. That no doubt facilitated and promoted the putting in place of these arrangements speedily. As the Minister said, the arrangements put in place were directed by the guiding principles of ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the necessary legislation, letters of comfort had to be issued to the airlines involved. Letters of comfort were a short immediate solution that enabled airlines to overcome the difficulty of the Government's inability to issue legal indemnities in the short term. As the Minister pointed out, the deadline is 23 December. With the passage of this legislation the indemnities can be issued. Against that background, Members on all sides recognise the major significance of this Bill. Never before was a Bill so necessary and urgent not alone to protect the industry specifically referred to in the Bill but because of the major dependence of many, if not all, sectors of industry in Ireland on that industry. With the advent of globalisation and liberalisation, no economy in the modern world can have any realistic prospect of survival in the absence of air transport. That points to the major and much wider significance of ensuring that our aviation industry is maintained, sustained and helped to grow.</P>
    <P>The Bill underpins those arrangements. That is its importance. The implications of its enactment are much wider and more significant, but the <Col N="1690" /> urgency of enacting it is appreciated because the letters of comfort expire on 23 December. It is vital they do not lapse before the legislation is replaced.</P>
    <P>I want to take up an important point made by Senator Caffrey. Initially, it was envisaged that the timeframe involved would be about one month, but because of the caution being displayed by the airline insurance industry generally that has been extended further into the new year. I fully endorse the sentiments and concerns expressed by Senator Caffrey that the Minister &ndash; I know we have her support &ndash; should ensure through the Transport Council and the ECOFIN Council that the temporary arrangement by states would be of a very short-term nature.</P>
    <P>We fully agree with the concerns expressed by Senator Caffrey that the insurance industry generally can be coy when it sees an opt-out factor. It can be coy in re-establishing its commitment and responsibilities. I know the Minister, the Government and the EU will ensure that will not happen and that pressure will be brought to bear on the industry to renew cover at the earliest possible date, while bearing in mind that the risk, however diminished, still exists. The purpose of insurance is, by definition, to deal with risk and provide people with cover and security from risk. The industry will be encouraged and pressured by every means at the Minister and transport council's disposal to renew its primary role in line with that definition. The purpose of the legislation is to fill a gap between the pre-11 September and post-11 September position.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the State's exposure. If one thinks in terms of £1.5 billion cover or £50 million per aircraft for cover, one is talking in terms of huge multiples. The potential liability is absolutely astronomical. A small State such as ours could not afford to aspire to fulfilling that role not just in the short term but in the long term. Nevertheless, I welcome the safeguards, provisions and conditions provided for in the Bill. For example, the Government must decide that a problem exists before an order can be made. The order will last for six months, following which it will have to be renewed. Under the Bill the Government will be obliged to review that order every six months. The indemnity factor lasts for a maximum of 31 days but that has been amended somewhat in the other House. The main provisions in the Bill are important safeguards to limit to the maximum extent possible the exposure of the State, bearing in mind the role it must play. The safeguards are realistic, effective and practical.</P>
    <P>The action the Minister took in the dire circumstances which existed was swift, effective and timely. It prevented the airline from going to the wall because that was the scenario if the Government did not step in to fill the gap on an interim basis. It also ensured that economic activity, which is so dependent on the aviation industry, has been facilitated to continue with the minimum possible interruption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" />I wish the deliberations well in regard to the survival plan because they are at a delicate stage. I am not familiar with what has happened in the past couple of days. I wish the Minister, the Department, the management and workers of Aer Lingus well in expediting the putting in place of the survival plan. Much work has been put into the plan both here and at EU level. I commend all those involved for their maturity and enlightened approach with which they have faced up to the crisis. I urge all those concerned to grasp this opportunity as part of the restructuring programme to upgrade the Aer Lingus pension plan. It is vital this opportunity is taken to bring more equity and fairness into the whole Aer Lingus pension plan because there is discrimination between that and other public service pension plans.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and compliment the Minister on her overall management of a terrible crisis not previously envisaged in terms of Aer Lingus and the airline industry generally.</P>

      <P>While recognising that the Government had no choice but to introduce this essential legislation, it would be utterly irresponsible of any House of the Oireachtas not to support the general terms of the Bill. However, we should also recognise what is before us here. This is not greenfield legislation because it has a certain sense of <i>déjà vu.</i> What is involved here is the neglect and abrogation of responsibility by the private sector. We have had to do this before. We have had to introduce legislation previously to deal with the ICI debacle when the Government had to pick up the pieces. I do not hear any of the great supporters or disciples of the private sector and the free market telling us how the free market operates in this situation. As soon as there is any element of risk, the insurance companies turn tail, run away and let us look after our own business. All those who speak about the great importance of the private sector and how it works should keep that clearly in mind when facing into this legislation. It goes even deeper than that. I am not opposing the legislation because it must be enacted. However, we should recognise that what is happening is that the Irish taxpayers are taking on the responsibility which the insurance companies with limitless profits have soaked out of the system for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back to the basis of the problem on 11 September. The problem began in Boston airport because it had the worst levels of security of any airport in North America. That fact was established many months before 11 September. There are two serious documents outlining the security in different American airports which showed Boston to be lacking. This was brought to public attention long before 11 September. The issue was flagged for those people who were looking for the worst possible security measures. However, that is not the point I wish to make. The point I wish to make is why Boston? <Col N="1692" /> Whether we look at Boston or Berlin for our role models for the future, what happened at Boston airport is that it outsourced security.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i> newspaper, which is not notorious for its left wing tendencies, liberal views or being pro-public sector, carried the results of a survey which compared airport security in Boston and Amsterdam. The difference between the two airports was absolutely staggering. First, the people working on airport security, those who look at the screen when we put our bags through security and who judge what is in them, were paid less than operators of cash registers in local supermarkets. Therefore, those who were getting jobs at the airport were people who would not get work anywhere else. This is not my view, it is an established fact. It is also a fact that the people in Boston took up appointment following a couple of hours training as compared to a number of weeks training at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam. The number who remained in the job for any significant period at Boston airport was in single figures compared to it being a career option at Amsterdam airport. These people were well paid and completely skilled at the job. They were security conscious, they knew what they were about and had the experience of identifying on the screen items in suitcases.</P>
    <P>That is the reason the problem was encountered on 11 September. It goes back to a basic neglect, to a dependence on the market. The market is good for one thing, making profits. The market is not good at protecting people or looking after the general needs of people. The Government should take a clear interest in any proposals to outsource various aspects of the work of the airport.</P>
    <P>The other issue that was evident &ndash; this has been in the news again recently &ndash; is how few proper scanning machines there were in airports. There is security scanning but the level of security scanning necessary is not taking place at present. There is a shortage of scanning machines in airports around the world, and that is certainly causing a problem.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the market abrogated responsibility by reducing the level of security, reducing the trust and confidence in security and reducing the security of the travelling passenger. That, therefore, allowed people to get on board unchecked and led to the problem on 11 September. That, therefore, led to the bosses of the international insurance corporations saying, &ldquo;Why should we take the risk, we are here to make a profit, not to pick up risk&rdquo;, because they are averse to risk.</P>
    <P>Most insurance companies do not know about risk. Risk is merely a factor in the calculation of premia. It is not something which they engage in at any time. If there is a risk involved, as anybody, whether it is a 19 year old driver looking for insurance or somebody trying to insure a plane at Dublin Airport, will know, these boys just do not want to know. They are not in that business. They are in the business of making profit and they do <Col N="1693" /> not care about our demands. That is a point on which one should dwell and which we should remember.</P>
    <P>In terms of Aer Lingus, Ireland is the only island nation of the European Union. We need a national airline more than anybody else. It is disgraceful that the European Commission has used the appalling events of 11 September to put forward its agenda to reduce the number of national carriers in Europe to three or four to push forward the demands of British Airways, Lufthansa and whoever might be the other lucky two or three. I assure the House it does not include Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland, the people who need airlines more than others, suddenly find ourselves dependent on other airlines. Some would ask, &ldquo;Would we not be served by another European airline anyway?&rdquo;, and of course we would, but we need an airline with a commitment, with a stake and a root in this country. There are many strategic reasons for this. Apart from the national pride issue, which counts for a great deal in terms of our status internationally but which I will leave aside for a moment because it is hard to put a clear figure on that, we need our airline for exports. Many people do not realise that a huge amount of our exports to the United States in the IT industry is carried by plane.</P>
    <P>Many people do not realise also the importance of having direct routes between North America and Ireland for the purpose of foreign direct investment, of the establishment of industry and of ensuring that there are communications between international head offices in North America and Irish branches. These people do not want to change planes at London. They do not want to be pushed out to a hub. If Ireland is pushed out and becomes a tangent at the far end of a hub located in London, Paris, Amsterdam or wherever, we will lose out financially and in all sorts of ways. Therefore, the Government needs to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>We also need to recognise, as many have pointed out, that what has happened in Aer Lingus in terms of the numbers of redundancies and the decision to eliminate pay increases over the next few years, will have a huge impact on the morale of Aer Lingus workers. We should recognise that the principal trade unions involved in Aer Lingus are going through the difficult and arduous, if not dangerous, task of trying to convince their members to vote for a deal which reduces their prospects, comfort and security and darkens their future. We should recognise what has been done by the trade union movement in talks with Government over the past two to three months to secure the national airline.</P>
    <P>In addition, on the point which has been made about insisting that there is a certain element of equity available to the workers as a compensation for their lack of pay increases and for much of what they are losing in terms of involvement in profit sharing, these matters are hugely important <Col N="1694" /> in restoring some of the morale among the working in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>In short, this legislation, although important, should not be necessary but it reflects all that is wrong with privatisation. This is another version of what we saw in the UK last month and the previous month with Railtrack, which has had to be re-nationalised. We have seen it happen also with Air New Zealand, which has effectively been re-nationalised.</P>
    <P>I am not making this as a great plea, coming from a rooted philosophical stance of being completely opposed to privatisation and in favour of public ownership or nationalisation in all cases. What I am saying is that in all these cases &ndash; we will face it with Aer Rianta next &ndash; there is a strategic interest element, a security element and a health and safety element which need to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We should approach these matters in the same way as the Government and the trade union movement have recently approached the issue of public private partnerships. We should see how we can achieve our objective by protecting the needs and genuine aspirations of all the parties. Let us put together the building blocks to produce a policy on that. We must be careful in considering public private partnerships and, similarly, with the issue of privatisation. We need to look at our national strategic interests before making a decision.</P>
    <P>I will finish up with a story. When CIE was established all those years ago, it took control of the routes and established a monopoly. It was required to maintain a service. That was a condition of the establishment of CIE and what is now Bus Éireann. That is why there are some amazingly quaint routes, where a bus that is supposed to go from A to B seems to hit D, F and H before it gets to B. The reason for this is that the company has had to give a guarantee to maintain the level of service provided by the private sector. One might ask what that has to do with this matter. The answer is that we should take a similar approach and insist that levels of service are maintained, that there is a service contract and that there are certain demands on those issues.</P>
    <P>If Aer Rianta is sold to the wrong person &ndash; that is tied in with this legislation &ndash; we could be back here next year, with a flaw in security leading to another charge on the taxpayer. Therefore, let us insist that if we privatise Aer Rianta, the levels of security do not go south as they did in Boston airport. These are the kinds of issues we need to address and which should have been addressed previously. What we are seeing today is the failure of the Boston model as opposed to the European-Berlin model. It is a classic example.</P>
    <P>I am glad the leader of the Progressive Democrats group is here to listen to this; it is a message he might bring back to his party. This is not a black and white matter, there is more to it. The Irish taxpayer is taking up from the profiteering <Col N="1695" /> insurance companies who have walked away from their responsibilities. The taxpayer is also picking up the pieces left by those who have privatised airports and taken the profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made a very fine speech and there is very little that can be added, but there are one or two points he may have omitted. We have been calling for a debate on the insurance industry in this House for a considerable period of time. It is astounding that commercial insurance companies can give an ultimatum to airlines and Governments and withdraw insurance from a given date, namely, 24 September. They left the entire international airline industry high and dry. It seems incredible that that could have happened but it did. Since then all the Government, and other governments, could do was give letters of comfort regarding indemnification. We are being held to ransom by commercial insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us should be a Bill to regulate the area of insurance and set out the responsibilities of companies in times of crisis. The legislation should deal with how this is to be ordered in a balanced fashion rather than having companies ceasing to carry out the function for which they were originally established. A company cannot provide a service and withdraw it at a whim. There must be regulation. We are not talking about insurance cover only, we are also talking about major industries.</P>
      <P>We have seen airlines collapse because of the tragic events of 11 September. Many airlines around the world have shed huge numbers of jobs. There are a minimum of 2,000 jobs at risk in Aer Lingus accompanied by downsizing, a loss of morale and change in conditions. That is only the initial part of the problem. There will be knock-on effects for industry and imports and exports. An island nation like ours is hugely vulnerable but we do not seem to have any protection from the withdrawal of indemnification from airlines by insurance companies. Ireland relies heavily on tourism and many jobs may be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has huge ramifications and we need to have a very thorough discussion about the entire insurance industry. I do not know if anyone has called for that here, but I would like to have seen that as a preamble to the introduction of any legislation whereby taxpayers take on the indemnification which was hitherto dealt with by commercial insurance companies. Those companies made their profits but ran for cover when the first cold winds blew. They were not prepared to take any chances, nor do they seem to have given any proper reasons or explanation as to why the <Col N="1696" /> entire indemnification was lifted in the manner it was.</P>
    <P>Have many of these insurance companies closed? Have jobs been lost in the industry? Are they still charging for the insurance they are offering even though it is inadequate to provide all the cover required? What level do the insurance companies who provided cover for air navigation currently operate at? What security measures do they feel are required to enable them to restore indemnification? We do not know the answers to these questions. We have had letters of comfort in recent months. We are now going to extend the cover for another month, have a review in six months and the legislation will stay in effect for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies seem very cautious and do not know when they will again offer indemnification. Obviously they will not do it until they are ready. What has the Government done to explain to the companies their responsibilities? It is unacceptable for an insurance company not to offer a quote under equality legislation. I understand that every company is obliged to offer a quote in areas such as motor insurance. Are they making outlandish quotations for indemnification or are they making none? This is information that would be very useful to the House. We would like to know how the insurance companies are acting and how they propose to address indemnification in the future. I will not oppose this legislation but I do not want us to lose control. No one knows when these circumstances will change.</P>
    <P>We know that many security measures are being introduced. For example, new measures have been introduced in baggage handling and aeroplane cockpits are being sealed. Will a checklist be required? The war in Afghanistan is coming to an end. Is there a checklist the commercial insurance companies require during the so-called war on terrorism that is being fought?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about section 8 of the Bill. Am I to take it that another month of free cover will be offered to all airlines, national and private? What contribution are the airlines making to this cover for which we are providing £9 billion in indemnification? Why should a private airline receive letters of comfort from the taxpayer? Why should they receive free cover from the taxpayer? Is this likely to continue on an ongoing basis? While I have certainly not heard complaints from Ryanair about indemnification for its operations, I have heard it denounce the Government and scream about the manner in which it has been treated regarding the future development of the airline industry.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of hypocrisy in areas of the private sector. The insurance companies, for example, are running scared and do not consider it necessary to respond to any need other than those of shareholders. It has no broader vision, yet it viciously attacks state operations as unsafe, unstable, a waste of time, inefficient and more. <Col N="1697" /> On the other hand, the privatisation of national utilities has been a disaster in some cases.</P>
    <P>We must reassert the authority of the Government and the Legislature and ensure the private sector operates under a regulatory framework which respects the interests and dignity of people. Until we do this there will be no change in our position of chasing matters up and being left to pick up the pieces. Those involved in the marketplace declare it to be the be all and end all. They take everything that is up for grabs and leave the difficulties behind for the taxpayer to pick up.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister has no choice but to introduce this legislation. However, I call for a major discussion of the broader context in which it is being enacted. We should look again at how the insurance companies operate here and elsewhere, the way in which they can bring the world economy to its knees and make unilateral decisions. I ask that we return to this matter at an early stage to improve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Caffrey, Liam Fitzgerald, O'Toole and Costello for their excellent contributions. I will make a few comments and endeavour to answer some of their questions.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey was concerned that governments might have to continue to provide cover and that there was no mechanism in place to reintroduce the norm which would return insurance companies to their former role. He expressed strong sentiments about Knock Airport and asked about charges and the potential for clawback from insurance companies. Senator Fitzgerald also voiced concerns about this matter.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is reviewing the manner in which the insurance industry operates in case a cartel is operating in breach of competition law. However, this will take time. In the meantime member state governments must continue to support the civil aviation industry. The Government will meet this obligation. Senator Caffrey will be pleased to note that Knock Airport is also covered by the letters of comfort.</P>
      <P>Senators expressed concerns about charges which will be levied on the airports, airlines and ground handling companies which receive indemnities. Because the State will not pay out moneys except where a claim is made as a result of a terrorist attack, clawback will not be required.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of indemnity and referred to the interconnectivity between nations in matters such as trade and security measures. I agree this is a very important boon during these troubled times. The Senator's concerns about the implications of the huge insurance cover and expression of appreciation for the huge significance of the legislation were consistent with all the contributions. On his question concerning the duration of indemnity, each indemnity may only last for 31 days, a provision not amended in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" />Senator O'Toole referred to the abrogation of responsibility by the private sector, which has left the Government and the taxpayer to pick up the tab, and mentioned the deficiency in security at Boston Airport which, he indicated, was due to doing things on the cheap. He also argued that there should not be overdependence on the market to the exclusion of other national strategic requirements and, like all of us, questioned the wisdom of outsourcing functions. He emphasised the importance of Aer Lingus in terms of international trade, our position as the only island nation in the European Union and our exporting status, with which none of us would argue. The Government endorses his sentiment on the need for a national airline.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised serious and potent questions on insurance. Irish insurance companies do not participate in world aviation insurance. The decision to withdraw cover was taken outside Ireland. Insurance companies are still in business and have greatly increased charges for a reduced level of cover. No explanation was given for the decision to withdraw cover.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As aviation insurance is a worldwide business, Ireland has very little influence on the market. One group of insurers offers cover, but at a very high price. Insurance companies have not provided a security checklist. The Government indemnities will not be free. It is estimated that charges for all the airlines will amount to approximately &euro;1 million per month.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, there is an agreed framework document on Aer Lingus to which the Government, the company and the unions have signed up. The Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise welcome that document in terms of the importance of Aer Lingus, referred to by all speakers. The agreed framework will provide an opportunity for Aer Lingus to face the future with renewed confidence, which we all want. All that remains now is for the workforce to vote on these changes, which appear to be fundamental to the airline's survival and the retention of 4,000 jobs. I hope I have dealt with the queries raised by Senators and I thank them.</P>

      <P>On the question of insurance and liability, some Senators were critical of insurance <Col N="1699" /> companies. I hold no brief for them, but it is important to remember that all insurance companies have actuaries who determine the level of risk for the particular industry. The thinking is that if insurance companies were exposed to the level of risk prior to 11 September, the whole industry could be taken out with a repeat performance. This would result not only in the collapse worldwide of the aviation industry, but also the insurance industry. We might not appreciate that but we should at least acknowledge the thinking behind it. We must also acknowledge that the State's liability is limited to £9 billion, so it does not have an open cheque book.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the arrest of a person in the context of the legislation. One of our concerns about the extradition procedures is the safeguards in place in various jurisdictions in the context of arrests taking place. This section is silent on that matter with the exception of the statement that the suspect is to be informed of his or her alleged offences and so on. We would like an indication from the Minister of State regarding the safeguards in the legislation in this area because there is concern that no other EU member state has similar arrangements and there is a quite a disparity between jurisdictions in the way in which detainees are treated in terms of detention, interrogation and the judicial process.</P>
      <P>Our way of dealing with extradition is different from other countries. Many provisions in our legislation have been developed over the years to protect suspects in custody to a greater degree than is the case in a number of other jurisdictions.

      <P>The Senator is correct to seek to ensure people's rights are safeguarded. The same rights apply to detainees under this legislation as to all other persons in that a detainee is informed of his or her right to consult a solicitor and, in extradition proceedings, the Attorney General's scheme of legal aid is also available. However, a number of safeguards are provided in the legislation. Section 5 specifies the information to be provided to a detained person. Any waiver of rights is to be made before the High Court and must be shown <Col N="1701" /> to be have been made voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. The convention provides that the consent or renunciation may not be revoked but allows parties to opt out of this requirement by making a declaration to that effect on ratification. It is proposed that Ireland will make a declaration allowing revocations. Persons will not be extradited for the purpose of investigative detention and Ireland has a declaration in the new European arrest warrant to ensure its position.

      <P>Rights are being provided, not diluted. Sections 29(5) and 47(5) of the 1965 Act provide that no appeal shall lie against an order of the Circuit Court under this section. However, we are providing an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. The court will consider questions of incorrect interpretation in application of the law. Increased safeguards have been provided because cases will begin in the High Court, as the court of first instance, rather than in the District Court.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) An affidavit or statement sworn for the purposes of proceedings referred to in subsection (1) may not be relied upon by a party to those proceedings without leave of the High Court if another party to those proceedings has given notice of an intention to crossexamine the deponent and the first-<Col N="1702" /> mentioned party has failed to produce the deponent for cross-examination.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We seek to provide protection regarding evidence by affidavit whereby an affidavit or a sworn statement for the purpose of the proceedings may not be relied upon if there is an intention to cross-examine the deponent or where the first-mentioned party has failed to produce the deponent for cross-examination. We wish to insert a <i>caveat </i>in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>A new subsection has been inserted to provide for the taking of evidence by affidavit. It allows rather than requires evidence to be given. The following subsection provides for the High Court in the interest of justice to call cross-examination. In all cases, irrespective of who is requesting to cross-examine, the High Court will have the power to give it. The discretion has been provided in the interest of justice and in the belief that the courts will act in the interest of justice.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3 of the Constitution provides for the right to cross-examine. Provision is also made for the cross-examination of witnesses in the rules of the superior courts. The Bill allows for the discretion of the court to seek cross-examination and the Constitution also provides this protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. There are two full-time gardaí appointed to Newport Garda station, County Mayo, one of whom spent six days in the last two months in the station while the other was present for 12 days. The local community believes that the Garda presence has diminished substantially. People must travel to Westport and other larger centres to have Garda forms for passports and driving licences signed and for other services. The neighbourhood watch scheme no longer functions, especially in rural areas. There is no visible Garda presence which is seriously affecting the relationship between young people and the force. Local people believe that this is not in the long-term interests of law and order.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the station sergeant retired and no replacement was appointed. The two gardaí assigned to the station spend most of their time working in the bigger centres, particularly Westport, providing relief for gardaí stationed there. There are 20 gardaí and three sergeants in Westport. While I acknowledge this is necessary in a growing town, the town of Newport which has a population of 700 and district which has a population of about 2,500 are left without a service. While it is a town which has grown in size and stature, it does not have an adequate Garda presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of court cases and incidents in Newport illustrate the effects of the Garda <Col N="1704" /> absence. The area's chief superintendent and superintendent believe that the easiest way to address staffing levels in Westport is to take personnel away from Newport. However, it diminishes the Garda's importance in the eyes of local people and the protection it provides in the town. The Minister must ask the Commissioner to appoint a sergeant to Newport Garda station to ensure proper representation of gardaí, allow it to properly serve a growing community and be able to protect the local population, particularly the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for giving me this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the policing arrangements in Newport, County Mayo. As he will appreciate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the overall provision of resources for the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>In respect of overall resources provided for the Garda, the House will be well aware that since the Government took office the strength of the force has increased consistently. It has grown from 10,800 in 1997 to more than 11,750 today. Last year the Government approved proposals from the Minister for a Garda recruitment competition from which 500 applicants are being called. The competition will fulfil the commitment in the programme for government to increase the strength of the force to 12,000. The Minister recently approved the holding of a further competition early next year to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees. As I have said, recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up to an all-time high of 12,000 in 2002 and the recruitment of these additional 300 Garda trainees will ensure strength is maintained at that level.</P>
      <P>The commitment to a 12,000-strong force is a key priority for the Government. It a clear sign that it is delivering on its commitments to give the Garda the necessary resources to enforce the law, clamp down on anti-social behaviour and fight crime. Having delivered on that commitment, the Minister is determined to maintain Garda strength at this level. The new competition &ndash; the first in which there will be no height requirement &ndash; will be advertised early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as increasing the force's strength, additional financial resources have also been provided. The provision in the Garda Vote in 1997 was £457 million while next year's provision is over £722 million, a significant increase by any standards. Never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda and ensuring the number of personnel increases. Furthermore, we also had a <Col N="1705" /> major prison building programme to ensure those convicted of crime serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>On the question of Garda strength in Newport, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Newport Garda station is two gardaí. This has been the position for a number of years. Supervision of gardaí attached to Newport is carried out by sergeants attached to the district headquarters in Westport. Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements in place in Newport are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. Garda personnel assigned throughout the area, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided for the public.</P>
    <P>Garda management will continue to appraise policing and administrative strategy in Newport with a view to ensuring an effective service is maintained and when additional manpower next becomes available the Minister has been that assured that Newport's needs will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking on the matter I wish to raise, I am delighted that the height requirement for gardaí has been changed, a matter about which I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for years because Special Branch officers were obvious on account of their height and bulk. It was almost impossible for them to go about <i>incognito</i>.</P>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is of national importance. I want to keep the nation on its feet, as I am sure the Minister of State does. Some years ago the Minister for Health and Children established a committee to examine the statutory regulation of various paramedical professions. He subsequently produced a White Paper covering physiotherapists, speech and occupational therapists, and chiropodists or pediatrists as some are called. However, there has been a considerable delay in introducing regulations for the various groups concerned. The training of chiropodists varies from diploma or degree courses in the United Kingdom to correspondence courses.</P>
      <P>A dispute arose within the profession regarding the statutory basis and this led to a High Court case which is still awaiting a final settlement. That is the concern of the profession and the Department of Health and Children. My concern is that those involved in the dispute are unable to be registered to provide services for patients on the GMS list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a list of recognised chiropodists to whom these patients can go, but the list has been closed since January 2000 because of the dispute. This has led to many problems because some chiropodists have retired and others have died. The people who have taken over as replace<Col N="1706" /> ments in those practices are not eligible to be recognised for payment for GMS patients even though in all the cases that have come to my attention they are very well trained. This has resulted in a serious loss of service to the patients, particularly the elderly and those with systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes.</P>
    <P>I am the president of the Diabetic Federation of Ireland and I take a very active interest in the medical problems of diabetics. They can have serious foot problems and the maintenance of good foot hygiene and regular chiropody is extremely important for their health. Sixty per cent of the money spent on treating diabetes goes towards treating the complications of diabetes. Diabetic ulcers on the feet are a serious problem and require hospital admission. Hospital beds are taken up by cases which could have been treated at primary level.</P>
    <P>I was concerned that diabetes was not mentioned in the quality and fairness health strategy. There is an international plague of diabetes due to the increase in obesity and lack of exercise. I was pleased when I read the primary care document. Top of the list of proposed membership of primary care teams was chiropody. The Minister therefore recognises that chiropody is extremely important in primary health care. I suggest that it is also extremely important in secondary and tertiary health care because chiropody treatment will keep people out of hospital. Two years is a long time in a patient's life. I ask the Minister to outline his proposals to ensure that the places on the list are re-opened immediately. Too many patients have suffered in the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for putting the case for chiropodists so well. She has highlighted for us all the range and importance of the service they provide. This issue has a long history but hopefully not such a difficult future. I will outline the background to the issue and indicate how we intend to move forward.</P>
      <P>Until February 2000, the assessment of chiropodists wishing to work in the health service was carried out on behalf of the Minister by the chiropody assessment and advisory committee. This committee formed a panel and only those whose names appeared on this panel were eligible for employment in the public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An individual whose name the chiropody assessment and advisory committee declined to put on this panel brought a case to the High Court, contesting that the committee had denied him the opportunity to show that his combined qualification and experience gave him a competence equal to that of a chiropodist with a degree. Following negotiations, both sides agreed to a settlement under which the delegation to the chiropody assessment and advisory committee was withdrawn. Under the terms of this settlement, it was agreed to establish a revised mechan<Col N="1707" /> ism to deal with the assessment of chiropodists who wish to work in the health service.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has been working with the four organisations in Ireland representing chiropodists and podiatrists with a view to obtaining their agreement to this revised mechanism. As a first step, a proposal on the implementation of the High Court settlement was circulated to the professional bodies representing chiropodists in February this year. As there was no agreement among the professional bodies to the content of this proposal, an individual with considerable industrial relations expertise was subsequently commissioned by the Department to consult with the professional bodies to achieve a consensus among all concerned. Arising from these discussions, revised proposals and subsequent clarification have been circulated to the four chiropody organisations with a view to obtaining their agreement to a new assessment mechanism for chiropodists wishing to work in the public health service, but to date no agreement has been reached.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, I wish to inform the House of the proposals for the implementation of the High Court settlement. It involves the establishment of two committees, a criteria committee and an assessment committee. The remit of the criteria committee will be to advise on the criteria to apply for public health service employment of chiropodists, including those without a degree level qualification. The remit of the assessment committee will be to assess chiropodists for eligibility for public health service employment based on input and recommendations from the criteria committee. The proposed membership of these committees comprises nominees of the four professional bodies representing chiropody in Ireland, representatives of other relevant professions, an orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant endocrinologist, along with a consumer representative and an internationally recognised expert in chiropody. The Minister believes it necessary that there should be close interaction between the cri<Col N="1708" /> teria committee and the assessment committee so the same person will chair both committees. This will ensure that a formal line of communication is established between both committees.</P>
    <P>At present, there is no system of statutory registration for the chiropody profession in Ireland. However, the Department agreed the principles of a system of statutory registration with a number of professional bodies representing health and social care professions, including chiropodists, in November last year. The Department is currently finalising draft heads of a Bill and it is hoped to submit these heads to Government for approval early next year. It is anticipated that statutory registration will become operational within the next 18 months to two years. Although it is likely that the work of both the criteria committee and the assessment committee will have been completed within this timeframe, the activities of both committees will become defunct in the event of the system of statutory registration becoming operational.</P>
    <P>The Minister fully recognises that in the current circumstances the health boards are finding it increasingly difficult to ensure the adequate provision of chiropody and podiatry services, in particular to the elderly and those with diabetes under the GMS scheme. The Minister has asked me to assure the Senator and Members of the House that the Department is doing its utmost to resolve this current impasse. A first meeting of the criteria committee has now been scheduled for Monday, 21 January. The Minister hopes that all the professional bodies, in partnership with the other experts participating in the assessment mechanism, will play a full and constructive part in securing early progress in this matter, particularly in light of the pressing need for the services of chiropodists within the public health system.</P>
