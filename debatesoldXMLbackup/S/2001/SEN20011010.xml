      <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to take urgent action to ensure that the network of sub-post offices is maintained throughout the country and that the 12% increase in remuneration is paid immediately to postmasters and postmistresses.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the workers at the former GMX factory in Thurles, County Tipperary, receive the full redundancy payments due to them from the company.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to expedite payments to small and medium beef and dairy farmers under the national scheme of investment for control of farmyard pollution and the area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>As Leader of the House and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I express our sympathy on the sad death of Paddy McGrath, a former Member of the House, who passed away yesterday. He was a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1973 to 1977 and will be best remembered as one of the country's best known businessmen. <Col N="150" /> He was also a leading figure in the horseracing world and a director of a number of very well known national and international companies. He will be particularly remembered for his involvement in the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake, the hugely successful lottery which helped to fund many hospitals for many decades. However, it is in connection with Waterford Glass that he will be most remembered. Paddy McGrath became involved in the Waterford Glass Company during a time when the glass industry was dormant and was instrumental in Waterford Crystal becoming one of the world's most famous brand names. He was made a freeman of Waterford city and, among other honours, was a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great.</P>
      <P>On behalf of all Members of the House and on behalf of my party, I extend our sympathy to the late Mr. McGrath's wife, Anna, his sons, Paul, Patrick, Neil and Roderick, his daughter, Jane, and his beloved grandchildren, to all of whom we offer our deepest sympathy. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I extend deepest sympathy to Mrs. Anna McGrath and her children, Paul, Patrick, Neil, Jane and Roderick, on their sad loss. It was with great regret that I heard yesterday that Paddy McGrath had passed on. He was a Member of the House between 1973 and 1977. He will be best remembered as a very successful businessman. His father, the late Joseph McGrath, was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first Government of the State.</P>
      <P>Paddy McGrath will be remembered, in particular, for his work with the Irish Hospitals Trust, in which he succeeded his late father as chairman. It is important to recall that, when times were not so good, the Irish Hospitals Trust provided the necessary financial assistance to enable hospitals to function. If we compare it with the present national lottery, there was always a winner when the Hospitals Trust draw took place twice a year. It also gave employment to many, either on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
      <P>Paddy McGrath steered Waterford Glass, in its early years, towards the great worldwide brand of success which it has become. He was a very generous and charitable man who did a great deal of unseen work in relation to charities. In the early 1980s he donated Cabinteely House and Park to the then Dublin County Council and it was opened in 1981 by the then chairman, my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett. He was keenly involved in the racing industry and his familiar colours were carried to success on many tracks, in particular by Levmoss, the only horse to win both the Ascot Gold Cup and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the House and on behalf of my <Col N="151" /> own group, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Anna, his children and extended family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I came to know the late Senator Paddy McGrath only in more recent years through the Irish Management Institute. Accordingly, it was through his business connections that I got to know him and his wife, Anna. I know that the sympathy of all of us in the House will be extended to all his family. I was shocked to hear the news this morning. I met him regularly on social occasions. He had not been well in recent years but he always had flair and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>If there is a word one could use to describe Paddy McGrath it would be multifaceted because this man covered so much of Irish life over those active years. He had confidence in Ireland, in the people and in their talent. He was the one who made Waterford Crystal the success it became. He also had other involvement in business and in later years he became actively involved in leisure and sport. I was aware of, but not as up to date as Senator Cosgrave on, his horse racing activities. He was clearly very successful there.</P>
      <P>He was also a very charitable man and was recognised by the Pope, who made him a Knight Commander of St. Gregory, an honour he received because of the work he put into so many other aspects of Irish life. We in the business world will miss him, his family will certainly miss him and the friends he had over the years will miss this man who brought so much energy, enthusiasm and confidence to everything he did over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Paddy McGrath who was a Senator in this House. I did not know the man but knew him by reputation. His family was one of the first in this country to show world renowned entrepreneurial skills in terms of the hospital sweepstakes, Waterford Crystal and Wedgewood, at a time when there were very few substantial business people and entrepreneurs in this country. He made a major contribution to the racing industry. He had a great reputation worldwide. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer my sympathies to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join other Members in the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Paddy McGrath. The McGrath family made an enormous impression on the business, political and sporting life of this country. Paddy certainly left his own indelible mark in all those areas. I had the privilege of knowing his late brother, Joe, reasonably well as he lived close to me at home. The family was always very conscious of their obligations to the State and to society in general. It was Senator Cosgrave's father who nominated <Col N="152" /> Paddy McGrath to the Seanad in 1973. Apart from the racing connection, they had a house on the shores of Lough Corrib and that was another interest he had. To his wife, Anna, his family and colleagues, we extend our sympathy. May he rest in peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 2, statements on the UK Government's decision to approve a MOX plant at Sellafield, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Business is to conclude no later than 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the time limit on No. 2, I do not see why the Leader is confining it to 15 and ten minutes. I do not believe there will be many speakers and they should be given freedom to extend their remarks. Maybe he could change that to 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>Last week the Leader indicated to us that he will let us have today the schedule of Bills he hopes to introduce during this session. Perhaps he will revive the custom of providing the Opposition parties with a monthly schedule in advance of the legislation he proposes to take that month.This was the practice for a long time under his predecessor and during my time as Leader. It is a practice that would greatly facilitate the work of the Opposition parties in planning ahead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil that there will be ten extra pieces of legislation dealing with terrorism going to the Dáil in coming weeks, which may necessitate Monday and Friday sittings. What are the plans for this? Can the Leader <Col N="153" /> indicate what these ten Bills are? He could tell us tomorrow; I am not asking him to do so today. As we do not have much legislation at present, perhaps some of them could begin life in this House. The Leader does not need to look bemused; there is a very light schedule at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not argue about that as the record speaks for itself. I was offering to facilitate the House, but the Leader takes everything very personally. I do not know what is happening to him.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage of the Pensions Bill? Will the Leader indicate that the amendments on Committee Stage will not be, in effect, half a new Bill? The suggestion is that the Bill was only half ready when it was brought forward and that whole new sections will be brought forward under the guise of amendments. As a member of the Government's legislation committee, perhaps the Leader knows the answer. If not, can he find out for us by tomorrow, when we can expect Committee Stage of the Pensions Bill?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform us of the status of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in a truncated form and amended by this House before the end of the last session? I understand the Dáil must either accept or reject our amendments. Can the Leader give any indication as to the status of that Bill? It is a Bill about which many Senators care deeply.</P>
      <P>On the first day back I asked the Leader to facilitate a debate on Northern Ireland and I repeat that call today. Events there are in a dangerous phase, but the House has a right to debate them and express views as to what is happening. We have always done so in a responsible way and the House should at least have the opportunity that those on radio and television have, which is to debate what is happening in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the difference between the Government, the Opposition and the Independents with intent. I notice that the Leader has arranged for nice cut glass decanters of water to be placed in front of the Opposition and Government Front Benches. On behalf of the Labour Party &ndash; which would not like to make this claim for itself, being too humble &ndash; and the cross-benches, we would also appreciate the odd drink of water from the cut glass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Only that it was placed there during the Order of Business I would not have mentioned it.</P>
      <P>On a more serious note, I support the proposal made by Senator Manning regarding speakers in the MOX debate getting 20 minutes to be shared. We have had a long-standing tradition, since the present Leader took office and under the previous Leader, that we put times on debates in order for Senators to arrange their days. I suggest we start the MOX debate at a given time, either 6 p.m. or 40 minutes after the conclusion of No. 1, whichever is the earlier. Members are entitled to know this if they are waiting to speak.</P>
      <P>The happenings in Aer Lingus were raised last week on the Order of Business. I do not want to open up a debate on the Order of Business, but there are compelling reasons for a debate on the matter. The obvious question&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Senator's attention to No. 17, motion 27 on the Order Paper which relates to Aer Lingus. Any debate on that motion should not be pre-empted on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my understanding that the motion is due to be debated in the House. I would be happy to support such a motion in its current form from the Fine Gael Party or in another form but the issue should be debated in Government time as it is Government business. There are strategic reasons for debating this matter which does not merely relate to European directives, the airline industry or job losses. As an island nation dependent on channels of communication, we must view this issue somewhat differently from the rest of Europe. There are compelling reasons for an urgent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is addressing the merits of the matter, thereby pre-empting the debate on the motion. That is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling although I did not intend to pre-empt a debate. My motive was to outline to the Leader compelling reasons for a debate on Aer Lingus. The tourism industry, among others, will have an interest in such a debate. This is a multifaceted issue involving a high level of interdependency and we should view it with a political eye. We should attempt to change the minds of people in Europe rather than break European rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should note the appalling loss of life in Kabul in recent days when UN peacekeepers working in a mine clearance unit in an effort to make the earth a safer place were killed by bombs which were not precisely targeted. We <Col N="155" /> convey our sympathies to the UN. It is extraordinary in this day and age that bombs cannot be targeted in such a way as to safeguard innocent bystanders. We do not want innocent people killed in Afghanistan, be they Afghani people or people working with the UN and other agencies. We should make that clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Leader of the House responded to our request last week for a debate during Government time on the MOX plant in Sellafield. I invite him to respond in the same generous fashion to the request for a debate on the terrorist bombings in the United States on 11 September which have had a military, humanitarian and economic impact. Senator O'Toole referred to the need for military targets to be precise. Millions of people are in danger of starvation and our national airline is under serious threat. All these issues could be addressed in a single debate which, given the magnitude of this issue, should be held during Government time.</P>
      <P>A debate on Northern Ireland is also urgently required. Each time we rise to request such a debate, we are informed that the matter is too sensitive and should be postponed until some future date. Northern Ireland is always a sensitive issue but that should not prevent us addressing the subject. Given the current breakdown in the peace process, it would be worthwhile to explore the factors which have led to the current critical impasse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>A call was made last week for a debate on the seriously depressed price of beef cattle. It is appropriate to take this opportunity to acknowledge the reopening of the Egyptian market and to thank all concerned, including the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and others. This is an obvious reflection of what Egyptian technical experts think of the controls in use in this country. They were responsible for imposing a ban on all beef exported from European countries. The reopening of the Irish market reflects well on the quality of Irish beef and the standards that exist here.</P>
      <P>In light of this development, we should call on factories to pay a realistic price for beef cattle. We should also convey our congratulations to the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of today's events involving Aer Lingus and the difficulties the airline is facing in relation to its survival, would it be possible to take motion No. 27 tomorrow? I know that other Members, including Senator Taylor-Quinn, are anxious to contribute on that matter. I hope the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, will honour the commitments she has given in the past to retain stop-over status for <Col N="156" /> Shannon. This matter is of immediate importance and I request that the debate be taken tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in calling for a debate on the current world situation, particularly in light of Senator Manning's comments about proposals from the Government to introduce ten items of legislation of an anti-terrorism nature. In my opinion, it would be appropriate to introduce such legislation in this House because of its detachment and its concern for human rights. In light of current circumstances, we must strike a balance between human rights and the need to combat terrorism.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain if the Government proposes to bring before the Oireachtas its decision to grant permission, apparently of an unlimited nature, to American forces for overflights? This is a matter of particular concern and it should be debated because of recent indications that the Americans intend to expand the scope of their operations to take in countries such as, perhaps, Iraq. As somebody who voted against granting permission for such overflights during the period of the Gulf War, it is my view that the House should be consulted and I would like to know whether this will happen.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate whether we can have a debate on transport and whether the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, can come before the House for such a debate? It is important that the Minister should provide the House with an update on the circumstances surrounding Luas, particularly the underground element of the project, in view of the changed financial situation since she last made a statement to the House. Those of us who are interested in ensuring that part of the line runs underground would like reassurance that matters are still on track. I also support calls for a debate on Aer Lingus in order that I may give my wholehearted support to our national carrier.</P>

      <P>I support calls for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come before the House for a debate on Aer Lingus. It is important that such a debate should take place either today or tomorrow, particularly in light of the proposal relating to a reduction of 68 in the number of flights going through Shannon Airport. I ask the Leader to give this matter urgent attention and to accommodate us with a debate today or tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The other issue I wish to raise relates to the Lindsay tribunal. I hope the Leader will urge the Minister for Health and Children to introduce legislation to expand the terms of reference of that tribunal to include pharmaceutical companies. The evidence shown on RTE earlier this week was appalling and, in fairness to the deceased and their relatives, deserves immediate attention.</P>

      <P>All Members have rightly expressed abhorrence at what happened in America on 11 September and we have extended our heartfelt sympathy and support to the United States with which Ireland has very close ties. However, it also behoves each independent legislator to participate in ongoing debate on events as they unfold. The House should set an example in this regard. We all have worries about civilian casualties, but, above all else, about the humanitarian issues involved. We have been warned by all the aid agencies that there may be a humanitarian crisis greater than any witnessed previously. There should, therefore, be ongoing debate in the House because this matter is so serious.</P>

      <P>When will road traffic legislation dealing with accident rates be introduced? Will it happen during this session? There have been some horrific deaths on our roads in recent times. Figures published recently show that while the number of deaths on our roads has reduced compared to previous years, we have one of the worst records in this area in Europe. Ireland does not have a penalty points system. However, this system has been introduced in practically every other country in Europe and had an amazing effect on the behaviour of motorists. The Minister intends to introduce such a system. Will he do so during this session? The system is a weapon to effectively reduce road deaths, but has not been introduced. We should not wait any longer and if there is a delay in its introduction, we should be informed. I hope the Leader will inform the House that it is planned to introduce legislation in this regard during this session.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Callanan's call for a debate on the agriculture industry. I welcome the recent announcement regarding the reopening of the live cattle trade with Egypt. It is an opportune time for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to come to the House to outline the work done by his Department to protect the industry, which has faced severe difficulties as a result of BSE and foot and mouth disease.

      <P>With the agreement of the House, I propose a sos for 45 minutes between No. 1 and No. 2. The principal spokespersons will have 20 minutes on No. 2.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole referred to the MOX plant at Sellafield. It is interesting to note that 11 Senators called for a debate on this issue on the Order of Business last week. I have responded to their concerns and look forward to their contributions this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Manning's point about legislation, there are ten pieces of legislation with which we must deal. I will inform the House at <Col N="159" /> the end of my reply about the proposed legislation for the coming session. Senator Manning mentioned the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, which I understand is due back in the House in two weeks time. The Senator also inquired about the progress of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. It is before the other House where I hope it will be concluded this week.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning and Costello called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I do not have any difficulty arranging such a debate, which I hope will take place at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello, Jackman and Taylor-Quinn called for a debate on Aer Lingus. I am endeavouring to have such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Norris and Ó Murchú expressed their views on the US air attacks which happened on 11 September and the war in Afghanistan. As the House is aware, following requests on the Order of Business last week I got agreement for such a debate to take place next Wednesday from 3 p.m. until 6 p.m. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will be present. Senator Norris expressed his views about the stop-over. I understand the stopover by American airforce personnel is covered by a United Nations resolution.</P>
    <P>Senators Callanan and Chambers strongly congratulated the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on getting the Egyptian beef market reopened at a critical time of the year. I will pass on Senator Norris's views to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and others called for the Lindsay tribunal to extend its terms of reference. Any of us who saw the television programme the other night must agree with those sentiments. I know the Taoiseach is taking an interest in this issue and was working hard yesterday with the Government and the Minister in charge of this area. I expect an announcement will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Coghlan's views on planning problems to the Minister. Senator O'Dowd called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on toll roads. I do not have any difficulty making time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett mentioned the sentencing of a person and Senator Quinn raised the issue of an inquiry. I will find out the answers to the questions the Senators raised.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation for the coming term is the Heritage Fund Bill, 2001; Family Support Agency Bill, 2001; Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001; Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001; State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Bill, 2001; Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill, 2001; Road Traffic Bill, 2001; Private Security Services Bill, 2001. In December we will have the Social <Col N="160" /> Welfare (No. 2) Bill; Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001; Appropriation Bill, 2001, and the Interpretation Bill, 2000. That is the proposed list of legislation for both Houses but, as Senator Manning has said, any issue required for security matters will also come before us. I welcome the opportunity to deal with such legislation. This is our third sitting day in this session and today the third Bill of this session will be initiated here. That augurs well for the House and for the importance of the business that is being conducted here. Long may it continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 16, to delete &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have to confess to a life-long aversion to the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; because it is such a vague term. I have often argued that we should replace it with the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo;. What is happening here, however, is different. The term &ldquo;customer&rdquo; is being used in this Bill and I applaud it, but in this section &ldquo;customer&rdquo; is being defined as a consumer. There are a number of reasons against proceeding in that way and I wish to argue them through. One is that the term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill. The legislation defines the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and states that a customer is a consumer, yet it does not define what is a consumer.</P>
      <P>More importantly, there is an error in the level of generality that is employed. It is not good grammar to define a term with a term of the same level of generality, once one has looked to a higher level for the appropriate term. In this case, I submit that the appropriate term at the appropriate level of generality is the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;. The fact that a customer could be a company rather than an individual does not affect the issue because conventionally the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; covers individuals and what are called legal persons. The instance of a company as a customer sits better with the concept of &ldquo;person&rdquo; than it does with the concept of &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If one uses the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and then defines what a customer is by saying it is a consumer, one must also define the term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and we will get into terminology that is difficult. That problem could be solved if we said &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the knowledge that if it is a legal person a company would be covered by that term. This amendment improves the meaning and intention of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoir<Col N="161" /> ligh, and Senators for agreeing to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, today. Senator Quinn's contribution was thought-provoking. His proposal is to amend the definition of the phrase &ldquo;final customer&rdquo; by substituting the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; for &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; has been used in this instance to mirror the definition used in EU Directive 98/30 which deals with the internal market in the natural gas sector. For reasons of consistency of language my preference is to retain the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;final customer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I will not press the amendment at this stage. However, I received the same answer when I suggested that the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; fits uneasily and that it is being used in European terms. I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter before Report Stage to see if he understands the point I am making. The word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; is not the correct word, particularly when it means &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. Apart from anything else, it is bad English to define &ldquo;customer&rdquo; as &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and then not explain what is meant by &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. This issue can be resolved by using the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. I will not push this issue, but perhaps the Minister of State will consider it before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 29 to 31 and substitute the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;shipping' in relation to natural gas, means the introduction into, the conveyance by means of, or take off from the natural gas system of natural gas by persons other than the operator of the relevant pipeline or facility being used for the purpose of introducing, conveying or taking off the natural gas;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to expand the definition of &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; which is a specific type of supply activity in the natural gas market. Shippers provide a service to customers whereby they arrange for the transport of gas through the system on a customer's behalf. The amendment seeks to clarify that the term &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; does not include the activities of the operator of the pipeline or other facility used to transport the natural gas on behalf of the shipper.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 2, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 18, after &ldquo;day&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, not later than three months after the passage of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to inject some sense of urgency into the Bill. On Second Stage I made the point that it is late in the day to introduce an interim arrangement for the regulation of the gas industry given the amount of time which has passed since the other regulators were established and the period of over three years, if I remember correctly, which has elapsed since the passing of the relevant EU directive.</P>
      <P>This being so, I am anxious to avoid further delay such as a situation in which the Bill is passed into law but those responsible for its implementation drag their feet in terms of putting it into effect. Realistically this Bill is likely to be enacted in the immediate run-up to a general election. It is an unfortunate, but unavoidable, fact of life that the period immediately before an election is one in which the machinery of Government tends to grind to a halt. If the business of forming a new Government is prolonged this stoppage continues. This is especially so if the election is followed immediately by a summer period &ndash; which is likely to be the case on this occasion. In the worst case scenario, we could see this Bill being passed into law and then sitting for six months or more before being implemented. This amendment would put everybody on notice that a more urgent approach is needed in this case. That is why I am suggesting a limit of three months for bringing it into operation.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Senator's desire to ensure that the transfer of functions to the commission takes place within a realistic timescale. I share his desire, indeed his resolve, that that will happen. I can assure him that I will make the order appointing a day as soon as possible after enactment. However, before I sign the order under this section, I have a responsibility as Minister to ensure that the commission is appropriately and adequately prepared to undertake the additional functions which are proposed in this Act. While I would expect that this should occur within three months of the passing of the Act, I cannot agree to the inclusion of such a timescale in the legislation that would limit my discretion on this issue in this way.</P>
      <P>I reassure the Senator of the air of urgency on this matter that I articulated at my parliamentary party meeting this morning. The liberalisation of the gas market is part of the programme for Government. That of itself is a factor which brings a particular air of urgency to this. I concur with the need for urgency which the Senator has articulated. While keeping the level of discretion that I need in deference to the CER and other aspects, this will happen.</P>

      <P>I suppose I know what the Minister is saying and I know he does not want to be tied down to a three month restriction, but it is exactly the terms that he used that worries me. He wants to make sure everything is prepared. What happens in life &ndash; it certainly happens in business and in Government &ndash; is that there are priorities. Sometimes the long finger grows longer and longer. I am not going to press this but I would like to find some way whereby the Minister's intention is actually enforced. I suggested that we make it part of the Bill to enforce this in three months. In the light of what the Minister is saying I am not going to push that. I know his intention, but priorities do not always stay as priorities and other priorities take their place. I reluctantly withdraw the amendment because I know the Minister's heart is in the right place, but matters are not always in his own hands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 23, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in the interests of the final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment aims to assist the Commission for Energy Regulation in making the underlying motivation behind its remit a little clearer. We must remember that legislation such as this is used on a day-to-day basis by the regulators in deciding when and how they should act. In this case I want to make it very clear to the commission why it is being asked to promote competition.</P>
      <P>I applaud the fact that the Minister saw fit to include a competition proviso in this Bill. I remember arguing at length, unfortunately without success, to have a simple provision put into the telecom regulator's remit. I did not succeed and I am delighted that the Minister has done it on this occasion. Having taken this welcome step we need to go further and to make it very clear to the commission that our interest in competition is not an end in itself, but is a means to an end and that end is in the interests of the final customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing beneficial about competition on its own. Most think that business people believe competition is the Holy Grail. However, the value of competition lies in the final end it achieves. To set up competition as a god in itself, as this Bill in its present form does, amounts to being driven by ideology rather than practicality. It opens up the possibility that the commission will be forced to act in a way that ultimately is not in the interests of the customer. To avoid doubt and make life easier for the commission we, the legislators, should make it very clear to it <Col N="164" /> that what lies behind the emphasis on competition in the Bill is the interests of the customer.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained my point. If we leave competition in its present form and do not stress that it is &ldquo;in the interests of the final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be&rdquo;, we virtually tie the hands of the commission by making a god of competition when we should be stating that we are promoting competition in the interests of the final customer. The Minister of State should take this into account and accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I understand the sentiment behind the proposed amendment. I point out that a duty on the commission to protect &ldquo;the interests of final customers for electricity or gas or both&rdquo; is already provided for under the amendment to section 9(3) of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as proposed in section 6(<i>b</i>) of the Bill. As such, the amendment may entail repetition. Section 6(<i>b</i>) states:</P>
      <P>(3)&nbsp;It shall be the duty of the Minister and the Commission to carry out their functions and exercise the powers conferred on them under this Act in a manner which&ndash;</P>
      <P>. . . . . (<i>b</i>)&nbsp;in relation to gas, does not discriminate unfairly between holders of licences, consents and Bórd Gáis Éireann or between applicants for consents or licences, and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;the Minister or the Commission, as the case may be, considers protects the interests of final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the Senator is, therefore, incorporated in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State's point that this area is covered by the legislation, but the amendment reinforces it. The substitution of paragraph (<i>a</i>) by the following paragraph: &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to promote competition in the generation and supply of electricity and in the supply of natural gas in accordance with this Act&rdquo; suggests there is something holy about competition. Adding the phrase, &ldquo;in the interests of the final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be,&rdquo; strengthens that paragraph no end.</P>
      <P>The phrase, &ldquo;considers protects the interests of final customers&rdquo;, in paragraph 6(<i>b</i>), which the Minister of State just quoted, is a long way from stating that competition should be &ldquo;in the interests of the customer.&rdquo;  I am referring not just to protecting customers, but also to using competition in the interests of the customer. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I trust that as Committee Stage progresses we will be able to be more co-operative in other areas. These amendments deal with the imposition of additional duties on the commission in the areas of safety and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which I propose, seek to extend the existing duty of the commission to promote safety and efficiency on the part of electricity undertakings to cover natural gas undertakings also. These two amendments deal fully with the issues raised by Senator Quinn in relation to safety in amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and the issue of efficiency raised by Senator Caffrey in amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>On efficiency in the wider energy context, I point out to Senator Caffrey the role of the Irish Energy Centre in promoting energy efficiency among industrial and domestic energy users in Ireland. The Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001, which was before this House recently, aims to establish the centre on a legislative footing with clear responsibilities for energy efficiency, and giving similar responsibility to the commission would merely lead to confusion. On this basis I propose that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 be accepted as they cover the position. Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are not required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has put forward amendments Nos. 5 and 6. My two amendments are the first of a number of amendments that are intended to emphasise the issue of public safety &ndash; I stress public safety &ndash; in this Bill. The events of 11 September in the United States brought home to all of us that we have moved into a new and more terrifying era &ndash; it is not the same world any more particularly where terrorism is concerned. Public utilities will be in the front line in this new era. We have heard about concerns in Britain regarding Sellafield and we will be discussing that tonight. I am talking about public buildings, transport facilities, electricity, gas and water networks. From now on, it is only prudent that we regard these vital parts of our infrastructure as being open to attack from terrorists in a way that we would not have even thought of last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" />Accordingly, in creating a legislative framework for any of this infrastructure we must make it clear to those who are charged with the regulation and operation of these facilities that the issue of public safety is not only part of their remit but that it should be in the forefront of their minds when they make decisions. We should spell out the issue of public safety in this Bill. I am not referring to technical issues of safety which are adequately catered for in this Bill. What I have in mind is the threat to public safety that can arise from a deliberate attack on some aspect of the gas or electricity network.</P>
    <P>We must make it very clear that the responsibility of the regulators and the operators extends to these matters. I would not have thought of these amendments four or five weeks ago but since 11 September we must consider these matters. The terms used by the Minister do not provide for the effect that I have in mind. I am talking about public safety following the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The onus of responsibility should be on the commission and I urge the Minister to give consideration to what I say because this is a different situation from that one month ago.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn's amendment has covered what I intended with my amendment.

In accepting later amendments on public safety I believe his fears for public safety will be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey raised the issue of energy conservation and energy efficiency. This is a very important issue not least because of our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Government has recognised this and has already embarked on giving a statutory basis to the Irish Energy Centre and beefing it up. It will be given the funding to spearhead that whole area. This is the role which will be allocated to the reconstituted Irish Energy Centre.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to allow persons, in addition to BGE, to become involved in the supply of gas in towns and to be granted third party access rights in that capacity. Amendment No. 45 expands the existing amendments to the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987 proposed in section 19 of the published Bill, to take account of the proposals to allow the commission to make an order under section 2(1) of that Act conferring on persons, in addition to Bord Gáis Éireann, the functions of a &lsquo;town gas' company.</P>
      <P>The 1987 Act was introduced following the demise of the original town gas companies, such as the Cork Gas Company and the Alliance and Dublin Gas Company. To date, BGE has been granted the sole power to operate in place of these town gas companies. The proposal to introduce competition into this area is based on the following reasons:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the proposed extension of the natural gas network currently being undertaken by BGE will bring gas to many areas of population not previously supplied by the network. This development presents an important opportunity for the introduction of competition into this area of the market and, by presenting opportunities to new market entrants, should encourage the growth of competition throughout the whole gas market. Second, my proposals to reduce the consumption threshold for eligibility for third party access rights to zero by 2005 to allow for full competition in the natural gas sector requires a mechanism to be put in place so that the commission may <Col N="168" /> effectively regulate the domestic supply market. The framework established under the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987 provides an effective interim solution for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Among the changes being proposed to the 1987 Act by this amendment are the proposal to allow the commission to grant an order to any person, including BGE, to operate as a town gas company; the granting of the power to the commission to regulate the pricing policy of any person operating as such a company and the granting of the power to the commission to conduct a competitive process for the selection of a suitable person on whom to confer town gas functions in regard to a particular geographic area, where the commission considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments being taken with amendment No. 45 are being put forward to ensure that persons who are the subject of an order made by the commission under the 1987 Act may avail of third party access (TPA) rights under section l0(a) of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended by this Bill under section 11. The granting of TPA rights to such persons is a prerequisite for any person, including BGE, to be able to source their own gas for the purposes of operating as a &lsquo;town gas' company.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 24, I am proposing to expand the exemption from the eligibility threshold for TPA rights, that currently covers operators of gas fired generating stations and small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) plants, to include persons operating as &lsquo;town gas' companies. This recognises the fact that, within its first period of operation, while such a company is building its customer base, it would be unreasonable to expect it to attain the minimum consumption threshold which is required to avail of third party access rights. I propose, therefore, that amendments Nos. 10, 23 to 25, inclusive, 30, 34 and 45 be accepted.</P>

      <P>My concern in this regard reflects a criticism which was voiced on the Order of Business by Senator O'Toole, who suggested that, while we are very happy to have the Bill initiated in this House, it was introduced before it was quite ready. The introduction of such a list of amendments so soon after Second Stage does suggest a criticism of the preparedness of this Bill &ndash; that the homework was not done ahead of time. I hope the Minister can put my mind at rest in that regard.</P>

      <P>Yes, I believe I can put the Senator's mind at rest. In the preparation of this very important Bill, there was wide consultation. After it was drafted, there was further wide consultation and it has been very comprehensively examined at this stage to ensure that the aims of the Bill are fully comprehensive. Hopefully, when the Bill has completed its passage through this House and the other House, we will have a very adequate and comprehensive piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept entirely what the Minister has said and, of course, that is what we all hope. In voicing my criticism, I would feel happier if some of these amendments came about as a result of things said on Second Stage. The fact that this Bill was introduced last Wednesday, and now we have this list of amendments a week later, suggests that something happened in that week. Perhaps the eloquence of this House convinced the Minister to make all these changes, but I am not sure that these particular points featured greatly on Second Stage. I would hate to think this Bill was rushed in and that amendments were being cobbled together within one week. Perhaps it is just my suspicious mind at work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 29 to 32.</P>
      <P>The acceptance of amendment No. 10 will entail the consequent deletion of subsection (5). Section 8(3)(i) states that the board shall have power &ldquo;to subscribe or guarantee money for charitable or benevolent objects, or for any institution or for any public general or useful object&rdquo;. I never heard anything like that before. I totally disagree with this provision. I take the view that subscribing money for charitable or benevolent purposes should not be within the remit of any State body, except a body that is specifically set up for that purpose. When the State contributes to charitable or other causes, it should do it openly and transparently. I see no good reason whatsoever to necessitate the laundering of such contributions through the medium of a State body. This is a most unusual provision. I cannot remember seeing a provision like this ever before. I challenge the Minister to cite precedents. Even if they exist &ndash; and it may well be that they do &ndash; I argue that they are very bad precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" />The real problem with this sub-paragraph is not that it applies to charitable and benevolent causes, but that it also extends to everything else as well. The board is also empowered to subscribe or guarantee money &ldquo;to or for any institution&rdquo;&ndash; note &ldquo;any institution&rdquo;&ndash; or &ldquo;for any public general or useful object&rdquo;. This provision is open to abuse. Have we forgotten the instances that were uncovered of State companies subscribing generously to golf outings of political parties? Such contributions clearly fall within this provision. There is no way to rewrite this provision to avoid such abuse.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I have no objection whatsoever to companies, whether State bodies or otherwise, making contributions in pursuit of their marketing objectives. That is expenditure carried out in pursuit of the company's fundamental commercial purpose and it does not need special or separate authorisation. This provision authorises payments made that have nothing to do with the organisation's commercial purpose. In the case of State companies, such payments should not be made. To facilitate them in legislation is to open the door to abuse and corruption. We should strike this subparagraph from the Bill and, with it, subsection (5) which is consequential on it. I would like to hear the Minister's defence of this. I would prefer if he said it had been thought through and that he would accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 8(3)(i) of the Gas Act, 1976, provides that the board of Bord Gáis Éireann may make subscriptions for charitable, benevolent and other public, general or useful purposes. In other words, this provision already exists in the Gas Act, 1976. This provision is subject to subsection (5) of the same section which requires that any subscription over a certain amount must be identified with the purpose for which it is given in the company's annual accounts. It is good that public companies are allowed within reason to make subscriptions of this nature which include those to charitable or benevolent institutions. Subsection (5) which requires subscriptions over a certain amount to be specified in the company's annual accounts is a necessary balancing mechanism ensuring that such donations or subscriptions are open to public scrutiny. It is also a useful mechanism for ensuring that the actions of the board in this regard are reasonable.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the provision already exists in the Gas Act and this is merely being repeated here for the sake of clarity. Incidentally, in regard to subsection (5), the figure beyond which must be specified in the company's annual accounts is the small figure of &euro;2,000.</P>

Will the Minister <Col N="171" /> tell me it is not possible to do that?

      <P>These amendments seek to amend the existing section 40(A)(7) of the Gas Act, 1976, to take account of the fact that Ireland has ratified the so-called Espoo or Transboundary Convention. The convention applies to situations where proposed pipeline projects are likely to have significant effects on the environment of the state which is party to the convention. The revised subsection (7) is set out in full in the amendment for the purposes of clarification. However, the actual changes to the text proposed are minimal and consist only of the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;a state which is party to the Transboundary Convention&rdquo;, with related phrases, into the body of the original text where this is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Transboundary Convention was drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. While the provisions of the convention mirror the requirements under the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, it offers enhanced consultation procedures allowing states affected by developments to have their concerns reflected in any decision made on such developments.

      <P>This amendment proposes additional new power to the commission regarding the provision of pipelines. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides that the commission, where it considers it necessary or where directed by the Minister, shall conduct a competitive process for granting consent for the building of a particular pipeline. This amendment is aimed at a number of different situations.</P>
      <P>In cases where the commission receives one or more applications for the building of a particular pipeline in a particular area or is aware that others may be aware of building such a pipeline, the commission will have the power to hold a competitive process to ensure that the most efficient and economically viable proposal wins out at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>Second, where the commission perceives there is a market opportunity for the building of a pipeline in a particular area or for a particular purpose, in this case the commission can use the mechanism of a competitive process to alert the market of the potential opportunity and seek expressions of interest in building the pipeline.</P>
      <P>Third, where the Minister or the Government seeks to arrange for the provision of natural gas to a previously unsupplied area, for example, the provision of gas to the northwest, the Minister may request the commission to initiate a competitive process to choose the best person to construct the necessary pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides the power to the commission to make regulations regarding the holding of such a process, thereby ensuring transparency for all participants. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) seeks to allow the commission to carry out whatever preliminary investigations in relation to the proposed pipeline that it considers necessary prior to the holding of a competition and paragraph (<i>d</i>) allows the commission to decide not to grant a <Col N="176" /> consent to any applicant where it considers none is suitable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;publish,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including publication by electronic means&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put forward in the spirit of the Government's declared policy on e-government, with which I wholeheartedly agree and enthusiastically support. For over a year I have been monitoring almost all new legislation that comes before the House from the perspective of the Government's own policy on e-government and I have reminded Ministers that the coming of the Internet requires us to take a new approach to what publication means in legislative terms. This would not have mattered three or four years ago, even two years ago, but there has been a dramatic change.</P>
      <P>The reason we should require &ndash; and I use the word &ldquo;require&rdquo;&ndash; publication by electronic means, which I am advised is the drafting term to be used for publication on the world wide web or Internet, is that it is a way of making information accessible to a far greater number of people than by any other means. Making information immediately accessible is the real benefit. We have not yet reached the stage where publication on the Internet will be enough on its own to reach everybody but we have long passed the point where we can ignore that medium as a way of releasing information to the public.</P>
      <P>One advantage of electronic publication is that there are easy methods of updating it. That is particularly relevant to the information referred to in this section. To avoid misunderstanding, I stress that this is not merely an enabling amendment, empowering the publication of the information electronically, as such an amendment would not be necessary; there is nothing to stop anyone from doing so. The point of the amendment is to require electronic publication and the basic reason for requiring such publication is to enhance the level of accountability in matters such as this. The Internet is used for many purposes but one important aspect of its potential is the way it can bring everyone information quickly and at very little expense which would otherwise be much more difficult to access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" />I said earlier I had been making this argument in respect of new legislation for some time and for the most part I am pleased that Ministers have accepted my point and my amendments. I hope it will not be too long before that message gets through to the parliamentary counsel who actually draft the Bills, so they incorporate the requirement for electronic publication in every new Bill as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>When I proposed this a couple of times last year I made the case about the logic of information being required. Someone in Donegal might in the past have had to come all the way to Dublin and go in somewhere to see a proposal. I know such matters might have been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but this would enable people to do so from their own home. It is not an enabling provision but a provision which insists that this should be by electronic means, as most information is now being provided in multiple ways and the old ways are not enough any more. I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Senator's enthusiasm for electronic publication but I am loth to regulate the activities of the commission to the detailed level which the Senator is seeking. In the case of publication of codes of operations and gas capacity statements, it is a matter for the commission to decide how best this should happen, taking account of its relevant duties. In the case of audited accounts of gas undertakings, the provisions in section 14 are sufficient.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn's proposal, which seeks to impose an additional publication requirement on natural gas undertakings &ndash; this is a potent point &ndash; would only serve to discriminate against players in the gas industry in comparison with other sectors of the economy. I do not know if the Senator's persuasive powers succeeded with legislation in the economic or commercial area but consistency in the commercial and business sector is important and I would not like to see discrimination against the gas industry in comparison with other sectors of the economy.</P>

A significant number of people now obtain information by electronic means and all legislation passing through this House should be published in that format. I made this proposal a number of times during the previous session and was successful on occasion. Although I cannot recall the detail of the proposals, I will obtain them and forward them to the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to foresee a scenario in which electronic communication will not be insisted upon in the future. Electronic communication is a common and normal means of communication and I cannot believe that Bills will only be published in print. All legislation should be published in electronic format. I cannot believe the Minister <Col N="178" /> of State's comment that this proposal discriminates against the gas industry as we will insist on all legislation and accounts being published in this format. It is unacceptable to think that we can avoid publishing legislation electronically and the Minister of State is living in a fairy tale land if he believes this to be the case.

      <P>These amendments deal with agreements between an applicant for third party access rights and the relevant pipeline operator in regard to the ownership of the proposed connection to the operator's pipeline. It has been pointed out in submissions received on the Bill that the ownership of such connections is, in the first instance, a matter for agreement between the relevant operator and the applicant. The provision allowing the commission to specify in regulation terms and conditions which may be contained in such an agreement is, therefore, inappropriate and likely to create confusion. This provision is being deleted by the proposed amendment No. 27.

      <P>Amendment No. 31 seeks to amend the revised section 11 of the Gas Act, 1976 set out in section 12 of the Bill. The amendment proposes, through the insertion of a new subsection (2), the transfer to the commission of the Minister's powers over the charges made or proposed by BGE to those customers who, for the time being, are not eligible to avail of the third party access rights under section 10A of the 1976 Act. It is considered necessary to transfer these powers to ensure there is consistency in the regulation of all charges and tariffs related to natural gas. The establishment of the commission as the sole regulatory body with the power to oversee this area will help to ensure the required consistency is achieved.</P>

      <P>In view of what happened with Eircom, we have reached a stage where disadvantaged areas are being left out when semi-State companies are being hived off. It appears that commercial viability is the sole criterion considered in terms of extending services to rural areas and areas where normal commercial criteria would not warrant such a move. I refer specifically to Knock Airport, where a public service obligation contract gives the people of the north west access to an air service to Dublin. If this was based solely on commercial criteria, there would be no such air service. By including the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in section 17, we are ensuring disadvantaged areas throughout the country will become more disadvantaged and that the services they should be given will not be extended to them because of the current emphasis on the need for commercial viability. I am sure the Minister of State will give serious consideration to this amendment.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I recognise from where Senator Caffrey is coming. However, I have made it clear on previous occasions that I do not favour assisting the development of uncommercial extensions to the gas network by means of an increase in tariffs or, as the Senator proposes, the imposition of a public service levy on natural gas undertakings. The net effect in either case would be the same. It would mean the imposition of an additional burden on existing gas consumers and have a detrimental effect on national competitiveness. Where funding for such uncommercial extensions is to be made available, it must be done in an open and transparent way. A public service obligation is not an appropriate mechanism in such circumstances. For those reasons, I regret that I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

      <P>I believe the Senator is <i>au fait</i> with the Government's plans to extend the natural gas infrastructure to the north west. The proposal to extend the network to the north west does not involve a public service obligation. Meritorious cases such as that to which the Senator refers can be dealt with, openly and transparently, in other ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sympathetic to the principle Senator Caffrey is espousing. In view of the migration of people from isolated rural areas, there is no doubt that these communities will, at least in the short to medium term, suffer disadvantage. There are merits in the case put forward by the Senator and if I were representing his constituency, I would be pushing that case as forcefully as he is attempting to do.</P>
      <P>Issues such as this must be examined in the long-term. Given the evolution of competition in the semi-State sector and the rapid changes in markets in Ireland and elsewhere it would be a significantly retrograde step to go down the road of imposing public service obligations again. I have contradicted my original comments but, while I am very sympathetic to the strong principle espoused by Senator Caffrey in terms of addressing depopulation in rural areas, going down that road could establish a precedent that would lead to a number of retrospective claims and this would not be in the interests of fast-tracking the comprehensive development of the gas network .</P>
      <P>The proposed extensions are meritorious and laudable and need to be accelerated. However, there are isolated communities which can be reached by the existing network but it is not commercially viable. Such communities could make a strong claim. On balance the greater good is serviced by accelerating the development of the network and I support the Minister of State on that basis.</P>

This section relates to the construction, maintenance and repair of pipelines. The Minister's power relates to the settlement of certain disputes that might arise between a person laying a pipeline and a local authority and given the Bill's proposals to transfer this area to the commission's area of responsibility in respect of distribution and transmission pipelines the powers under section 27 should also be transferred to the same extent.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose the transfer of all the Minister's powers under section 2 of the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, to the commission. These powers relate to town gas functions. The draft legislation proposed to transfer these powers only to the extent that they relate to the provision and maintenance of distribution and transmission pipelines. The proposal would have led to a complicated arrangement whereby both the commission and the Minister would have had to make orders to confer different functions on a person wishing to operate as a town gas company. Such a complicated system is likely to lead to inconsistent regulatory approaches being taken and this could hinder the development of the market and adversely affect investor confidence in this area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 29 to 32.</P>
      <P>I am tabling this amendment again because the Minister of State might, to use his own words, reflect on it in view of my strong views. I hope, having had time to reflect, he will accept it. I remind everyone of the concern I have. Section 8(3)(<i>i</i>) which I wish to have deleted states:</P>
      <P>subject to subsection (5) of this section, [which deals with the functions of Bord Gáis Éireann] subscribe or guarantee money for charitable or benevolent objects or to or for any institution or for any public, general or useful object. . . </P>
      <P>Subscribing money for charitable or benevolent purposes should not be the function of a State body, other than State bodies specifically established for that purpose. It is not the function of do-gooders, as we have often seen before, to make charitable donations, and it should not be the function of a State body to use taxpayer's money to do so. My real concern is that this is so wide open, it could enable a Bord Gáis sub-board to make political donations in the future. Yes, they are limited by subsection (5), but I am talking about something such as the proceeds of two golf classics being given to a political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in business is inundated with requests to make political subscriptions, but this provision is far too open. We are also inundated with requests to make charitable donations, but this is State money. I am not being a scrooge, but it should never be the function of a State board to use taxpayers' money for its own favourite charities, causes or political parties. If it is done for commercial, market reasons &ndash; in other words, if they decide to sponsor something &ndash; that is all right. It is being done for clearly spon<Col N="191" /> sored commercial reasons with a good commercial objective behind it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment. This is bad law and I have never seen it before. The Minister of State said it is already in the functions of An Bord Gáis, but we should not reinstate it in the functions in this legislation. The Minister of State agreed to reflect on this case and I hope he has had time to do so. No State board should use taxpayers' money to make donations to its favoured hobbies or charities, and certainly not to its favoured political parties. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Senator Quinn said, both on this occasion and in the course of the earlier debate. Political donations are certainly not envisaged in this case. The Senator made some compelling points, both now and earlier. I undertook to reflect on the points he made, and I meant that. I will need some more time to reflect and, in particular, to establish the implications of the proposed amendment. I undertake to do so in the context of the Bill going forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the word &ldquo;reflect&rdquo; meant reflect in this House. Normally, I would vehemently disagree with legislation that is rushed through Committee and Report Stages, although we accepted it on this occasion. I assume the whole purpose of having a separate Report Stage debate is to enable the Minister of State to reflect on points made on Committee Stage. In this case, the House agreed to take Report Stage immediately after Committee Stage. I appreciate Senator Liam Fitzgerald's agreement to a five minute sos to make sure we had time to reflect. However, if the Minister of State is saying he will reflect upon and consider the matter when the Bill goes to the Lower <Col N="192" /> House, that is not good enough. I think that is what he means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I mean, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but that is not good enough. I really feel strongly on this point. I do not know of any other State board which is allowed to make charitable donations, even if they are limited, to its favoured hobby, pastime, sport or charity. No State board should use taxpayers' money in this way. To put the Minister of State's mind at rest, we are not talking about good marketing and sponsorship, we are talking about charitable donations which are not even limited. The provision is so wide it means that, in future, Bord Gáis Éireann could state, &ldquo;We are going to make political contributions.&rdquo;  I know they are limited by subsection (5), but it should never be the function of a State board to do so.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have put up with scandals that have been brought about by this. I urge the Minister of State to reflect now, rather than wait until the Bill goes to the Lower House. The purpose of having this House where amendments can be tabled is so that we can reflect. We agreed on this side of the House to have Committee Stage followed immediately by Report Stage, but if it means the Minister of State will only reflect on matters raised here before the Bill goes to the other House, I will be very disappointed. I am unable to accept his views, although I hope he will change his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I re-emphasise that political donations are certainly not envisaged. This is not some kind of innovation that is being introduced in the Bill. I remind the Senator, and the House generally, that this provision already exists in the Gas Act, 1976. I stressed that point earlier and I am stressing it again now. It is being repeated here for the sake of clarity. I also wish to clarify the undertaking that I am giving to make the appropriate amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil, once I have satisfied myself that there are no hidden negative effects in the Senator's proposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 34, to delete &ldquo;applied.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;applied, and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;whether publication takes place under <i>subparagraph</i> (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) of this subsection, it shall cause the annual accounts to be published by electronic means at the same time.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. The Minister listened to me and accepted four amendments, two of them connected with this topic. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. This is a modern Ireland, one which does not limit itself to old fashioned methods of communication. It seems outrageous that we do not establish in these Houses that in future electronic means of communications is simply normal and not something for the <i>avant garde</i> or a small number who think in that way.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that publication of accounts, under paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this subsection, &ldquo;shall cause the annual accounts to be published by electronic means at the same time.&rdquo;  Nowadays electronic means of communication are an essential. This is not enabling legislation. I am not simply saying that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; publish them, I am saying that in future all accounts should be made available. The Minister's heart is in the right place. He has accepted some of these amendments already and I urge him to accept this amendment as well.</P>
      <P>The case the Minister made was that it might not be fair on this particular board if they had to publish using electronic means and others did not. It costs less to do this than to type it on paper. To electronically publish accounts which are already published is simply a matter of pressing a button. There is no cost involved. It is democratic and transparent, and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not speak on this on Committee Stage, but I listened very carefully. As someone who is computer illiterate, and I freely admit it, I wanted to mull over the implications of what Senator Quinn had said. He put forward his reasons very cogently and with his commercial background, which he brings to bear very effectively and well in his contributions in the House, he is <i>au fait</i> with the merits of promoting this in the world of rapidly developing technology. Even those of us who are technologically illiterate can see it by listening and observing. Nevertheless, it is my understanding from other legislation that has gone through the House that this did not apply.</P>
      <P>It is also my understanding from observing the war that is being waged with the banks &ndash; it is not even to the extent of electronic communication &ndash; that there is a very significant resistance among the older generation to following this policy. I am not using my own circumstances to take a decision on this, but from my perspective I can see why this might be the case. There is a lot of public disquiet among bank customers at the manner in which they are being literally forced into making the transition and doing so rapidly. Taking this Bill alone as it specifically refers to Bord Gáis and related competitors, I can see the difficulties that will arise. I can see the resistance that will be there.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that using legislation to impose legal impositions is necessarily the correct way to proceed at this time. Since it does not apply to other companies where legislation brought a greater degree of accountability and openness, there is a dichotomy and inequity there, and therefore I caution the Minister. I certainly urge and encourage him to look at ways and means by which the global use of electronic communications would be rapidly accelerated, but I am concerned that legal imposition is not the right way to go.</P>

      <P>There is considerable merit in Senator Quinn's amendment. We seem to be flying in the face of IT in not catering for this. On a question of principle alone it should be embodied in the legislation. That would send out the right signals that the remaining semi-State bodies are moving along the same road as the commercial sector. It would signal that we are keeping abreast of the technological developments of the mod<Col N="195" /> ern era. From the point of view of principle alone I would like to see it embodied in the legislation.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to believe that we are having this debate. This is a bit like being back in the 15th century. Printing is well established and somebody is saying that not everybody can read and, therefore, we should not bother printing. The fact that Senator Liam Fitzgerald is not<i> au fait</i> with the Internet may be to his advantage because most of the time it is an enormous waste of time and it is dreadfully diverting for lots of reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that we should not be having this debate. This should have become a matter of stated public policy. I recently spent a considerable amount of time looking for the most recent report of the Dáil boundary commission. It is not on the Internet. The gloss of Ireland as a high-tech, knowledge-based information society is increasingly that, a gloss. When Mr. Justice McCracken produced his first report he put a little aside in it admitting that he was totally unfamiliar with information technology and was extremely grateful to a few people who helped him during the compilation of his report. I remember a scandal from 1994 when it emerged that the Attorney General's office was at a very primitive level of technology and technological assistance. It is not so long ago that we heard that the Garda fraud squad, dealing with high levels of fraud, did not have a fax machine.</P>
      <P>If every simple matter such as this has to be a subject for debate, it makes the British TUC in the 1980s look like a model of technological flexibility. It is not a huge issue. Nobody is compelling people to read this information on the Internet or electronically as it will be printed anyway. We are simply saying that it should be compulsory to publish it on the Internet, which is not a difficult procedure. One brings up the document and pushes a button. Companies which decide they do not want to publish would have to go to great lengths to avoid the document turning up electronically by accident. It would cost them a great deal more money than the effort of making it available electronically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit like saying we should not make it compulsory for a State commercial body to have a website. The board of any State commercial body which does not have a website should be sacked for being so far behind modern realities. <Col N="196" /> The idea that this simple amendment should be a matter of debate rather than nodded through, having been dealt with years ago, is incomprehensible. To anybody in this country under 40 years of age, it is as strange as saying we should have a witches' dance to pray that the sun will rise in the morning. It is as fundamental a reality as that.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment. It is not breaking new ground. Senator Quinn, being electronically very sound, has tabled these amendments frequently. I remember the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, accepted a similar amendment to the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, accepted a similar amendment to one of the insurance Bills and I think the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, accepted a similar amendment to one of the public service Bills. These amendments have been accepted in the House before. This is the right time to admit it would be wise to publish company accounts in the most modern manner as well as in the traditional printed manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>My earlier comments reflected my concern that there would, possibly, be discrimination against natural gas undertakings. We are not only talking about BGE, but a growing number of concerns and undertakings entering the gas market and gas sector generally. We should not be discussing this matter. All I am looking for is some common ground with Senator Ryan's statement. For instance, companies are not required by legislation to have telephones, but they all do. I thought the same would follow as far as technological assistance, accounting methods and other matters were concerned. It would be wrong to insert this into a Bill concerning one particular sector.</P>
      <P>I was happy to accept similar amendments from Senator Quinn. My reservation about this amendment is that it would discriminate against gas undertakings. I support the use of electronic media, but an obligation in law of the type requested should only be introduced through an amendment to the companies Act to ensure it applies to all companies equally, at the same time rather than just one sector. For those reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State does not accept the amendment because, as Senator Henry said, similar amendments have been accepted in the past. I table these amendments, the vast majority of which have been accepted, to almost every Bill that comes before us. However, I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has accepted two other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we set standards. The Government has declared its wish to become the e-<Col N="197" /> government and, therefore, the e-hub of Europe. It seems outrageous then that, when this kind of legislation is being passed, we insist only that companies publish their accounts on old-fashioned paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke very well about the time when William Caxton and others started printing. At that stage no one argued that because not everyone could read, they need not print. I do not accept the Minister of State's analogy with telephones, that is, that companies are not obliged to have telephones, but they all do. The amendment is not the same, it concerns information which the public has a right to know. All companies have a right and an obligation to publish their accounts. State companies and natural gas companies should ensure they publish their accounts by electronic means as well as in print. I use the term &ldquo;electronic means&rdquo; because I have been informed that is the term the draughtspeo<Col N="198" /> ple insisted on using in the past when I used other terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already accepted a couple of similar amendments. His heart is in the right place. He should also accept this amendment because the public has a right to know. That is Government policy. The right to know by electronic means is also Government policy. Let us ensure we do not step back from that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, listened and accepted similar amendments to this &ndash; I do not know their precise detail &ndash; and, as Senator Henry pointed out, to the best of her memory the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, also accepted a similar amendment. We are living in the Stone Age if we do not accept this kind of amendment.</P>

    <Title>MOX Plant at Sellafield: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been to the House on a number of occasions to debate this subject with Senators. I welcomed it then and welcome this occasion even more so in the light of recent happenings. Senators will recall that the last time I addressed a debate in the House concerning Sellafield was in March 2000. That debate took place in the immediate aftermath of the publication of three reports on Sellafield by the United Kingdom Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, including a report on the falsification of safety related data relating to MOX fuel manufactured at Sellafield's MOX demonstration facility and a report on the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those reports by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate were severely critical of safety standards at Sellafield. They, effectively, reinforced the already long held concerns of this and pre<Col N="199" /> vious Irish Governments about the safety of the Sellafield operations and the steadfast view of the Irish Government that the Sellafield plant should be shut down.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally opposed to the continued operation and any expansion of the Sellafield plant. Since taking office I have spared no effort in making known to the relevant UK Ministers, both in face to face meetings and in correspondence, the concerns of the Irish Government about Sellafield. The Government's concerns about existing operations at Sellafield relate mainly to: the management of safety at the site; the storage in liquid form of high level radioactive waste; the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the site; the continued operation of the old Magnox reactors; the discharge of radioactive waste to the sea; and the risk of a catastrophic accident.</P>
    <P>A dominant theme of the Government's campaign against Sellafield has been the genuine fear of an accident at the site. The multiplicity of existing operations at Sellafield increases the risk of a major accident. This risk has now become much more acute in the light of the horrific events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House of the Government's dismay and anger at the announcement last week by the UK Government that it has given the go ahead to the Sellafield mixed oxide or MOX fuel fabrication plant. At a time of heightened tensions around the world arising from terrorist threats and when one would have expected countries with nuclear installations to consider the very real threat to safety and security, I find the UK Government's decision, which will effectively result in an expansion of operations at Sellafield, difficult to comprehend.</P>
    <P>British Nuclear Fuel's proposals to establish a MOX fuel production plant at Sellafield date back to the early 1990s when it first applied for planning permission to construct the facility. Ireland objected strongly to the project at that time but planning permission for the plant was granted in 1994. Construction of the MOX plant was actually completed in 1998 at a cost of over £300 million and I understand that capital expenditure of some £450 million has already been injected into the project.</P>
    <P>In 1996, BNFL applied to the UK Environment Agency for approval to operate the plant. It is amazing that this approval was sought so late in the life of the project. Since then, the BNFL application has been the subject of no less than five public consultations held by the UK authorities and Ministers &ndash; the most recent of which was completed in August 2001. The Irish Government has strongly and consistently opposed the commissioning of the MOX plant and its concerns about this plant have been conveyed to the UK authorities in every possible manner and in <Col N="200" /> our responses to each of the five separate rounds of public consultation over the period 1997 to 2001.</P>
    <P>The MOX fuel to be produced at Sellafield would be made from uranium and plutonium material separated from spent fuel which is reprocessed mainly in BNFL's thermal oxide reprocessing plant or THORP as it is better known. Therefore, the production of MOX fuel is part of the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing industry at Sellafield. Ireland is strongly opposed to nuclear reprocessing activities which generate gaseous and liquid radioactive discharges which contaminate the terrestrial and marine environment. Furthermore, the resulting production of plutonium creates an unnecessary risk that plutonium could be diverted for nuclear weapons production or terrorist activity.</P>
    <P>Even countries with nuclear programmes are questioning the merits of reprocessing on economic and safety grounds. The nuclear spent fuel reprocessing industry is now separating more plutonium than the nuclear industry is able to absorb. Sellafield now has a stockpile of plutonium which presents a potential risk to existing and future generations. The existence of such a large stockpile demonstrates how ill-advised it is to persist with reprocessing. The commissioning of the MOX plant will add even further to the multiplicity of operations already at Sellafield, thereby increasing the risk of an accident. It will increase the volume of world-wide transport of MOX fuel with obvious additional volume of traffic in the Irish Sea, thus posing an unacceptable safety and security risk as well as the potential for a major accident or terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>It will also perpetuate nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield and add to radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. While I am advised that the increase in discharges associated with the MOX plant is likely to be small, any contamination whatsoever of our marine environment is objectionable and unacceptable. The Government sees no justification whatsoever for the MOX plant and will do everything possible to bring about a reversal of the UK Government's decision of last week. The Irish Government has already initiated legal action against the UK under the OSPAR Convention in regard to the MOX plant. The Government's legal action began in June this year and relates to the fact that the UK, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, withheld pertinent information essential to assessing the economic justification of the MOX plant. This action is proceeding on schedule and an arbitration tribunal is in the process of being established under the OSPAR Convention to consider the case.</P>
    <P>I had specifically requested the UK not to take any decision on the MOX plant while the arbitration process was in train. However, the UK did <Col N="201" /> not accede to my request and instead have taken the decision to give the go-ahead to the plant, a decision which is totally unacceptable to Ireland and difficult to fathom, particularly in the current climate of heightened terrorist threats. In my responses to the public consultations held by the UK, I had made it clear that the information being made available to the public in the consultation papers was inadequate and insufficient to assess or support the economic justification of the MOX plant. I had repeatedly demanded, without success, full release of the information withheld by the UK which purports to support the economic justification of the plant.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the Government has exhausted all efforts at a bilateral level with the UK in trying to stop this plant being commissioned. The next step as far as the Government is concerned is to pursue the legal route. I understand that it will be some time before the MOX plant is fully commissioned. In the meantime, the Government will, in tandem with the legal action already proceeding under OSPAR, now press ahead with a view to finalising consideration of all legal options under both EU and UN law. Consideration of these legal options is already well advanced and, based on our best legal advice, the optimum path for proceeding from here will be determined and pursued.</P>
    <P>The Government does not accept the UK Government's decision that the MOX plant is justified. Indeed, in announcing its decision to give the go-ahead to the plant, the UK Government said that some 2,000 of the 9,000 respondents to the consultation process were against the proposed commissioning of the plant. Apart from the depth of economic data and information deleted from the UK's public consultation documents relating to the plant, the Irish Government cannot accept an economic analysis which writes off capital costs of some £450 million already injected into the project. Furthermore, there must be serious question marks about the projected markets for MOX fuel, notably in respect of the Japanese and German markets which are identified by BNFL as the primary markets for MOX. Germany has already announced that it is phasing out nuclear power. Japan has its own plans to produce MOX fuel which would further reduce the demand for MOX fuel from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Last year I met the German ambassador to Ireland and informed him of the Government's concerns about the MOX project. In addition, our ambassador to Japan also met an official in the Japanese foreign ministry and expressed similar concerns. Our aim was to address the main markets in Japan and Germany and point out the concerns that pertained in Ireland. It is difficult to see, based on any reasonable commercial principles, how a project for which firm contracts amount to only 11% of output can be said to be economically justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" />It is unthinkable that the UK Government should, at this point, allow BNFL to expand its present operations, when the company, only some 18 months ago, was the subject of what can only be described as a damning report by the UK nuclear installations inspectorate into its safety standards and safety management. As I understand it, very few of the 28 recommendations for safety improvement contained in the inspectorate's report of February 2000 on the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield have been implemented to date. Such a situation does not inspire confidence for the safety of an expanded Sellafield operation.</P>
    <P>The future of nuclear power worldwide remains highly uncertain. Some countries have decided to reject nuclear power. On the other hand, arising from concerns about global warming, climate change and the need for sustainable development in energy, Ireland is acutely aware that some Governments, international organisations and other stakeholders see these concerns as an appropriate basis on which to re-launch and re-invigorate the nuclear solution as a response measure. Ireland is firmly of the view that nuclear energy is incompatible with the objectives of sustainable development, principally because of the real risks which nuclear energy continues to present in terms of security and safety, such as the transport of nuclear materials, radioactive waste and spent fuel management, environmental contamination and increased proliferation risks.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government believes that the suggestion that nuclear technology might be a solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions does not hold merit because of the dangers which I have outlined above. The awful effects of nuclear accidents are well known. Such accidents do not respect international boundaries and countries which have rejected nuclear energy should not be exposed to such risks. It is our firm view that the risks posed by nuclear energy should always mean that it has no role to play in any sustainable development policy. At a time when some developed countries, including some of the world's most advanced countries, are phasing out their nuclear installations, Ireland would be concerned if developing countries were encouraged to develop nuclear industries as part of their energy mix and their efforts to strengthen their economies. It would be a mistake to encourage this approach. I made Ireland's views in this regard very clear at meetings of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and the International Energy Agency earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The terrible events of 11 September have highlighted new security risks which were previously unimagined. These events show that the onus is on those countries with nuclear installations to protect them from attack. They have a duty to do everything possible to protect their dangerous installations, irrespective of the cost of doing so. <Col N="203" /> It is unthinkable that they should authorise new installations until they have successfully addressed these issues.</P>
    <P>Concern about terrorist attacks on Sellafield or other nuclear plants has raised public concern about our preparedness to deal with the consequences of a nuclear incident. The Department of Public Enterprise, in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has primary responsibility for emergency planning for nuclear accidents. A national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is in place to ensure a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment, which could result in exposure of the public to radiation. The plan is designed to cater for a major disaster at a nuclear installation in another country, which would result in radioactive contamination reaching Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the plan is not designed to deal with a direct nuclear attack on Ireland, but obviously a number of the arrangements and measures in the plan would be relevant in such a scenario. The plan provides a structure for the management of the effects of such an accident, under the overall direction of a committee of Government Ministers. It outlines the measures which are in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents. It also describes the early warning systems operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union for alerting states to any radiological accident, and shows how accident management will operate, how technical information and radioactivity monitoring data will be collected, how public information will be provided, and what measures may be taken for the protection of the public in the short and long-term.</P>
    <P>Once the plan is triggered, the emergency response co-ordination committee goes into immediate session in a central control room. Armed with information from the RPII and other agencies, notably Met Éireann, because prevailing weather conditions will play a vital role, this committee, comprising representatives of key Government Departments and State agencies, will decide on, and co-ordinate, the implementation of counter-measures and public safety advice.</P>
    <P>Providing accurate information and advice to the public is of major importance. Information will be released throughout the course of the emergency by the RPII using national radio and television and the Internet. We are concerned with a nuclear accident, not an attack, so normal methods of communication will remain operational. The public should stay tuned to bulletins which will provide information and best advice on a frequent basis.</P>
    <P>If there was a nuclear accident, at Sellafield for <Col N="204" /> example, even if the wind was blowing in our direction the contamination would take some period of time to arrive here. That period can be estimated and taken advantage of. The areas most likely to be affected may be identified. It would be unusual if the entire country was affected in the same way. There would be time, for example, to put animals indoors and perhaps to take limited steps to protect their fields, in order to protect the food chain.</P>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise has overall responsibility for the nuclear emergency plan, and for ensuring the co-ordination of the responsibilities and functions of the relevant Government Departments and statutory organisations. These have responsibilities under the plan to establish procedures for implementing measures within their own particular fields of competence, including integration, where appropriate, with emergency services already provided for other civil emergencies.</P>
    <P>The national emergency plan which is currently in the public domain dates back to 1992. Since then the plan has been reviewed, and a number of refinements and improvements to the plan have been introduced. I hasten to add that the updating of the plan has nothing to do with the appalling events in the USA. Emergency plans, by their nature, are subject to continuous review and updating as appropriate. Our nuclear emergency plan is a product of years of learning and review. It is not the plan of any particular Minister, and not my plan. It represents the accumulated input of energy Ministers through the years. For example, it was improved dramatically using the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident. The monitoring stations around the coast are a direct legacy from that time. The current plan, published in 1992, has been undergoing review and testing for the last two years, and an updated plan will be ready for publication towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The changes for the plan are largely institutional in nature, and are designed to streamline administrative arrangements, and to reflect advances in science, technology and meteorology. They are designed to ensure prompt and effective analysis of any emergency and prompt communications to the public and to key players concerning risk analysis and recommended counter-measures. The plan has been the subject of independent evaluation and a full-scale exercise of the plan will take place early next month. The exercise, based on a simulated accident abroad, has been planned within the Department, in conjunction with other Departments, for two years. It has been worked on intensively for the last twelve months, and independent consultants were brought in to advise on the most appropriate and user-friendly plan. I intend to publish the updated plan in the near future and to deliver a fact sheet <Col N="205" /> drawn from the plan to every household in the country.</P>
    <P>This House should be assured of the Government's strong resolve to remove the threat to Ireland posed by the Sellafield plant. To encourage the cessation of all activities at Sellafield remains a priority for the Government and we will pursue every diplomatic and legal means of achieving this. More immediately, our action to prevent operation of the MOX plant is proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Caffrey. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob. This is a very serious issue and he has addressed in his speech the major points of concern. The State is very well served by Dr. Tom O'Flaherty and his team in the RPII, and also by the very committed and dedicated staff in the Department of Public Enterprise. A joint approach is required on this issue &ndash; there is, and should be, no political division in this debate. If we have differences, they are differences in terms of the scale of the response, not on the fundamental issues, about which there is deep concern.</P>
      <P>I live in County Louth. If there were a nuclear accident in Sellafield, and if the wind were blowing in the right direction, County Louth would be one of the first places affected. I am not satisfied that we are sufficiently alert to deal with this issue. A further debate is needed at local level to get the Garda, Civil Defence and other bodies together in order that they can follow through on the national plan, which is being refined by the Minister of State and his Department. I am calling for that and ask that the Minister of State insist with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that it be done, particularly on the east coast, County Louth in particular, where there is deep concern.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a mother yesterday morning in a coffee shop and told her we would be talking about Sellafield. She said her 13 year old daughter cannot sleep at night because she is worried about Sellafield, as are her friends. She explained that her daughter was afraid to go to sleep or to school; that is the reality for this girl and her family. We have a responsibility as a State to tell all the facts about Sellafield clearly. I am concerned about the tabloidisation, if that is the correct word to use, of this issue and the scaremongering in the national media, which is unwelcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want are the facts, not scaremongering. The reality is that if there is an accident at Sellafield and the reaction is bad enough, it will destroy not just this country, but the whole western world. The accident in Chernobyl was a serious explosion in a reactor, which had and continues to have an effect on our society. We must deal with the reality. How safe is Sellafield and how do we determine how safe it is? That is the <Col N="206" /> real debate. The history of British Nuclear Fuels and the management of the plant from the days of the explosion at Windscale, renamed as Sellafield, right down to the falsification of data in the plant at a fundamental level, bring the integrity of all operations there into question. The only way we can have an overview of those operations is by insisting, as a State, that we have our people present there in an inspectorate while the plant continues to operate. We should have our own inspectorate present in the plant to identify what the reality is from its perspective and what the information deficit is, if any. We need total transparency and openness about what is happening at the plant which we do not have.</P>
    <P>Clearly, those working at a high level in Sellafield discovered fabrication and falsification of information and, in fairness, it was through the nuclear inspectorate that this was brought to the attention of the company. However, I remain deeply unhappy about and suspicious of operations there. We should do what we should have done last week: call the British ambassador into the Taoiseach's office and tell him how we feel. I accept the Minister of State has done his best and that the Taoiseach has spoken by telephone with Tony Blair, but that is not good enough. The most forceful way we can bring our fears to the attention of the British Government is directly through the British ambassador and via a face to face meeting between the Taoiseach and Tony Blair.</P>
    <P>A clip of Tony Blair's election campaign was broadcast on television last week in which he said it was not the intention of his Government to expand the nuclear industry in Britain. That was clear, concise and factual, but clearly, in view of what has happened since, it was a pack of lies. The reality is that what the British Prime Minister said is totally and absolutely false and that they intend to expand operations there. We must nail this lie, but we must also nail the facts. The facts are that they have and are expanding operations. That is and will continue to be a matter of the deepest and most serious concern for our society.</P>
    <P>What is the benefit of Sellafield for our country? We get absolutely zero. There is no benefit to this country from the plant. What we get is worry, not just among the children of whom I spoke. Cancer is on the increase all over the western world and that is particularly true in County Louth. People are concerned that pollution of the Irish Sea from Sellafield during the years has caused contamination in the food chain. There is no clear empirical medical evidence to prove that is so, but that is what people believe.</P>
    <P>There is a big job here for the Government, Opposition and society as a whole. We must ensure this plant is closed. We stand behind the Government, but we want it's response to be firmer and much more aggressive on the issue. Our environment is the most important thing to <Col N="207" /> us and I fault the Government's policy of placing toxic incinerators in my county, where dioxins will poison people if the incinerators are built. Our environment is number one and we must protect it at all costs. Our agricultural exports and food production will be affected if there is an operational accident at Sellafield. The key worry for the girl who may not sleep tonight is the possibility of terrorists taking over the plant or crashing God knows what into it. If it can be done, these people will do it. Sellafield has the potential to kill millions of people, not just on our east coast. We must be alert to this. We must make sure British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government are kept on their toes day and night on this issue. That is what we must do.</P>
    <P>We must have balance in reporting this issue. Dick Ahlstrom wrote a very useful and pertinent article in <i>The Irish Times </i>about the realities of a terrorist attack on Sellafield and how he perceived the scale of danger. We need views like that expressed, but I am worried about the unnecessary fears being created, particularly among children. We must do everything we can to reassure them. I accept what the Minister of State and Tom O'Flaherty said, that there is a plan in place which is being refined, but it is not being refined enough. The distillation of views is not percolating to the grass roots, though the Minister of State's leaflet may do the job. That will not be enough, as we need a more proactive, public campaign. The reality is that in the world in which we live, after the twin towers disaster, we cannot afford to be laid back. We must be aggressive and at the cutting edge. Above all else we must ensure this plant is closed; the Government must take any steps it can to do so and we will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his reassuring, comprehensive address. Nevertheless, when we look at the events of 11 September, we can only see how helpless the vast resources of New York were in the face of the enormity of those events. The resources available were incredible, as was the human effort put in by firemen and others. However, people just sat down helplessly and watched the drama unfold before them. While the Minister of State's speech was reassuring in many ways, we, in this country, would be in a similar position with the type of plan envisaged by the Government. Everyone would be doing their best, but would be looking on helplessly at the enormity of what was unfolding before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission was granted in 1994 for the MOX facility, an extension to the Sellafield nuclear power station. It is ironic that although Irish farmers cannot obtain planning permission to cut turf on their bogs, this monstrosity was granted planning permission only 80 miles away <Col N="208" /> from Ireland. That is what springs to mind when one considers what recourse is available to us through EU law. The Government has opted for the legal route at this juncture as there is no other option open to it. If I could draw an analogy, the Sellafield plant is like a neighbour's vicious dog. We have warned its owner and now must finally resort to court.</P>
    <P>Nuclear power stations are sleeping monsters which are fine as long as they are not disturbed. The twin towers of the World Trade Centre were peaceful monuments to civilisation but were destroyed even though they did not pose a threat. Without wishing to scaremonger, the capacity for an accident at Sellafield is very real in light of the existence of the bin Laden DIY school of destruction. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that these demented people will consider other means of pursuing their twisted agendas.</P>
    <P>Sellafield has posed problems for Ireland over the years. There is evidence that the incidence of cancer has increased along the east coast and that pollution levels in the Irish Sea have also increased. The finger points to Sellafield. Marine life and other aspects of our environment are endangered. It is important that we are vociferous in our opposition to this facility at Sellafield. Sellafield does not have a good record. Figures on reprocessing were distorted some years ago and the chief executive had to resign, after which a new management team was put in place. Nevertheless, doubts remain about this monster on our doorstep which we must ensure is removed.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the Government's approach, the Green Party and other environmental activists are attempting to bring a case against Sellafield. We must continue to exert pressure in this area and support all those involved in the effort to prevent the commissioning of this facility. Following the events of 11 September, we must view everything in a new light. Prior to that date, we viewed Sellafield as posing a threat to our environment and were concerned at the possibility of a serious accident such as that which occurred in Chernobyl. We must now consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on Sellafield. This prospect has stirred people's imaginations and has frightened many ordinary people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that planning permission for this facility was granted in 1994 and that the British Government has now granted it a licence to go into production, particularly given that all the indications from technical experts and analysts are that the market for nuclear energy will not exist in the near future. Germany intends to phase out its nuclear capacity altogether. New technology has created myriad energy production possibilities such as wave and solar energy. These energy sources could be successfully harnessed without great risk to our environment or to human life. In its efforts to get the MOX facility <Col N="209" /> up and running, the British Government seems oblivious to the potential hazards to people in this country and on the British mainland.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers are aghast that they cannot work their own land without being subject to all manner of EU directives. Legislation must be tightened up to ensure there is no repetition of what happened at Sellafield. There are several nuclear power stations in Britain and the British Government has not given an indication that it will phase out its nuclear capacity. We must maintain the momentum on this issue. The Government is correct to pursue all legal and other avenues to ensure this facility does not go into production.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate following the decision of the British Government to sanction the commissioning of the proposed MOX facility at Sellafield. I commend the Minister on his hard-hitting, uncompromising contribution and the up-front manner in which he outlined the Government's determination and that of the RPII to pursue this matter vigorously and prevent the MOX development proceeding. I compliment Senators O'Dowd and Caffrey on their approach to the debate on this issue about which there is unanimity in these Houses and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach categorically assured us in recent weeks, as did the Minister of State, that all options, including the OSPAR Convention and a challenge through the European Court of Justice, will be vigorously pursued to ensure the facility does not proceed. Previous speakers referred to the ongoing intensive lobbying of our EU partners, Nordic countries and others to turn up the heat internationally on Britain. We must increase the vigour of our efforts in this regard. All Irish parliamentarians and citizens unequivocally support the Government on this issue. Sellafield represents a clear and unacceptable danger to the Irish people, to marine life and to the environment. In light of a disastrous history of repeated leaks, accidents and safety failures at the plant, a sinister and pervasive culture of secrecy on the part of BNFL, constant deception and a slick presentation of propaganda relating to the nuclear industry in general, we must call for the complete shut-down of Sellafield as the only action to meet our legitimate concerns. The decision to sanction a new phase of nuclear processing at Sellafield at any time, given the plant's notorious and abominable record, represents at the very least the most cynical contempt for our legitimate concerns about activity occurring a few short miles from our coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is Ireland Britain's nearest neighbour, it is its friendly neighbour. Taken against the background of the horrific events of 11 September in the United States, the decision to proceed with MOX shows what amounts to criminal and reckless disregard for the lives of people, not only in Ireland and Britain but internationally as <Col N="210" /> well. The decision totally ignores the warning from Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, who spoke recently about exposure to increased risk of terrorism involving nuclear weapons. A leading scientist, Dr. Frank Barnaby of the Oxford Research Group, felt duty bound to state publicly that the proposed new nuclear reprocessing plant could be a prime target for a terrorist attack. Some people will state that we did not need him to point that out but nonetheless, as a leading academic in the area of science, Dr. Barnaby has unequivocally and unambiguously stated that Sellafield poses a major threat to this country because it is a prime target for a terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>Dr. Barnaby, in very strong language for a scientist, accused the British Government of gross stupidity and irresponsibility in granting BNFL permission to open a mixed oxide fuel plant on the site. He pointed out that plutonium from a MOX plant can be used to produce nuclear explosives and stated that if terrorists obtained MOX materials they could easily chemically separate the plutonium and uranium oxides and use the former to make a crude nuclear explosive. He made it clear that very little expertise is required to produce such an explosive and indicated that MOX is particularly vulnerable to terrorist acquisition, particularly during transportation. When asked about the possibility of a terrorist flying a plane into Sellafield, an event to which Senators O'Dowd and Caffrey and the Minister of State referred, Dr. Barnaby stated that he saw this as a major and real threat. He said that such an attack would have devastating contamination consequences for a very wide area. Some of the self-appointed experts in the media, who have absolutely no background in science, had the presumption and the gall to try to play down Dr. Barnaby's comments.</P>
    <P>While I agree entirely with Senators O'Dowd and Caffrey that we should not hype this issue out of all proportion and generate unnecessary fear throughout the country, we must accept that the scientific facts bear out Dr. Barnaby's words. He indicated that there would be devastating contamination over a wide region and, in particular, the east coast of Ireland which is the area most adjacent to Sellafield. Dr. Barnaby regards the potential consequences as a legitimate fear and, from his scientific perspective, this decision simply beggars belief.</P>
    <P>There is another curious dimension to this matter &ndash; it would be curious if it was not so serious. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in a world-view statement on Tuesday, 25 September, emphasised that the lesson of the financial markets, climate change, international terrorism, nuclear proliferation and worldwide trade was that &ldquo;Our self interests, and our mutual self-interests, are today inextricably woven together.&rdquo;  What a laudable and commendable observation from a highly enthusiastic, self-promoting world statesman &ndash; there is nothing wrong with that &ndash; pondering the significance of rapidly evolving <Col N="211" /> globalisation. A simple interpretation on my part, very humbly put, of his words can raise a warm feeling of acknowledgement, friendship and connectivity among states from the perspective of a statesman representing a superpower casting his fond gaze and his fatherly eye over his less powerful neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>What a shame these same mutual self-interests were not accorded an appropriate place in his Government's decision on Sellafield, which followed within days of the now famous statement on mutual self-interests. For the past three years, five Nordic countries &ndash; Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden &ndash; have been seeking the closure of Sellafield under the OSPAR Convention, which requires all 15 member states, including Britain, to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate marine pollution. The Nordic states took this aggressive stance because studies had shown that currents brought radioactivity from the Irish Sea into their most important fishing grounds. They received some response last week from the self-appointed world statesman on mutual self-interests.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to our more immediate and pressing concerns in Ireland. When an abominably treacherous decision &ndash; I cannot describe it in milder terms &ndash; of this nature is taken by Britain against Ireland, its nearest friendly neighbour, the Irish public and politicians might quite legitimately question the actions and decision of successive Governments and Ministers and the effectiveness or otherwise thereof. As part of that legitimate process, some accusations and allegations have been unfairly levelled at the Minister of State and the Government, mainly in the Lower House and the media, about actions taken to prevent a decision such as that recently taken by the British Government. To conveniently blame the Minister of State or the Government in this instance for what has happened is to totally miss the point of what is at issue.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the justification put forward by the British for the decision to commission the MOX plant &ndash; this would be funny if it was not so serious &ndash; after a five year delay and five public consultation processes, which, as we know, were not entered into voluntarily, is a simple, economic one. No genuine attempt whatsoever was made to put forward a strong economic justification or otherwise for the decision. The British Government stated that it was based on an assessment which found that it would cost more to mothball the project than to operate it. Such a response to our major and legitimate concerns on this side of the Irish Sea &ndash; we live literally a few short miles from the site in question &ndash; is pathetically inept. In more sinister terms, it is also cynically and despicably arrogant. How could any fair-minded state, even half conscious of the implications of mutual self-interests let alone internationally binding obligations freely entered into by signatory states, perpetrate such a bullying and treacherous action on its immediate <Col N="212" /> neighbour? Not only does it &ldquo;beggar belief&rdquo;, in the words of the eminent scientist, Dr. Barnaby, it seriously challenges the notion that the British are genuinely serious about continuing to foster good Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and the Government can stand proudly over their record since entering office in their ongoing, determined and all-out efforts to eliminate the threat posed and damage caused by Sellafield. Equally, the Minister of State's outright opposition to nuclear proliferation in general is unequivocal and is a matter of public record. From the outset, he has at all times opposed the commissioning of the MOX plant. With the full support of the Taoiseach and the Government, he has forcefully articulated Ireland's major concerns about and opposition to this plant to the British authorities at the highest level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He has done so at every forum and every opportunity. We are all aware that, between 1997 and 2001, there have been five separate rounds of public consultations on the proposed commissioning of the MOX plant. The Minister of State and his officials, fully supported by RPII officials, have responded in a detailed manner to each round. Through correspondence and meetings Ireland's concerns about health, security and environmental risks arising out of activities at Sellafield have been forcefully and consistently put by the Minister of State to his British and international counterparts. The British have no doubt where Ireland and the Government stand in regard to this plant.</P>
      <P>Suggestions, one or two of which I have read over the past week, that we are too quiet or compliant regarding Britain's nuclear activities are naive or mischievous. Contrary to inaccurate statements in the media, the Government has initiated action against Britain on MOX under the OSPAR convention. The case was made by Britain that it was withholding information on the ground of confidentiality. This information is essential to assessing the economic justification for the MOX plant. The Minister of State had asked the British authorities not to take any action on MOX while the arbitration tribunal was sitting, pending the outcome to its deliberations. Their decision to disregard such a reasonable request is contemptible. They are not only turning their noses up at the Minister of State and Ireland, they are displaying equal contempt for the Nordic countries and the arbitration process itself, which was agreed between north Atlantic countries concerned with marine pollution and discharges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to reiterate that nuclear safety is a legitimate concern for countries, particularly those which are neighbours to countries that have chosen the nuclear power option. Any country in close proximity to such installations is fully justified in having major concerns about plant oper<Col N="213" /> ations, storage of waste, discharges into the marine and terrestrial environments, transportation of nuclear fuels or reprocessed materials and the ever present threat of a major accident.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State clearly rejected the nuclear option for developing countries in April at a conference on sustainable development. The following month at a Council of Energy Ministers meeting in Brussels he again rejected the nuclear option as a solution to the problem of security of supply. At an OSPAR commission meeting he secured the adoption of a proposal by Ireland that the current review of radioactive discharge authorisation limits from spent fuel reprocessing activities should be completed as a matter of urgency. The reviews seeks to achieve the objective of the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges into the marine environment by 2020 through substantial, progressive reductions in discharges. Members, the Minister of State and the Government are not happy with that date and that is one of the reasons the Minister of State continues to have an input in trying to accelerate the process and using every forum and legal means available to him to do so.</P>
    <P>At the same meeting, the Minister of State, expressing concern about a Greenpeace International report, pointed out that Ireland is totally opposed to any increase in discharges and wants them halted. The Taoiseach and the Government are fully supportive of the Minister of State's position that the only satisfactory outcome in regard to Sellafield, with its unenviable history, is complete closure. His British counterpart, Minister Liddell, has been informed of this and she has been asked to halt all reprocessing operations immediately.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to continue and step up, if possible, ongoing contacts with other countries, whether at the EU or UN or at fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, to promote the dismantling of the nuclear industry. I welcome the decision to take legal action under the OSPAR Convention. It is encouraging to learn that proper legal evidence appropriate to the taking of such a case is now available. There was little point in pursing legal action when Ireland did not have the wherewithal to make it stick. Ireland would have been the laughing stock of its partners who were willing to lend support. Credible sustainable evidence is needed and I am heartened that it is available. Every other legal avenue under EU and UN law as well as the international laws of the sea needs to be pursued equally vigorously to overturn this crazy decision on MOX. Nothing short of a complete end to all activities at the Sellafield plant must be the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the teams of officials from the Minister of State's Department and the RPII, whose significant ongoing input should not be underestimated. As recently as Monday, these officials held a top level meeting with their British counterparts and such meetings need to increase in frequency and intensity. If the <Col N="214" /> British, through mindless arrogance and stubbornness, continue to flout international laws, trample on the legitimate concerns of neighbouring states such as Ireland and display cynical disregard for the major risk to people's lives and the environment, a much tighter coalition of concerned states will have to be galvanised to halt their reckless and irresponsible behaviour.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have always been opposed to Sellafield and its operations and this will continue to be the position. I am confident the Minister of State will avail of all the legal powers at his disposal in the international arena and will copperfasten international action to reverse this recent outrageous decision on MOX and put paid to Sellafield's activities for good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I listened to his speech with great interest and I am particularly glad that he referred to his concern about the continued operation of the old magnox reactors. I was telephoned by a former neighbour and constituent who was very worried about the Wylfa magnox reactor on the island of Anglesey. The reactor is very much out of date and has not been effectively decommissioned and there was a seismic tremor under it 13 or 14 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>It is antiquated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The reactor on Anglesey is only 50 miles across the Irish Sea as the crow flies, while the magnox reactor at Trawsfynnydd is slightly younger and is only 70 miles across the Irish sea as the crow flies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State provided a broad sweep on the issue and I am in agreement with virtually everything he said. I greatly regret, however, I missed his recent appearance on the electric wireless, which, I understand, was of vintage proportions but then I have an unfortunate record in this regard as I also missed the performance of his former colleague, Padraig Flynn, which I also bitterly regret.</P>
      <P>However, some elements of his appearance have survived. For example, the Minister of State said the concern about terrorist attacks on Sellafield or other nuclear plants has raised public concern about our preparedness and that lends some force to my slogan, &ldquo;A pox on the MOX&rdquo;. Irish people want to reject it and we feel we are right so to do. If we can do so by ridiculing MOX and laughing at it, then so much the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I love about the Minister of State's contribution is that we have the serious stuff at the beginning but then we have the emergence of the PLAN. When one examines it, it is vague. We are back to the business of listening to the weather forecast to find out which way the wind will blow <Col N="215" /> and so on. I recall in the 1960s that a predecessor of the Minister of State issued a wonderful little book about what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion. One was to unscrew the outside lavatory door, lean it against an internal dividing wall, pile blankets on top of it, get under it with tinned food, wait until after the flash and then open the window and shout &ldquo;help&rdquo; in Irish. There was also information about how to milk a radioactive cow. Rubber gloves are quite essential, I am told.</P>
    <P>However, one could not take seriously the notion that we will be protected if one analyses the Minister of State's contribution, particularly in light of an interesting article by Edward Horgan, a former member of the Defence Forces, in<i> The Irish Times.</i> He indicates that our command centres are woefully out of date, probably insanitary, and that we do not have Army vehicles capable of bringing members of the Cabinet from one location to another and, therefore, command control. I am not convinced we have protective measures of any substance in place. For a country like ours, it is difficult to do this. Although I enjoy the amusement, I sympathise with the Minister of State's predicament. It is difficult to protect against these things. The best protection is to try to intercept the possibility before this type of accident occurs.</P>
    <P>The British have been extremely bad neighbours. There has been a record of accidents, cover-ups and the falsification of information and scientific reports which has vitiated the situation. This plant, with its dreadful sordid history, will lead to a further proliferation of nuclear materials and exposure to a possible terrorist threat. There is no point producing this magnox fuel. The Japanese were horrified by the fact that in August 1999 it was revealed that BNFL had falsified documents going to Japan. They will not have anything to do with it now. There is no market there. It suggests that some of the Scandinavian countries are interested. This is the result of what it calls finessing. It is massage. There is no concrete market for the MOX fuel.</P>
    <P>In addition, it will be a loss. It has cost it £470 million to build the plant and, at its best figures, it estimates a £200 million profit. It will undoubtedly make a huge loss, while it creates further dangers down the road from nuclear contamination. As a result of its operation, the plant will become contaminated. It must deal with the decontamination process of the plant.</P>
    <P>There was also a suggestion that it would use up stocks of plutonium created by the previously existing procedures at Sellafield. It will not use them up. They are of no use in this process. Most of the plutonium it wants to turn into MOX has not yet been separated in the central THORP plant. It will not reprocess dangerous materials in that situation.</P>
    <P>As regards the idea of Japanese orders, the executive director of BNFL, Norman Askew, said in an interview with <i>The Guardian</i> on 15 September 2000:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" />Without Japanese orders we cannot justify opening the MOX plant. We have no time to finesse this: we have until about next January or February to convince the Japanese, otherwise we shall have to abandon the project.</P>
    <P>Where are the orders? It should have abandoned the project. What is the British Government doing about it? </P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Professor William Walker, Dr. Frans Berkhout and Mr. Gordon MacKerron said in their response to the Environment Agency consultation in March 1998 that &ldquo;there are grounds for concern that all of the health and environmental detriments arising from the SMP's operation will fall on the UK.&rdquo;  That is grounds for concern for the citizens of the United Kingdom, but, unfortunately, it is not true. Many of the detrimental effects will be felt on this island. We have already felt the effects of Chernobyl. Several areas of this country were contaminated by radioactivity in the aftermath of Chernobyl. There is no reason to suppose that an accident at Sellafield, which could be up to at least ten times the scale of Chernobyl, would not have a significant impact on us. It is a dangerous dirty process which can only make a loss and create significant security and health problems.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Tony Blair said, on 14 September in the aftermath of the events in New York on 11 September, &ldquo;We have been warned by the events of 11 September, and we should act on the warning.&rdquo;  He acted on the warning almost immediately afterwards by licensing the MOX plant at Sellafield. It is astonishing. The British Government gave massaged finesse and inaccurate scientific information. For example, the Environment Agency in a paper entitled, Proposed decision on the Justification for the Plutonium Commissioning and Full Operation of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Plant, in October 1998 stated:</P>
    <P>It would be a relatively straightforward matter to undertake chemical separation of plutonium from MOX fuel. It is debatable how easy it would be then to assemble the plutonium into a crude nuclear device actually capable of exploding [but] a terrorist group would arguably be able to exercise considerable power by merely threatening to explode such a weapon.</P>
    <P>It is easy to separate. There might be some technical difficulties in putting the thing together, but it is a significant political problem, although it may be militarily vulnerable. The Minister of State in the British Government, John Battle, said in June 1999 that &ldquo;anyone trying to [separate plutonium from MOX fuel] would require highly specialised plant, equipment and skills, and a considerable degree of nuclear sophistication in order to ensure radiological and criticality safety.&rdquo;  That is not accurate. Frank Barnaby, to whom Senator Liam Fitzgerald referred, said that a good second year undergraduate could complete it in his or her own kitchen. Much of the <Col N="217" /> equipment is readily available and information about criticality is available on the Internet. The United States Department of Energy and the Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation states that MOX fuel remains a material in the most sensitive category because plutonium suitable for use in weapons could be separated from it relatively easily.</P>
    <P>As regards ships, Ben Gilman, who is known to many of us in this House from his visits to Ireland and our visits to Capitol Hill, expressed concern about the capacity of ships to outmanoeuvre or have deterrent ability in the event of an attack. There is no suggestion they would be accompanied by other ships. There is also the question of the impact on the oceans. This is dangerous for those travelling through areas of ocean with islands, coastlines and people who depend on fishing. The effects of a nuclear accident would be enormous.</P>
    <P>There is a huge pressure pushing against this reactor, such as the failure of MOX fuel to make it economically, the German decision to rule out nuclear power, the Belgian decision to rule out MOX fuel, the fact that BNFL has zero value on plutonium stores and the fact that Electricité de France, the world's largest MOX customer, also values its plutonium holdings at zero. That is the negative aspect. However, we must be positive.</P>
    <P>There is a use for this plant as outlined in a briefing document by Earthwatch and other groups. It could be converted in the sense of turning sordid plough shares to undertake the task of ceramic immobilisation of separated plutonium. The industrial equipment and processes which exist at Sellafield would be perfect for decommissioning &ndash; to use a popular political term &ndash; this type of fuel. We should look at the benefit of this. It would provide a way to put the plutonium store into a non-weapons usable form. It would be safe and preserve jobs in the plant because the British are keen about their employment. If they were put into canisters and made part of the vitrified glass logs that BNFL is already producing, it would eliminate the problem of disposing of separated plutonium as a distinct entity. It would make Britain the world leader in immobilisation technology which should satisfy its national pride. It would also free up British Nuclear Fuels Limited from being seen merely as a failing element in the plutonium business.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and my friend, Senator Ross, for his indulgence. We must not just be negative. We should laugh and scorn the attitude of the British Government and expose it for the cynicism it is. We should ruthlessly go through the economic, medical and scientific arguments and then in an act of Irish generosity present the British with a way out which would preserve jobs, clean up the environment and make everything better for people.</P>

      <P>It is rare we have such total unanimity in the House and it is welcome. Some of us are affected in a direct way, including the Mini<Col N="218" /> ster of State. In the past I had ambitions to take a seat in his constituency. I remember well that in County Wicklow, particularly in Arklow, there were real concerns about the effect of Sellafield, especially on children. There were coincidences whereby deformities appeared in human beings and animals in various parts. While these were unproven, the statistics were beginning to look alarming as they do in other areas of the country, particularly on the east coast. Many people point with conviction to Sellafield as the reason.</P>
      <P>It is unforgivable that a so-called friendly neighbour could take the sort of attitude as the British do on this issue. This is the opposite of friendship. It is something that many of us, who are after all Anglophiles, deeply regret and utterly condemn. Senator Ryan will correct me if I am wrong but the history of this matter goes back to when we were first elected to this House. I remember this having been an issue for 20 years and that is a disgrace. It is a history of total impotence on the part of the Government. We are not here to apportion blame but to try to achieve something and make constructive suggestions. The efforts made by successive Governments of whatever hue have been abysmal failures. We have protested and have taken various legal cases. Some people have physically protested in more dramatic ways, not at governmental level but at Sellafield itself. Not only has nothing happened but we are going backwards, as we have seen following the recent announcement about MOX fuel. The British are saying: &ldquo;We don't care, we're going ahead with this and are actually increasing it, and you can't do anything about it.&rdquo;  I am afraid that is the truth. It may be that the British are within their supposed legal rights, even if what they are doing is totally immoral. It may be that successive Governments have taken legal action which they knew would fail but which have given the semblance of action to a fairly gullible electorate.</P>
      <P>The action the Minister is proposing to take has, in legal terms, little hope of success. It will probably be as successful as any action he has taken in the past, which has been zero. What should we do? We should test the Government's sincerity on this matter to see whether it has a commitment and, if so, how serious is that commitment.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business last week, I suggested that we invite the British ambassador to the House to answer questions about Sellafield. That simple suggestion was not taken up, however, and I wonder why. As happens on occasions like this, the suggestion met with a deafening silence. Why are the Government benches so keen that this matter should be discussed in secret behind closed doors in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges? That raises another issue because I do not know why that committee's meetings are held behind closed doors. Why can we not all sit in on it? Why can the world not see what happens at those meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion was very sensible &ndash; we should <Col N="219" /> put the British in the dock here to answer questions from the electorate. We have the ability, procedures, Standing Orders, passion and sincerity to do so, yet it will not happen. The ambassador will not even be invited, wait and see. Every single excuse known to man will be offered as to why the ambassador should be invited, but he will not be because we do not want to embarrass the British. Embarrassing them, however, is exactly what we ought to be doing but for some reason it will not happen. I may be wrong and I would be delighted to eat my words here if that is the case. If the ambassador is invited he may not attend, but let us issue the invitation anyhow. Let us begin to expose this matter and show the world what is going on.</P>
    <P>One can be sure that the British would not locate Sellafield in the south of England because the French would not put up with it for a moment. They have more clout internationally and would scream from the rooftops. British ambassadors in every capital in Europe would be called in to hear protests, but the Government prefers to take the innocuous route which will not have any effect. Why is this? Have we still got some sort of inferiority complex about the British or are we frightened of something they will do to us somewhere else? We seem to have absolutely no moral fibre and no political courage to expose them in public.</P>
    <P>We prefer to do it behind closed doors. When it was announced last week that this was happening why did the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, not call in the man from Glencairn and say, &ldquo;We don't like you.&rdquo;  He could have made a very public, international incident of it. This is not a matter of petty politics, it is a matter of life and death. People can skip around the issue as much as they like by politely discussing Chernobyl and talking in technical terms about radioactivity and nuclear power, which none of us really understands. We know what is really going on, however. What is happening across the water threatens our lives and our children's lives, yet we are doing nothing about it and neither is Britain.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is sincere but I found his speech disappointing because it reflected the efforts of successive Governments. I have often heard such speeches in the House from Ministers who have to get through a difficult situation. They are, in effect, saying: &ldquo;Look lads, we haven't been able to do anything for 20 years and we're not going to be able to do anything in the next ten years either; if we can do anything we're not going to embarrass our neighbours, even though they're threatening us.&rdquo;  We are talking about people being paralysed or killed by an appalling accident. We are now talking about the nightmare scenario of a terrorist attack &ndash; that was mentioned in somebody else's speech, although it is almost taboo to say it &ndash; that will cause radioactive fallout here.</P>
    <P>What would a madman like bin Laden, sitting <Col N="220" /> in a desert cave in Afghanistan, with the power to hit back at those who are now hitting him, do? He has done a pretty nasty job of destruction in New York. Who is America's greatest ally in all this? Who is a possible future target, and where better to hit than Sellafield? The consequences of that are unthinkable. It would be a tragedy for us and for the British people, yet we are sailing along as though it could never happen. We hope it will never happen.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's plan. The situation is much worse than any Government will admit. In his radio broadcast, the Minister tried to reassure the public but he did not offer protection. We know it will not do much good to go home, close the windows and hope for the best. It may do some good if we are lucky but there is no real protection against this threat, except the dismantling of the Sellafield plant. I question the Government's determination to take concrete steps on this issue. I do not question the Government's concern about this matter, but its record. The Minister says he spoke to the Japanese ambassador last year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Government on its actions in trying to prevent this development which will not be easy to stop. Senator Ross spoke about turning this into an international issue. During the troubles in the North 30 years ago some suggested that we make it an international issue and cause uproar. However, that would not have solved anything and I do not think Senator Ross seriously thinks such a course of action would solve this problem either.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that we invite the British ambassador to the House, but that will not happen as it is not within the remit of any ambassador to come into the House. There might be some hope if we invited the British environment Secretary. Is it possible for the Government or the Minister of State to obtain an injunction in the European Court to stop the commissioning of this plant until after the legal case is heard? The Minister of State made a strong case and the legal route is the only route to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement the Minister of State summarised the situation when he referred to the management of safety at the site, the storage of material in liquid form, the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, the continued operation of the old magnox reactors, the discharge of <Col N="221" /> radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and the risk of a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>We know that the past management of the site has been appalling and that there have been leaks about which we were not told. If we were told immediately there is a leak we could implement our emergency plan and take precautionary measures. However, the danger is that it may be two or three days after a leak has commenced that we get to know about it as the nuclear authorities have not told the truth about previous leaks until well after they occurred. People heard about those leaks through other means rather than directly from British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the damage caused by the explosion at Chernobyl and that some of the fallout affected parts of Ireland. If Sellafield was attacked, what happened to the World Trade Center in New York on 11 September would pale into insignificance as the entire country would be wiped out. I am aware of a prophecy which suggests that when the world ends it will be due to a terrible disease which will disfigure and injure people so badly that they will not wish to live, even if they succeeded in surviving the initial catastrophe. Such a disaster will be a man-made, nuclear catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Given that we live at a time when suicide bombers are prepared to give their own lives, it is well within the realms of possibility that a plane, helicopter or some other method would be used to blow up the plant at Sellafield. We can stay indoors and preserve food and cattle, but for how long? Years after the Chernobyl disaster people are still experiencing fallout from that accident and it is not safe to go into parts of Russia. We are only 80 or 90 miles from Sellafield and the furthest part of Ireland is only another 80 or 90 miles away so the entire country could be wiped out before we have time to act.</P>
    <P>This development must be stopped as it is a Frankenstein which will destroy Ireland and much of England if the authorities do not realise the dangers involved. It is the most dangerous time bomb that could be set. The events in Chernobyl showed us what can happen. In the past the authorities at Sellafield did not tell us about leaks. They decommissioned parts of the plant, but did not decommission other parts. We do not know what is there. A reactor is supposed to have a working life of ten to 15 years, but some of those at Sellafield are almost 30 years old.</P>
    <P>When there were proposals to build a nuclear reactor in Enniscrone, Sligo, the late Eugene Henry was the first to speak out against it as it was unsafe and he suggested we should think about such a move. We did not agree with the development and proposed a resolution against the plant which suggested that Sligo would be a nuclear-free zone. We saw the dangers of such developments 25 years ago and I cannot understand the thinking behind scientists and the British Government who continue to propose them.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey suggested that this situation is similar to a farmer with a mad dog. At least a <Col N="222" /> mad dog will not bite its owner, but the mad dog at Sellafield will bite and destroy England as well as Ireland. It would only require a small leak to destroy our fishing and tourism industries and our way of life. This is a serious issue and we must take every action possible. It is good that all parties in the House oppose this development. We must oppose it everywhere possible and make people aware of the dangers. Many people are not aware of the seriousness of the issue or the damage which can be done, even by a small explosion.</P>
    <P>Whether the material involved is transported by sea or air it is a sitting duck for suicide bombers. Such people could crash a yacht into a ship and blow it up. People do not realise how serious an issue this is. I appeal to everyone in this country, to the Minister of State and our MEPs, to raise this issue in the European Parliament and to ensure that the political groupings to which they are affiliated also do so. This is a European problem from which Ireland can suffer seriously and it must be solved.</P>
    <P>Ireland is pursuing this issue in the courts and there must be some way by which we can obtain an injunction against it. We might not succeed in bringing the British authorities to court for two or three years. We do not know what the consequences will be if the plant is commissioned.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out in newspapers that this development is uneconomic and that there is no guaranteed market for this material. This material will be placed on ships for export, but Japan or some other country may not need it. Material was sent back previously as it was not up to the required standard. What will happen to this material in such a scenario? A ship will be in mid-sea with a highly explosive substance on board. It will not be able to return to Sellafield or go anywhere else and the material will probably be dumped at sea. This issue is too serious and this commodity too dangerous to even contemplate such events. I appeal to everyone, particularly our MEPs and diplomats, to increase awareness of the fact that this could be the most serious disaster ever to befall the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great moments in Irish history occurred in 1977 when popular resistance prevented the imposition of a nuclear power plant on this State. It was one of many occasions throughout history when the extraordinary wisdom of democracy was shown, when the good sense of ordinary people across the political spectrum was demonstrated. In particular, I remember Ógra Fianna Fáil giving the then Minister, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, a fairly rough ride on this issue. It was not a party political issue, many of the parties were not nearly as vocal as <Col N="223" /> the public. It was one of the most profoundly wise decisions this country ever made and one which other countries are now scrabbling to catch up with. As Members of the House know, I intensely admire Sweden, but it and countries like it now have to adjust to a post-nuclear era when they no longer have nuclear power.</P>
      <P>I remember driving past a nuclear power plant in France. I still find those places a little bit nerve wracking and I am an engineer, although I am not necessarily frightened of technology. I do not want to wear the House out with my teaching techniques, but I teach students the rudiments of process design, how to design the process and the criteria that make something successful. There are four or five, depending on how one works it out. The first is that it should be technically feasible &ndash; that is the easy bit. The second is that it should make economic sense, the third is that it should be safe, the fourth is that it should be environmentally acceptable, and the fifth &ndash; which is probably implied in the others &ndash; is that is should serve some social purpose. That is the left winger in me.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the nuclear industry, it is, to a point, technically feasible. It is technically possible to do those things. The economics of the nuclear power industry are perhaps among the most dishonestly quantified in the whole area of processing. The cost of initial development is left out because that was paid for by weapons research. If one had to add &ndash; as one would in every other industry &ndash; the entire cost of research, development etc., the nuclear industry would be uneconomical.</P>
      <P>As Members know, the nuclear power industry in Britain could not be privatised because the costs of decommissioning were so enormous and so uncertain that no sane private purchaser would take it on without an indemnity from the Government which would have cost more than it would have got from privatisation. It stayed in public hands, not because the present or previous British Governments are keen on State ownership, but because the market will not accept it. The market is quite happy to write off the research costs because it does not cost it anything to do so, but the future uncertain costs of security and decommissioning are another matter. How much have the costs of securing out-of-date, closed down nuclear plants increased in the last three weeks? We do not know, but probably dramatically because risks now exist of them being sabotaged that we did not imagine would have existed before. There is huge uncertainty. On the question of economics, the whole thing makes no sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is nuclear power safe? At the risk of boring the House, I must ask what does &ldquo;safe&rdquo; mean. Safe never means that there is no risk, nothing is risk free. Safe means that the risk must be at best <Col N="224" /> quantified and then a decision must be taken if the risk is acceptable or otherwise. There are two issues involved in risk. The first is how big is the hazard. In this case it is enormous. We do not know how big it is, but it is enormous. We have not had enough body counts from nuclear accidents yet to know how big the risk is. What were regarded as safe levels of exposure to ionising radiation, which are all essentially determined by the unfortunate people of Nagasaki and Hiroshima &ndash; because that is the biggest experiment we have ever had in the exposure of people &ndash; have been reduced continuously as time progressed. It turned out that lower levels of exposure to radiation were actually seriously hazardous to human health. This is not theory, this is what happened. We do not yet know what is a safe level of exposure. Therefore, the scale of what could happen from an accident is unknown and unquantifiable and the only sensible thing is to say that it is enormous.</P>
    <P>How likely are nuclear accidents? It was likely to happen more frequently than people used to admit. There was Three Mile Island and others, Detroit was nearly lost, there was the famous China syndrome and then Chernobyl, all of which got worse and worse. That was before the present, new and more threatening phase of terrorism. Now we know the likelihood of an accident or an incident which causes damage is vastly greater. Therefore, the risk has gone up.</P>
    <P>That having happened, we are now told that this risk, which is quantified, is acceptable. The reason it is acceptable is because those who stand to benefit from it have decided that we and a significant proportion of the British population are not a significant enough matter of consideration to influence their decision. The risk is deemed to be acceptable. That is the decision that the British Government took, it took it when it sustained Sellafield and now it is taking it when it expands Sellafield. The essential decision is that in spite of the fact that the risk is quantifiable and large, it has decided that it is worth taking. That really is the most extraordinary thing.</P>
    <P>In that context, when there is a decision to make something which is manifestly risky acceptable, and to deem the risk acceptable, one inevitably ends up with what has happened. One ends up with lies and cover ups. Why? Because we know and they know that nothing can be absolutely safe. Every time somebody in Sellafield says that there is no risk from Sellafield, that is a lie. It is a lie because there is a risk with everything. The need to over-compensate for the risk involved means that they have to say things that are technologically untrue. It is impossible to say that any piece of technology is 100% safe. No honest engineer would say that anything is 100% safe, it is a question of the degree of risk. They will say that Sellafield is 100% safe, that is untrue, it cannot be true and the reason they say it is, is <Col N="225" /> to cover up the scale of the risk. The risk is clearly unacceptable, but someone has decided that the risk is worthwhile, and that is what produces the lies and the cover ups.</P>
    <P>That said, are we really serious about doing anything about it? It is not often that I feel that Senator Ross is the extremist in the House, but the sort of language that he used was perhaps a little bit too extreme for me. There are many things we could do that we do not that suggest that we are not really serious. I do not want to start anything about the Minister of State's now famous radio interview, because I think he was in a quite extraordinary no-win situation. Those things cannot be dealt with, but I do not think we have done the minimum that should be necessary. Let me give two instances. On today's Dáil Order Paper is the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998. There is urgency. It passed through this House three years ago and is still on the Order Paper of the Dáil. Are we really serious? The second one is the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000. We are approaching the end of 2001 and that is also still on the Dáil Order Paper. The enactment of both pieces of legislation as a matter of urgency would demonstrate some seriousness, but they will not be enacted, deep down in the rhetoric of the Government there is another set of priorities. Apparently, it has decided that these are not election issues. Whereas other issues &ndash; that I do not propose to go into &ndash; of a more socially acceptable kind which will appeal to part of the core vote will be sailing through and taking up vast quantities of time, issues like radiological protection and containment of nuclear weapons will have to wait until another agenda is met. That is wrong and quite clearly suggests that the Government is not serious about these issues despite its fine rhetoric recently.</P>
    <P>There is something particularly sorry about the issue of the MOX plant. I keep thinking about the leaked e-mail from the adviser to the British Minister recommending the publication of the bad stories at a time when nobody would notice. Of course, people are outraged and say they would not dream of doing such a thing. Then what happens out of the blue, at the height of an international crisis of unprecedented proportions, which everyone is saying is on the scale of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, which I believe, while perhaps not a nuclear threat, nevertheless threatens a level of bloodshed, disorder and instability on the planet, the likes of which we have not seen since 1939? A decision is made by the Government of the neighbouring island to do something it knows will be unpopular at home. They have, however, a Prime Minister who is sailing so high in public approval that nobody dares criticise him. They also know it will be unpopular here, but believe we are not in a position to do anything serious about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" />My message to the Government is that its rhetoric is fine &ndash; it is not the first Government which did not manage to resolve the issue &ndash; but there are actions it could take to demonstrate it is serious. There are the legislative actions which should be on the Order Paper of the Dáil tomorrow and dealt with by next week. There is no reason that should not happen other than lethargy and indifference.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the next, very apposite, question is what the European Union is doing in all of this. Let us examine the contrast. A neighbouring government is doing something unsafe, uneconomical and a potential environment disaster and apparently the European Union is impotent. On the other hand, we have a national airline, the only guaranteed link between ourselves and the United States, the single biggest investor in this country, yet the European Union is doing its best to make us close it down. I wonder what is going on and what is the agenda. The same European Union that is prepared to take the risk of closing down the only guaranteed link between this country and our greatest single investor is, at the same time, prepared to blink about what is happening across the Irish Sea. Some foolish people tell us the European Union is the reason we have better environmental standards. As long as it tolerates what is being done in Sellafield, the European Union is in no position to lecture anybody about environmental standards.</P>
    <P>If the European Union, so extraordinarily arrogant on the issue of our national airline, is so supine on the issue of Sellafield, one has to assume there is a reason for it. The reason, I believe, is because this links in to the whole defence issue. It is not about nuclear power or the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is about creating the cycle to make more and more and better and better &ndash; excuse that description &ndash; nuclear weapons. Sellafield is uneconomical, unsafe and a threat. The idea that the European Union, the alleged institution of democracy, freedom and accessibility, would tolerate this sort of misbehaviour simply to facilitate the nuclear weapons industry, while at the same time threatening to close down a small country's national airline, raises fundamental issues about the whole institutional relationship between this State and the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All speakers have been vociferous in their forthright condemnation of the circumstances arising at Sellafield. Sellafield with its track record of leakages, contamination, discharges and the huge number of health scares on this side of the Irish Sea was bad enough in the past, but now it plans to proceed with the commissioning of a reprocessing plant using mixed oxide fuels for which the only markets are Germany and Japan. As the former has already indicated it is unlikely to be a customer any longer, reprocessed fuel will have to be transported around the world to Japan. This will mean stockpiling plutonium and uranium and making Sella<Col N="227" /> field a prime terrorist target. The ships sailing around the world will also be prime targets for hijacking or other sorts of terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>Already, there is considerable evidence that a significant amount of plutonium has got into the hands of people who could use it to mount terrorist attacks. This is unnecessarily creating a position in which we could become a target for any terrorist attack on Britain. It is beyond logic that Britain is doing this to a friendly neighbour. It is unnecessary on economic grounds. The only possible economic justification for this project is the £450 million to £500 million which has already been spent. I presume nobody wants to take responsibility for a project which I am sure will be loss making if and when it is up and running.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister of State's speech with interest. I do not doubt his tremendous conviction on this matter. He has a good track record in expressing concern and doing his best on the issue. However, I am extremely disappointed that the outcome of all the efforts made to date is one big round zero. We have not had a single element of success on Sellafield or Thorpe and, certainly, we are unlikely to have any on MOX. We have protested, taken the legal avenue and got the support of OSPAR. We are taking the matter to a tribunal of arbitration and, of course, the British Government has refused to wait to see what the outcome of that will be. We are taking the matter to the European Court of Justice and the United Nations, but are not getting results. We will have to devise a more effective policy to get the desired result.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that the Government and all sides of the House are 100% behind the Minister of State's position. Probably uniquely in the two Houses, we share exactly the same view on what should happen to Sellafield, yet we have not been able to achieve an iota of success. Obviously, the measures that have been taken are useless. The second half of the Minister of State's speech related to the national emergency plan. Unfortunately, this is where action must be taken. It appears all we can do is prepare ourselves, revise the national emergency nuclear fallout plan and suffer the consequences.</P>
      <P>The very least that should be done is to take up the suggestion made by Senator Ross. Let us bring in the British ambassador. Why should he not come to the Oireachtas to meet us and listen to the unanimous view of Senators and Deputies on what his Government has just decided against our wishes. That step is essential. We have had bilateral avenues and some words exchanged with the British Prime Minister. That approach has been very respectable, but I fear the end result will be the demise of the respectable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ryan indicated, this country decided against nuclear power nearly a quarter of a century ago. The people took to the streets and to the fields, roads, avenues and little laneways of Wexford, down to Carnsore Point. The end result was that despite a determined movement by the <Col N="228" /> Government of the day, the decision was taken and that decision was never reversed. That is what will happen now, there will be mass campaigns on the streets. It is a shame that a Government is not able to achieve on behalf of the people something that ultimately will be achieved through grassroots protests. The Minister should be introducing new approaches, but there is not a single new approach in his speech. Effectively, the Government is devoid of a response, of ideas as to how to reverse the decision. If the Government is devoid of ideas, that means that the people will have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should at least respond to the main proposal made in this House concerning the British ambassador. He should indicate just how far the Government is prepared to go within diplomatic channels so that someone can be taken to task severely and in a public fashion. This should happen in the public arena, in the full glare of television and radio. The Government should give a clear message to the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in that I probably live nearer to Sellafield than any other Member of the House, 90 miles downwind on 90 days of the year. As a resident of Northern Ireland and a taxpayer there, it is my money that is being wasted on this too. I am grateful to Senator Ryan for his technical expertise in this which I found extremely helpful. We should all pay heed to his warnings in relation to risk. I will not follow him into the wilder reaches of conspiracy theory because I do not think this has an awful lot to do with armaments and war planning. It is just dirty politics.</P>
      <P>We have all seen cases where people are afraid to write off an investment that has gone wrong or afraid of the loss of jobs in an area where jobs are scarce. It is not without note that for a number of years under the Labour administration the Minister responsible for the environment was also the Minister sponsored by the trade unions on the Sellafield site. It is not surprising that people are flogging this particular dead horse for which there seems to be no economic or other justification.</P>
      <P>I remember when Sellafield was called Windscale. It got such a bad name that the name was changed to Sellafield but the practices were not changed and, by and large, the same people were running it. This was the original cowboy outfit. I had some dealings with those people many years ago when we were trying to investigate the possible impact of a health nature on the County Down coast. These people have literally been criminally negligent over the years. The litany of escapes, leaks, bad management and culpability is very long. These people cannot be trusted to run a plant such as this and we should not allow them to extend their activities or even to continue them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a severe source of pollution, not only potentially wind-borne pollution, but there is an fallout going into the Irish Sea and it is polluting <Col N="229" /> our waters and the fishing grounds. It is a pity the British ambassador was not present to hear what was said and the matter needs to be taken up directly with the British Government. It is an example of bad neighbourliness to behave in this way.</P>
    <P>There is a principle of European law which states that the polluter should pay, but we should not wait for that stage. We should take action to prevent the pollution taking place in the first place. Every interest should be mustered, not only through the courts but also through the European Union. If the Union means anything, it is about good neighbourliness, about not taking advantage. It is noteworthy that this news was put out under the mandate of the leaked e-mail which Senator Ryan referred to and which said that any bad news or dirty news should be made known this week. We should let the British Government and the world in general know that we are aware.</P>
    <P>The Minister should assemble as many friends as possible to create a lobby. One person who has made an acute study of this over the years and probably knows more about it than anyone else, is Mr. Eddie McGrady, the MP for South Down. Mr. McGrady is always extremely vociferous and has been arguing this for the past 20 years. If the Northern Ireland Assembly survives over the next week or two &ndash; I sincerely hope it does &ndash; the Minister will find that he has many friends there. Exactly the same concerns are being expressed on all sides of the House there as are being expressed here and in the Dáil, and it would be a pity not to make common purpose with them.</P>
    <P>I am aware there is a groundswell of responsible public opinion in Britain opposed to nuclear proliferation generally and it takes the same view as we do of the manner in which the decision was announced. I wish the Minister well but it is time to step up a gear or two and to be aggressive about this in every forum and avenue that can be found. It is clear that the unanimous sentiment of this House is fully behind the Minister in any action he may take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It was most interesting to listen to the contributions of all the Senators to the debate on British Nuclear Fuels and Sellafield. We must muster international support, particularly from the citizens of Britain. It is as important to them as it is to us. They will be the first affected by any accident. We should open up relations with people there who are actively involved and who object to the development of this facility. Many of the people involved in the protests at Carnsore Point were people from the world of music, like Christy Moore who participated in the objections to that proposal. They helped to muster a huge national anti-nuclear movement. We need to raise that consciousness in Britain and Ireland to strengthen the hand of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Prime Minister to <Col N="230" /> announce this in the wake of what happened in New York was certainly not in the interests of good diplomatic relations with a neighbouring country. In my view, there was a definite breach of trust in the manner in which it was done. The circumstances were very questionable, although we should not over-emphasise the conspiracy theory. However, one must be concerned at the huge change, particularly in Prime Minister Blair's interest in relation to the armaments race. It is a matter of concern that Britain should contemplate a move in that direction in the longer term, perhaps in conjunction with the United States. It is worrying for Europe and for Ireland that the strength and thrust of the major super powers may be channelled in that way. That concern extends to the use of nuclear spent fuels.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are deeply concerned about radioactive fallout, having regard to the experience which we have witnessed in Chernobyl and elsewhere and the manner in which people have suffered as a result. Ireland has participated actively in helping to alleviate some of the problems, including health problems affecting children. That experience illustrates the serious problems of radioactivity and the importance of proper safety measures.</P>
    <P>Against the background of events in the United States, the expansion of British Nuclear Fuels, with its history of accidents and cover-ups, is disturbing. I concur with the view that we must take a firm approach on the issue at European and international level. It should be a priority for our Government in its dealings with Britain in relation to the commissioning of this extension of British Nuclear Fuels. The Minister of State and his predecessors have done good work in progressing the legal aspects with a view to bringing it under judicial review but it now needs a stronger input. The Minister of State needs the full support of the Irish people in pursuing this issue in the interests of all of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and the very worthwhile suggestions which emerged from it. Hopefully, that will have a beneficial effect. The views of the Seanad should be conveyed to the British ambassador and the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all ten Senators who contributed to this debate &ndash; Senators O'Dowd, Caffrey, Fitzgerald, Norris, Ross, Farrell, Ryan, Costello, Hayes and Chambers. A great deal of wisdom was expressed in the debate and there was also much concern. A common thread through all the contributions was the concern with regard to the safety factor and the danger which is presented by these installations so close to our shores. There was concern and anger, which underlay most of the contributions, at the decision by the UK Government to proceed with this plant, notwithstanding the present international situation, in the aftermath of the events of the 11 September in the USA, and the fact that Ireland had embarked on an initiative <Col N="231" /> last June, via the OSPAR process, to prevent the commissioning of this plant. The Irish Government, through my Department, had requested the UK authorities to defer any announcement and any decision with regard to the MOX plant until the proceedings under the OSPAR arbitration process had been concluded. I share the sentiments which were voiced in that regard during this evening's debate. I am quite horrified that that decision was taken, in the light of all those issues.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd and others complimented the Department officials and the RPII personnel on their excellent efforts in this matter. I welcome those comments, which I fully endorse. Several Senators spoke of the possibility of the UK ambassador being invited to address the Seanad on this matter. That is a matter for the Seanad &ndash; I do not know what the protocol may be. I have met a succession of British Ministers on numerous occasions, sometimes in London, sometimes in Dublin and also on the margins of other fora, to spell out loudly and clearly the objections and very serious concerns of successive Irish Government about the presence of nuclear facilities in the UK in such close proximity to our shores. Every possible opportunity and every possible forum has been and will continue to be used, at ministerial and official level.</P>
      <P>With regard to the MOX facility itself, I see it as perpetuating the reprocessing facilities at Sellafield. That is the issue we have targeted in the OSPAR process. Senator Costello reviewed the question of our success, and I do not blame him for that, but there have been successes. Under a previous Government, which included his own party, there was a significant success in objecting to the proposed NIRAX waste storage facility at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OSPAR Convention, which Ireland played a major role in putting together, has been very successful, involving 15 countries and the European Union. There are 16 signatories to it. It was advocated in the discussion tonight that we bring other countries along with us. There is an opportunity which has been availed of to repeatedly bring our concerns and objections to that forum. We had the oppportunity to table a motion before the OSPAR meeting of June 2000 calling for the complete cessation of reprocessing facilities at Sellafield. Our good colleagues and friends in this battle, as I unapologetically call it, the Danish Government, had a similar and less robust proposal before the same convention. A modified version of those two motions successfully went through that session of OSPAR. Some 12 countries voted with the Irish and the Danes. That sent out a very clear message, if we want to get a message across internationally, of our concerns and objections, particularly as maritime countries, countries with which OSPAR is concerned, with regard to contamination of the sea and the protection of our maritime environment. Naturally, we are concerned about the Irish Sea while our <Col N="232" /> more northerly colleagues, the Nordic countries, are concerned about their fishing grounds. The OSPAR forum is ideally suited to take action and make all possible progress to maintain our seas, waters and fishing grounds in a non-polluted fashion, particularly in a non-nuclear polluted fashion.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly called particularly for the cessation of reprocessing activities at Sellafield because reprocessing equals discharges into the Irish Sea, or the marine environment. In our case, our immediate concern is the Irish Sea. A decision has been taken to perpetuate it by way of this new reprocessing facility &ndash; the MOX plant &ndash; to which we have objected. It represents an expansion of nuclear activities.</P>
    <P>The safety culture at Sellafield was mentioned by a number of Senators. A decent, proper, reliable and credible safety culture does not exist. As I said, the Nordic countries have been working hand in hand with us in objecting to these facilities. I journeyed to the Nordic countries in preparation for the meeting in June 2000. The Danish Minister visited me and I went to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland. I had excellent meetings at ministerial level in those countries.</P>
    <P>Our efforts and those of successive Governments to bring an end to this blight on our doorstep and this malaise, which is precisely what it is, have taken on a whole new vista and perspective given the present situation. The way to bring these facilities to an end, as we have repeatedly requested for many years, is via the economics of the business. It is not economic nor will it be. The business, that is, BNFL's nuclear activities at Sellafield and elsewhere, will no longer be economically viable without MOX. It is very questionable whether the business will be economically viable even with MOX and therein lies our case in the first instance under OSPAR.</P>
    <P>Colleagues in this House and concerned people outside can take it that the Government from the Taoiseach down is absolutely adamant that on this occasion the legal process will be followed. This has already been embarked upon. It was initiated last June via OSPAR and will be pursued under EU law, the EURATOM Treaty and the EU treaty. It will be pursued, if necessary, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. These options are being looked at by our advisers, will be brought to the Attorney General very shortly to finalise the matter and go to Government again very soon. The Government is determined not to rest on its laurels in this case, but to go down every possible avenue, particularly the legal route, to prevent this plant. I am reliably advised that some time will elapse before it can be fully commissioned. These legal paths will be followed to prevent this plant from being commissioned and presenting a further and ongoing hazard to the people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to sub-post offices. I call for urgent action to be taken to ensure the network of sub-post offices in cities and rural areas is maintained and that the 12% increase in remuneration is paid immediately to postmasters and postmistresses.</P>
      <P>I need not go into any great detail to explain the importance of the network of sub-post offices throughout the country and the role they have played in providing a very valuable community service as well as an economic service. They are located in every village and city. The present threat is looming very large. Last year 52 post offices closed while two reopened.</P>
      <P>There is very little interest among people in replacing post offices when, for one reason or other, the postmaster or postmistress shuts down the operation. The reason is obvious since only 30% of all postmasters or postmistresses are earning the average industrial wage and 70% earn less than the average industrial wage. Clearly we have not been looking after our postmasters and postmistresses in an economic sense. Their remuneration has been bad and overheads, costs and rental for premises have been going up. The situation has been deteriorating in the past few years to the extent that we can now see the post office system going deeply into the red in the future. At the same time we must recognise that this is a service which is necessary and a service of community solidarity as well as an economic service. We must come up with a plan which will mean that service can be provided.</P>
      <P>The Minister has produced her own plan, which involves putting a forum in place &ndash; everyone will sit around the table and that will resolve the matter. However, the problem now is that the contract won by the postmasters and postmistresses in relation to the PostPoint service is seen as a dangerous one from their point of view in that the services being provided by the different agencies connected with Eircom are viewed as points whereby further post office services would be offered, further undermining the post office network. The PostPoint service is now a major bone of contention.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State well knows, there was a protest outside Leinster House when the Dáil and Seanad resumed. Balloting was due to finish on 5 October, last Friday. All indications are that industrial action will be announced on 12 October. Clearly the situation is dire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to link the 12% remuneration to the forum has meant we are in a state of chaos, as PostPoint and remuneration are now tied <Col N="234" /> together and a strike ballot will result in total stalemate. What is required is a commitment from the Minister to get on with the package. It has been indicated by the postmasters' union that approximately half, or 500, of their members would be willing to accept a decent redundancy package. That is the way to go about it, not using a big stick as the Minister seems to be doing at present, introducing all sorts of conditions for the forum. She should go about this by using an incentive, bringing postmasters and postmistresses on board while seeing how we can maintain the network of post offices and expand their services &ndash; we saw recently that the banks are withdrawing from face to face and customer contact. We must ensure also that the promised remuneration is paid quickly so there is not a sour taste or a strike which could easily be avoided. We can see the situation deteriorate and we could easily see a strike early next week and further protests outside the House. I hope the Minister of State has some good news regarding a way out of this morass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for raising this issue and I am glad to be here to respond. In February last year the Minister requested Phil Flynn to carry out a review of the sub-post office network in the context of the Government's explicit commitment to the retention of the rural sub-post office network in the White Paper on rural development, given that regional and rural development are cornerstones of the Government's economic and social development policy. Mr. Flynn's terms of reference were twofold, first, to review the financial and business environment of the sub &ndash; post office network and, second, to examine options and make recommendations on the sustainable development of the rural sub-post office network against the background of the obligation of An Post to provide a nationwide service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts as outlined in the report are stark. The company operates a network of 1,914 offices, the highest <i>per capita </i>in the EU, and 97 of these are staffed by the company &ndash; 1,817 are subcontracted offices. A significant proportion of these sub offices are loss-making, with a very small volume of transactions. The post office division made a loss of nearly £3 million in 2000 on a turnover of £83 million. Due to increasing costs and falling margins, further significant losses are projected by the management of An Post based on current tariffs and the existing network structure, rising from £12 million this year to nearly £28 million in 2004. Total losses over the four year period 2001-04 are forecast at nearly £80 million. These projections have been independently verified as accurate. The post office division is critically dependent on just three contracts for 80% of its revenue, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for social welfare payments, the National Treasury Management Agency for saving services and RTE for licence <Col N="235" /> collection. These customers are held under short-term contracts, all of which are either currently or shortly up for renewal.</P>
    <P>The implications of the report for the network are clear. The current situation, which I have briefly outlined, is unsustainable and threatens the continuation of the existing level of services as well as the future viability of the An Post group. The Government, An Post and the union representing postmasters, the IPU, agree that remedial action is urgently required to ensure the future of the network and the widest range of quality services to its customers.</P>
    <P>The Flynn report outlined a wide range of scenarios, options and recommendations to guarantee the future viability of the network. In light of the report the Minister announced on 4 April last that the Government had decided to establish an interdepartmental group to assess options for the long-term viability of the post office services. The group's report, published in July, provides the framework for the development of a viable post office network service, which meets the requirements of both the customer and the operator.</P>
    <P>In the context of the report, the Government has agreed first that short-term actions by An Post need to focus on the pilot introduction of postal agency arrangements and, second, that in situations where it is impossible to continue a post office service on an agency basis, a Government services outlet network would be developed, having regard to the availability of already existing equivalent community-based or statutory services so as to meet the needs of the community within each county.</P>
    <P>The Government also agreed to an equity injection of £10 million to An Post on the basis that this would facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms, in particular through payment of the increase for sub-postmasters recommended in the Flynn report. This equity stake is subject to clearance by the European Commission as it may constitute a State aid. We have therefore made a submission to the Commission for clearance under the State aid regime. The Minister also met representatives of the Commission to press Ireland's case for an early and positive response to our request.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided to establish a partnership forum to oversee the developments in the network. The first meeting of the forum, which is chaired by Phil Flynn, took place on Monday, 1 October. One of the first commitments the Minister gave when appointed in June 1997 concerned the post office network. She promised that there would be no forced closures of post offices, and that position has not changed since. The Government remains committed to a viable and competitive post office network. I am aware of and appreciate the work undertaken during the years by postmasters and postmistresses in the provision of excellent services for customers, particularly in rural areas. The Minister and the Government are committed to ensuring the pub<Col N="236" /> lic service ethos of the post office network will remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. He will be aware that small and medium sized farmers, particularly those in County Clare, are experiencing significant difficulties due to a combination of factors such as the inability to sell cattle as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak in the earlier part of the year. The fact that farmers had to hold on to cattle and provide them with additional fodder was very costly.</P>
      <P>A number of dairy and beef farmers are participating in the control of farm pollution scheme for which there has been a substantial uptake throughout the country. I appreciate that the £15 million set aside for grant payments under the scheme has already been spent. Many farmers are awaiting the cheque from the Department, but, unfortunately, the bank is, in many instances, waiting for it too. Farmers are paying interest on loans they have taken out. The situation might not be as serious as it is were it not for the unsold cattle and additional fodder payments.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has made representations to Brussels in regard to the difficulties being experienced by farmers, but the Department is surely in a position to meet a certain level of payments from Exchequer funding. I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in early August and was sure that the matter would have been dealt with in Brussels by mid-September. We are now in the middle of October and nothing has happened. I urge the Minister to explore other means of dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Small and medium sized farmers in what were traditionally known as disadvantaged areas are subject to the area based compensatory allowance scheme which is based on acreage rather than headage. Lowland farmers are benefiting to a greater degree than farmers with poorer land. Some farmers receive £70 per hectare while others receive £60 and £45. There are huge discrepancies between the various categories of farmers. I urge the Minister to increase payments in the lower and middle categories to £70 per hectare to avoid this distinction. It is ironic that the farmers with the best land are getting the most money. The Minister should remove the inequalities in this area. If one goes into particular townlands or parishes, one will find one farmer receives £3,100 while another receives only £1,600. The Minister of State, hailing from the fine land of Tipperary, may not appreciate the level of disadvantage about which I speak. However, he is a reasonable and logical man and I am confident he will recognise the need for fair play in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of farm incomes published last week showed that almost 60% of farmers earn less than <Col N="237" /> £10,000 per annum while 63.5% earn less than the average industrial wage. Many farmers will not acknowledge this as their standing in local communities is a matter of pride. I urge the Minister to recognise the particular difficulties which have arisen this year and acknowledge the need for a special package to address them on a one-off basis.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see a person of long-standing being added to the ticket. Having fought for it, today's achievement is a personal success for the Senator.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this matter on the Adjournment as my Department's performance, particularly in regard to the delivery of payments, has not always received the credit it warrants. I want to clarify the position regarding the control of farm pollution scheme which commenced in June 1999 and its successor, the farm waste management scheme, introduced in February this year.</P>
      <P>I will address the older scheme first as it is the one about which there is most concern. The scheme came into operation on 28 June 1999 as a State aid with formal approval from the Commission for expenditure of up to £15 million. It proved highly successful and applications far exceeded expectations. Up to May this year, my Department made payments amounting to almost £15 million under the scheme in respect of 2,400 individual applicants, and had, therefore, reached the ceiling imposed by the Commission. By that stage, my Department had been in discussion with the Commission about raising the ceiling for payments under the scheme. This is a technical issue which the Department has vigorously pursued with the Commission for a number of months.</P>
      <P>There is an inevitable and time consuming series of formal procedures through which applications of this nature must be processed by the Commission. As a result, some 650 payments have been temporarily delayed. However, as the Minister stated in reply to parliamentary questions yesterday, a positive response is expected shortly. As soon as approval to increase the ceiling is received, all outstanding payments will issue immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Commission closes down in August.</P>
      <P>The farm waste management scheme was approved under Agenda 2000 and, together with schemes for dairy hygiene and alternative enterprises, was formally launched in February 2001. The total amount of funding for these schemes in the period 2002-06 is in the region of £260 million, of which £180 million is allocated to the farm waste management scheme.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, these schemes were only up and running a few weeks before the foot and mouth crisis and to control the imminent threat of this terrible disease, the Department had to impose an immediate ban on farm visits. This meant that none of the applications received under the new scheme could be approved since the conditions of the scheme require that departmental inspectors visit each applicant to examine the position on the ground. While the ban on farm visits was lifted at the end of May, the majority of these inspectors remain assigned to foot and mouth disease duties and this has seriously affected the rate at which applications can be approved.</P>
      <P>We are making progress, however. Up to 30 September, 2,019 applications had been received under the new farm waste management scheme, of which about 50% have been processed while just under 600 have been approved to proceed. Nonetheless, to speed up the rate at which the remaining applications can be approved, my Department has sought permission from the European Commission to reduce the level of pre-approval inspections required. We hope that, as a temporary measure, we can avoid having to carry out inspections in every case and instead approve most remaining applications on the basis of a detailed desk check. The Commission is at present considering our request. I stress that no payments are outstanding to any applicant under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme was agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan. The new arrangements involve a cost of about £180 million in 2001, representing an increase of about £60 million over the old animal-based headage scheme. It is estimated that about 75,000 farmers stand to gain from these new arrangements while, compared with payments under the old animal-based headage scheme, 24,000 stood to lose money. However, a compensation package has been negotiated with the European Commission under which 90% of any loss would be made good this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payments now being made to farmers include this compensation for losses in appropri<Col N="239" /> ate cases. It should also be noted that payments under the new scheme commenced on Friday, 21 September, as agreed in the protocol on direct payments to farmers and £147 million has been paid to date to 85,434 farmers, representing over 86% of the total number of applicants. This compares very favourably with the figure of just over £68 million which was paid to farmers at this time <Col N="240" /> last year under the old animal-based headage schemes. The new scheme is currently being reviewed with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land, such as those to whom the Senator referred.</P>
