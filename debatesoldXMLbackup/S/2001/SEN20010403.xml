    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and on which Senators may share time; No. 2, statements on the implications for tourism of foot and mouth disease, not to be taken before 4 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue on the Order of Business which is relevant because it will determine the way we do our business for the rest of this session. When I became a Member of this House in 1981, I was told by the then Fianna Fáil Whip, Senator Willie Ryan, that the House ran on the principles of consultation and co-operation. I have always worked on that basis, and in those days there used to be Whips' meetings which would sort out the business for the coming week. They are now just a memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> Last week I was told by the Leader that this week we would be taking Second Stage of the Waste Management Bill, and I agreed to that. On Thursday, when the Whip arrived, I was told we were taking all Stages on Friday. This was done without consultation, without the agreement of the Opposition or advance notice. It was simply sent to me by the Leader of the House as a <i>fait accompli</i>. I wrote to the Leader and expressed my concerns. I copied my letter to the leaders of the other groups. Since then, I have not received even an acknowledgement of that letter from the Leader.</P>
    <P>I may not be much but I am Leader of the Opposition here and when I write to the Leader of the House on a matter which concerns me and all the Opposition groups, I have a right to expect at least the courtesy of an acknowledgement or a reply. I believe I have been treated in a contemptuous way by the Leader of the House on this matter. It is not the first time he showed contempt for institutions in the past week.</P>
    <P>I could say more but I ask the Leader if there is any good reason we are being asked to steamroll an important and contentious Bill through the House this week. There is no crisis. <Col N="3" /> We can take Committee Stage next Tuesday and Report Stage next Wednesday. There is no difficulty in doing that but why are we being asked to take both Stages on Friday when there is clearly no emergency? This Bill took three years to prepare and those of us in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to rubber-stamp it through in two days. Everyone here knows that when Committee and Report Stages are taken on the same day, there is no possibility of amendments being accepted.</P>
    <P>The Leader can either consult with the leaders of the Opposition later and agree to take this business into next week, when he will have full co-operation from this side of the House, or he can agree to go ahead with what are steamrolling tactics. If he does that, however, the principle of co-operation will be withdrawn from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments of Senator Manning. I have written in the same terms, on behalf of our group, to the Leader of the House in the sense that this is highly controversial legislation and people should have the time to deal with it. We know difficult decisions will have to be taken. There are different views on all sides of the House and it would be wrong and irresponsible to push this Bill through the House. There should be as much agreement as possible on the Bill. There will be enough differences on its content without having a row about the procedure or the process through which we put it through the House. I want to make it clear to the Leader that this process should be done by agreement. We should have had some interaction as to how the Bill would be taken.</P>
      <P>On a completely different issue, I want to ask the Leader about his intention in regard to the Nice treaty. The Government has set 31 May as a probable date for the referenda. We are aware that, constitutionally, the legislation has to be passed a month before that date, but is there a case for having a debate on the White Paper prior to publication of the heads of the Bill or the actual Bill? As the Government, the Opposition and most commentators are concerned about the lack of debate in this area, it might be helpful if we debated the White Paper before we debate the merits or demerits of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We raised here last week the issue of the impact of President Bush's attitude to the Kyoto agreement. This week we see resonances of the Cold War coming to our screens with the current issue in China. Our Government, as a member of the Security Council, should speak both to the Chinese and the US ambassadors and tell them that this does not look well for the developed world. It is the kind of operation we could do without. People can spy on each other without flying over each other's air space. There is nothing private in this globe. This is simply two <Col N="4" /> turkey cocks facing up to each other and we should ensure that we do not give it support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said by Senators Manning and O'Toole in relation to the Order of Business. I am thankful to the Leader of the House for bringing the Waste Management Bill into this House. The taking of Committee and Report Stages of an important Bill at the same time is becoming a crisis. To take all Stages in a couple of days in the same week is unsatisfactory. We have highlighted this before. If there is some pressing reason to get legislation through, I would welcome consultation on this. I have not the slightest problem sitting on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The problem lies in our not having time to put forward proper amendments, reflect on them and deal with a matter that has been raised week after week in this House &ndash; the way in which we deal with waste management in our society. I urge the Leader of the House to defer the remaining Stages of the Bill from Friday until the following week.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has agreed to change her mind and stay on for at least another 12 months. After she announced her decision not to remain for a second term, it emerged that she has had a budget of only $20 million out of a full budget of $1 billion and that most of her staff are part-time. Therefore, the stance that she has taken is well worthwhile. I hope the result of that stance is that we will get a far more firm approach to human rights from both the UN and the states with which she has dealt.</P>
      <P>I ask for a another debate on the drugs issue because it is a long time since we have had one. The recent seizure of £2 million worth of heroin has highlighted the fact that there is a huge trade in this country and that a link-up between British and Irish drug-smuggling gangs is being developed. I compliment the Garda on their success, but given that there are approximately 8,000 to 10,000 heroin addicts on the streets of Dublin alone, we need to look at the broader issues as well, the question of rehabilitation and the manner in which we deal with addicts in our society.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Manning has said on the ordering of business for this week. I thought we had all agreed and that the Leader had informed us that, except in a case of extreme urgency, and we have had a few of those, we would not have a situation such as has been proposed for this week.</P>

      <P>Today is Tuesday. The Order of Business that has been proposed by the Leader is for today. I did allow considerable latitude to Senator Manning and the leaders of the groups to make some general points in relation to the Order of Business, but I cannot allow other Senators to discuss the business of Thursday or Friday. The Order of Business for Thursday will be dealt with on Thursday morning and so on. I ask the Senator to refrain from dealing with business which may or may not arise later in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will. I fully support what has been said and I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I note that in his report on the planning inquiry to the council and the Minister, the Kerry county manager has pointed out that, at national level, the regulations regarding the identification and registration of agents and also those who prepare drawings and planning applications need to be tightened up. Furthermore, he has pointed out that section 135 of the new Planning and Development Act requires the council to implement a full code of practice. Equally, he has stated that this section of the Act has not been brought into operation. Despite this lack, the manager has drawn up his own code for Kerry. Is it the Government's intention to have uniformity throughout the country regarding this important matter, or will the Kerry code be specific to the county? In the light of the further reports that are due to flow in from various councils throughout the country over the next 48 hours or so, what will the position be?</P>
      <P>We urgently need to hear from the Government how section 135 of the Act is intended to operate. I was inclined to assume that it should be applied on an even-handed basis throughout the country. I look forward to the Leader's words of advice and wisdom in respect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House welcomes the announcement from the UN High Commissioner, Mrs. Robinson, that she intends to renew her mandate. I raise this issue in the context of putting a question to the Leader and, perhaps, to the Cathaoirleach as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. A delegation from the sub-committee on human rights, which included Senator Norris and me, had the privilege to meet Mrs. Robinson on a visit to Geneva last week. I do not intend to suggest that Senator Norris and I were responsible for ensuring that she will either seek a second term or serve an extended first term, but the views we expressed were in keeping with comments made by others. She admitted that she had been overwhelmed by the response and reaction of those attending the Commission on Human Rights currently in train in Geneva.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of this and of the high esteem in which Mrs. Robinson is held, under the procedures adopted by the House relating to access to non-<Col N="6" /> Members, which allowed President Santer to come before us, I formally propose that consideration be given to inviting Commissioner Robinson to address the House on the issue of human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention that if a Senator wishes to have a particular individual invited to the House, he or she should submit that proposal or suggestion in writing to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. There is a convention that we do not discuss in the House who may or may not be invited to address it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his ruling. In the interests of clarification, is he stating, therefore, that no Member has the right to enter this Chamber and expound on the reason that a particular individual should be invited to address the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments on the way the business of the House is being conducted. It is remarkable that he made such a trenchant contribution because he is a man of moderation, balance and good sense and it takes a great deal for him to be provoked into making a statement of the kind he made. I know the Leader is fully conscious of the dignity of the House and wishes to maintain it and I am sure the actions that have been taken were not deliberate. I serve as Whip for the Independent group and I knew nothing about the proposal to take all Stages of the Bill this week, which is quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that matter because it does not arise on today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader should continue to be conscious of the vulnerability of the Seanad, particularly in light of the contempt with which various Governments have treated it. One classic example of this is that when a Bill is passed by the Dáil, it is virtually impossible, on many occasions, to have amendments to it accepted in this House because it does not suit the Government to have the legislation recommitted to the Dáil. In my opinion, that is treating the Upper House with a certain amount of contempt. However, I will leave the matter aside in deference to the Cathaoirleach's ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is astonishing that more of a fuss has not been made of President Bush's withdrawal from the Kyoto agreement. This action represents a potential disaster for the entire planet. However, we should not really be surprised because when President Bush was elected I stated that it would be a case of &ldquo;back to the future with Bush&rdquo;. The Cold War is recommencing, treaties are being <Col N="7" /> welshed on and it is clear that he is a prisoner of industrial interests. America has only 5% of the world's population but it produces 25% of its atmospheric pollution and it is now abrogating a treaty which was freely entered into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely not. I wish to request a debate on the Kyoto agreement.</P>
      <P>I will not trespass further on the Cathaoirleach's goodwill with regard to the question of inviting Mrs. Robinson to address the House. However, I am sure this matter may be considered in the proper way. I share the sentiments of those who are glad she was persuaded to reconsider her position. As an astute tactician, she may well have gained some advantage, in a negotiating sense, from what she did. When a delegation from this House visited her office and had a very useful exchange of views, we observed her busy schedule which involves meetings from early morning with Foreign Ministers, Prime Ministers and Presidents and subsequently chairing meetings in the afternoon. Her work is accomplished with rather limited staff resources. We can be proud that she has had strong, committed support from the Irish Government in her work. I ask the Leader to convey to the appropriate Ministers the continuing support of the House for Mrs. Robinson and for her important work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Leader of the House, I express our sincere sympathy, on behalf of all Senators, to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, on the death of her father, Michael. I also extend our sympathy to the Tánaiste's mother, Mrs. Sarah Harney, and her brothers and sister, on their sad bereavement.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Coghlan and Norris expressed their views on the business to come before the House during the coming weeks. I assure Senator Manning and the House that no disrespect was intended. A meeting of party leaders and Whips can be held later this evening, perhaps after 6.30 p.m. when I have been briefed by the Government Chief Whip, in relation to how our options can be reviewed.</P>
      <P>This is a very good week for the House, with two further Bills being initiated here. The Waste Management Bill is of major importance, dealing with a matter which poses a great challenge to local authorities and to the public, and I have no intention of it being steamrolled through the House. When a Bill is initiated in the House in a particular week, the remaining Stages should normally be taken in the following week. However, as former Leaders of the House, Senators Manning and Lanigan will be aware that when the Government calls for a Bill to be dealt with in the House, the order of the day has to be suspended to accommodate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> There are four Bills coming to the House in relation to proposed referenda. Because of time constraints, I do not expect the referenda to proceed on 31 May. I understand that the date will be very early in June. Accordingly, we as party Whips and leaders will need to consider how we can facilitate that legislation within the time available. It is my very earnest wish that consultation and negotiation will be the order of the day at all times in determining how our legislative work is arranged. I take the criticism in the manner in which it was expressed, in terms of upholding the status and dignity of the House. Before this Government took office in 1997, there was no period when so much legislation was initiated in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Mooney and Norris welcomed the announcement by our former President, Mrs. Robinson, of her intention to continue for a further term as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. I join in those sentiments and will pass on the good wishes of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on the drugs issue, for which I will allocate time. I congratulate those responsible for the drug seizure which was reported today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present Ordnance Survey Ireland or OSI is a Civil Service office under the aegis of the Minister for Finance. The primary purpose of this Bill is to set up OSI as a State body outside the Civil Service. This will enable OSI to have the freedom to operate with a more commercial focus, subject to appropriate controls. The Bill also makes provision that OSI will be required to provide for the State specific services to high standards of quality and value for money in return for a subvention from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth recalling that Ordnance Survey Ireland has a long and illustrious history of providing a mapping service to the State. Ordnance Survey Ireland or, as it is more colloquially known, The Survey, was established <Col N="9" /> in 1824 as a centralised agency to provide mapping for the State. However, no organisation is static and the role of Ordnance Survey Ireland has evolved greatly since its foundation. From the early 20th century, its role in support of Government services developed still further as mapping became an increasingly important prerequisite for land valuation, land registration and asset recording for local authorities and utilities. Today, the products and services offered by Ordnance Survey Ireland extend to the commercial sector and the unprecedented prosperity achieved under this Administration's stewardship of the economy has also been accompanied by a large increase in commercial demand for the products and services produced by OSI.</P>
    <P>The environment in which OSI operates has changed dramatically in the most recent decades. Over the past 20 years map-making has been transformed from a hand-drawn activity to a digital process which employs the most advanced information technology. As a result, all maps in Ordnance Survey Ireland are now stored digitally rather than in paper form. This means, for example, that customers who call to OSI headquarters or OSI agents can now get within minutes a specially printed map for anywhere in Ireland which meets their particular requirements.</P>
    <P>The advent of cheaper and more efficient technology has also led to the emergence of geographic information systems or GIS. GIS combines map data with computer software to produce a powerful tool for analysing information. GIS is now an important part of the information society and there are hundreds of companies throughout the world producing thousands of GIS products. Among the myriad ways in which GIS can be used by the commercial sector is to link their customer data with map data to identify new business opportunities. These new applications have considerably broadened the customer base for mapping data and the prospects are that the demand for new and improved products and services derived from this data will continue to grow strongly for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>It is against this changing background that the Government came to the conclusion that the restrictions imposed by its Civil Service status limit OSI's capacity to meet its customers' demands and to exploit new opportunities in the marketplace. Hence the necessity to bring forward this Bill to transform Ordnance Survey Ireland into a separate State body with a strong commercial remit. This conclusion has been validated by the findings of the interim board of OSI. In June 1997 the outgoing Government agreed to a proposal by the Minister for Finance to establish an interim board to advise the Minister for Finance on and to oversee the transition of OSI to a more commercial organisation. In April 1998 the interim board set out in a report its vision for the future of OSI. <Col N="10" /> It suggested that OSI has considerable scope to develop the market for its products and to reduce the size of the State subvention. The interim board concluded that the fundamental organisational change needed for OSI to fulfil adequately its public service responsibilities and to anticipate wider customer demands in the fixture would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The interim board reflects a wide range of users of OSI products and of other interest groups, including employer and employee groups. It is headed by Mr. Kevin Bonner, former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and consists of representatives of the wholesale booksellers trade, the Irish Mountaineering Council, chartered surveyors, local authorities, IBEC and ICTU. I take this opportunity to compliment the chairperson, Mr. Bonner, and the other members of the interim board on the excellent work they have done to date.</P>
    <P>A further reason for this Bill is to rectify the existing unsatisfactory situation where, despite its 177 year existence, there is no primary legislation governing OSI. All previous legislation, particularly the 19th century statutes, refers specifically to boundary survey work which is more relevant to the chief boundary surveyor who is attached to the Valuation Office. This Bill will rectify this and allow OSI to carry out its functions based on a sound legislative framework.</P>
    <P>Despite the change in status under this Bill, the OSI will continue, as it did for the previous 177 years, to provide mapping services for the State's administrative, legislative and infrastructural needs. These fall into four main operational categories: the updating and maintenance of the framework on which national mapping is based and on which very many industries such as construction, surveying, transport and air navigation depend; a programme to complete soon a new mapping infrastructure for rural Ireland; an ongoing maintenance and development programme to ensure that urban and rural tourism and leisure mapping databases are up to date; and a developing marketing and sales function to ensure that products and services are developed to meet the needs of public and private customers. The Bill provides that the OSI will continue to be the State's national mapping service and will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive maps and geographical information of the State, including those areas that it would not be commercially viable to map.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the State with the quality services it needs, the OSI, despite its commercial focus, will continue to need Exchequer subvention. A financial scoping study, commissioned by the interim board to show what would be the OSI's financial position as a stand-alone commercial body, suggested that, on the basis of the revenues then being generated, the <Col N="11" /> OSI's costs would leave an annual deficit for the foreseeable future of more than half its revenues.</P>
    <P>The amount and the terms and conditions of the Exchequer subsidy will be in a service agreement between the OSI and the Minister for Finance. The agreement will set out in detail the range of activities OSI will carry out in the national interest. It will describe each such activity, the justification for and benefits arising from it, and details of the deliverables to be provided by OSI, including their standard and quality. It will state the amount of the subsidy to be allocated to each of the individual activities. An important benefit of the service agreement is that, in clearly identifying the national interest element in mapping, it will prevent the cross-subsidisation from the public purse of the OSI's commercial activity.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the service agreement between the Minister for Finance and the OSI may contain terms and conditions of product pricing. The OSI's pricing policy should adhere to the principle of ensuring that maximum use is made of its products and services by all sectors of Irish society, public and private.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that OSI, when engaging in commercial activity, may do so through subsidiary companies with limited liability set up under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999. Any necessary capital for such companies will not come from the public purse but will be raised in the marketplace on the basis of the project's commercial merits. There will be no cross-subsidisation of commercial activity from the Exchequer, either by way of capital or running costs.</P>
    <P>Measures in the Bill to ensure that there is no cross-subsidisation by the Exchequer include clear statements of the OSI's public interest functions, the requirement for a service agreement with the Minister for Finance to deliver specified public interest outputs in return for Exchequer money, and provision to establish separate limited companies by the OSI to operate on a purely commercial basis for each commercial product. OSI will operate transparent accounting practices to identify and separate commercial and non-commercial activities. It will also implement a fair and transparent pricing policy to ensure that its basic data is available to competitors in the marketplace on the same terms and conditions as to its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>OSI is preparing for its future as a commercially focused entity through the use of leading edge technology, to which I have already referred. Substantial sums have been allocated to OSI in recent years to ensure it uses up-to-date map production techniques. OSI is leading the way in the use of satellite positioning and is currently implementing a network of permanently operating global positioning system receivers for the country. This system is expected to be operational by the end of the year and will be controlled from a central computer in OSI <Col N="12" /> headquarters. Similarly, OSI has a very advanced in-house geographic information system, or GIS, that is used to store all collected digital mapping data and for the supply, editing and management of data. It is anticipated that supplying GIS users with digital mapping products will be a major area of business growth.</P>
    <P>In investing substantially in technology OSI has not neglected to invest in its staff, which is its major resource. The training of staff in new technology has been under way for many years. The Minister for Finance sanctioned a number of new managerial posts in anticipation of the move from the Civil Service, including a human resources manager, a corporate services manager, a marketing manager and an IT manager.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the staffing arrangements of the new body now that it will be operating outside the Civil Service. Ordnance Survey staff will cease to be civil servants on transfer to the new body. Meetings, including one with the Minister for Finance, have been held with staff association representatives to inform them at various stages of these plans and they are fully aware of the Bill's provisions on this and all other matters. The staff associations have welcomed the setting up of a semi-State body and are aware that their future, and that of OSI, lies with continuing to adapt to changing technological and user needs.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on a wide range of issues of concern to staff will continue with associations and unions in a partnership framework. It is intended that all staff currently employed by the Ordnance Survey will transfer to the new body. There are standard provisions in the Bill to ensure that pay, terms and conditions of employment, including superannuation benefits, are maintained in the new body. The OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park and its six regional offices located in Cork, Ennis, Longford, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tuam are not affected by the Bill. The question of the relocation of OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park, acknowledged not to be ideal for a modern mapping organisation, will be decided on in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>Through continually adopting the latest mapping technology over many years, the staff of OSI has achieved a complete transformation of all aspects of map-making. OSI has been brought to a point where it has potential for dramatic expansion of, and improvement in, the range of products and services which it can provide to customers. The achievement of this potential depends on the staff of OSI fully supporting the proposed new structures. I am confident this support will continue to be given if there is consultation at all stages.</P>
    <P>I will now outline for the House the key provisions of the Bill. Section 3 formally establishes a new body to be known as Ordnance Survey Ireland which will have its own powers and will be separate from the Civil Service. Section 4 sets out in detail the functions to be <Col N="13" /> performed by the body. The OSI's general function is to provide national mapping services for the administrative, legislative and infrastructural needs of the State. The OSI will be the national mapping service in the State and will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive maps and geographical information of the State. In other words, OSI's traditional role for the last 177 years will continue. This section also places a general duty of care on the new body to conduct all its business, both commercial and non-commercial, in a cost effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 allow the Minister for Finance to give directions to OSI and to confer additional functions on it. Section 7 allows OSI to establish subsidiary companies with limited liability when engaging in commercial activity. It is a key element of the Bill that the OSI, when engaging in commercial activity, does so through subsidiary companies with limited liability set up under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999. Any necessary capital will not come from the public purse but will be raised in the marketplace by reference to the commercial merits of the project concerned. There are two main advantages to this approach. First, the Exchequer's liability in potential loss making situations is limited and, second, in keeping commercial activity separate from national interest mapping activity, cross-subsidisation from the Exchequer is avoided.</P>
    <P>Section 8 allows OSI to hold and dispose of shares or other interests in a company with the Minister's consent. Section 9 allows the OSI or any subsidiary to borrow money but the Minister may set ceilings on such borrowings.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives OSI staff powers to enter private lands and premises in connection with the carrying out of their functions. It also authorises OSI to place survey marks on any land or premises for the purposes of supporting the national grid, geodetic or height frameworks. Where an authorised person is prevented from entering lands or premises when carrying out OSI functions, the Bill provides for a warrant to be obtained from the District Court to allow required access. Obstruction of a member of OSI staff in the exercise of his or her powers under the section will be an offence, as will the intentional destruction or removal of an OSI survey mark. A person found guilty of an offence under this section will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 13 provide that there shall be a board of the OSI and that members may be remunerated from funds at the disposal of OSI. These sections also contain the provisions in regard to the appointment of a chairperson and deal with the meetings and procedures of the board of OSI.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the appointment of a chief executive officer. The chief executive officer will be appointed by the board and will hold office subject to the terms and conditions which may be determined by the board with the consent <Col N="14" /> of the Minister for Finance. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the staff, administration and business of OSI. He or she will be the person charged with the day to day running of the new OSI and the carrying out of its functions under the Bill and will be answerable to the board. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the propriety of OSI's accounts and the economic and efficient use of its resources. He or she will also be answerable to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up to examine OSI's affairs.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 17 outline the provisions for the transfer of staff from the Civil Service to the new body. Staff will cease to be civil servants on transfer to the new body and these sections contain the provisions for their remuneration and superannuation. There is a guarantee that the pay and terms and conditions of employment, including superannuation benefits, will not be less favourable in the new body than those prevailing before the changeover date. Sections 20 to 22 provide for the disclosure of interests by staff, members of the board of OSI and directors of a company set up as a subsidiary of OSI.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that the Minister may make an agreement &ndash; entitled a &ldquo;service agreement&rdquo;&ndash; with OSI which will deal with the performance of its public functions. This is a key element of the Bill. The service agreement will set out in detail the range of activities OSI will carry out in the national interest and the amount of the subsidy from the Exchequer for so doing. A further important benefit of the service agreement is that by clearly identifying the national interest activities of OSI, it will also prevent the cross-subsidisation from the public purse of any OSI commercial activity.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the keeping of accounts and the conduct of audits of the financial accounts of OSI. Responsibility for the accounts rests with the chief executive officer. The accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the audit report will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that OSI will make an annual report to the Minister. Section 30 expressly allows the OSI to charge for its products and services. Sections 32 to 36 deal with the dissolution of the existing Ordnance Survey and the transfer of assets, liabilities, contracts and pending legal proceedings to the new body.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey was established in 1824 to provide a national mapping service. The operational environment has changed dramatically in recent years and there is now a need for OSI to become a more clearly focused business organisation while at the same time continuing its public service role. This Bill allows the OSI to build on the strengths it already possesses and provides it with the freedom to operate with a more commercial focus while at the same time ensuring appropriate public policy safeguards. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> For Members' information, I am due in the Dáil immediately for Question Time but I will return as soon as possible. I apologise for this clash between my responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill's purpose is to establish OSI as a separate State body. The Ordnance Survey office, located in Dublin, has a long and interesting record extending from the early years of the State until well after the last war. The Ordnance Survey reflected faithfully the state of the country, which was mainly agricultural at that time, with little or no change in city and rural areas.</P>
      <P>It was only in the 1950s that Dublin, in particular, began to change as the population slowly grew as a result of the drift in population from rural to urban areas. In recent years that drift has turned into a rush, which has created many of the socials problems which exist today. If the Ordnance Survey office was to deal with this change, it needed to be modernised.</P>
      <P>The modern Ordnance Survey dates from around the mid-1960s when a Government committee, set up to look at the state of mapping in Ireland, made sweeping recommendations such as a re-survey of all urban areas, revising and re-mapping of rural areas, revising and updating of tourist maps, etc. Implemented in the early 1970s, the new policy brought new thinking and new challenges to the Ordnance Survey and with them new buildings and of course new technology.</P>
      <P>New technology has radically changed the role of the Ordnance Survey. With modern technology, creating maps is light years removed from the way it used to be done. In the past, people sat down at their desks and worked with immense skill and application to produce maps of precision and beauty, works of art in their own right, and re-generating a map used to take years. Today it takes hours. Map makers often leave their office to go home in the evenings leaving a computer to print out their day's work and come in the following morning to find the map prepared. This modern technology has allowed Ordnance Survey to move aggressively into a broader role as a supplier of an ever-wider range of information. All urban areas in the country have been re-surveyed and are now in digital form. Rural areas have been re-surveyed, based on area photography and electronic imagery.</P>
      <P>In its mapping functions today, the Ordnance Survey is motivated towards what the customer wants. A good example of this is that instead of producing a general tourist map of any area, the Ordnance Survey will produce some specialist maps. These maps will be to the benefit of tourists who are interested in hill walking and rock climbing. Tourist research has shown that there is great demand for maps that specialise in these areas. There is also a wide range of specialist maps dealing with the monastic period and medieval Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> For local authorities mapping is essential for a wide variety of purposes. The greatest local authority use for mapping is in my local authority, Dublin Corporation, where there is a stock of 23,000 maps of the city. Even the oldest maps are essential in establishing present day property rights. The history of mapping in Dublin Corporation is much older than the Ordnance Survey, dating back to the 1670s.</P>
    <P>The most profitable role for Ordnance Survey is likely to come from the business and commercial world where the application of computer-based technology has opened up countless avenues for map use and the sort of information which maps contain. A typical instance would be underground plant maintenance involving such organisations as Eircom, the ESB or local authorities and using what is called geographic information system technology or GIS. A large-scale mapping database can be superimposed electronically on, for example, a grid of underground gas pipes. The collective image which results is micro metre perfect, marrying the Ordnance Survey map with the gas grid. This can then be used to produce a working plan on the site and give much quicker and more concise access to relevant data. Other utilities which avail of this facility are Eircom and the ESB. These electronic mapping methods can be used for other purposes and An Post has started to devise the most efficient delivery routes for its postal delivery workers.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector has also benefited from the new technology. Farmers have used maps more than anyone since the service was established because they own more territory than most. A map is needed for every sale of land. Many farm holdings are fragmented but if the farmer is able to supply OSI with his farm number, even if it is a fragmented holding, a map can be produced showing his property. This saves a lot of farming and administrative time, addressing as it does the difficulties farmers have with dispersed lands.</P>
    <P>These technological advances have resulted in the emergence of many new opportunities for OSI but currently the restrictions imposed by its Civil Service status limit its capacity to exploit them and meet customers demands. This legislation assists the transformation of Ordnance Survey Ireland into a separate State body with a commercial remit which will continue to carry out its traditional mapping functions for the State. Ordnance Survey Ireland has achieved a complete transformation of all aspects of map making over recent years and, as a result, is now at a point where it has the potential to expand and improve the range of products and services it can provide. The Bill allows Ordnance Survey Ireland to fulfil that remit.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows the usual form in setting up a State body, in the appointment of a chairperson, a board and a chief executive but when it is passed the staff of OSI will lose their Civil Service status. I note from what the Minister has said that meetings have taken place with the staff and the <Col N="17" /> staff association and that certain guarantees have been given to them in the Bill. If the staff are happy with these guarantees then I am only too pleased to support the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, and the legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those working in the Ordnance Survey who have provided the State with such a wonderful service over the years. They are those who are hidden away but upon whom we depend for the relevant maps which are so necessary to the many transactions carried out daily, monthly and annually. This Bill, while it acknowledges that major contribution, is taking the Ordnance Survey work into the 21st century. It is setting up a State body with a brief to continue the work that has been done for the past 177 years and providing it with further opportunities to move into the commercial field. That opens up the possibility of work in the private sector and I am pleased the legislation incorporates that.</P>
      <P>New technology made it inevitable that the Government would legislate for this new body. The whole process of drawing up and amending maps has changed dramatically in recent years due to information technology and scientific advances. As someone from an agricultural background, I still find it difficult to understand how an ordinary field on a family farm can be identified so vividly on an area aid map, which I understand is superimposed using technology. Many farmers find this difficult to understand. It brings modern technology right into the family farm.</P>
      <P>Area aid and holding maps are now very important for agricultural activity and are required when applying for premia and grants. New technology, therefore, is playing a part in some of the most remote areas of our land. It is available to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to peruse in order to establish people's rights as regards what they should receive under particular schemes.</P>
      <P>Another area of vital importance is the whole area of mapping town and city expansion. This was brought home to me very vividly recently when considering the county development plan for my own county, Roscommon. The chamber of commerce of Roscommon town pointed out to me that the map presented to the council was completely out of date and bore no resemblance to the present town.</P>
      <P>Having a commercial body involved with the local authority system will be important and creates a new situation. Local authorities have a responsibility to keep up with the changes taking place inside their functional areas. They should have up-to-date maps for all of the reasons that I have mentioned and, in particular, for the area of tourism which has moved into second position among the country's leading industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business and commercial sector will have a vehicle that was not available in the past when <Col N="18" /> the Ordnance Survey Ireland was solely a public service and people could only purchase a map from the survey office. This legislation will create a situation where not alone will the public service, the Government, Departments and local authorities be guaranteed the most modern mapping system, but the private commercial sector will also be able to avail of these services. Joint ventures between this new semi-State body and other bodies will also become possible. Commercial companies can be established to take advantage of that. This is a major change in the level of activity of the Ordnance Survey, and the opportunity presented by this new body, Ordnance Survey Ireland, will take mapping beyond being a reliable support to Government and into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by Senator Joe Doyle's comments regarding underground mapping. It must be a feature of the future and underground activity must be part of the development of Ireland in the 21st century. It is obscene that sufficient levels of ducting are not provided in major road projects to accommodate necessary services. I will give an example. When it was necessary to lay a fibre-optic cable across the Shannon in Athlone, the new bypass, which is only a few years old, had to be ripped up to accommodate the necessary ducting. Surely it should have been possible ten or 12 years ago to have mapped out and installed ducting in that £36 million development to accommodate services, not only the fibre-optic cable but also gas lines and whatever else. That should have been thought of at the time and mapped out by the Ordnance Survey. This would have meant that relevant public and commercial companies who needed to lay cables would only have had to consult the map of underground ducting to identify the route through which they needed to conduct their services.</P>
    <P>The level of destruction by public companies in the provision of ducting is a cause of great upset. An underground system of ducting is as important as the footpath system because it provides for necessary services on an ongoing basis. It should be provided and a map made available so that people could identify the route their services would take.</P>
    <P>The first ordnance survey was taken 177 years ago and the survey marks left in appropriate places throughout the country are intriguing. It was a lesson in history for me when I saw group water schemes being extended to rural areas some years ago. The engineer surveying for the group scheme was able to tell from the map that there should be a mark on a foundation stone in a specific location. It intrigued me that, after removing some rubble, he found the mark on the stone. From that he could tell the height and where a pumping station needed to be located. The people who conducted that first ordnance survey did wonderful work with limited technology in comparison to what is available today. It is appropriate that we compliment them and <Col N="19" /> those who have worked in the Ordnance Survey office in its 177 years of activity.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle said the mapping system for Dublin dates back another 60 or 70 years before that. A mapping system was in place for the city prior to the Ordnance Survey office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That was long before the Ordnance Survey. It is all part of our history but it is also an important part of the infrastructure of the country today.</P>
      <P>Finance is an area about which I have questions. What is the cost to the Exchequer of running the service? The Minister of State said the office would only be able to meet about 50% of its costs through revenues. What will be the projected annual running cost over the next five years? Surely in a sound commercial setting a body such as this doing such vital work should provide a great opportunity to raise revenues.</P>
      <P>I am pleased negotiations have taken place between the Government and the staff of the Ordnance Survey and that an amicable arrangement has been reached. No one wishes that people would be imposed upon. It is important that does not happen to the staff of the Ordnance Survey office who will now enter a commercial State body and who will no longer be civil servants but public servants. Their positions, conditions of employment and pension rights must be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>It is also important people are not imposed upon in the context of the ongoing discussion on decentralisation, something which may involve the Ordnance Survey in future. According to information available to me, six sub-offices are located in different towns throughout the country. This new body, Ordnance Survey Ireland, may in future be located outside the Phoenix Park in some town in the midlands or elsewhere. There is an ongoing debate on decentralisation and the relocation of 10,000 civil servants in various towns and centres of population. No more than the voluntary and agreed change from civil servant to public servant, it is important the relocation of people involves the same type of consultation and a similar agreement.</P>
      <P>I remembers some years ago the General Register Office was transferred to Roscommon town. It created a great hullabaloo at the time and was a welcome decision. Within days we discovered the majority of staff did not want to relocate and had never wanted to. They are still located in Dublin city. We do not want a similar situation to arise in the context of any new relocation of staff to the regions. It is important the regions are built up. The national and EU emphasis is on developing them, especially the Border, midlands and west region, to bring them in line with the rest of the country in terms of income. That is a side issue which is tied to the issue of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> This is a good decision. It recognises the reality of new technology and the opportunity it presents to this new body to map in a new way, which extends also to the commercial sector. I commend this legislation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is welcomed by all parties in the House, which makes me wonder why there are so many advisers &ndash; I count six. Perhaps they were expecting a huge assault or probing questions of a technical nature. They are all welcome. While they are here, I am sure they will have pleasure in admiring the contours of the ceiling, which is another production of the Georgian period. The Ordnance Survey just squeaks in under George IV. My only hesitation would be to seek a reassurance that the public function of the Ordnance Survey would not be in any sense inhibited by a diversion of energy into the public market, because it must first serve the needs of the State.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the history of the Ordnance Survey in Ireland. It is remarkable that there was no mention of the military aspect. This office, which is a very important one, was established principally as a method of imperial administration, and there was at least some degree of military application in terms of road networks and information which would be of use to the military. A distinguished former Member of this House, Brian Friel, wrote a very important play called &ldquo;Translations&rdquo; which centred on the question of the Ordnance Survey. That play brought to prominence another aspect of the Ordnance Survey, the recording of the names of townlands and that the Ordnance Survey is a record of a cultural shift that was quite painful for many people. There are all kinds of significance in the historical background of the Ordnance Survey Office.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that a question hangs over the relocation of the Ordnance Survey's headquarters in the Phoenix Park. I take a particular interest in this because of the physical plant there. I speak about the headquarters itself, the building which, if my recollection is correct, was a hunting lodge owned by Luke Gardiner, one of the principal property developers in the 18th century. One of the reasons the building is unsatisfactory is that it has not been properly maintained. There are problems of damp penetration and rot, and there is a problem with the roof. I hope that when the Ordnance Survey vacates this premises it will be turned to proper advantage by the State, perhaps as some kind interpretative centre, although I do not know whether another interpretative centre is needed. The building should at least be secured and made accessible to the public. I very much hope this is contained in the Minister's plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the reaction of the staff, I welcome the fact that negotiations have been successful. The Minister states that there has been a general welcome. In the detailed analysis of the key provisions of the Bill he states that there is a guarantee that the pay and terms and conditions <Col N="21" /> of employment, including superannuation benefits, will not be less favourable in the new body than were those prevailing before the changeover date. That is very much to be welcomed. In parenthesis, let me say that I know the Minister indicated that, like myself, he has a heavy cold or a touch of influenza. That must have suppressed his sense of irony. Otherwise when he came to section 25 he might have caught some rather curious and amusing cadences because the phrase &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo; occurs on a number of occasions. Perhaps, like me, he watches that marvellous programme &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo;, in which a Member of the other House continually intones that mantra. One is, of course, gratified that parts at least of this Bill are brought through this House in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes one is aware of the possibility of bilocation. The surreal atmosphere in the House sometimes leads to that.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we in this House should pay tribute to the outstanding work and artistic quality of many of the maps, to which Senator Doyle in particular referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not be completely lost. Even if the artistic quality is lost in a narrow sense, I hope that, at least, the very fine degree of detail is maintained. I am not quite sure &ndash; perhaps Senator Doyle can inform me on this &ndash; whether what I am about to refer to is from the previous generation of maps which were created by the offices of Dublin Corporation. In my own researches in North Great George's Street, for example, we have had recourse to the productions of the Ordnance Survey Office, and they are extraordinarily detailed. From what I take to be Ordnance Survey maps, which were issued to me as such, it is possible to tell the layout of the 18th century gardens of Dublin's inner city down to the level of the planting pattern of trees and the disposition of paths in the gardens. The degree of detail that is available is quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not just true of the city but of the countryside. My roots, like those of most Dubliners, are firmly ancestrally in the bog, in my case in County Laois. The wonderful book by John Feehan about County Laois, which incorporates a geological survey, comments on agriculture and so on, is very definitive, almost an encyclopaedia of Laois. I was delighted when I bought it to discover that the cover consists of an off-print from the map of what was then the Queen's County and that right in the centre of it is my grandfather's house, Spring Gardens. It gives one a wonderful sense of location to find in one's home county, one's grandfather's house right in the centre, thanks to the Ordnance Survey. One can <Col N="22" /> actually tell the shape of the house, the bow windows and so on. The Ordnance Survey has acquitted itself extremely well historically in terms of the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to bring this office into the era of modern technological change, the age of information technology. I am not very gifted in the world of computers which I leave to my colleague, Senator Quinn who, I am sure, will have much to say because he has pioneered this work in the House. In my day I used to see people training for the Geological Survey and the Ordnance Survey in Trinity College with their theodolytes and their tapes and their rulers. It was there that I first came across the phrase &ldquo;bench marking&rdquo; which now has another and more intriguing resonance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is very important that we bring the operations of the Ordnance Survey up to date. I have a question about the future disposition and fate of the headquarters in the Phoenix Park which is a very important building. I want to be reassured that the privatisation of a section of the work of the Ordnance Survey will not inhibit its public functioning. I welcome the fact that this move has been welcomed and agreed to by members of staff in the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    <P>I permit myself one further comment which follows from Senator Finneran's speech. I was not quite sure how relevant it was, but since he has opened it up I will comment on it. I refer to the question of ducting. Senator Finneran made a very eloquent attempt to introduce it directly as being under the remit of this Bill, but I am not sure that it is. He has certainly hit on a very important point. As a city dweller, I find it quite extraordinary that every second day a different utility opens up the roadway. I am sure this is also the case with county and urban councils in other areas. This work is often put out to tender to companies which dig up the road, shovel a load of tar on top and later reopen the road for something else. The whole thing is a complete mess and a waste of time and money. If only somebody would grasp this nettle, centralise the operation and put a major, easily accessible channel under the road, the majority of services could be accommodated. I am not sure how that ties in with the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill but it is a point worth making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Norris, I realise that a function of the Ordnance Survey in future could be to survey such areas so that future generations will not have to suffer as we have with road works being reopened. The information will all be there in black and white. Few public organisations have been in existence for over 175 years as the Ordnance Survey of Ireland has. It is a great tribute to its staff that the organisation has survived for almost two centuries. The Ordnance Survey is stronger than ever and this legislation will ensure that it continues to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey was established in 1824 and while I do not claim to be as well briefed on <Col N="23" /> British imperialism as Senator Norris, it is one of the aspects of British rule that we should be thankful for. Over a period of 177 years the Ordnance Survey surveyed the country, with its staff, both past and present, providing accurate and detailed maps of high quality. When I was at primary school I was always amazed that geography maps on the wall contained nothing but the limited detail of county boundaries, place names and towns. The Ordnance Survey maps, however, even at that stage, provided much greater detail of historic sites, including the martello towers in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The world is changing and so is the Ordnance Survey &ndash; it has moved from the days of copper plates and measuring chains to modern day technology. Today, the survey adopts a scientific approach to mapping the country's physical features. While the Government needs clear pictures of the country's physical landscape, the public sector also relies on good mapping and geographical information. Good quality mapping is needed for the development of many aspects of modern day Ireland, particularly transport infrastructure and land registration. We are all aware of the delays that can arise when dealing with the Land Registry, but I hope in future matters will move more swiftly with the digitisation of maps.</P>
    <P>The construction industry and, as Senator Doyle mentioned, our growing tourism and leisure industries, are among the many sectors that rely on the Ordnance Survey to supply mapping needs. Such geographical information is required for the continued good performance of the economy in the information age. The Ordnance Survey has developed significantly in recent years to meet the demands of the many customers it serves. It has improved the service to the public as demanded by the Government under the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>Its original purpose was to provide maps for the State and the State's administrative and legislative functions, but it has expanded to provide a wide range of products and services for commercial and industrial users. New technology has transformed the work of the Ordnance Survey, which has moved from manually prepared maps to digitised data. The market places many demands for new improved products. Ordnance Survey Ireland is currently limited in the services it can provide while operating within the public service. The legislation will enable Ordnance Survey Ireland to become a separate State body with the ability to deliver its services to the public and private sectors. The new body will continue to provide the State's mapping needs for administrative and legislative purposes.</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister's guarantees, the Bill will secure the future of the staff currently employed in the Ordnance Survey. Apart from pay and conditions, the Bill provides for the establishment of a proper pension scheme. Recently a number of Bills before the House related to the privatisation of State companies <Col N="24" /> and share options. No such provisions are contained in this Bill, although one never knows what may happen in future &ndash; perhaps the Ordnance Survey will be privatised. The staff should hang in there because one never knows what windfall may arise for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance can still direct the new body and confer additional purposes on it, if necessary. This is one of the areas about which I am slightly worried. Over the years we have seen many State bodies removed from the powers of a Minister or Department &ndash; I am referring to bodies such as An Bord Pleanála. Sometimes when one reads the inspector's report and the decision of the board, one is totally baffled. There should still be some political influence via the Minister for Finance. When one writes to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about planning matters one is told that he has no direct input. We have had great difficulties in Donegal with valuations being struck by the Valuation Office. When one writes to the Minister for Finance one is told that he has no input and no control but Ministers have control sometimes, when it suits them. Valuations done by people based in Dublin are based on Dublin rents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to consider that, if I am here. People based in Dublin have no idea of commercial activity or the value of commercial property in rural areas, particularly areas that are nearly 200 miles away. The National Roads Authority was also established in Dublin but sometimes one would wonder on what basis it operates. When one contacts the authority one is told that the Minister is the master and has provided the money. When one contacts the Minister, however, he says he has no input and the NRA is a separate State body. I do not think that could happen in the same way with the Ordnance Survey which is involved in more technical mapping work. Politicians might not have the same input or need for involvement in it.</P>
      <P>The new body will be able to sell its products in new commercial areas. The Bill provides for the appointment of a board and a chief executive officer who, while not a member of the board, will be able to attend meetings and brief the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has instructed the new service to try to break even, taking into account the subvention. I find it difficult to see how that could possibly happen, however, unless the subvention is of a proper magnitude. The Minister also mentioned the possibility of receiving a dividend but based on the type of service being provided that could be a long way down the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Ordnance Survey to minimise its cost base, while at the same time providing good quality service. The Minister expects the new body to provide proper standards of ser<Col N="25" /> vice and to charge accordingly. Many people in the private sector will have no difficulty with that. If people are getting a good service, they do not mind paying for it. The Bill also states that the new service will be subject to a value for money audit and that the commercial accounts have to be provided on an annual basis. I read somewhere that they have to be provided and printed within six months of the year's end.</P>
    <P>I wanted to touch on a number of other items. Senator Doyle mentioned tourism in particular. In a county like Donegal, the tourism product has not been developed much over the years but in recent years, particularly with Deputy McDaid as the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, hill walking and climbing have become a great feature of the tourism industry in Donegal and all of the maps, and the detail on those maps, can be provided by this service.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned area aid. While we have experienced difficulties in the past two or three years with area aid applications, those difficulties are becoming fewer because of the type of mapping and surveying that is being done.</P>
    <P>Many of our archaeological and heritage sites are coming under great strain, with the possibility of them being destroyed due to the boom in the economy and all the construction work that is taking place. I hope that the Ordnance Survey service which, until now, has provided the details of these sites will be used more by planning officers because planning officers spend a great deal of time dealing with minor problems when deciding on a planning application, yet that application may involve a major historical site. In terms of the N14, I am aware that a prepared route is being chosen in Donegal. The Donegal Historical Society wrote to the NRA over four months ago and it still has not received a reply. Those people are working on the ground and they got this information from Ordnance Survey maps which show our great historical heritage, particularly in and around the Lifford area.</P>
    <P>There are many other items I could discuss including SACs and European directives in relation to some of the scientific evidence, with little reference to what is happening on the ground, but due to the time restraints I cannot do so. I commend the Bill to the House and I hope everything will work out for the staff who have provided such a good service. I also hope that the guarantees in relation to conditions, pay and pensions will work out. This is the only service the British left us that I appreciate and even though Senator Doyle was concerned about some aspects of the Bill, I wish the service well over the next 177 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. I welcome the Bill and the contribution earlier of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Bonner talk about what the British left us. When I first saw <Col N="26" /> the Bill I thought it was interesting because it takes me back to 1979 when the then Government decided to separate the post office from telecommunications and to set up two bodies. When I compare this process to the establishment of An Post I realise there are similarities but also differences.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Doyle talk about the copperplate writing, the art and the traditions. Those similar traditions existed in the old post office. Incidentally, I believe it was 1840 when the penny post was set up, which was about 17 years after the establishment of the Ordnance Survey office. An Post has managed to maintain that tradition and I hope it will be maintained in the Ordnance Survey office as it continues.</P>
    <P>Another comment made concerned the headquarters. When An Post was set up the new body got possession of all the property, with the exception of the GPO which was regarded as a national heritage site; it was the only site An Post did not get. I wonder to what extent will the headquarters of the Ordnance Survey office be maintained and recognised because it would be a shame if anything happened to it in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the value of the Ordnance Survey office which we tend to forget. We had a problem in the supermarket business in the 1970s when the holy hour was in operation in Dublin city and we could not sell alcohol between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. but it could be sold in the county. We had a supermarket under which the river flowed through a big tunnel right down the centre of it. We had to go to the Ordnance Survey office to find out exactly where the river went and to establish whether we had to close the off-licence between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. If my memory serves me rightly, we were able to continue serving alcohol between those times.</P>
    <P>We sometimes forget the many aspects of the survey office. We do not realise the way it impinges on all our lives and that it will continue to do so in the future, particularly in the area of planning where the rules and regulations to protect the environment and our heritage are becoming more important. The traditions of the Ordnance Survey office, therefore, are becoming more necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to outline some of the challenges that face the Ordnance Survey office which are similar to those which faced the post office. The one that has been highlighted here is the need to recognise customers. In his contribution, the Minister of State recognised that and one of the reasons for establishing this office as a separate independent body, although State owned, was the commercial needs and the recognition that we are not just talking about the general public. They are customers who now have competition.</P>
    <P>Another major change the office has faced up to, and will continue to face in the future, is technology. I was travelling in a car in Britain a few months ago &ndash; there is a reference to this in the Minister's contribution &ndash; which had the geographic information system, GIS. One could tell <Col N="27" /> whether one had gone too far from the map in the car. The driver could assess the position and input directly into the system the desired route. It was fascinating to see the accuracy of those maps. We have that skill in the Ordnance Survey office and it will not be difficult to do this. If the office does not do it, somebody else will and it will face competition again.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a number of questions which I am sure can be answered. Why is this new body being set up under the Department of Finance? Surely it should come under the Department of Public Enterprise. We are talking about public enterprise but the attitude appears to be that because the Ordnance Survey office always came under the Department of Finance, it will stay under that Department. That is incorrect. It should be set up under the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The second question goes back to the customer bias that is needed. How will this body charge for its services to the State and how will it charge for its services in commercial terms? I recognise the requirement to set up subsidiary bodies to this independent body, and I assume they will be able to compete with other commercial enterprises, but how will they make sure there is no cross-subsidisation? An Post had that problem also. It was competing with couriers and it set up its own courier service, which is doing very well, but it was open to the accusation from the couriers that it was being subsidised by the State because it could operate under cost. Is there a possibility of that accusation in this case? I am sure it is being examined but I would like an explanation from the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner said something which was not quite correct, and I would like to see a correction by way of an amendment. The report to the Minister must be made within six months each year but it does not put an onus of responsibility to publish that report. I would like to see the report going to the Minister within three months and published within six months. I believe that is in section 28. I would welcome such an amendment.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned about section 10 in terms of the freedom of the citizen. We seem to lose our rights so readily nowadays. In the eight years that I have been in this House there has been a number of Bills ceding to other bodies the right to invade our own homes and properties. The fight against drugs and crime has strengthened that trend. We have handed over to the Revenue Commissioners and the Competition Authority the right to invade our homes and gardens. We have another one here giving the right to the Ordnance Survey to enter. It does differentiate between entering your home and entering your garden, but it does mean they can enter your property. Having gone to court they can enter your home as well.</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas where we as citizens are ceding some of the ancient rights that we always had. Are we sure it is necessary to the <Col N="28" /> services of mapmaking and the Ordnance Survey that we ought to be willing to cede these rights? I am not sure. I question whether that is necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the intention behind it. The vast majority of sections are designed to make sure that the Ordnance Survey will last another 177 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Ordnance Survey extremely well as I was raised beside it in the Phoenix Park. It is the old Mountjoy barracks, originally a cavalry barracks. As one of the earlier speakers mentioned, it is probably one of the oldest Departments of State, preceding the Post Office. I think it provided mapping services for Trollope when setting up the Post Office. It has continued to provide an excellent service to the State in the mapping section. There is no place in Ireland which has not seen an inspector or a surveyor from the Ordnance Survey not once but repeatedly down through the years. It is to be seen in the excellent maps. Even in rapidly changing urban areas the maps are up to date. The excellent Dublin map changes once or twice a year, giving up to date information on new estates, roads, motorways, etc.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the preservation of Irish placenames through the Placenames Commission, which is situated in the Ordnance Survey. Without this department many of these names would have been lost. The developers, in Dublin especially, are doing their best to eradicate any trace of Irishness in the placenames.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to praise myself, but some years ago I successfully introduced a motion in Dublin Corporation requiring developers to get planning permission before they could use a placename. It is observed more in the breach than anything else. I woke up one morning to find myself living beside a Kempton. Hampton is another one, not to speak of Tuscany Downs and Thornby and other such places that bear no relation to Ireland. The developers keep pushing ahead with their efforts to eradicate any trace of Irishness, especially in the urban areas. In Cork city I saw Pic du Jer Park, another interesting Irish name that features prominently in the developers' advertisements in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on a Saturday. The Placenames Commission has done much. It has produced some books on Kerry where it has gone into great detail on local placenames. It is very important that these placenames are kept and not lost to posterity. The Ordnance Survey has a long history in the development of modern Ireland. Its role in the provision of maps showing how Ireland has developed has been largely unsung.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is not mentioned here, I think there are two other Departments of State which are responsible for title and property. We know how dear the ownership of property is to the Irish <Col N="29" /> heart. They are the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. Bringing all three under one umbrella in the future might streamline the work of the legal profession in transferring deeds and titles. I wish to welcome the Minister to the Chamber, bringing this Ordnance Survey Bill before us. It is long needed, has been much delayed and will probably be the first of many Bills dealing with property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us had our first introduction to the words &ldquo;ordnance survey&rdquo; at post-primary school when learning how to read maps, etc. The Ordnance Survey does a tremendous job. I never travel without having an ordnance atlas of Ireland in my car. I can say the same for all my family. I am never stuck in traffic on main roads because the Ordnance Survey maps have such extraordinary detail that it is possible to go anywhere using their maps. I compliment them on that.</P>
      <P>The general thrust of this Bill is to be welcomed, but there are a number of issues I want to raise. I wish there were more references to technology in the Bill. If I am in Wexford and I want to get to Banagher, I find it is easier to click on to some technology or IT application like Route 66 to work out the best route. Even though it is made in America it is possible to input Banagher or Wexford and get an immediate map of the direction, distance, best roads etc. I would like to see that made available in Ireland soon.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Ordnance Survey people taking on board the importance of technology. I stand to be corrected, but as far as I know there are many road vehicles throughout Europe, such as taxis and even private cars, which operate on a global positioning system which relates the car to its exact position within a couple of feet based on geo-stationary satellites. It does not appear to be available here, or was not the last time I checked. The Ordnance Survey should move this forward and ensure that we are at the leading edge of technology. I have no doubt that the personnel in the Ordnance Survey have the ability to get this moving. Additional resources should be made available for them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the Ordnance Survey and begin with its name. The word &ldquo;ordnance&rdquo; has a military background deriving from the assistance provided by cartographers, mapmakers and surveyors to the army. This gave them best practice and location for the business of war. They then moved forward to the present. I would not like to see the Ordnance Survey being left behind. I recently saw advertisements for maps of Ireland and parts of Ireland marketed by an international body. It is possible that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the Ordnance Survey office could be overtaken by technology in other countries. It is easy for a company in Manhattan to download maps, cartography and information, including satellite information, and prepare documentation perhaps with economies of scale in terms of the resources <Col N="30" /> behind them. This would provide a threat to our own office that I would not like to see.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Costello has entered the Chamber because I wish to state that one of my regrets is that, at this particular moment of our history, the word &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; does not appear in the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill. I intend to find an excuse to raise that matter on Committee Stage because I want the term &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; to be included in the section to which I refer. I hope I will be indulged in that regard because I want to explain to people that the term &ldquo;benchmarking&rdquo; did not originate with car manufacturers but that it was in use 177 years ago and that there are many benchmarks throughout our country. We understood the term &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; when we were ten years of age and we continue to understand it now that we have reached 50 years of age. I would like the term to be properly enshrined in the legislation so I will return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will now reflect on some of the comments put forward by Senator Fitzpatrick. I am delighted that one of the objectives of the OSI will be &ldquo;to depict place-names and ancient features in the national mapping and related records and databases including the Irish language equivalent of place-names as advised by An Coimisiún Logainmneacha and declared in place-names orders made under section 2 of the Place-Names (Irish Forms) Act, 1973&rdquo;. As far as I am aware, that is a new requirement and duty. The Minister of State must ensure that Ordnance Survey Ireland will have the power to inform local authorities that particular placenames are incorrect and should no longer be used. Appalling damage is being done to placenames throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession a book entitled <i>Logainmneacha</i> which dates from 1935 and which I found in the Oireachtas Library. The final paragraph of the réamhrá states: &ldquo;In aon chúig bhliain amháin gheofaí teacht ar Ghael-ainmneacha furmhór ár mbailte is ár bparóistí ach cur chuige i gceart agus ba chóir don Stát tabhairt faoin ghnó sin gan mhoill&rdquo;. In other words, it would only take five years for a certain number of staff to draw up a list of placenames. Some of the changes made to those placenames are offensive and intellectually unacceptable and I wish to provide a number of examples.</P>
    <P>I moved to north County Dublin approximately 30 years ago and I live quite close to a townland near Lusk called Man-O-War, which is an unusual name but I chose it because many Members may be aware of it. When I checked the origin of the name to see if it had a maritime connection, I discovered that it was simply a corruption of the Irish title, An Meán Bhóthair, given to the middle road between the coast road and the inland road to Drogheda. It is perfectly understandable that, when translated, An Meán Bhóthair was corrupted to Man-O-War. I have no difficulty with this because we cannot control the assimilation of language. However, I am dis<Col N="31" /> turbed that some genius in the county council decided to translate Man-O-War, to which the townland is referred to on maps, into Irish. The result is that signposts in the Balbriggan area now refer to Man-O-War or Long Cogaidh. It is only a matter of time before someone states that the place was named after a fighting ship because of its location near the sea. That kind of nonsense should not be allowed because it destroys local heritage.</P>
    <P>Another example of changes made to place-names involves Larkhill, which is adjacent to Beaumont Hospital on Dublin's north side. Larkhill is a corruption of the old Irish name Lár Choille, which referred to the fact that hundreds of years ago the area was situated in the centre of a wood. It is easy to understand how Lár Choille became Larkhill. This is another form of assimilation, which cannot be controlled. It is unacceptable, however, that some genius in Dublin Corporation has decided that the Irish translation should be Cnoc na Fuiseoige. I could provide a hundred different examples of such changes to placenames and when I am driving through the countryside and I see them on signposts I almost always crash into a hedge.</P>
    <P>Ordnance Survey Ireland should ensure that Lár Choille, which became Larkhill, does not become Cnoc na Fuiseoige and that Meán Bhóthair, which became Man-O-War, does not become Long Cogaidh or Fighting Ship, with which the area had no connection whatever. This is a matter of great cultural importance and I welcome the provisions in section 4 in this regard. I request that information on their implementation be provided in the relevant reports.</P>
    <P>I raised the following matter informally with the Minister of State and I ask him to take on board my concerns about it. Under section 4 it is stated that one of the functions of OSI shall be &ldquo;to provide mapping and related geographic information to the public and private sectors in support of social, economic, legislative, security, business and administrative functions and requirements&rdquo;. That is fine. However, I reiterate what I said earlier, namely, that the first interface anyone present had with the words &ldquo;ordnance survey&rdquo; was when they were at school. To ensure that children continue to be educated to read maps, etc., the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; should be added to the list contained in the section.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with a number of other issues. Before the Minister of State at the Department of Finance re-entered the House I requested that the word &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; be enshrined in the legislation to explain to others what it actually means.</P>
    <P>It is stated in section 11(9) that &ldquo;A member of the Board may at any time be removed from membership of the Board by the Minister if, in the Minister's opinion, the member has become incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions, or has committed stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. Will the Minister of State indicate the kind <Col N="32" /> of stated misbehaviour which could lead to a member's removal from the board?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that my reading of the Bill has added to my knowledge. I did not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;geodetic&rdquo;, but I consulted a dictionary and discovered that it refers to a new mathematical approach to land surveying. I welcome the fact that there will be a national boundary surveyor and I wish him or her well in that work.</P>
    <P>Section 7(1) allows for the establishment of subsidiaries. However, subsections (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) seem to be utterly unnecessary in that a company establishing a subsidiary would normally be entitled to take the actions to which those subsections refer. I am always concerned about enshrining in legislation the power to do something which would have been assumed in any event and which leaves matters open to challenge if the relevant provisions are not adhered to in a precise manner. Will the Minister of State explain the need for the subsections to which I refer?</P>
    <P>In the interests of defending the rights of Members of the Oireachtas, which I do with great diligence when the opportunity arises, I ask the Minister of State to take on board the following point, which caused the parliamentary counsel and not his officials a number of difficulties. Why are Members of the Oireachtas excluded from holding certain offices? In my opinion a provision in this regard is almost automatically written into legislation and I want someone to inform me why a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas could not serve as a member of the board of OSI. This matter involves Members' personal rights. In the event that people believe otherwise, I wish to state that am not seeking a position on the board. However, I believe the reasoning behind section 19 is offensive to Members of the Houses. It is not acceptable that the Bill should state that a person cannot be a member of the board while serving as a member of a local authority, a Member of Seanad Éireann, a Member of the European Parliament or a Member of Dáil Éireann. There is no reason this should be the case. People with expertise in those areas should not be excluded. It seems to me that this is being done gratuitously, unthinkingly and certainly unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Having expressed those concerns, I welcome the Bill and I ask the Minister of State to consider the minor amendment which I intend tabling on Committee Stage. I wish the Ordnance Survey well in its next 177 years. It is doing excellent work and those of us who appreciate maps are indebted to the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House. The issue raised by Senator O'Toole about representation on the board is always a bone of contention. Whenever it arises, we ask why Members of either House, or elected public representatives generally, are excluded, in much the same way as criminals or bankrupts, <Col N="33" /> from membership of any State body. No satisfactory explanation or justification has ever been given for that.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance Survey office in Phoenix Park is within my constituency and I have been there many times. I have noted the excellent work done there and the modernisation which has taken place over the last two decades at OSI headquarters. It represents virtually light years of progress from the former manual mapping process to the computerisation and digitalisation which is now the order of the day. It is remarkable how quickly any area of the country can be brought up on screen and a map produced in a matter of seconds. It is a magnificent resource, which has rapidly become part of the information technology sector.</P>
      <P>One is reminded of Brian Friel's play, &ldquo;Translations&rdquo;, and his portrayal of the British army involvement in ordnance survey mapping work, with particular reference to the corruption of Irish placenames which occurred in the anglicisation process. There was no proper understanding or research into the origins of Irish placenames. The exercise simply involved getting an English approximation of the sound of the Irish name. There is much work to be done in that regard. It is regrettable that so many local authorities tend to follow a rather middle class, television-style approach to the naming of streets, roads and new residential estates. The Ordnance Survey office could play a useful role in this context, as a resource for local authorities. It should be part and parcel of the local authority process of naming streets and estates to consult with the Ordnance Survey office and to ascertain the traditional background to placenames of the area. There should be a requirement to take cognisance of the rich tradition and history which is to be found in every corner of this island. This would help to get rid of some totally inappropriate names which tend to crop up.</P>
      <P>I hope the central office of the Ordnance Survey will continue to be based in Phoenix Park. I note the statement by the Minister of State that the location of that office and the operation of its six regional offices are not affected by this legislation. However, he went on to say that the question of relocation of the OSI headquarters in Phoenix Park, &ldquo;which are acknowledged not to be ideal for a modern mapping organisation, will be decided in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme&rdquo;. That is a very ominous statement. I do not see why the Phoenix Park location is not ideal. There is plenty of space available and extensions can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference was to the historical building and its present occupier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to just one building. There is a plethora of buildings. The present location of the offices is like a courtyard. I see no reason why an extension would not be satisfactory. The headquarters of the Ordnance Survey <Col N="34" /> should remain at its historical location. Obviously, the Government has certain decentralisation plans, but surely in this case it should be based on further extension of the six regional offices, to allow for expansion of the work of the OSI.</P>
      <P>There is great potential for such expansion. Irish people, at home and abroad, are seeking their family origins. A facility for mapping the geographical location of the family origins would be no less interesting than the family tree as such. There is a commercial opportunity for the Ordnance Survey in that regard. If that office does not take it up, others will do it. We have seen how the Mormons developed the concept of a database of Irish family names in an international context. It is now as easy to get information on your family background in Utah as it is in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We need to look more closely at the issue of copyright and how it is to be protected. The Bill refers to copyright of existing data, in the context of the board's functions under section 4(2): &ldquo;To protect the Government copyright in OSI records, databases, products and published material.&rdquo;  It refers to existing material. What is there to prevent anybody with the necessary technology from doing their own mapping of Ireland by satellite and putting a range of products on sale on the Internet, without using any of the existing copyright which is to be protected under this provision? We need to consider this matter very quickly. Virtually any geographical location in the world is open to satellite observation and mapping activity.</P>
      <P>With regard to the composition of the board, I see no reference to gender equity. Has any thought been given to that? The numerical composition of the board seems rather strange: &ldquo;A chairperson and not less than four, or more than nine, ordinary members.&rdquo;  That is a rather extravagant gap between the minimum and the maximum. Surely the number of board members should be specified more precisely, with provision for replacement if required? I also wonder why the minimum is an even number, while the maximum is an odd number. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the reasons.</P>
      <P>The omission of any reference to worker directors on the new board is also noteworthy. Is there any involvement by the employees in the actual structure of the board? What representation is intended for the staff? Although they will be transferring from the present Civil Service type of structure to a more commercially based board, that is no reason for excluding staff representation. I would like to hear from the Minister of State on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that &ldquo;negotiations on a wide range of issues of concern to staff will continue with associations and unions in a partnership framework&rdquo;. He also said that all staff currently employed will transfer to the new body. That seems rigid. I know it is not true that all the staff want to transfer to the new body. If a new body is established, there is a procedure whereby <Col N="35" /> those who wish to stay <i>in situ </i>in the Civil Service can do so while those who wish to transfer have the option of doing so. It is like the decentralisation process where people are not forced to decentralise. People should not be forced to leave a work structure, such as the Civil Service, and move to a different commercial type work structure. I am not saying one is better than the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated that all staff currently employed will transfer to the new body. That will lead to controversy and difficulties in staffing associations which must be dealt with. Has the trade union staff association agreed to this new structure? It seems the negotiations are ongoing and that decisions have been taken without agreement. At what stage are the negotiations and what degree of satisfaction has been articulated by the trade union sector on this matter? </P>
    <P>I do not oppose the establishment of the body. I applaud the good work done by Ordnance Survey Ireland. I hope the new body will promote the wider use of the rich vein of information available to it in terms of the geography and cartography of this country not just for the indigenous population, such as the farming community, estate and property owners, local authorities, etc., but also for the international market. I hope we market all the information available to us. I hope there will not be a requirement for State subvention in the future. I look forward to seeing how this new body operates. If agreement is not reached with the workforce on all the matters in dispute at the initial stage, it might be an inharmonious way to begin. I await the Minister of State's response to the matters raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I apologise again for not being here as I could not be in the two Houses at the same time. I regret missing the debate because, judging by the notes given to me, great interest was shown in this Bill by the Members and many interesting and constructive matters were raised. We will have an opportunity to tease out the detail of the contributions on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>OSI finds itself in a modern framework where the world has changed dramatically in the context of the way it delivers its services and the range of services it can deliver. Senator Costello referred to the competition it clearly faces. While OSI will be able to protect its data, it is open to anyone else to do their own business. That is why OSI must compete in the marketplace to stay at the cutting edge of technology and to deliver the type of services required in a competitive environment. That is a central reason OSI needs to come out from under the strictures of the Civil Service structure and to be able to form companies and compete in the marketplace. That is welcomed by all concerned, including the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members mentioned the staff of OSI. That is why I clearly signalled in my speech the key areas, as far as the Government and the staff are <Col N="36" /> concerned, of existing pay and conditions, particularly pension and superannuation rights. These issues must be finalised. They are being discussed with the staff at present in a harmonious way. There was a meeting last week which was positive. Major issues have not been raised, apart from the fact that the unions and the staff want these matters finalised before the body is set up. That is also the Government's view and that will happen before the final transition from OSI's present status to its new semi-State structure. There is a good partnership framework within the company and that is the forum being used to move the agenda forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned the worker directors. Although the Bill does not explicitly provide for worker directors, it is open to the Minister to appoint a worker director. We will wait to see what happens in that regard. We want OSI to operate in an harmonious industrial relations setting and a positive competitive environment in the context of the services it will provide. The partnership framework in OSI will lead its transition into a semi-State structure.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Costello mentioned placenames. The role of OSI is to take on board existing placenames. I agree with the points made. There is a bastardisation of important placenames in Ireland today. Local authorities should use existing meaningful names instead of allowing people to modernise, for the sake of it, names which are meaningless and do not have any historical reference point. In many cases the original name is misunderstood when translating it from Irish into English. I regret the number of estates with traditional English placenames which are more familiar to the United Kingdom than to Ireland. It does not add anything to the addresses of the people who live there. They might have an immediate impact, but they do not enrich an area. I agree with the views expressed by Members on this issue, but responsibility lies with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made many points, including one about cross-subsidisation. This is a fundamental part of the Bill. It will be assured through the service contract drawn up between the Minister for Finance and OSI in terms of the delivery of its State functions. The market functions in terms of the services it might provide on a commercial basis will be delivered through the subsidiary companies which will be set up. I made the point in my speech that the funding for those subsidiary companies will not come from the State. That will be led by market demand and financial assessment of the marketplace to support and fund those companies to provide the services. They will be market driven and supported and funded through the normal channels that any profitable company would seek to operate. That will be the role of OSI. Nobody denies there will be huge opportunities.</P>
    <P>The service agreement will define what the State requires, why the Minister is giving the subvention, and what the OSI is expected to deliver. <Col N="37" /> There will be other arrangements put in place which the Bill allows for.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others asked why a Member of the House cannot be on the board. This is a standard provision in legislation. I subscribe to the Senator's view, but politicians on both sides of the House are their own worst enemies. We have almost made life impossible for ourselves in many activities by using base political argument in different circumstances on different issues to make political points. This has undermined politicians and the political process in recent years. That is regrettable. I am not blaming one side of the House or the other. Collectively, we have moved ourselves into this mode and we would do well to move away. We should treat our profession with the respect it had in the past. The behaviour of certain Members in all parties has lowered the flag of respect for politicians. It is up to us to restore that respect. When confidence and trust are restored, the possibility of Members of the Oireachtas with expertise on various matters serving on boards will arise, excepting obvious conflicts of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That section states a person cannot serve as a board member if elected to the European Parliament or a local authority, but if a person is only nominated for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas he or she must leave the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is transparently defining the ground rules. That is the condition of the political system. I regret that, but we must restore the trust and respect that most politicians deserve. Because a few damaged the majority, we are going through this painful process, which I hope will conclude soon. We ought to restore the mantle of a hard working, honourable profession. All Members in all parties, and Independents, work hard in public life.</P>
      <P>Senators Finneran and Bonner mentioned rural mapping. I stated that this needs to be undertaken and updated. The modern detailed, digital mapping of rural Ireland that we need will be done. There are existing guidelines on gender balance on the board and these will be applied.</P>
      <P>I hope I have addressed all the points raised. If not, I apologise. During the Committee Stage, Members will have the opportunity to raise issues. All points raised on what I should do on that stage are noted. Senator O'Toole's suggestion about education will be incorporated if possible.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Impact of the Foot and Mouth Crisis on Tourism: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for organising this special debate and for giving me the opportunity to speak.</P>
      <P>During the course of the crisis, the primary preoccupation of the Government, supported in large measure by the public, has been to ensure that foot and mouth disease is confined to the one outbreak. I indicated in two recent Dáil Adjournment Debates and a full day session of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, on 22 March, that the possibility of widespread outbreaks of the disease threatens our economy, security and the livelihoods of not just those in the farming, agriculture and food industries but potentially of every citizen, particularly those in the tourism sector. I pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his staff for the sure footed manner in which they are tackling the crisis, and for their extraordinary hard work and dedication.</P>
      <P>The recent heart breaking, stark images from County Louth and Britain give an indication of what a full scale outbreak would mean and put into perspective the sacrifices we have made. For tourism, a full outbreak would result in sustained negative international publicity, more internal and external travel restrictions and the prolonged closure of key attractions and facilities. Let us hope and pray that we do not face such a scenario.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, I thank the tourism and hospitality industry, which is on the economic front line in the battle against foot and mouth disease, for its support and patience in recent weeks in accepting the controls which were put in place. The industry has sustained a substantial hit in loss of business but has been mature enough to see it as an essential contribution to the bigger objective of fighting the disease.</P>
      <P>The economic importance of the tourism sector should not be underestimated. It employs over 15,000 and earns £3 billion in foreign exchange annually. One in 12 jobs is dependent on tourism. It represents over 4% of GNP and makes a critical contribution to regional and rural development. This industry has almost doubled in terms of employment and increased threefold in terms of foreign earnings over the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out, however, that the scale and importance of the tourism industry in modern Ireland is not always fully appreciated by the public because of its diverse nature and the number of small firms involved. While agricultural employment has decreased steadily in recent years, tourism has experienced phenomenal growth. The reports we hear every day of the impact and scale of foot and mouth disease on tourism will serve to get the message across that <Col N="39" /> tourism is one of our largest industries, not far behind agriculture in economic importance.</P>
    <P>The tourism and hospitality industry is hurting as a result of the foot and mouth crisis. An up-to-date assessment puts losses at over £200 million, excluding the impact on air and sea carrier receipts which I forecast will be substantial too. If the current situation were to continue until August, it is estimated that the potential loss of out of State visitor receipts could rise to £500 million. This does not take into account the separate and significant losses in domestic tourism and hospitality business due to cancelled events and conferences and the apparent reluctance of the public to take short breaks in Ireland. Since the onset of this crisis my Department, Bord Fáilte and I have worked energetically to support the industry and we have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation. I would like to outline ten specific actions we are taking.</P>
    <P>I encouraged the tourism and sports sectors to take a series of initiatives in support of the national campaign to minimise the spread of foot and mouth disease. Major industry groups such as the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland asked their members to take a range of precautionary measures. Bord Fáilte suspended the active promotion of high risk land-based recreational activities, and sporting organisations and festival groups voluntarily cancelled events. Such initiatives have demonstrated the commitment of the tourism and sport sectors to playing a full role in combating the disease.</P>
    <P>I set up structured arrangements to ensure the tourism industry's views are taken on board and their concerns are made known, particularly with regard to key decisions about control measures. On 8 March, I met a delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; ITIC &ndash; to discuss the situation and have kept in close contact with the industry since then. I am a member of the key Government task force which convenes every morning, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to monitor and review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a high level action group, chaired by the chief executive of Bord Fáilte and including key representatives of ITIC and my Department, has been established to monitor continually the situation. This group has met twice weekly over the past few weeks with the active participation and support of the industry. Its objective is to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business already booked and to limit medium and long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>We have pressed strongly in appropriate fora for a phased modification of the control measures in line with the evolving risk situation. This pressure brought about the easing of the control measures announced on Friday, 16 March by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural <Col N="40" /> Development. This followed a report by a technical expert group under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, supported by a separate report from the high level tourism action group. The guidelines issued by the expert group, together with clarifications given during the press conference by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, enabled a significant number of low risk events and activities in the tourism and sports areas to recommence immediately.</P>
    <P>With industry support, we have pressed for the phased reopening of key State cultural and heritage attractions to allow a full and varied array of facilities to be available to visitors. National cultural institutions such as the National Gallery, the National Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Chester Beatty Library and Dublin's City Hall have remained open, together with most of the attractions operated by Dublin Tourism and Shannon Development. Following the easing of control measures on Friday, 16 March, Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and the Rock of Cashel reopened. On 27 March the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands announced that a further 11 heritage sites would be reopened the following day and that further sites would be kept under review, which was welcome news to the tourism industry. In a recent press statement, I encouraged those involved in the provision of tourism facilities and attractions to familiarise themselves with, and to be guided by, the guidelines of the expert group with a view to restoring as much of our key tourism infrastructure as possible.</P>
    <P>We have arranged to ensure, through the Bord Fáilte website and associated call centres, that there is regularly updated information available to visitors and the trade, including information about major attractions and events which are open. The Bord Fáilte website is updated daily and contains a very comprehensive regional listing of the tourism attractions open at present. Tourism-related calls to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development foot and mouth disease helpline are being processed through Bord Fáilte. Hot links between key websites, including <i>The Irish Times </i>website, Ireland.com, have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I am anxious a clear message is sent that Ireland is open for tourism business and that, subject to the taking of appropriate precautions, Ireland remains a welcoming destination for international visitors. I have confirmed this in press statements and I believe it is entirely consistent with recent specific advice from the expert group. The new guidelines mean we can welcome urban based visitors from the United Kingdom and other affected countries. This positive message was reinforced by the Taoiseach in his remarks on 22 March at the naming of the Irish Ferries car ferry Ulysses, and by Sir Reg Empey and me at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting last Friday in Letterkenny. I am arranging that these positive messages are highlighted in Bord Fáilte's and my Department's websites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> We have been pressing for an easing of the restrictions on the movement of people within Ireland to help the accommodation sector recover from the effects of the cancellation of conference and seminar business and domestic tourism. It is important that people realise that the expert group's easing of restrictions on gatherings in defined locations means that indoor meetings, conferences, and certain sporting events may resume. Over the past week I have launched a strong appeal to the business community not to cancel or postpone conferences arranged for cities and towns in the lowest risk category specified by the expert group. This morning, the Government reviewed its instructions to Departments and State agencies to encourage them to allow such low risk activities to resume.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 16 March, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources announced the lifting of the ban on angling with effect from the following day. Under new guidelines, sea angling is permitted together with angling which does not involve access to lands to which susceptible animals have had access. This will go some way towards meeting the concerns of angling visitors who have been particularly badly affected by the crisis.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting I held with the chairman and chief executive of Bord Fáilte, the board is launching a special tourism marketing and promotion reassurance programme which will come into effect this weekend. The programme, comprising an initial component costing £3 million, will consist of tailor made trade and consumer campaigns, joint activity with trade partners and special consumer events in key European and US cities. I intend to personally lead these campaigns. Bord Fáilte has identified savings from within its budget to assist in meeting the costs involved in mounting these campaigns and I have sought supplementary funding for this purpose from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Prior to Christmas, I launched the largest ever annual tourism marketing programme involving the joint expenditure by the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte of £100 million during 2001, of which approximately £35 million is Exchequer funding. I requested the industry to put together a range of attractively priced short break packages to ensure a greater level of domestic holidays this year. We are also considering further initiatives to give domestic holidays a particular boost and I have urged people to holiday at home this year.</P>
    <P>I have also appealed to the banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners to be as sympathetic as possible to any tourism business which experiences cash flow difficulties as a result of the foot and mouth crisis. I received a very constructive response from the banks yesterday which stated:</P>
    <P>The banks are very mindful of their role in supporting customers through this difficult period. The banks are committed to giving careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for <Col N="42" /> particular support from those business customers who encounter financial difficulties as a consequence of foot and mouth disease. Such support may take the form of additional short-term credit, rescheduling of existing credit repayments and, where necessary, a moratorium on repayments. It is crucially important that banks are advised by their customers of the development of such problems as soon as they arise.</P>
    <P>The banks are confident that they will not be found wanting and I applaud them for the initiatives they are taking. While there has been unprecedented growth and success in the tourism industry over the past decade, inevitable temporary setbacks are experienced in the economic cycle which do not undermine the medium to long-term sustainability of the business. I expect a mature and enlightened business approach on the part of the financial institutions to help businesses to trade out of their current difficulties where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have confirmed that it is not possible to compensate tourism interests. It is more practical to put in place an aggressive international and domestic tourism marketing campaign, supplemented by measures to assist companies to trade out of any temporary financial difficulties. My Department and Bord Fáilte are keeping the situation under close scrutiny with a view to making appropriate further adjustments, in consultation with the industry, to planned marketing and promotional activities. While we are all conscious of the threat to agriculture, we must not lose sight of the extent of the disease's impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. Our shared objective must be to ensure that no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry which is so important in economic terms.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has successfully dealt with crises in the past, including the fall-out from the Gulf War and the troubles in Northern Ireland. It is a resilient and strong industry which, while bleeding at present, will successfully overcome this crisis if we all work together. I was delighted to hear the forecast from the Central Bank last week that economic growth is expected to run at a rate of 5% to 6.5%. Other European countries would give their right arms for such forecasts.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for providing me with the opportunity to address the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. His presence here underlines the importance and significance of this debate and the enormity of the crisis facing us. It is difficult to know where to begin assessing the damage which has already been done, aside from the potential damage which may occur until such time as the outbreak is contained in the UK. Recent reports from the UK suggest the disease is not expected to peak until June or July, by which time some <Col N="43" /> 4,000 cases are expected to be confirmed. These projections are alarming. While the disease is rampant in the UK, it will impact dramatically on this country. We have seen that to date with the catastrophic revenue losses &ndash; currently estimated at £200 million &ndash; in our tourism industry at such an early stage in the tourist season.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry will, I believe, suffer more than the agriculture industry as a result of this crisis. Farmers are suffering badly at present from cash flow problems and cannot move their stock to markets but the value of their stock is increasing rapidly. The price of livestock will undoubtedly rocket when this crisis passes and, this time next year, farmers will be in a different position. Tourism, however, is a very perishable commodity; a lost bed night can never be replaced.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's statement, I note a certain ambivalence in the attitudes expressed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, on the one hand, and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the other. That ambivalence is reflected by the advertising campaign being conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to discourage people from travelling to Ireland while the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation stands on the sidelines looking aghast at the devastation of the tourism industry. Both Departments and their Ministers will need to remove the ambivalence that exists in the public consciousness. They need to have a policy that will be acceptable to everyone without exposing the country to undue risk, while also controlling our advertising abroad so that it does not give the wrong impression. The perception in the United States is of a country teeming with animal disease, a misconception has to be removed. This can only be done through advertising.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that in the Minister's speech there were no specific areas targeted for reversing misconceptions. While he dealt at length with some of the major issues, his speech was lacking in specifics about dealing with the crisis now. The tourism season is about to start and I do not believe that we can reclaim much, if any, of the trade this year. That may be a very pessimistic observation. However, I believe that when people get turned off a holiday, they pull out and it is virtually impossible to get them to change their minds again that year. The Minister and his Department have much thinking to do about how to reclaim lost ground for the coming year. I welcome measures he has outlined today, but they will not do much to reclaim that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are operators in all areas of tourism who are affected by serious cash flow problems. I was glad to see the announcement today by the Irish Bankers' Federation that the banks would look sympathetically at businesses which are suffering severe cash flow problems. Nevertheless, the last line of their statement indicating that each <Col N="44" /> request will be looked at individually suggests that some people will suffer irrespective of the banks' attitude. I am sure that businesses which were having slight problems with the banks heretofore will not be looked at very favourably on this occasion. While in principle they are willing to support the industry, it will be interesting to see the extent of that support. The banks have a contribution to make in this. They have amassed great profits on the back of the Celtic tiger and it behoves them now to contribute something to the industry that is in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister could look at a range of options. He has stated that the Government has decided not to make money available to businesses which have suffered directly from this crisis. Nevertheless, measures will have to be put in place, which should include oil and diesel rebates for coach and tour operators. Some of those who are normally at full capacity at this time of the year are now down to zero and have no coach tours scheduled. The number of cancellations is disquieting.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks there will be a clamour for more action from the Government. The Minister will need to prepare himself for an avalanche of demands from representatives of the industry to get them over this critical period in the tourism business. There is a danger that in the space of one year, this industry could be plunged back to where it was in the 1960s and 1970s. That would be a total disaster but it is a distinct possibility. We need to put in place whatever measures we can even now to reverse the perception abroad about coming to Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are about 60 million people in the UK and most of them would never have been on a farm in their lives. There is a vast market there and it is wrong to give the message that there is a high risk in those people coming here. There are brilliant statisticians here who should be able to do a computer aided risk analysis to define mathematically where the true risks lie and our policy should be based on this.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that, in the initial stages of the outbreak in Britain, we went slightly overboard in our attempts to prevent or contain a possible outbreak of the disease here. That may or may not be justified. Both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Department have done a great job and have been at the cutting edge in dealing with this catastrophe. The incidence has been contained to just one outbreak. However, the fallout from this catastrophe ultimately will be greater in the tourism industry than in agriculture.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the measures the Minister has outlined, they do not go far enough. All the operators and the people involved in hotels, guest houses and farm house accommodation will be looking for some measures to tide them over for the next few months. We cannot ignore their demands because they have built up the tourism industry over the past 30 years at enormous expense. Approximately £30 billion has been <Col N="45" /> invested in that period and we cannot let the industry be annihilated completely in 2001.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will have to work together to come up with a realistic set of proposals and a realistic response to the demands of the tourism industry to see how we can open up our markets, without adding any risk. Each week more of our heritage centres are re-opening. In hindsight, we might have been wise to go ahead with the St. Patrick's Day parades as their cancellation sent out very negative images. Those images have become a massive misconception of how things stand here and we must all think positively and realistically.</P>
    <P>The industry is waiting for a comprehensive and realistic response from the Minister and the Government. While the measures the Minister has outlined are very welcome, the industry will not respond positively to them as it is expecting much more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and thank him for coming, particularly on such an important matter as the implications for tourism of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I listened recently to submissions by a number of bodies involved in the industry at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation and I noted a few of the points that were made. The points they made, and they made them sincerely, were put on the day the case in Louth was announced and we were all very depressed. We must compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, but we must also compliment the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, a Minister with a responsibility to develop and promote tourism, who rowed in behind what were the proper procedures to be taken to ensure that this was contained. As the old saying goes, there is not much use shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. There is no point in calling off parades and matches when the harm is already done. Every step was taken, and taken in time, and great credit is due to everyone concerned, particularly to the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the joint committee we heard from a number of organisations. Tour operators spoke about their visitors contributing £200 million per year to the economy, of employing 300 people and of the losses they had suffered, but they took it on the chin, as did other organisations, and they look forward to moving on in the coming months. The decisions taken by the Departments and the expert group set up by the Minister to lift some restrictions on visitor sites are welcome. Many Dúchas sites are located in the heart of good farmland, the risk was great and it was right to take action. We also heard from those involved in coach hire, people who had looked forward, who had developed tourism and invested heavily <Col N="46" /> in buses and facilities. They have been serious losers over the last couple of months but, please God, their investments will have been well made in terms of future developments as the year progresses. The Minister met with the banks, they replied and that is to be welcomed. All in tourism are hopeful that the banks will take on board what the Minister has said and, over the coming months, that they will treat with sympathy those who have very substantial repayments to make.</P>
    <P>Irish Ferries also spoke to the committee and described how last year they brought in 1.8 million passengers, 400,000 cars and 9,400 coaches. They employ 1,200 and they have been hit with a drop of about 30% in custom, which is substantial. The Minister's ten point plan will see a lot of the losses of the last couple of months made good, and made good on the double as the year progresses. I was very interested to listen to what Bord Fáilte had to say. They had planned a 5% increase in visitor numbers for this year but, from what the Minster has said about direct spend by Bord Fáilte for marketing, that will be made up as the year goes on and news improves as to foot and mouth disease. We can look forward to better times later in the year. There are other bodies which have to help the Minister promote tourism, for example, the airlines and all those who have benefited substantially from the numbers coming here, those who have developed tourism here. Those organisations should make an effort to reduce prices to enable more people to visit in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta, a semi-State body, must look at reducing landing charges and every reduction generally will improve the prospect of bringing in more tourists. We also have to look at those who sensationalised announcements of foot and mouth disease when there were no outbreaks, merely precautionary investigations of lame sheep. The papers tended to sensationalise and we had a major problem abroad as a result.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the groups who are going to be hit hard, who have already been hit hard, are the Town and Country Homes Association and Irish Farmhouse Holidays. Something special needs to be done for them. They have worked really hard, doing an excellent job developing tourism and providing an alternative income for many farm households. They are the real sufferers in this area, people can visit the country, many sites, towns and cities but, unfortunately, there are still major restrictions in the farmhouse holiday sector.</P>
    <P>The question of whether tourists are welcome was raised here. The tourism industry has spelt out that they are; no one ever said they were not. Ireland has been known for many years as the country of the welcomes. However, it was said that there were restrictions in certain regions. There is only one restricted region in the Republic and the problem has been well contained within it. Special attention must be paid to that region at a later date by the Minister and his Department. The Minister has already offered <Col N="47" /> assistance to the people affected in the Cooley peninsula. They are severely restricted and will incur substantial losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister is involved with the expert group established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, which is doing an excellent job. It has taken the right decisions to date and will continue to do so in the interests of tourism and farming.</P>
    <P>The rumours reported in today's newspaper about movements of livestock in the restricted area are a cause for concern. While they may only be rumours, the Garda must ensure there is no movement of stock unless people have a permit. That has been spelled out clearly by the Department. We want to see more action on the part of the Garda to ensure illegal movement does not take place. People should have no problem obtaining a permit. If they must move livestock to the factory or wherever, they only have to apply to their district veterinary office or Teagasc office and the permit will be granted within minutes. No one should move stock without a permit because it can cause a great deal of damage to Ireland and we may regret it later.</P>
    <P>The rugby and soccer organisations and the GAA must be complimented because they were dealt a severe blow in having to cancel many important matches. I attended a few GAA matches last weekend and I compliment the organisation on taking every precaution laid down by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>We must talk up tourism and promote centres for tourism and areas and sites which are open. There were many complaints about the inconvenience caused by some sites being closed and signposting not being that wonderful, with the result that busloads of people arrived only to discover there was no access. That was an inconvenience to tourists trying to visit certain sites. The tourism bodies have dealt with that initial problem. We must ensure that sites which are still shut are signposted as such well in advance in major towns so that people do not travel long distances to discover there is no access to them, something which can be embarrassing to tour operators and inconvenient for those travelling.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's ten point plan, the high level action group is welcome, as are the development of the website by Bord Fáilte and special tourism promotions. The Minister mentioned a figure of £3 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>That is the right money being put in the right place at the right time, and we will witness the benefits later this year. If we work together, with the assistance of the bodies the Minister announced and of the banks who will come to the aid of hard-pressed people, we will have a better and stronger tourism organisation with its different components working together. <Col N="48" /> If foot and mouth disease does one thing, it will bring together all tourism bodies and the different strands of tourism to work as one group for the development of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We did not realise for many years the huge benefit of tourism but we know it now. I live in a town on the Shannon which benefits from the tremendous spin-off from tourism. Once there were only a few boats on the Shannon. Now, during the season, it is better than any industry. That is what is involved. It is not an industry working 12 months of the year but a tremendous seasonal industry comprising boating holidays on the Shannon. It must be developed and promoted. I compliment the Minister and his predecessors on ensuring moneys were spent on the waterways to ensure thousands came to Ireland to enjoy the scenery and the hospitality of the people along the rivers and canals. When the foot and mouth crisis is over, and I hope the worst is past, we will see a much better and stronger tourism industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and express my appreciation to the Leader of the House for arranging the debate. When I requested it two weeks ago, I was reminded of what happened to my father's business in 1972 when Bloody Sunday occurred, followed by the burning of the British Embassy. My father's business never opened again. He had a holiday camp in Skerries and the guests came from Britain. I recognise the huge impact on those in the tourism business of one event such as this which can cause the closure of something that has been successful for many years.</P>
      <P>We were right to react in the way we did when the first threat of foot and mouth disease occurred some time ago. The experience in Britain, where the reaction was always behind the crisis, demonstrates the vital importance of getting ahead of the disease if it is to be conquered and controlled effectively. The first move in closing the country down was the correct thing to do. It was not an overreaction as some suggest now. Had we not acted decisively in the beginning, we would now face a much worse situation. That said, it is unrealistic to expect to keep a country locked down for an indefinite period. Apart from its impact on tourism, which is the focus of the debate, a country cannot be expected to give up its normal way of doing business for six months. That is why the appointment by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of the expert group referred to was a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important we recognise the group for what it is &ndash; a group of agricultural experts appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to advise <Col N="49" /> on technical matters related to agriculture. That group cannot be expected to give advice other than on agricultural grounds or to balance agricultural interests against others, such as those of the wider economy, especially those of the tourism industry. The Minister gave some interesting figures, such as 150,000 in employment, double that of ten years ago, and a threefold increase in foreign earnings in ten years.</P>
    <P>I suspect we are treating this outbreak not dissimilarly from the way we treated the previous one in 1967. However, in the intervening years dramatic changes have taken place in our economy. In 1967, agriculture was more important to the economy than tourism. Now the reverse is the case or close to it, and I wonder whether our handling of this crisis reflects that change. Agriculture is still centrally important to the economy. It is even more so when one considers agriculture and food as a single sector. No matter how much things shift, it will still remain very important. I cannot envisage a future in which agriculture here would decline to the essentially minor role it plays in the British economy. What is different is that today agriculture is not the only or even the main motor of our economy. It is one of several players, all of which are important and all of which deserve our support at a time of threat or crisis.</P>
    <P>Tourism shares two characteristics with agriculture. The first is that it has a high multiplier effect within the economy. As an industry it uses almost no imported goods and spending on tourism ripples quickly out to affect the whole economy. Because of this multiplier effect, it is as important as agriculture. It is even bigger than the statistics relating to it suggest. The second characteristic is that much tourism depends on the countryside. Many people come to Ireland for sightseeing &ndash; I saw dozens of people on Portmarnock beach today, posing no threat to agriculture. Others come to engage in activity holidays in the countryside. Despite the growth of many urban attractions in recent years, our tourism product is essentially a rural one. As such it has to share space with agriculture. This is why it is so affected by the foot and mouth epidemic. Note that I say tourism has to share space in the countryside with agriculture. Tourism does not invade space that belongs to agriculture by right. Present day reality is that both agriculture and tourism are major economic forces that need the countryside to survive. Neither has rights over the other. Both forces need to be considered as interests which must be given consideration and the implications of this are obvious.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the total economy we must be ready to take some risks, risks that we would not take if we were to consider the interests of agriculture alone. At the beginning we sacrificed everything by closing down the economy, by closing down the country, so as to keep the disease out and reduce its impact if it got in, as it did in County Louth. Now that that has been achieved, we need a more flexible approach to the future. <Col N="50" /> Let me put it this way. If the price of controlling foot and mouth is to be the loss of £1 billion in tourism &ndash; the Minister has talked about £0.5 billion &ndash; the loss of perhaps 20,000 jobs in tourism related activities and the collapse of hundreds of small businesses that are dependent on tourism in all parts of the country, that price is too high. However, we can manage this crisis in a way such that the price will not be anything like that. It is vital that we shift the focus of our policy so as to express the same concern and the same solidarity for the tourism industry as we have, rightly, in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's ten specific actions &ndash; they are not just thoughts but actions. With this in mind, I have three practical suggestions. The first is that the management of the crisis should be seen to be carried out from a national rather than just an agricultural perspective. This is not just a matter of cosmetics. Many people in the tourism industry believe that agriculture is calling all the shots and that their interests are not considered when decisions are taken. I know there is a Cabinet committee dealing with the issue, but it does not convey the impression of taking the wider national interest that is called for in this case.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion builds on something I said when we discussed this issue prior to St. Patrick's Day. I am concerned about the impression being given to the outside world about the nature of this crisis. Many people, especially in America, believe we are suffering from a food and food safety crisis. I spoke to somebody from America on the telephone who asked me whether everything was okay over here. They do not understand the situation.</P>
    <P>My third suggestion is that we should refine the official message that goes outside the country so that people are not led, in good faith, to make this situation worse. The Minister has touched on this and I recognise what he is doing. At the beginning of the crisis the message was simple. People were asked to stop whatever they were doing, to put off whatever they were planning. This was a necessary and useful approach at the time, but it has become counterproductive. I read a statement from the IMI, which the Minister has criticised, to the effect that it cancelled early because doing so would cost only £35,000 whereas cancelling at the last minute would have cost £350,000. That is an illustration of the need for flexible thinking. I am sure the people in Killarney would have been prepared to take the higher risk rather than completely forego high-profile business which was so important to the town at the start of the tourism season.</P>
    <P>There is much that can be done. A number of bands came here for the St. Patrick's Day parade, which was postponed &ndash; Senator Caffrey used the word &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo; but I say the St. Patrick's Day parade and festival were postponed. The bands came and paraded, unpublicised. The Minister and the Taoiseach went to Leopardstown racecourse to see them. There was no threat to agri<Col N="51" /> culture. The bands enjoyed it, particularly the high school bands. I met them too. This is a reminder that we can still run the tourism business without threatening agriculture. The message that goes out should be that for the sake of the country we should try to carry on business as normal except where the risks of doing so are clearly too high.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the St. Patrick's festival. I am chairman of the St. Patrick's festival and we will have to make a decision whenever we can. We have the choice of deciding to hold it very early . That choice would be welcomed by some parts of the tourism industry. I know the Minister would welcome mid-May because it would start the tourism season early. Others in the tourism business would like it to be held on Bloomsday, which is in the middle of June, but it is a national event and therefore the festival would be much more likely to get publicity around the world and be seen for what it is. That suggestion too is valid and that is part of what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The St. Patrick's festival is only postponed. We have a decision to make. The earliest we can make it is 17 April, if the expert committee gives the all clear at that stage. Let us make it an occasion to celebrate success in dealing with this threat to the economy. We will succeed in overcoming the threat to agriculture. With the right attitude and the right actions &ndash; the Minister is moving in the right direction &ndash; we will also overcome a great deal of the threat to tourism. I welcome the Minister and I particularly welcome his actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me. I welcome the Minister to the House. I have the greatest sympathy for him and for the tourism industry. A huge amount of work has been done in this area by the Minister and by all who are involved in tourism, and it has been rewarded. Now events outside their capability to deal with have dealt a terrible blow to the industry. I have been contacted by tour guides, people who run small bed and breakfast premises, people who have had major conferences cancelled and so on. This has been a devastating blow. Worse still, it will affect not just this year. People who have had the habit of coming here may break it and not come in other years. We should, therefore, look at promoting tourism not only this year but also in years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals have been made to the Minister to do something in the financial area, for example, to get the banks to be lenient towards people who may be behind with payments. I would like to see much more being done. In the past, during the fuel crisis, we gave vouchers to tourists who came here. I remember going to Italy once when there was a problem there and receiving vouchers towards the cost of petrol. The Minister has encouraged people to holiday at home. Why can we not give people vouchers to go on holiday at home rather <Col N="52" /> than giving them relief on rates or delayed VAT or PRSI payments?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in the long run the taxpayer will have to pay for this. I would much prefer to see people receiving £50 towards a weekend or £100 towards a week's holiday, depending on how many members of the family were going. Such a Government voucher scheme, particularly for areas that have been hardest hit, could also be publicised abroad. Nothing appeals to people more than receiving some money and it would encourage them to spend it in such areas. Who will know about it if we grant rates relief? There may be a delayed payment system for PRSI but what taxpayer will know about it? All they will know is that their money has been spent on something, whereas if they had a £100 voucher to go anywhere in the country they may choose to use it rather than going to the Canaries. The Minister should consider introducing such a voucher system.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a good point about celebrating the St. Patrick's Day activities, when they are eventually held, and it is important that a huge national effort should go into doing so. Perhaps we should consider rescheduling the St. Patrick's Day celebrations later in the year when the weather conditions are better. In July one year I was on holiday in a small village in Italy where a statue of the local saint was being brought around on a plinth. Money was pinned to the saint's dress as she was being paraded through the streets. Some of the locals told me that the parade used to be held in November when there were no tourists, so the saint's day was changed to July and since then it has been a great success. Perhaps we should consider rescheduling St. Patrick's Day to a more favourable climatic period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise farming organisations that are objecting to the tagging of animals to be very careful because many people have suffered huge financial losses. If the farmers do not like ear tagging why can they not use electronic boluses which lambs can swallow? Some boluses may come out but 99% of them remain in the animals. Why do we not consider this method if ear tags are prone to falling off? I know that boluses are expensive but if they are used on a large scale they would be cheaper. The farming community may end up having suffered far less financially than a large number of people involved in the tourism sector. Farmers may not like tagging but they would be wise to take it on the chin, or the ear. They should not make too many complaints because those who have been so good in this horrible national crisis might feel they are being let down by those with whom they have to work <Col N="53" /> cheek by jowl in the tourism and agriculture industries.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to debate tourism in the context of the foot and mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom and the case here which was most unfortunate. I compliment the Taoiseach, his Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his departmental officials for their work in this regard. The farming and non-farming community also deserve our compliments for having co-operated fully in trying to prevent the spread of this disease. To date, they have done a tremendous job and I compliment them for that, even though people were critical because they did not move fast enough. Some people thought the restrictions that were introduced were too severe, but the Government has acted to prevent the disease spreading and it has been successful.</P>
      <P>One cannot eradicate foot and mouth disease without having an all Ireland, an all island, agreement. Our friends in the northern part of this country have seen the damage that can be done through the unauthorised cross-Border transportation of animals, but they have also seen the benefits that can be achieved through cross-Border co-operation. This is a step in the right direction for the future.</P>
      <P>I am from a highly developed tourism county and have been involved in the tourism business from my early days. We started the Ballybunion bachelor festival which on one occasion was rescheduled from June to July to try to extend the season, which it succeeded in doing.</P>

      <P>We wanted to extend the season through the months of June, July, August and September. People in the west are now talking about the financial losses they have already incurred since the crisis arose, so I am glad that the season now extends to ten, 11 or even 12 months in places. In Killarney, we succeeded in extending the tourism season from five to eight months. It is taking it a bit too far, however, for people to claim that their businesses are ruined. We are now entering the tourism season and I am delighted to hear that the Minister is already removing some of the restrictions. He is being cautious about the matter, however, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For St. Patrick's Day I visited the United States where most of my family live. I was most concerned, however, to see the publicity there about foot and mouth being rampant all over Ireland. <Col N="54" /> They lumped us in with the United Kingdom but they failed to realise that while we had only one case, the UK had 490 cases at the time. According to the publicity in America, one cannot eat food here because of foot and mouth disease. The Minister should make it clear that our food is perfectly safe and that 95% of the food we produce is exported as a high quality product. It is something we have worked hard to achieve over the years. The Government is concerned about the outbreak of foot and mouth disease because it wants to protect the food industry.</P>
    <P>The decision to cancel race meetings and football matches was criticised, but the public must be complimented for co-operating with the restrictions. A tremendous spirit was demonstrated by everyone, but now we can open up again. I am sure that people would co-operate in the same way if there was a similar crisis in another sector in order to protect the national image. Mr. Denis Brosnan of the Kerry Group, who is also chairman of the Racing Board, was quick to support the suspension of race meetings, including Cheltenham. The Government acted immediately to protect the food industry, and it is great to see that happening. Whether the opportunity arises in the United States, Europe, Australia or elsewhere, we must get the message across that our beef, fish, poultry and other food is of top quality.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has not only expanded the tourism business in established markets but also in countries such as Japan, China and other areas in which there are enormous benefits for Ireland. I remember a time when one could not get a job in this country and now we are trying to recruit people abroad to work in the tourism business here. That is a tremendous turnaround and I welcome it. The world is vast and all we have to do is continue to push in the right direction but we must make sure that the quality of our food meets the highest standards, and that we uphold those standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the words of welcome to the Minister who made an interesting contribution in relation to his commitment to the tourism industry and the work done by him and his Department in dealing with the crisis affecting the country.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister because this year saw the greatest investment in the marketing structure of the country. Under the national development plan, the Government spent something in the order of £100 million promoting the tourism sector. That was a major commitment in what was one of the best years in tourism, looking at the whole economic climate. When that investment was made there was not a similar downturn in the American economy but it showed a firm commitment to the continuation of the investment in the marketing and promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> We have to deal with the situation as we find it and events change rapidly. The foot and mouth disease issue has brought about major and quick change, and compliments must be given to the Government, the Ministers concerned and the high level committees, be it in agriculture or tourism, that are dealing with their sectors on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>Some valid suggestions were made in the debate. I welcome the nine changes the Minister has made which are necessary in focusing on Ireland as an open destination for tourists. In terms of putting in investment and getting people to holiday in Ireland this year, I do not know whether there would be restrictions on that at European level or in the marketplace but it is a worthy consideration and might help. Such investment may help to encourage more people to spend money in Ireland rather than on other attractions abroad.</P>
    <P>In terms of the postponement of the St. Patrick's Day festival, it was interesting to note that a substantial volume of business in the tourism sector, including restaurants, was done in most towns. It may have been somewhat reduced but there was a good basis for business which pertains despite the fact that the country has responded to the seriousness of the foot and mouth disease threat.</P>
    <P>It is important that the clear message is sent out internationally, and it has come across in the debate, that Ireland is open to tourism and offers good quality at reasonable prices. I welcome the marketing incentives introduced by the Minister but in the context of our responsibility to the State, we have to be careful in terms of the people who visit here from England. We have to recognise that there is a serious situation in England which is pertinent to our economic survival. However, we should take credit for the fact that, with the exception of Louth, we have managed to keep our country free of this disease to a great extent.</P>
    <P>There should be focused incentives and greater marketing. If incentives are to be considered by local authorities in relation to some businesses, we should examine this issue in the context of the full year because, as the Minister is aware, there are areas of the country where there has been major investment in tourism due to previous tax incentives. While many people benefit from tax incentives, they need a strong throughput to pay the liabilities and upkeep of those major investments, particularly in rural Ireland. There may be a need to examine that area depending on the way the situation develops and whether this problem continues throughout the summer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's response to this crisis. I hope we can maintain the current position and manage the foot and mouth disease issue in the future. With focused attention, we can ride out this crisis and hold together a strong industry that is very important to our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Coghlan. I join with the other speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House for this important discussion. I compliment the Leader of the House for allowing this type of discussion on a weekly basis. That is important at a time when the country is going through a national crisis. The country has reacted in a responsible way. The people involved in every industry, whether it is tourism, agriculture or whatever, are to be commended for the way they have responded. A discussion like this is welcome in Seanad Éireann because it shows that we will do all we can to help out our respective communities.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the tourism aspects, I want to raise a number of urgent issues affecting rural communities on an ongoing basis which I would like the Minister to relate to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I come from a predominantly agricultural county and over the past few days people have brought these issues to my attention. I ask the Minister to give the message to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that in our county in particular, a county that is noted for producing many store cattle, there is a major problem in relation to movement. People are in severe financial difficulty because they cannot sell the cattle they would have earmarked for sale at this time of the year. Some sort of movement between farms should be arranged through Teagasc. That is a reasonable request and I ask the Minister to consider raising that matter with the specialist group in terms of examining hardship cases in particular.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the movement permits currently in place are working reasonably well under the circumstances. Permits, by their very nature, are difficult to operate, particularly with large numbers of cattle, and in fairness to the departmental officials, they are working extremely well. I am not asking for wholesale movement across the country but some relaxation in terms of movement. I ask the Minister to bring that matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</P>
      <P>In relation to the response from the Minister's own Department, which is what we are discussing this afternoon, there is no doubt that the tourism industry will be more affected by this outbreak of foot and mouth disease. It is only in the past few years that we have recognised the potential of the tourism industry. The growth in the industry has been huge. A figure of 150,000 employees has been quoted today, indicating that it is a huge industry by any standards. What makes matters more difficult is that most of the businesses were started only in recent years. Whether they are private or community-based, they have been very successful, but the initial stages of their development coincide with meeting their bank borrowings, putting more and more pressure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That there is already a 20% drop in air travel and an approximately 30% drop in sea travel is an indicator that we are facing an extremely diffi<Col N="57" /> cult summer season. Only yesterday at our county council meeting in south Tipperary we had an address by the regional director of SERTA, Mr. Joe Palmer. When it was proposed that he come to tell our council about the tourism potential of the whole south-eastern region, there was no talk of foot and mouth disease. It was the last thing on anyone's mind. We asked for a presentation to demonstrate to our members the phenomenal growth in tourism in our part of the country. We did not do what counties such as Kerry, Galway and Donegal did. They pushed tourism for many years and have derived great rewards from this, but it is only in recent years that we have actually seen the potential for growth in the tourism industry. For years, we did not exploit the Rock of Cashel, the potential of Tipperary town, the Glen of Aherlow and other beautiful parts of our county. Only recently did we invest heavily in tourism. That is the reason that we have to be more concerned. There are many loan repayments to be made.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be helped by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, particularly in counties like Tipperary, to give rate remissions to some of the businesses that are affected. The director of South Eastern Regional Tourism spoke yesterday about the impact of the current crisis and I ask the Minister that the Government make this one gesture with regard to the remission of rates. That would help greatly in my part of the country, an area to which the Minister might be coming shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for his contribution, which unfortunately I did not hear, but I skimmed through some of his script. We appreciate everything that has been done to protect the country from foot and mouth disease and, in particular, to keep it confined to one small portion of County Louth. I congratulate the Department of Agriculture on its comprehensive procedures at all ports, airports, bus and rail stations. I welcome very much the announcement that counties Louth and Wexford have received the all-clear. I know the incubation period can be anything up to 20 days and that we have to be hopeful over the next two weeks that we get over the line.</P>
      <P>It would be very helpful if we could have a continuous flow of precise information on what has been done, on what is allowed and what is not in relation to buses, cars, cyclists, walkers etc. For instance, are leisure walkers allowed to walk on public roads? I do not think there should be anything to stop them. It is vitally important that the tourism industry and other export interests have access to the review group of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development so the controls in place are justified and people clearly understand what relaxations are allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the precautions being taken are reviewed on a daily basis and I am not arguing against ongoing vigilance, but at the moment vis<Col N="58" /> itors to Killarney and County Kerry cannot walk in the mountains, boat on the lakes or visit the woods, and many people in Kerry think we are telling the visitors to go home and that they are not wanted. We have to arrest and correct that. Tourism is hurting very badly at the moment and, in order to counteract foreign media coverage that gives the impression that foot and mouth disease is rampant here, the industry needs a very well-resourced public and private promotional campaign to emphasise that the country is largely disease-free. We have the cleanest environment in the developed world and our food is quite safe.</P>
    <P>If we are to rescue this year's season, some key tourist attractions need to be reopened quickly. There is no rational reason why Muckross House and the immediate precincts, including the walled garden, could not be reopened immediately. I would suggest the same in respect of Ross Castle, Garnish Island and Derrynane House. There is no reason why the waterbuses cannot ply on the lakes of Killarney. They are not going to be able to land anywhere around the shoreline &ndash; they depart from and return to a designated spot at Ross Castle. Other boats could ply to and from Ross Castle. If these key visitor sites are not open before Easter, we could wipe up to 50% off tourism income in Killarney and the rest of County Kerry this year.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Minister and Bord Fáilte to spearhead a major promotional campaign aimed at visitors, buyers of Irish food and other exports to emphasise that we have the cleanest environment in the developed world, and we are determined to keep it that way. I know the Minister means well and I wish him well. I had the opportunity of having a few words with him earlier and I wanted to be in the House for his speech, but I was called to a committee.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear that we are not writing off our nearest neighbour, Britain, which has meant so much to us. We have had almost no response from them recently but this may be understandable. I know we have a major selling job to do in the USA and I am delighted to hear the Minister is going to tackle that and that he is spearheading an operation in Britain. I wish the Minister every success in this vitally important task. Hopefully in two weeks' time, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the rest of us will be delighted that we are free of the disease and beyond the incubation period. However, we have to be selling now. As the Minister knows, it is passed the time when bookings and so on should be made.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the Irish Management Institute conference in Killarney should have been cancelled. We were shooting ourselves in the foot. It would have involved people &ndash; 'suits', if I may say so &ndash; coming largely from Dublin, with nobody going to or from farms, trains and cars being sprayed and disinfectant mats all over the place. We have to give leadership on this and I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to reschedule it. My home town has always looked <Col N="59" /> forward to hosting that conference and, sadly, that is now the sixth or seventh conference we have lost.</P>

      <P>After all that levity, I welcome the Minister to the House and salute him and his colleagues for the fast and effective action they have taken in dealing with this crisis that has beset us in recent weeks. This is the first opportunity I have had to address the foot and mouth issue in the House. I pay particular tribute to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, for the outstanding work they have done together with their officials in addressing the challenge of the foot and mouth issue. Leadership and statesmanship are two qualities that could be attributed in ample proportions to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in the way in which he has handled the matter. As we watch the incidence of the disease in Britain rise inexorably towards the 1,000 mark, even the most cynical observers here are willing to give credit to the Minister and his officials for a job that has so far been exceedingly well done.</P>
      <P>The initial reaction to the outbreak in Meigh was, I believe, correct. The shutdown of operations has resulted in our being able to contain the disease thus far. However, while that was the appropriate reaction at that time, the need to sustain the wider economy and the tourism industry in particular means that an ongoing response is required. While recent statements by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, that an escalation of the incidence of the disease here would be devastating for the entire economy, including the tourism sector, are valid, there is a realisation that while maintaining an emphasis on the precautions that must be taken to prevent any spread of foot and mouth disease, we must proceed to a new phase in our response which must involve heavy emphasis on redressing the unavoidable damage done to the £3 billion tourism sector to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one in the House today is any less concerned about the welfare of the 150,000 people working in our second largest industry than they are about those working in the agri-sector or any other sector of the economy. To this end, I con<Col N="60" /> gratulate the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, on establishing the high level tourism action group which, working with the Minister and his Department, has devised a focused response to the difficulties the industry is currently experiencing. The Minister outlined that response in substantial detail in his contribution.</P>
    <P>As a farmer, I thank those working in the tourism industry for the manner in which they have generously participated in the nationwide campaign to combat this disease. The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; ITIC &ndash; has been true to its motto &ldquo;Leading our tourist industry&rdquo; in that it has provided the industry with sound leadership in this crisis. I welcome the confederation's involvement in the high level tourist action group.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that there are structures in place to ensure that the voice of the tourism sector is heard when decisions are being made about control measures. Our difficulty at present is one of international perception. The message has gone abroad to certain quarters that Ireland of the welcomes is no longer open for business. It must be stated that there is a degree of confusion on the part of some potential visitors regarding the difference between what is happening in Britain and what is happening here. Etched in the minds of many tourists are the Sky News and CNN images of huge smoking pyres of animal carcases in Britain. We have a job to do in terms of putting across the message that, thus far, the disease has been strictly contained in this country.</P>
    <P>As we celebrated record numbers of visitors to Ireland at the end of the year 2000 &ndash; 6.4 million people, representing an increase of almost 6% on the 1999 figure &ndash; little did anyone contemplate the enormity of the challenge we would face in 2001. It is fortunate that a feature of the industry's plans for the year 2001 was a record spend on marketing, in the order of £100 million of which 35% is provided by the Exchequer. We must welcome the Minister's announcement that £3 million will be made available for a campaign of reassurance. What we need now is an aggressive marketing and promotional plan that will counteract the misconceptions and misinformation that have taken hold in some of our overseas markets. I am sure our competitors in the marketplace are not unhappy that the position which obtains here has, in some instances, been misunderstood.</P>
    <P>We must re-emphasise that visitors from urban areas in Britain are welcome here. The recommencement of some sporting activities, the re-opening of State heritage and cultural attractions and the reconvening of conferences means that the vast bulk of the tourism package is again available to be enjoyed, subject to proper precautions being taken. I visited the Bord Fáilte website during the past 24 hours and I was pleased to note that its information is up to date. The website places a heavy emphasis on the fact that many activities are again taking place and <Col N="61" /> that a multiplicity of sites can again be visited, while at all times mentioning the necessary precautions that must be taken. Bord Fáilte has long enjoyed major success in promoting this country abroad and its experience and expertise in the marketplace is more important now than, perhaps, ever before. I am certain that all the resources necessary to mount an international campaign of reassurance will be provided. It is worth stressing that reassurance is all that most of our potential visitors require at this point.</P>
    <P>At home, people can play their own part in supporting the industry. In my opinion there would be widespread public support for a holiday at home campaign. Having seen the manner in which members of the public have rallied to the cause of preventing the spread of the disease, there is sufficient concern and goodwill to create a groundswell of support for the industry. There could be no more powerful or effective medium than the Irish people themselves, through their international network of contacts, sending out the message that, as far as tourism is concerned, all is well in Ireland.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been discussion about the urban-rural divide. A great deal has been said and written recently about a perceived decline in volunteerism and civic spiritedness. In stark contrast to this, and with the exception of a small cohort of ruthless smugglers who have shown a callous disregard for the well-being of the entire country, the Irish people have responded magnificently to the challenge of combating this destructive virus. That spirit can and will be harnessed in support of our tourism industry. There is no doubt that the sector has experienced difficulties in recent weeks but the industry has for many years demonstrated a great resilience and a capacity to meet new challenges. If, working together, we can continue to withstand the foot and mouth threat, the opportunity will exist to work our way out of our current difficulties and to seek to recover lost ground in the latter part of the year. It is highly significant to note that in the past three months of the year 2000, 1.3 million people visited these shores. That is astounding.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his dedicated work on behalf of the industry. I am confident that, with continued co-operation and prudent management of the situation, we can make 2001 another successful year for the tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister who has undergone somewhat of a baptism of fire in relation to this matter. I do not envy him. I am not sure if the House is aware of the latest news, namely, that the tests from Cooley have proved to be negative. I just heard a report about this wonderful development on the radio and I con<Col N="62" /> gratulate everyone involved. This news will give us the impetus to continue with the responsible attitude we have taken to this matter. Unfortunately, our neighbours have not taken such an attitude.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, this is a heartbreaking and tragic situation. I listened to grown farmers from the Cooley peninsula who were in tears on the radio. One man in particular said he had a blind sheep which had been fostered in his kitchen and which he had carried in his arms to be slaughtered. He also stated that he found a lamb that had been left behind and he was obliged to literally carry it to the slaughter. The man's voice broke as he recounted his experience, which is an indication of the strength of emotion and feeling people have about this matter. I am glad the farmers of the Cooley display a decent affection towards their animals.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of serious issues about the tourism industry. For example, I am sure the Minister is aware that people, particularly those in North America, make no distinction whatever between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Indeed, they make no distinction between Ireland and Britain. In 1982 I was sent to America to take part in a radio and television blitz about the centenary of James Joyce because people there thought bombs were exploding all over the Republic. That, of course, was not the case. We must invest in making it clear that it is safe to come here and that Ireland is, in most respects, open to and welcomes tourists.</P>
      <P>I suppose St. Patrick's Day could be shifted. It has already been shifted. I was on a plane in recent days and the KLM in-flight magazine stated that everyone should visit Ireland on 16 March because, as everyone knows, it is St. Patrick's Day. I was not aware of that, I thought it took place on 17 March. Given that it has been shifted by one day, perhaps we could celebrate St. Patrick's Day in a month when better weather obtains. However, if it is intended to celebrate it on Bloomsday we must be careful because there are advantages and disadvantages involved. This should only be done in consultation with the people who organise the Bloomsday festivities so that the two do not cancel each other out. If we are to contemplate celebrating St. Patrick's Day on Bloomsday &ndash; the Minister indicated that this is unlikely &ndash; it would have to be done in such a way that Joyce and Bloom would be featured on an equal footing with St. Patrick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the steps we can take is to encourage people to take domestic holidays. I do not believe people realise the wonderful value on offer. I do not suppose that what is being stated in this debate will be taken up by the mass media. However, perhaps the Minister and his advisers can take action in this regard. There is stunning value on offer. For example, there are &ldquo;Hidden Ireland&rdquo; holidays. I frequently visit Roundwood House near Mountrath. It offers superb food, a beautiful environment, gracious apartments, very reasonable value and the delights of the country<Col N="63" /> side. There many other such establishments. We can spend our money in our own country and, in many circumstances nowadays, the weather aspect can be more or less ignored.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of support for the tourism industry. It is an entrepreneurial industry in which people have invested heavily in guesthouses, hotels, etc., and it is heartbreaking to see them empty. Not only are there cancellations but new bookings have virtually dried up. People need to be encouraged and we need to ensure that the infrastructure is still there when this crisis is over. If VAT flexibility or rates relief is required, I am all in favour of that. I was astonished to hear a distinguished academic, Mr. John Horgan, say on the RTÉ programme, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, last night that people could be compensated out of the profits of the disinfectant industry. That is a classic example of how a person who is outstanding in his own area of expertise can be totally out of focus in terms of reality. The suggestion was utterly impractical.</P>
    <P>In terms of what is practical, we need to go beyond mere advertisements and capitalise on such activities as cycling tours. Carefully monitored and professionally guided walking tours should also be promoted in consultation with the farmers concerned and subject to strict disinfection procedures.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his efforts. Let us continue to exercise the maximum caution, to ensure that we avoid what is happening in England, such as the loss of the Herdwidge sheep flock in the Lake District. Beatrix Potter, that great children's writer, wrote very movingly of the unique traditional features of that flock whose genetically proven ancestral memory dates back to pre-Roman times. The loss of that irreplaceable flock will have serious environmental consequences. The wonderful moorland landscape will revert to a neglected scrubland desert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time. I join in the applause for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, his Department, the Government and the Opposition, for their attitude in this crisis. I intend it as a compliment when I say that the Opposition has only exploited the situation to a very limited extent for political purposes. There has been a great national effort because of the possibility of a real crisis and real economic damage. I do not believe, as suggested by the Minister, that the situation has the potential to destroy the economic boom, though it has the potential to do temporary damage. However bad the crisis may be, it is temporary. Foot and mouth disease will go away. That is not to underestimate the problem but rather to avoid being too alarmist about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the Government's courage in saying that there will be no subsidies in relation to this crisis. It is very difficult for governments not to give way to vested interests and lobby groups, especially when there is no shortage of funds. <Col N="64" /> Mistakes were made in previous situations. In the currency crisis of 1993, the Government established what was known as a marketing development fund, which actually became a scam. Industries which did not need help claimed that they were in difficulties and were given money quite unnecessarily. In the present situation, the Government has resisted that pressure and has rightly pointed out that, as a commercial business, tourism need not expect subsidies. That is the correct attitude. Hopefully, the Government will be politically rewarded, in terms of the crisis being a temporary phenomenon.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement. Much of what he said is aspirational rather than concrete, and that is necessarily the case. However, I criticise his appeal to the banks &ldquo;to take an enlightened and mature attitude&rdquo;. The banks will take no such attitude and the Government is perfectly well aware of that. As is to be expected, the banks will look at profitable lending opportunities and will only give money to people in trouble if they see them as a good risk, in a temporary situation. They will not indulge themselves, their shareholders or their customers in offering any charity and it would be wrong to expect them to do so. Their attitude will be purely commercial, regardless of any crisis.</P>
    <P>I think we may have an opportunity in this situation, though perhaps I have not read the Minister's speech properly&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Or perhaps not read it at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read it. We have an opportunity to unite with our Northern Ireland brethren and friends on this issue because we have an identical problem and we have had almost identical results in containing it. We have, of course, the Border problem of smuggling and the illicit movement of sheep in what are known as &ldquo;flying flocks.&rdquo;  There is co-operation between thieves on both sides of the Border. I just hope that all this is matched by the authorities on both sides of the Border. It is patently obvious that the Governments, North and South, the tourism interests and any relevant tourism committee and North-South body, have an opportunity to get together on an all island basis to tackle the consequences of this dreaded disease. Tourism is an all-Ireland activity with an all-Ireland benefit. I hope that the Minister has, in fact, conferred with his Northern Ireland counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, on the matter and that the co-operation which the industry deserves is in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This crisis is not the only obstacle to discourage tourists from coming to Ireland. There are other issues and indeed this crisis may camouflage some of them. The raw materials, such as visitor attractions like Glendalough and Killarney national parks, are not necessarily the key factors. The strength or weakness of the currency is a vital issue for foreign visitors in terms of value for their expenditure while in Ireland. To a great extent, that factor is out of our hands. The boom <Col N="65" /> which we have been enjoying is partially currency led. Our weak currency has made it very cheap for people to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the holiday at home campaign has any chance of success whatsoever. It is an appeal to sentiment which will not work in the world of the Celtic tiger. Was there any contingency plan in readiness for a crisis of this type? In the case of Bord Fáilte, a semi-State body of dubious value, did anybody in that organisation anticipate such a contingency and prepare to launch a marketing campaign aimed at selling the benefits of this country, even in a crisis period? </P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important and timely debate. I congratulate him, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and all their Government colleagues for the rapid reaction to foot and mouth disease. This is contrary to what happened across the water. I also congratulate all the people involved to date in ensuring that we limit foot and mouth disease to the two cases on the island.</P>
      <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Proleek in County Louth was probably a blessing in disguise in that it refocused our minds on the potential disaster of foot and mouth disease for the entire country. There was no doubt we were becoming complacent about it. I agree with the Minister that the possibility of a widespread outbreak of foot and mouth disease would threaten our economic security and the livelihoods of every section of the community.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have been linked with our colleagues across the water. We have a huge job to try to improve the image of Ireland and to portray it as a single entity. I was pleased to hear the Minister say there is co-operation North and South of the Border. Although County Monaghan is not renown for its tourism industry, we have been trying to develop it in the past two or three years. There has been much co-operation across the Border, particularly with County Armagh. However, just as we are developing and promoting a number of rural tourist attractions, particularly short breaks, in North America and Canada, we have been hit by foot and mouth disease. As Armagh is close to Monaghan, we will be doubly affected.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that a special tourism marketing and promotion reassurance programme will take effect from this weekend. This is a crisis for the tourism industry, particularly in counties such as Monaghan and Armagh which are not renown for tourism. It will also affect Ireland in the long term in the context of promoting Ireland as a tourist destination. I am not only talking about places such as Killarney, Donegal and Galway, but about other parts of the country which have been untapped to date. We must consider the long-term aspect of this crisis. I welcome the Minister's statement today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many calls have been made in recent days for supports for the tourism industry. It is easy to <Col N="66" /> engage in political point scoring, but we must look at it realistically to see where we can draw the line. I have been in contact with a number of businesses which have told me they have noticed a huge reduction in their business. Coffee shops, delicatessens and home and builder providers have noticed a huge slump in their business in the past couple of months. I do not know if this is related to the fears about the American economy, which seems to have a ripple effect on people's confidence across the world, or to foot and mouth disease. The public is concerned about this issue. Where do we draw the line? If people do not stop at the local coffee shop in County Monaghan on their way to Donegal, the coffee shop will lose out in the same way as the people in Donegal who own bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels. I am concerned this could be an administrative nightmare. When we talk about supports, we are talking about money. I would be fearful about adopting such an approach as everyone is affected.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of complaints in recent weeks from people involved in the tourism industry about the fact that people should avail of the tourist facilities in our domestic market and that we should encourage them to holiday in local areas. The tourism industry must accept some responsibility in this regard. Two and a half weeks ago, for example, an individual contacted a hotel group through a central reservation line to get information about the type of accommodation on offer. However, they have not received the promotional material in the post to date. We can say everyone should support their local tourism, but the tourism industry and the people most affected by this crisis must take some responsibility and react instantly to requests. They should also be courteous, which is another complaint I have received. I do not like being negative, but it is at times like this that we must appreciate our own people as we will be depending on their money this year. It is not difficult for personnel managers in the tourism industry to teach their staff how to be courteous and to serve the customer. God helps those who help themselves in a crisis. The tourism industry should take a leaf out of its own book and instead of talking the talk, it should walk the walk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. The foot and mouth crisis is having a knock-on effect on the economy. I welcome the Minister who is concerned about the situation. Many industries and people are affected by this crisis. We must do all we can to ensure that foot and mouth disease is kept out of the country. While farmers will be compensated for their losses, other people are also affected. If this crisis continues, some people, particularly small operators, will go to the wall. Bigger operators will also suffer as profits are reduced and they run the risk of losing business, such as conferences and weddings. However, smaller operators whom I know have not <Col N="67" /> received an income for the past month. They will probably manage for a certain length of time, but guesthouse owners, bed and breakfast operators or small hotels adjacent to a sensitive area will be badly affected. We must look at what can be done for them. l know it is not a simple thing of dishing out grants or compensation. What the Minister said ought to be put into practice.</P>
      <P>Tourism is losing the public relations war partly because we are linked to Britain and also because we are so focused on preventing foot and mouth that the hatches are battened down and places are closed. There must be a realistic approach and I welcome the Minister's announcement that some heritage centres will open to tour buses.</P>
      <P>It must be possible to open some places with curtailments on access. Railings could be put up and disinfectant mats put down. Visitors could be asked to behave in an orderly manner. Tours, whether to Government buildings or elsewhere, do not have unlimited access but people are kept together in groups. The management of such places ought to be able to arrange things so as to let the public in and not send out the message that they are closed for business.</P>
      <P>Despite the national crisis, people making sacrifices and the farming industry uniting, there are still a few rogues who think it is business as usual. They may be farmers, dealers, racketeers, members of unlawful organisations which patriotically wave the Tricolour but do untold damage. The reporter in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning appears to have the correct facts and the person responding on the radio was vague and admitted there may have been some movement of small numbers of livestock. There should be no movement. Every county has people who look for the extra subsidy or the side deal. Word should go out loudly from this House about zero tolerance of this practice, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised on other matters.</P>
      <P>The horse industry is responsible and plays its fair share. Despite an apparent sleight of hand in which the people who head up the industry were not informed at the same time, there is an easing on horse movements. They can now go to Aintree but there is concern that racegoers will travel also. There is a difference between travelling to the rural and urban areas. Horses which travel must not come back for some time.</P>
      <P>Life must go on. Tourism must receive every incentive. We must win the PR war in the USA and elsewhere. If curtailments are imposed, they must be realistic. I hope the Minister will take these matters on board, and I welcome the Minister of State here.</P>

    <P>Many tributes were paid to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his staff for their handling of the crisis. However, there was full co-operation <Col N="68" /> from the Opposition, particularly Deputy Dukes who played a tremendous part in supporting the Government during the foot and mouth catastrophe.</P>
    <P>I regret that there were no answers to my questions arising from the Minister's ten points. We often feel in the mid-west, and knowing that the Minister comes from Donegal, that we are lost in the debate on tourism which centres on the north-west, Mayo and Galway and Kerry.</P>
    <P>In Limerick city we are trying to get some bed nights from visitors <i>en route</i> north and south. The mid-west itself is a large area depending on tourism. It includes Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary, north Kerry and south Offaly. Shannon Development works closely with the Minister. The figures it gave me show that it is losing £60 million, a figure that is being upwardly revised. That is a huge figure.</P>
    <P>Reading the Minister's address, I do not accept that the public do not realise the importance of tourism. As a teacher I can say that first years are expected to know that it is our biggest industry after agriculture. People are aware of the impact of foot and mouth disease on tourism. This is particularly so in rural areas where activities such as angling, equestrian holidays and walking tours have been hardest hit. The latter is increasing in popularity as we are one of the few EU countries with unspoilt walking routes. I am concerned because this activity is possibly hardest hit and even with the new guidelines it will be some time before people can walk through the countryside. I refer in the mid-west to the Burren, Slieve Feighlim and Ballyhouran areas which have small players in tourism but for whom tourism is their bread and butter. Farming is peripheral and they depend on tourism to supplement or give them an income.</P>
    <P>The figures for the mid-west and of people passing through Shannon on 31 March show that the UK market was up 28% and the US market was up 12%. That is good news up to that date, but what Senators said about foreign perceptions is true. I travel often in the United States to visit my daughter who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. Outside of the cities with Irish connections, like New York and Boston, it is difficult to promote Ireland. Beyond the American mid-west they cannot distinguish our accent from other English speakers. From that context, there is no doubt that we have been labelled as part of the British Isles, which is how many people still see us.</P>
    <P>The normal advertisements used to publicise Ireland abroad are not appropriate in the light of the adverse publicity. It will be difficult to come up with an ingenious way of creating advertisements which are not negative. To say people can come here now because the scare is over will not work in the many cases of people who did not know we had a problem. One cannot give a negative message when trying to produce a positive impression. The task force has to get across a message which will focus on the product we offer without giving a negative impression. I do not <Col N="69" /> know how this can be done, but I am sure there are enough intelligent people coming together to advertise positively in the United States. Tourists will still come from the United Kingdom, particularly in the light of the figures I have given. I am glad that urban based activities can be promoted under new guidelines.</P>
    <P>I compliment everybody involved in the tourism industry, from the owners of the smallest bed and breakfast or farm guesthouses to the managers of large hotels. They have been extraordinarily co-operative and very patient, without whinging or whining, and have accepted that it would be difficult to compensate them.</P>
    <P>In relation to marketing, surely sufficient funding is available to facilitate the aggressive marketing that needs to be done. Sectors like pony-trekking, hill-walking and bed and breakfast particularly need special support, which is a more appropriate term than compensation. We must ensure that they are supported by marketing, as they cannot possibly do it themselves because they have been so badly affected.</P>
    <P>We need to encourage domestic holidays, which are currently very expensive. Those moving between hotels, as Senators who have to stay in Dublin tend to do, know how expensive they can be. Unless one is in that milieu, how can one appeal to those unaware of what is on offer? I think that low-cost packaging is undoubtedly the price that must be paid to encourage people to holiday at home. Irish people respond to special offers abroad and only retired people get a good deal at home, and even then they can only avail of it mid-week. Those who need breaks because of the pressures of working extremely hard, often seven days per week, are not being catered for at home. Short breaks at reasonable prices would attract Irish people and encourage them to holiday at home.</P>
    <P>I have addressed many of the comments made by the Minister, Deputy McDaid. He spoke of attractively-priced short break packages, which must be prioritised. I hope things will work out. We need to be proactive and positive, and to push ahead to get out of this. We cannot allow ourselves to whinge and whine, but rather we must get everybody together to assess the best ways of promoting what we have. Although enticing tourists from abroad has to be a priority, we must also encourage one another to take domestic holidays.</P>
    <P>I would not be as negative as Senator Ross in relation to banks, as I would expect them to play their part from a patriotic perspective. They will be affected indirectly by a downturn in tourism, and they are making sufficient profits, so I see no reason they cannot proactively and positively help people. The banks must give people sufficient space to deal with problems which are already emerging and continue to emerge. I ask them to be as patriotic as everybody else has been since the first negative news broke regarding foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, to the House and wish her the best of luck in her new portfolio. I thank Senator Cassidy for putting this important matter on today's agenda. Everybody needs to be brought up to date on this issue every week. It was interesting to listen to Senator Quinn speak of his family's business. This crisis could well be a milestone in some people's business, as there are people who will never open their doors again after this episode. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of previous speakers who complimented those who put an enormous effort into containing this dreadful disease. The negative results from tests on animals in the Cooley mountains was the great news we were waiting for, and from which we can go forward.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, to discuss this matter with her colleagues, the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I believe that we are not properly marketing Ireland in North America. Agencies like the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Bord Fáilte and Bord Bia should make a joint effort in North America, which they have not been doing so far. Such a joint effort should concentrate on bringing American tourists to this island. As things stand, they believe that there is something wrong with our beef and our meat industry and that if they come here they will contract some form of disease, and are put off as a result. We must get over this problem through a joint effort from the bodies I have mentioned to market this country as a safe place to come to and to eat meat.</P>
      <P>Many Americans confuse foot and mouth disease with BSE, which is something the market needs to get over. I was in the United States for St. Patrick's Day and on numerous occasions encountered such an attitude. Many Americans are put off coming to Ireland because they are afraid of contracting some form of disease from being in the country or from eating beef or lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain people in the tourism industry, for example, those who own restaurants or small hotels, have gone through a horrendous few months. I come from an area where the tourism is very important. There are a number of small hotels along the shores of Lough Conn and Lough Cullen in Pontoon, one of which has not yet opened and the other of which was about to close. This is the height of the fishing season, which is very important to those whose income depends solely on people staying in their hotels and spending money in their restaurants and bars. This has been a dreadful time for those enterprises which have had to choose between opening for business and paying staff or staying closed. The losses incurred in recent months will never be redeemed. The Government should intervene <i>via</i> the local authorities to provide some kind of assistance, perhaps rates remittance, to small hotels and restaurants which have high operating costs. Such businesses are enormous <Col N="71" /> assets to rural areas and if they do not survive, tourism will be wiped out in these areas.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a very important aspect of the tourism industry which, in addition to bringing business to hotels, bed and breakfasts, bars and restaurants, involves people hiring out boats, equipment, ghillies etc. If the Government does not assist such enterprises, this may be a crisis from which people will never recover. I commend the Government on some of the initiatives it has taken to address this crisis. It has been very vigilant in its actions as have the Garda, customs and excise officers, farmers, tourism operators and members of the public.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by the cancellation of the conference in Killarney as it could have provided an incentive for similar events to proceed. The American market is very important to us and a joint effort is required on the part of Bord Bia, Bord Fáilte and other Irish agencies in North America.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who participated in this debate. They clearly appreciate the importance of the tourism and hospitality industry in terms of its economic effect at constituency and national level. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation found it useful to hear Senators' views on the impact of the foot and mouth crisis on the tourism sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone agrees that the control measures currently in operation are essential to ensure the disease does not spread any further. We heard the good news this evening that the suspect case in Wexford has been given the all-clear. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development stated that while this news is to be welcomed, we must continue to be vigilant. The measures put in place initially were very restrictive to ensure the disease would not spread as it <Col N="72" /> did in the UK where it has not yet peaked. However, the expert group, under the advice of Professor Monaghan, gradually signalled certain possible modifications to the control measures. These modifications evolve daily.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands was in a position last week to sanction the reopening of 11 sites which are very important to the tourism sector and she is giving consideration to further innovative measures which could facilitate the reopening of the other sites under the Department's aegis. Every effort is being made in the context of the control measures to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>A clear message is being conveyed that Ireland is open for business. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has advised me that advertisements will be placed in British newspapers tomorrow to this effect. Representatives of the industry are working with the Department and Bord Fáilte to convey that message, particularly to the American, UK and European markets. Various innovative marketing strategies will be considered through which people can be assured that there are plenty of activities in which they can engage and that they will be welcomed. If everyone works together, we can hopefully get beyond this impasse and ensure this vital industry is supported. The Minister has provided assurances that the industry will be supported and that funding will be provided to issue a clear message to prospective visitors that they will receive a warm welcome here.</P>
    <P>Gabhaim buíochas le gach duine a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht. Cuirfidh mé gach rud a bhí le rá ag na Seanadóirí in iúl don Aire atá sa Dáil faoi láthair. Cuideoidh an díospóireacht go mór leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn maidir leis an méid atá ag dul ar aghaidh i dtionscal atá an-tábhachtach dúinn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 April 2001.</P>
