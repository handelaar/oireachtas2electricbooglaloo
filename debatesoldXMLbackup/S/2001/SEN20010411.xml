      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to create a legal framework to protect privacy of genetic information and to prohibit its use for insurance purposes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ó Fearghail of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional teaching hours for special needs students at St. Anne's school, The Curragh, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide additional funding to the Mid-Western Health Board for the establishment of a general practitioners co-operative in the north Tipperary area, which cannot be initiated until further funding is allocated.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline what steps he proposes to take to ensure the speedy availability of Acts of the Oireachtas and other official documents in the Irish language in view of the recent Supreme Court decision in the O'Beolain case and the strong criticism of the Government in that decision.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Henry's and Senator Ó Fearghail's matters. They will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara and Senator Manning may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Ordnance Survey Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, statements on the current status of foot and mouth disease, to commence not before 4 p.m. and to conclude by 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes; item 19, motion No. 29, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business, if not previously concluded, to resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Manning: I wish to raise two related items on the Order of Business. A recent celebrated libel case has led many people in the media to demand reform of the laws on libel and defamation and, by implication, to suggest that the politicians stand in the way of such reform. The Seanad has had numerous debates on that subject and there was a general willingness on all sides for movement towards reform. That reform would involve the lifting of certain restrictions, as they are seen by the media, in return for the appointment of a press ombudsman. We should have that debate again early in the new session.</P>
    <P>However, if there were an ombudsman, I wonder what he would have made of the front page of yesterday's <i>Irish Mirror</i>. It was an extraordinary, insensitive and brutal intrusion into the grief of a family who had just lost their father. I will not mention the details of the case but it was one of the most extraordinary and intrusive pieces of journalism I have seen. We would all benefit from reminding the media from time to time that there are responsibilities as well as rights involved in freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>I did not see last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that these matters are of considerable interest to the Senator as a historian but I would prefer if they were not debated on the Order of Business in the Seanad. If I allow latitude to the Senator on this matter, I know what will ensue. I ask the Senator to abide by my ruling on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling. I intended to make a suggestion but I will make it in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must seek one minute of tolerance from the Chair on this issue. I do not wish to raise the content of the issue but to point out that Members of the House have a responsibility to ensure there is a sense of trust and confidence in the apparatus of the State. If issues arise which undermine people's trust and confidence or which raise serious questions about the management of the Executive of the State, we have a duty to ensure that our business reflects that concern. In that sense I ask the Leader of the House <Col N="379" /> to ask the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to outline from his knowledge of the files in his Department the events surrounding statements to the arms trials 30 years ago. He should come to the Seanad to deal with that matter.</P>
      <P>The Chair will accept I am being careful and I will make no comment on the issue. Questions were raised about trust and confidence in the apparatus of the State. Lives, reputations and families were ruined along the way and it would be appropriate for us to ask the Minister to come to the Seanad to explain the view of the Department at this stage of what happened 30 years ago. We can then decide whether we need to take the matter further. I ask the Leader to do so in a serious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur and accept the Chair's ruling on this matter but there are serious issues raised in this regard. The Leader should consider, in conjunction with the other parties, a suitable apparatus or mechanism to allow us to consider those serious issues and to have a report given to us in due course.</P>
      <P>I too raise the issue of the media. It is now over two years since I proposed that a voluntary press council be established by the media. That received widespread support from the voluntary and community sector in particular and from the public as well as the National Union of Journalists but there was no response from media ownership or at editorial level. Last evening journalists raised concerns with me about the matter referred to by Senator Manning, although I will not refer to it as the privacy of the family has already been invaded to an extraordinary and outrageous extent. We should not add to that but we will have to turn our minds to this issue.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business but last night I made the point, although the Leader was not here at the time, that we spent seven hours on Committee Stage of the Waste Management (Amendment) (No.) Bill and we dealt with it well. It is not sufficient to give half a day to a Bill. Today we have two substantial Bills to deal with, involving a considerable number of amendments, and we are looking at a long day's business. In the new session the Leader should give adequate time to legislation and he should not schedule Committee and Report Stages for the same day. There should be more than 15 minutes between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on defamation, the press and related issues. He is correct in stating that we have looked at these matters frequently in the past but it would be useful to return to the issue of a press council or ombudsman. The Law Reform Commission has issued a report on the law of libel and we could revisit that. There is obviously a balance to be struck between protecting the right to know <Col N="380" /> and protecting people's reputations. Those issues are important.</P>
      <P>Another important issue is the ability of photographers, with their powerful lenses to get in very close to the subject. It is wrong to have pictures in the press of public figures at times of grief when they are burying members of their family. It is totally unacceptable and we have had several instances of that in the recent past. It should not happen and people should be allowed to have their privacy at private events and at times of grief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The monitoring committee of the task force on Traveller people published a very disturbing report yesterday. In the most recent period for which it has figures the number of families living on the roadside or in unauthorised sites has risen from approximately 1,148 to 1,270, approximately a 5% increase. It is now 15 or 16 years since the ESRI published a major report on Travellers which was damning in its conclusions on how they were treated by society. The outcome of yesterday's report suggests that little has changed in the interim.</P>
      <P>At the earliest opportunity the Leader should allow this report to be discussed as it is a human rights issue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published it yesterday so it is now in the public domain and we should be able to discuss it here. That should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the media and the right to privacy. It is ten years or more since Senator Cassidy and I put down a motion on this matter. Senator Manning was the only contributor from his side of the House then, while Senator Cassidy and I were the only speakers who raised the need for a press council. I support such a debate 100% and we should include the right to privacy.</P>
      <P>May we have a debate on violence on the streets? Last night a garda said on &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; that there was enough law but he as good as said it was impossible to enforce it unless the gardaí got more support on the ground from people, as there was only one blackguard in every group who sets this chain of events in progress. Unless those people are singled out and brought to justice we will have this violence.</P>
      <P>There is also a large influx of travelling salespeople coming in from England who are different from Travellers. They travel around with their goods but I wonder if they have the hawkers' licences and so on which are necessary and which others in that business must have. Do they receive social welfare and are they available for work? I am not talking about Travellers who need rehousing, I refer to big business people some of whom are in the millionaire bracket. We must draw a line between these groups as the travelling salesman is causing many problems in rural and urban Ireland today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the requests for a debate on the media and licensing the media. On a more mundane matter, when is it proposed to take Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill? On the basis that the Leader has told us continually that the local government Bill would be completed, done and dusted by last month, where is it exactly at this point and is there any intention of bringing the Bill forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to bring up the matter the Chair has asked us not to discuss but it is a reminder of the ability of television to focus on a subject. I read recently that British Sky Broadcasting is now negotiating a deal to broadcast British stations on terrestrial television in Ireland and is attempting to negotiate a deal with other television stations. If that happens it threatens the future of the network being negotiated by RTÉ for 72% of its broadcasting. I do not understand the topic well enough to debate it now but if we are to debate the media, let us make sure we ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to come and explain the threat that exists to the future of Irish terrestrial television because of the benefits we get from a competing network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the early release system for political prisoners and to get an assurance from him that those convicted of the murder of the late Jerry McCabe will not come under this programme. That is very important and will have to be debated for the morale of the gardaí and people at large.</P>
      <P>With the rise in TB among people in Ireland and the massive increase in the disease in Britain, is a programme in place for dealing with this? This disease was supposed to have been eradicated years ago. It is on the increase again and outbreaks have been announced throughout the country. We should invite the Minister for Health and Children to address the House on the prevention of the disease.</P>
      <P>I also call on the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House after the Easter recess to debate noise levels in cities and large towns. There seems to have been a massive increase in noise levels which should be curtailed. In New York and other cities in the United States it is now illegal to use a hooter. A similar law should be introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators were disturbed to read in the newspapers this morning that a number of county managers were unable to submit required reports to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Some reports submitted on planning investigations were incomplete. This may not have been the fault of any county manager as the 1984 regulations on which the Minister and managers rely are somewhat ambiguous regarding conflicts of interest. A number of staff refused to help in the investi<Col N="382" /> gations, possibly, in their own interest or on the advice of their trade union. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate to be attended by the Minister as the country is too small not to have uniformity. The time has come for the Minister to update regulations to mandatory directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on the role of the media in present day thinking, especially the role of investigative, visionary or &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; journalism which seems to be prevalent in today's society. It is high time that we looked at it. We should ask schools of journalism to make their views known on journalistic ethics which seem to have disappeared, having been replaced by the &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; style of journalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and commend the attempts of the Leader of the House each week to enable us to discuss foot and mouth disease, a very important issue. I put it to him, however, that it is necessary for Ministers to bring something more positive to the House. Many difficulties are faced by the farming community and small businesses in the tourism sector. I know the owners of several such businesses in County Tipperary who have financial problems and are in need of relief. The Government should consider giving rates relief to small businesspeople, particularly in the tourism sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's call for a debate on the progress made in housing Travellers as such a debate would allow the Minister to assess the progress made as a result of the strategies adopted by each county with Government support. An opportunity would also be provided to outline difficulties encountered in specific areas as a result of increased numbers living in caravans and mobile homes. Such a request to the Minister would allow the House to assess progress in dealing with a problem that has been neglected for many years and which we are obliged to deal with in a responsible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a problem I have raised previously. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to outline the appropriate education he has in mind for children with the disorder who are outside the normal education system. Such children should have access to proper facilities and be given teaching support, as is their constitutional right, without having to resort to legal action. Although there have been reports on the subject, they have not been acted upon. A debate as early as possible in the next session is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support Senator Connor's call for a debate on Travellers. A project was almost signed, sealed and delivered in Limerick, but male Travellers refused to be housed despite the fact that female Travellers wished to do so, enabling their children to attend local schools. It <Col N="383" /> is an important issue, one we need to debate quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last three years I have raised an issue on many occasions and do so again today. The Leader of the House should ask the Taoiseach to update us on his call for independent public inquiries into the murders of Robert Hamill, Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. Four years have passed since the death of Robert Hamill and three since I met the Hamill family at an anniversary mass in Portadown. I was greatly taken by their sincerity and have been delighted to see that they have relentlessly pursued the truth. They were vindicated in recent days when it was announced that a number of people had been arrested as a result of inquiries by the police ombudsman. Although they have now been released, it is particularly disturbing that one of those out on bail is a member of the police reserve force. I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Taoiseach to update us on what has happened as a result of his call for public inquiries into the three deaths in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise the urgent need for local authorities to designate park and ride facilities on approach roads into Dublin. Those who live in Dublin have a choice of public transport, but those who live outside the city cannot avail of a similar opportunity. Park and ride facilities must be introduced on the outskirts of the city where traffic moves at a snail's pace. It took me one hour to travel 200 metres this morning, which is utterly disgraceful and unacceptable. If the park and ride option of taking a bus had been available, hundreds of us who were delayed would have taken it, but we could not do so because the facilities are not in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to initiate a debate on psychiatric services, particularly the funding of such services which are the poor relation among health service providers. While we support the removal of existing institutions, unfortunately, the alternative provision of community care is not funded. This area needs to be addressed as the people involved are not in a position to speak very loudly and, certainly, do not have great political clout. Service managers in health boards give low priority to psychiatric care. Those who can afford to be treated privately receive good care, but those receiving public psychiatric care are not given the necessary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to arrange a debate in the session on the BMW region, particularly the funding it receives compared to what was supposed to have been distributed. I also ask for a debate on national roads, especially national primary routes, as no funding <Col N="384" /> seems to have been distributed for national secondary routes. This is an important matter. Counties with many miles of national secondary routes are at a complete disadvantage. If he can, the Leader of the House should bring representatives of the National Roads Authority to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, O'Meara, Farrell, Coogan, Ormonde and Dardis called for a debate on the libel laws and the appointment of a press ombudsman. As Senator Farrell said, this matter was discussed on previous occasions. I can allow as much time as is required for another such debate. I fully agree with all the sentiments expressed regarding sensitive occasions, particularly occasions of bereavement. I agree that such a debate is long overdue. I always thought when communications spokesperson in the Seanad for Fianna Fáil in previous Governments that this measure should have been brought forward and addressed a long time ago. I will pass on Senator O'Toole's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara spoke about Committee Stage of the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which we took yesterday. I originally proposed that it be taken last Friday and that all remaining Stages be taken yesterday. By agreement, however, the debate took place yesterday when there were seven hours of continuous debate. It is a very good Bill.</P>

      <P>Senators Connor, Chambers and Jackman called for a debate on the report of the task force on Travellers published yesterday, for which I will provide time after the Easter recess. Senator Farrell called for a debate on violence on our streets, for which I will provide time. He also called for a debate on travelling salesmen, for which I will also provide time.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan called for an update on the Electoral Bill which I understand will be taken in the House next session. It is our intention that the local government Bill, on Second Stage in the Dáil, will be concluded before the summer recess. If necessary, the Seanad will sit a week or two longer than the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I will pass on the views of Senator Quinn to the Minister for Public Enterprise. Senator Dan Kiely expressed strong views regarding those serving prison sentences which I will certainly pass on to the Minister. I will provide time to debate the apparent increase in the incidence of tuberculosis, although I hope that is not the case. The Senator also called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to debate the increase in noise levels. The debate should be broadened to include the increase in noise levels inside and outside buildings governed by legislation. I am thinking not only of the noise levels outside, but also of the horrific noise levels inside discos. I have been involved in the entertainment world for over 35 years, but the noise levels now experienced by young people at discos must cause long-term damage to their hearing. The noise levels are unreal. We can certainly debate the matter in the presence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the planning laws, in particular the 1984 Act. I will pass on his views to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes spoke about the foot and mouth crisis. I am aware that he will be making a lengthy contribution on the topic this evening. It is still a good idea to include it on the Order Paper every week and I compliment everyone who has taken part. It will be our last opportunity before the Easter recess to compliment every person in Ireland on the responsible way in which they have played their part in keeping foot and mouth disease away from our shores with the exception of the one case on the Cooley peninsula.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate with the Minister for Education and Science, for which I will provide time. Senator Bonner called for an update from the Taoiseach regarding the independent public inquiries being called for, for which I will also allow time.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd called for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House to debate public transport in general, but park and ride facilities in particular. As I said yesterday, I will have no difficulty in allocating time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on psychiatric services. A debate was also called for on the Order of Business yesterday. I will have no difficulty in providing for such a debate at some future date.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke again called for a debate on the BMW region. I will have no difficulty in providing for such a debate, possibly in the third or fourth week after the Easter recess. I will also pass on the Senator's views to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who has provided for large increases in funding for roads in recent years, particularly secondary roads. I am sure, like every other county, County Mayo has received its fair share.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 28, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment reflects a concern among teachers. The work of schools and teachers now covers a wide variety of different approaches. There is a worry among some members of the profession that an issue could arise never anticipated during all the time the Bill was being prepared, that is, the employment of non-teachers in schools to break down the work in a particular way.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it is not the view of Minister that unqualified people should work as teachers, but there is a sense that the profession is in need of reassurance. It has taken a battering regarding the importance of its work. It is the view of teachers that the Bill should reflect the fact that their job is important, crucial and central to the work of schools and that the work should be done by qualified teachers. The Bill should reflect this approach. I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I have to go along with the Senator on that aspect of the matter. It is very important, in the light of what has come out in the newspapers recently about the use of untrained teachers or teachers who are not properly qualified, that we be reassured that teachers have the necessary qualifications to teach their subject range. In the light of the unrest we have gone through in recent months, it is more important than ever that the point be reinforced by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment, irrespective of whether it would involve the retraining of those involved in the teaching profession. The Senator has tabled a very valuable amendment which should be inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the importance of the point made by Senator O'Toole, but the Bill, as it stands, covers it. Section 30 provides that persons who are employed in schools as substitutes cannot be paid from funds provided by the Oireachtas for the employment of registered teachers. Eligibility for registration with the Teaching Council is outlined in section 31. Any <Col N="387" /> person who before the establishment day is employed as a teacher in a recognised school and paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas or where he or she is not employed and is eligible to be so employed will be deemed to be registered for an initial period of 12 months. Within the 12 month period existing teachers must apply to the Teaching Council to be registered and be issued with certificates of registration under procedures set down by the council.</P>
      <P>The council may also set down procedures for the registration of persons other than those already mentioned. These regulations may set conditions for registration, which may include qualifications, teaching experience, medical fitness and evidence of character.</P>
      <P>Section 30 provides that a school may employ as teachers, paid as such from the public purse, only persons who are registered with the Teaching Council as registered teachers. That is the main point Senator O'Toole wished to have clarified.</P>
      <P>Untrained substitutes currently fulfil an important role in schools and those individuals will continue to be paid for this purpose out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. However, if registration is to have a meaning and if we are serious about the promotion of quality in the teaching profession, we must move to an all trained teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole will be aware that under the PPF considerable and ongoing measures have been taken to address the difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. For instance, between last year and this year it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. That represents a major increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. In effect, that shortfall was addressed in a practical way by the national partners through the PPF. When they examined the situation they realised there would be further difficulties unless something was done and, consequently, there was a major investment in the teaching colleges. That major investment is continuing. Massive developments are taking place, including major capital investment, particularly in the Mary Immaculate College in Limerick and in the other training colleges. That is part of the PPF and part of what was identified by the partners when they examined the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those developments are illustrated by the fact that 291 qualified primary teachers graduated in the 1995-96 academic year and now 1,900 qualified primary teachers are graduating. The total intake of students training as primary teachers in the colleges of education in the 1999-2000 academic year has risen to 1,283, which is a significant increase from the 500 entrants in the 1996-97 academic year. In foreseeing the difficulty and dealing with it in a practical way, the Government, in partnership with the national partners, has made a major investment in that <Col N="388" /> respect. That kind of development has also applied additionally to second level.</P>
    <P>To put the existing situation in perspective, there are 20,444 permanent trained primary teachers; 1,101 temporary trained teachers filling in for teachers on a career break, maternity leave and so on; 542 temporary untrained teachers, teachers who are older and who were employed prior to the introduction of the B.Ed; 232 EU permanent teachers, who are fully qualified and succeeded in the Irish test; 208 EU temporary teachers, who are waiting to do the Irish test and, as the Senator is aware, we have allowed them a period within which to do that; 212 temporary secondary trained teachers, teachers who have the H.Dip; 36 permanent teachers with restricted recognition, some of whom are Montessori teachers teaching in recognised Montessori schools and some of whom are involved in special education; and 24 temporary teachers with restricted recognition. That brings the total number of trained teachers to 22,799.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole will note from those figures that the emphasis is on trained teachers. As a result of the national partners' agreement with the Government there is substantial investment in training and in the facilities for training to greatly increase the numbers who are coming through from our training colleges. The point raised by the Senator is covered elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive clarification of the number of trained teachers. He dealt with it in two ways by dealing with the number of substitutes covering for absent teachers and he is looking forward to the time when we will have fully qualified and trained teachers. I was glad to hear him say that as I am certain that within a short period the teaching profession will have taken the decision that it will no longer accept the current situation. People are treading water on this issue in recognising the shortage of teachers, but they are not prepared to put up with it much longer.</P>
      <P>My amendment does not focus on that issue but on a longer-term one. I recognise what the Minister said. To paraphrase him, my understanding of what he said is that as the Bill stands, schools effectively employ teachers, teachers are people whose qualifications are recognised by the council and it will only recognise as teachers those people with the appropriate qualifications which have been endorsed or agreed by the Teaching Council, the majority of whose members are teachers. It is important that is on record. The Minister will be aware that many teachers and branches of the INTO have raised this issue with me. It was one of those issues that people felt might have fallen through the floorboards of time in the period between our discussion on what should be in the Bill and what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's outline of the figures is helpful in the context of the overall debate. Teachers <Col N="389" /> recognise qualified teachers as qualified teachers. The Minister defined teachers under the categories of EU qualified with the Irish qualification and EU qualified with temporary recognition, which I understand to mean they do not yet have the Irish qualification. In the case of temporary post-primary teachers and those with restricted qualifications, in terms of recognition by the Minister, I do not see them as restricted but rather as qualified teachers. My worry relates to the unqualified group and this issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's endorsement of the fact that schools will employ only those teachers who are recognised by the Teaching Council and that the council, which will include a majority of teachers, will be the body to determine which qualifications are appropriate for recognition. In view of the Minister's assurance in that regard, I am not pressing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments. I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive assessment of the procedures in relation to the role of the Teaching Council in assessing qualifications. Section 7 sets out the position very clearly, to determine the qualifications and criteria for registration and also the educational qualifications for new entrants. The council will need to be very assertive in relation to the subject area, especially for second level teaching, because the qualification can vary so much from subject to subject and in terms of the kinds of teachers that are needed in each area or subject range. The onus will be on the Teaching Council to ensure that the qualifications are appropriate, whether in art, music, PE or other areas. In the past, there were teachers with experience of dealing with a range of subjects, without necessarily having the qualifications. Reassurance is very important. I compliment the Minister on his handling of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As General Secretary of a teachers' union, I appreciate the importance of Senator Burke's amendment and perhaps I should have discussed it with him previously. Over a period of 15 years and the work of three interdepartmental committees which contributed to the preparation of this legislation, that was the foremost issue in our minds. We got agreement from successive Ministers for Education, including Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers, that, unlike any other western European country in which there is a teaching council, the teacher unions will actually have a direct nomination to the council. Section 8 provides for two nominations from recognised trade unions representing teachers at primary level and there is a similar arrangement at post primary level.</P>
      <P>This link was intended to establish an in-built, consistent and constant form of consultation. If this had not been provided for, alternative new approaches would be essential. However, there will now be six members representing the teacher unions on the council, that is, two each from the INTO, the TUI and the ASTI. They will have a significant input to the deliberations of the council and will obviously be in direct contact with their unions. While I do not by any means oppose what Senator Burke has put forward as a belt and braces job and I will be delighted if the Minister accepts that amendment, I reassure the House that the teaching profession is in there, i lár an aonaigh, as they say in Dingle, and we hope to stay there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill follows the exact line taken by the steering committee which, in its wisdom, felt that this was the best approach. The Bill has explicit provision for the teacher unions to have representation on the council, not to act as members of the union on the council, which I appreciate they would never do, but rather as wider representatives of the teaching profession who, through their expertise and experience, will enrich the council as a whole. I expect that the choice of nominees by the unions will reflect that by putting forward people whose broad experience will enable them to contribute substantially to the development of the profession. Furthermore, should the Teaching Council require the advice of trade unions or any other group, it can do so under section 53 of the Bill, which provides that the council may make arrangements with <Col N="391" /> other persons to assist it in carrying out its work. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is adequate provision for teacher representation on the Teaching Council, which will have an overall majority of teachers.</P>
      <P>The teacher unions will continue to carry out their important duties in the related area of industrial relations. I consider that these amendments would upset the balance which has been established through the steering group. I hope the Senator will recognise that what he wishes to achieve is covered in the Bill in a slightly different way.</P>

      <P>The role of the Teaching Council can only be to set out the standards and qualifications applicable to those teachers who will, in future, seek to register with the council. I do not intend that the council will be empowered to retrospectively apply new standards to the existing body of teachers. Since Committee Stage, I sought legal advice on this matter and I have been assured that the Bill, as currently worded, safeguards the rights of existing teachers. Section 31 provides for the registration of existing teachers on establishment day. Annual renewal of registration will not be subject to a review of the qualification requirements. However, the council will have a proactive role in promoting the value and importance of continued in-service training, which is an essential feature of teaching or, indeed, any other profession, allowing its members an opportunity to keep themselves in touch with new developments in the field of theory and practice. This duty, which is provided for in section 39, is most important at this time of change and development in the teaching profession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> We are very disappointed that the Irish Primary Principals Network and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals are not included in the council. The members of these bodies, which meet regularly throughout the year, have gathered a wealth of knowledge on teaching, administration, sports and handling other teachers and acquired all the administration skills required nowadays for performing their duties as school principals and deputy principals. They have very difficult jobs, especially in urban schools.</P>
    <P>These bodies discuss the great difficulties principals and deputy principals encounter in performing their duties and are, therefore, very well informed about the administration of their duties. It would be a great advantage to have someone with those skills and experience on the Teaching Council. Being at the coalface of administering education, they have a valuable contribution to make and I will press the amendment. The council is big enough to accommodate them given that most of the universities are, quite rightly, included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the necessity for this. The Bill provides that of the 11 registered teachers employed in, or qualified to teach in, recognised primary schools, nine shall be elected to the council by registered teachers. That should adequately reflect those people working in an administrative capacity, which is only a small aspect of the whole role of teaching. It is a Teaching Council and a member of the union should be selected as a member of the union. The Senator is differentiating between principals and teachers. Collectively, however, they are all teachers so we should leave the Bill as it stands and let teachers be selected on that basis. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely and utterly opposed to this amendment and will vote against it if Senator Burke puts it to a vote. The structure of this Teaching Council is a very precious and delicate flower. We had constitutional lawyers and many others sitting around the table in order to get it right. One of the main difficulties was finding a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh dea-thuiscint ag an Cathaoirleach ar an rud seo. Mar a chítear dúinn sna scoileanna, is foireann scoile atá idir láimhe againn, and we have a situation where the principal is the principal teacher. People should not forget that the word principal is an adjective qualifying the word teacher even though it has been assimilated into the language as a noun. The spelling indicates that it is an adjective with normal qualities, and, as such, it clearly refers to a teacher, albeit one who is the leader of the foireann scoile, the person who is <i>primus inter pares</i> in the school and who is first and foremost a teacher. That fact is even reflected in the payment of teachers. We had a long discussion in the mid 1990s on how principal teachers should be paid. In the UK and <Col N="393" /> other countries, they have switched to a spine, which is a different scale for paying principal teachers, which, incidentally, does not mean that they are paid more. The Irish system has always held that the principal teacher is paid a teacher's salary plus a principal's allowance.</P>
    <P>It is hugely important that we do not allow any fracturing of the teaching profession to take place. I ask the Minister not to accept this amendment because it will fracture it. Looking back at the changes in the Irish education system over the past four or five years, nowhere else in western Europe has the teaching profession, represented by the teaching unions, sat down with management, parents' representatives and the Government of the day and produced, for instance, a revised curriculum for primary education, every line and word of which was agreed, much like the Bill before us, prior to publication.</P>
    <P>That can only happen where there is an organisation, let us say in the teaching area, that represents the views of all teachers including the principal teachers. This forces the organisation, in this case the INTO, to seek an agreement from all the disparate members within the profession and come up with a common position representing the views of the principals, the special and remedial sector, the urban and rural teacher, the island school, the large city school, the disadvantaged school, the very well-off school etc.</P>
    <P>If I had my way, inspectors too would be members of the INTO because it would create a greater focus on moving things forward. It is precisely because there is a single organisation representing teachers that the Department of Education and Science has been able to get agreement on issues such as the curriculum and whole school evaluation, discussions on which are coming to a conclusion and on which no agreement has been possible in other places. That has required compromise from all sides.</P>
    <P>I assure Members and the Minister that the INTO fully intends recommending and supporting for election to the Teaching Council only people who represent all areas of the profession. The current view of the INTO is that at least two of those nine people should be principal teachers. Our view is that principal teachers must be properly and fully reflected in the make-up of the body. We will consult with members who are principals to seek out and support people who will reflect the interests of principals, whether they be a teaching principal in a rural school, an administrative principal in a large urban school or whatever.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that approximately one seventh of the teaching force are principal teachers. I want to stress, however, that I could split up the profession in a lot of other ways, for instance, of the 22,000 referred to by the Minister, close to one seventh are principal teachers but one seventh are teachers working in special education. I could equally make the case that every group should be represented. We in the steering group examined the possibility of breaking up the <Col N="394" /> teaching profession into different structures in order that each could have a representative. The reason we did not was we were of the view that whoever went in, whether from an island off the west coast, an inner city school, a principal of a large or small school, teaching in special education or a different kind of classroom, should look at the matter as a teacher, not simply as a teacher who is a principal or teaching in special education, etc. We should make sure there is a broad reflection.</P>
    <P>I guarantee that that is the view of the central executive committee of the INTO which deals with primary level and reflects the views of my second level colleagues in the TUI and ASTI. Principal teachers will, certainly, be among either our nominated or elected members. It is our view that there should be, at least, two principal teachers on the council. That is our advice to our members and what we will try to achieve.</P>
    <P>The amendment would actually be divisive and take from the impact principal teachers can have where they are seen as leaders. We have seen what has happened in the United Kingdom where a separate principal teachers union has been established, the National Association of Head Teachers, with which there is nothing particularly wrong, but if principals are represented in one place and classroom teachers in another, neither will have to consider the other. Everyone looks after themselves, everybody adopts a polarised position and nobody is required to compromise or make progress. That is the reason the situation, as it stands, is a better reflection of the needs of the teaching profession, its protection and advancement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke appreciates the efforts which have been made to achieve a balance. The purposes he would like to see achieved will be provided for in the establishment of the Teaching Council, the proposed membership of which has been drawn from the report of the steering group after a great deal of deliberation. It sought to achieve a formula that would allow for a balance between teachers and non-teachers, the teacher education institutions, the other partners in education such as school managers and parents and also provide for the role of the public interest. In undertaking this task it relied heavily on the report of the technical working group which included noted education experts to advise it. Nevertheless, we should not understate the difficulty of the task. It is a tribute to the steering group, particularly the chair, Dr. Séamus McGuinness, that it was able to arrive at such an agreed formula. As Senator Ormonde said, its task was to find the right balance. Senator O'Toole highlighted the work that went into achieving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reluctant to revisit the proposed formula as it continues to be appropriate, although I accept that principals are a very important part of the teaching profession. Senator O' Toole mentioned the concept of <i>primus inter pares, </i>first <Col N="395" /> among equals. One of the changes is that principals are now managers, especially in larger schools. The management side has been developed in respect of which there is a need for new inputs. Senator O'Toole made the point clearly that the professional qualification of the teacher is the teaching qualification.</P>
    <P>I accept that principals are a very important part of the teaching profession. Their proven expertise and experience in key areas of the profession such as induction and probation make it likely that the profession as a whole will choose to ensure they are represented on the council, either by way of nomination by the teacher unions or direct election by the body of teachers. I leave the choice to the profession. It can make its own judgment as to who will represent it on the council. We are genuine in our approach and are, essentially, following the advice of the steering group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister and other Senators said. It is possible, however, that there will be a number of teachers on the council, none of whom may be a principal or vice-principal. I look at the matter from the point of view of an outsider not involved teaching. The Minister said that principals are now managers or administrators. School principals and managers should always come from the teaching profession. We should not bring in administrators. I hope we are not moving from that position. If an administrator was brought in, he or she would not be able to become a member of the Teaching Council. I will press the amendment because it is important <Col N="396" /> that principals and vice-principals are represented on the council. Only those with teaching experience should be principals and vice-principals. They have a significant contribution to make to the council. If the Teaching Council is to be representative, principals and vice-principals should be included. This should be guaranteed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Burke on this issue. He implies that principals are more qualified to be members of the council than teachers. The Teaching Council must represent fairly the entire body of teachers. This is listed among its functions in section 7. I am of the view that it will do so. If we make an issue of this for principals, we will make a case for other bodies allied to the teaching profession to be involved also. I accept that the role of principals is important and that they have experience, but we are talking about teachers, not principals. The Teaching Council should represent all teachers. Principals would be included because of the fact that they are qualified teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not talking about administrative teachers coming from outside. It is the opposite. I was taking up the point made by Senator O'Toole that the principal is a teacher and a leader among teachers, <i>primus inter pares</i>. We must support them separately in their leadership role with the required management support. The principal is essentially a teacher and this is a Teaching Council. Twenty-two members will be registered teachers. What Senator O'Toole said is true.</P>

      <P>The Senator has raised an important point on which I sought clarification from the legal advisers. The purpose of the register is, on the one hand, to serve as a clear indicator by the profession for the public of the membership of the profession and their qualifications to teach to high and consistent standards. On the other, members of the profession are entitled to some privacy in respect of certain details on the register. For example, it may be important for the council to know the date of birth of a teacher, but not for such a fact to be made public knowledge. My legal advice is that this question is, essentially, one for the council and addressed in section 29(6)(<i>a</i>). As the guarantor of the standards of the profession, it is its duty to provide sufficient information to the public to make that guarantee meaningful. At the same time it has a responsibility to protect purely personal information pertaining to teachers.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides a specific mechanism for the registration of teachers and the subsequent conditions which schools must adhere to for the employment of teachers. This is predicated on the clear definition of teachers as set out in section 2 of the Bill. The council will assume responsibility for any changes to the definition of what constitutes a teacher. The use of &ldquo;in a teaching capacity&rdquo; will create a great deal of uncertainty in this context. If it is intended to have the same effect as the present formulation, I prefer to retain the existing phrasing. If the amendment is intended to capture a further category of persons not covered at present, I would not consider it appropriate that this should be done here. The council will have the responsibility for the further extension of the qualifications of what constitutes a teacher. Indeed, this specific point was addressed by the report of the steering committee, which noted that the Teaching Council might consider providing for the membership of lecturers in colleges of education, departmental inspectors, teachers in the early childhood sector and other appropriate groups. I consider that this would be the appropriate means for any such extension, and this was the view taken by the steering committee.</P>

      <P>This section is an important bedrock for the council, ensuring the maintenance of high quality standards in the teaching profession. The particular nature of the profession, where teachers continually occupy a position <i>in loco parentis </i>and to an extent act as a form of moral standard for the pupils in their care, makes it imperative that where a teacher substantially and consistently departs from such a standard, the council would be in a position to investigate and take appropriate steps. The example of a teacher convicted of a serious criminal offence, such as a drugs-related offence, with no direct relationship to his or her teaching position but which carries with it implications for that teacher's care of pupils is an obvious example.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke's amendment would remove this aspect of the council's role and I do not think it would be appropriate to do so. I therefore cannot accept the amendment. The Senator will understand that there are circumstances in which the council would need to be able to exercise this role.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) lists some of the grounds for initiating a fitness to teach inquiry. These are failure to comply with, or contravention of, any provision of this Act, the Education Act, 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1999, or any regulations, rules or orders made under those Acts. Some would argue that this section is too all-encompassing and could give rise to fears that complaints may be made against teachers for minor infringements. I believe that there are enough safeguards within section 42(3)(b) to ensure that minor or isolated infringements will not be used to instigate investigations.</P>
      <P>All applications will be examined by the director of the Teaching Council before any investigation is initiated. The director may refuse an application should he or she decide that the application is frivolous, vexatious, made in bad faith or an abuse of process. I remind the Senator that all the Acts mentioned in this subsection were passed by the Oireachtas. They are a protection for parents and their children and ensure that they have clear grounds in the future to base any complaints against a minority of unsuitable teachers. All the Acts mentioned in this subsection allow for the making of regulations and orders. These regulations and orders are the means by which these Acts are put into operation. To accept this amendment would negate the whole purpose of this subsection.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister. He understands how legislation governing education, educational welfare and vocational education committees must be encompassed. The question of a teacher's fitness to teach was discussed on Second Stage. Many teachers are concerned about this question. The Bill allows the Teaching Council to examine a teacher's fitness to teach. However, one needs to take account of changes in society and the discipline problems which exist in many schools. Some teachers may not be able to teach in particularly difficult circumstances and the Teaching Council must examine and assess a teacher's fitness to teach on that basis. This was not made clear on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister has replied to this amendment very comprehensively. However, the concept of fitness to teach is a very broad one. In a certain type of school it could become almost impossible to teach. In such circumstances a teacher could be seen by parents or by the public as being unfit to teach. To protect the profession the Teaching Council must consider this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The council may request the investigating committee to inquire into the fitness to teach of a registered teacher on grounds of failure to comply with provisions of existing education legislation. It is appropriate that the investigating committee, the majority of whose members are teachers, does that. The alternative is that the Department does so. We are giving these rights to the Teaching Council and putting safeguards and protections in place. These provisions already exist in legislation. We have the choice of including these provisions in the remit of the council or leaving the council without them. We are placing our faith in the council as a self-regulating body and giving it these powers.</P>

      <P>An association representing school principals is to be established. The fitness of a principal to manage a school must also be questioned. The poor management of a school might cause discipline problems which would lead, in turn, to accusations of unfitness to teach. There are principals who cannot administer properly. Poor administration can lead to unrest within schools and create the problem of unfitness to teach. Responsibility of the Teaching Council should be extended to ensure that a climate is created in every school which allows teachers to teach effectively and avoids ambiguity regarding the question of fitness to teach.</P>

Repeated appeals are usually made to the person concerned, often over a long period. It will be the responsibility of the investigating committee to make these judgments.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment would place an additional administrative burden on OSI which would add to its cost and reduce the operational flexibility of its field staff. What is proposed in the Bill is essentially a continuation of arrangements which have been in place since 1854 and which have proved to be workable and acceptable to landowners. At present OSI staff enter private lands only where absolutely necessary and conduct their work as unobtrusively as possible. There will be no change in this approach following the enactment of this legislation. Obviously there will be communication between the OSI and anybody affected. No concern in this regard has been raised with me when drafting the Bill and bringing it forward. The position that pertains at present is well tried and trusted. I see no need to tie it down in the way suggested by the Deputy. What is done in practice more than meets what Senators are asking me to do. The amendment is not necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> This amendment is designed to meet the main issue raised by unions representing workers in Ordnance Survey Ireland. The issue raised on Second Stage was the absence from the legislation of a provision providing for the appointment of a worker director to the board of the new Ordnance Survey. This is a major deficiency which the amendment is designed to remedy. There are similar amendments from other Members. It is a major issue.</P>
    <P>I note from correspondence from the IMPACT trade union and other contacts with individual workers in the Ordnance Survey that while the Minister for Finance originally promised full consultation on this matter, it was not undertaken. Concern has been expressed with regard to the speed with which the legislation has been brought forward, although its principle is not contested.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take this important principle on board. The practice of having a worker director on the board of State companies is a long established and successful one. In an era of participation, partnership at workplace level and consultation between unions and employers, the appointment of a worker director should have been an automatic inclusion in legislation such as this. It is disappointing to see it omitted and I wonder to what extent it marks a new departure by the Government in terms of policy on this important matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give a positive response on this issue. It is, probably, one of the most critical issues in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no specific provision in the Bill for the appointment of worker directors, this does not reflect a rejection of the concept of worker directors in so far as the Bill is concerned. When it was being drafted it was considered that the hands of Ministers for Finance should not be tied with regard to the composition of the board and that he or she should have the freedom to make appointments to it, in accordance with Government policy of the day on such matters, and include one or more worker directors or representatives if he or she sees fit. That is the current practice.</P>
      <P>The OSI has partnership structures in place which include management, staff and trade union representatives. These will continue to be developed and should ensure staff interests and concerns are discussed and brought to the attention of the board. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to accept the amendment. It is open to the Minister to make such appointments, as is the case in many other board appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also open to the Minister not to do so. It is at the discretion of the Minister as he or she &ldquo;sees fit&rdquo;, to use the Minister of State's <Col N="409" /> phrase. This is not a satisfactory situation. A future Minister could take the view that he or she will not appoint workers' representatives to the board. The structure contained in the Bill is too loose. Discretion remains entirely in the hands of the Minister of the day. This is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments with regard to Government policy. Given that the tradition of worker directors is well established, it should be enshrined in legislation. It is at the discretion of the Minister because, according to the Minister of State, the Minister's hands would otherwise be tied. That suggests that the Government sees such a provision as an unnecessary stricture. It is possible, therefore, that the appointment might not be made. It is not sufficient, simply, to have partnership structures within an organisation, although they are welcome and where they are in operation they do excellent work. However, the Minister is not going far enough with partnership structures within the organisation. They are non-statutory. The issue must be dealt with through legislation. Otherwise, too much discretion will be left to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I invariably agree with Senator O'Meara; a great deal of what she says makes sense. On this occasion, however, the Minister of State's case makes more sense. It is good management practice to find a way to involve everybody in ensuring an organisation succeeds. I am not sure that it would be wise to tie down an organisation by insisting that it have certain people on the board. On occasion the best people for the job might not, necessarily, come from the workforce. If the objective of the organisation is correct, its mission statement is moving in the right direction, but if the best people for the job are elsewhere, I would prefer not to tie the hands of the organisation by insisting that it have a certain number of representatives on the board. On the other hand, if the organisation is to succeed, it would be unwise to ignore the huge fund of information and commitment that can be secured by involving those who work in the organisation.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister of State on this occasion with regard to providing in legislation that there must always be a certain number of worker directors. There could well be a greater number of worker directors in an organisation such as the Ordnance Survey since it is likely that people from within the organisation will play a better role than those from outside it. However, I would prefer not to tie the organisation's hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much wisdom in what both Senators said. I do not disagree with the principle they outlined. I addressed the issue on Second Stage. I do not wish to prescribe one organisation because we will then be obliged to prescribe other organisations and build all of them into the legislation. That is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way forward in an organisation is to have a well structured and ordered working relationship. I am not suggesting that worker directors <Col N="410" /> would not be included in this instance, but there should be flexibility in the configuration of the board, regardless of whom the Minister of the day might be, for many obvious reasons. It is not necessary to enshrine the amendment in the legislation. The approach adopted with this and much other legislation is the correct one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring some issues to the Minister of State's attention in case he is not aware of them. They were brought to my attention by the trade union representing the workers. There has been a certain degree of trauma within the OSI on the industrial relations front in recent times resulting in a deterioration of previously good industrial relations within the organisation. It centred on the suspension of staff. I am informed that the suspended staff enjoyed widespread support from colleagues who collected substantial sums to support them throughout the suspension.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the details of the case, but the provision of a directly elected workers' director is seen by the staff as important in rebuilding good industrial relations within the OSI, particularly in developing a proper partnership relationship in the new body. I hope the Government will listen carefully to that argument. The representatives of the workers are saying that they see the appointment of a worker director as an important goodwill gesture, particularly given the recent background of bad industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The Government puts great store by partnership, consultation and so forth. There have been calls for partnership in recent industrial disputes, something on which the Government should act at every available opportunity. This issue is, probably, more important than just a general principle because of the recent history in this organisation. The trade union states that when the issue was first brought forward in the deliberations with the employers no indications were given that it would be problematic. The conclusion that workers will inevitably come to, therefore, is that it is problematic. While a request was made, no indication was given that there was a problem, which was not acted upon. That is not the way to build good relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a polite note from the Cathaoirleach this morning to advise me of that. I support Senator O'Meara's amendment as it fulfils the same requirement as the amendment I put forward. We need to take a broader look at this issue. At the lowest point in our recent economic history, 13 or 14 years ago, which was the high point of the recession, those in charge of various areas realised that a new synergy could be released and a new energy created by asking workers to bring their brains to work. Companies realised that those working in their industry, or their representatives, might have something valuable to contribute to move forward their products, markets or services. That idea evolved into the concept of social partnership which was born in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>There were many different manifestations of this, including industrial relations legislation in the early 1990s which allowed for worker-directors in certain semi-State companies. Some years later, this was further developed by the Government of the time which proposed to allow sub-board representation for workers in various industries. That development was significantly driven by an acknowledgement of the importance of involving workers in a company's decision-making process at sub-board and board level. I recall the then Minister for Labour and current Taoiseach outlining in this House his commitment to the idea of worker directors and worker representation at board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the board of Ordnance Survey Ireland is not broad, as the organisation must be run in a clear, focused and directed way. Its objectives are precise and will be fulfilled with the skill, expertise, talent and professionalism of people on the ground. It is crucially important that we ensure these qualities are recognised and valued by amending this Bill to allow worker representation at board level. That is what I was trying to achieve in a slightly different way in my amendment which was ruled out of order. In supporting Senator O'Meara's amendment, we will <Col N="412" /> send a message to public service workers, including those in OSI, saying that they are held in high regard by the Government.</P>
    <P>This measure costs us nothing and adds to the cohesion of the board. It gives the organisation a greater sense of direction and ensures that workers have a voice at board level. It is in line with Government policy and the partnership model and is commercially important. Those who are closest to an organisation are often those who can see the value of their own work. By putting them on the board, with those who are far from the work, the cohesion which is necessary to provide the comprehensive overview required will be achieved. For that reason and related reasons, I strongly support Senator O'Meara's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this amendment at some length in the House this morning when I stated that I am not without sympathy or understanding for the position outlined by Senator O'Toole. This Government has been extraordinarily committed to the principles that have been enunciated in the House, a commitment which has been demonstrated over and over again. The Government agrees with the argument put forward by various Senators this morning and by Senators O'Toole and O'Meara this afternoon. I am not prepared to prescribe these issues in legislation in this or any other Bill. Notwithstanding the arguments that have been made, flexibility is built into this Bill and it will be open to the Minister of the day to make a decision based on the issues of the time.</P>
      <P>It is important to state that I am not indicating that the Minister for Finance will not appoint a worker-director. He has met representatives of Ordnance Survey Ireland and fully understands their issues. As a result, and because of the way the Bill is drafted, I am not prepared to accept the amendment. I understand the arguments being made and we should wait until the board is appointed to see if the requirements of Senators have been met.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister of State says and that he says it in good faith. As I stated earlier, it is important that this provision is enshrined in legislation. While the current Administration has quite clearly indicated its support for the representation of workers on the board, a future Administration may not share that view.</P>

      <P>We discussed this issue on Second Stage. It is my strong view that the 40% target should be reached. It would be in everybody's interest if it was achieved. It is not always possible to achieve it, but there are strong guidelines on gender balance on State boards providing that 40% of members of boards should be women.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to note that the interim board of the OSI, set up by the previous Government, includes two women out of a total membership of seven, which is a female representation on the board of 29%. I am not saying that as a criticism. That was a positive step forward in that regard. While it is desirable that women should be adequately represented on all State boards, it is not appropriate that a percentage representation of men and women should be fixed in this Bill. I do not consider that would contribute anything to it. A future Government may want to appoint more or fewer women to the board. The issue of gender balancing is a genuine one. It is something to which we all aspire. I take the view that one does not have to go over the top. There are good people, men and women, who are suitable for certain appointments and that is the basis on which it should be done. I cannot accept the amendment in the context of the Bill.</P>

Clearly, the Minister of State will not support this amendment. I fully accept that he believes there should be a gender balance, but the proviso &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; will always be there. We know from experience that unless it is put into legislation, nothing will change. Aspiration is one thing, reality is another.</P>

      <P>I understand the absolute honesty of what the Senator has said and I do not disagree with it. However, putting something in legislation does not necessarily deliver the best results. There are occasions &ndash; I speak from experience &ndash; where the quality of the people available cannot deliver on the aspiration. That does not necessarily undermine the intent of all Governments, political parties and Independent Members of the House on this issue. We achieve our aspiration on many occasions, but it does not achieve anything to force the issue, nor is it in anybody's interest to do so, in situations where it will not be delivered anyhow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that, on this occasion, the Senator will agree with me. Discussions on the change of status of OSI and the implications for the staff have been taking place in the partnership framework against the background of the guarantees in the Bill. The terms and conditions of employment of staff will be no less favourable in the new body than at present. The staff of OSI have welcomed the proposed changes in OSI status. Any issues affecting staff due to such changes are best dealt with through direct negotiation with the staff representatives rather than through legislation. I believe that is something to which the Senator will subscribe. Putting such matters into legislation would negate the role of legitimate negotiations and good faith on both sides. Notwithstanding the Senator's good intent, the amendment would be unwise.</P>

Such negotiations are already well under way. While I do not wish to prejudice the outcome, I think it is fair to say that the negotiation of transitional arrangements, whereby transferred staff remain eligible to compete in Civil Service promotion competitions for a period after establishment day, is a fairly normal occurrence in similar situations.

      <P>Yes, but in the context of the present negotiations, staff have welcomed the change. I believe they rightly see the future of the OSI in a strong and expanding role. There is a wider argument, which I will not open up now. We are trying, collectively, to give people in the public sector and the Civil Service much greater career opportunities. Developments such as that in OSI create that kind of opportunity and it is important that the negotiations are well handled by the staff representatives. I do not recall any recent similar case in which there has been a residual difficulty and I believe that all such negotiations have been very successful.</P>

A transition period could conceivably mean a few years, until matters have blended in. However, in all our lives we reach certain stages and move on to new opportunities. People should be committed to their new situation rather than looking back. There is enough scope in the negotiation process to cater for the point which the Senator has made. I expect that the staff will negotiate on the basis of a few years rather than months.</P>

      <P>In page 14, subsection (1)(b), line 42, to delete &ldquo;nominated to stand as a candidate for election&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a standard insertion in Bills setting up State bodies. It is time for the phraseology to be changed. The note in the Bill in relation to section 19 refers to membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament and I accept that. I have no difficulty with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) referring to a person nominated as a member of the Seanad &ndash; one of the Taoiseach's 11 &ndash; a person elected to fill a vacancy in the European Parliament, or a person is elected to a local authority. I have difficulty with the pro<Col N="418" /> vision that if one is nominated to stand as a candidate for either House, one ceases on nomination to be a member of the board. That is unfair and unjust. There is also discrimination in that compared with the next section which deals with employees of the board. They are dealt with in a totally different way. I ask that the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; be replaced by &ldquo;elected&rdquo;. If a person is elected to the Dáil or Seanad then they would cease to be a member of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Doyle has raised this issue. I have raised it many times, including on a Bill here three weeks ago. I believe that what is provided is unconstitutional. It is only right if there is some form of conflict of interest but there is no such conflict. I support the amendment but I have even stronger views than those put forward by Senator Doyle.</P>
      <P>I am an Independent and since I was elected to this House I have never made distinctions as I do not believe that Independents are any way purer than members of parties. Every party has difficulty recruiting people to stand for election at any level. I recognise that even in recent times members of the Government and I as a trade union general secretary have supported arrangements whereby people can be seconded. That issue is covered in section 19(2).</P>
      <P>However, staying with the amendment, I do not believe there is any conflict in a person being nominated to stand for election. That person should not be deprived of the right to remain as a member of the board. That is unacceptable and I do not believe it is constitutional. It is an impingement of constitutional rights which make it very clear who is entitled to stand for election. I know that being a member of the board does not prevent anyone from standing for election but there is certainly an infringement of the liberty to do so if a person has to choose between remaining a member of the board and going forward for election. It is hard enough to get people to stand for election but if they have to pull down the shutters on important aspects of their lives, paid or unpaid, it becomes even more difficult. It is a constitutional issue and I do not see any conflict in a person standing for election and being a member of the board. If a person works for RTE and stands for election&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I did not intend that but as it happens it is a case in point. If a person employed by RTE stands for election they work until the day of their nomination. They are not sacked then but are not allowed broadcast during that period. The same applied to Members of this House and it is understandable. There are other examples. This proposal is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is the participative aspect of our democracy. We should not do anything in our legislation that makes it more difficult for people <Col N="419" /> to become involved in public life. I am still unhappy with the section but I do accept Senator Doyle's proposals and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. Acceptance of this amendment would take the dirty look off the section and I appeal to the Minister, in the interest of public life and democracy, to accept it.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses should question every occasion where people gratuitously &ndash; I do not mean that as a reflection on the integrity of the draft persons of the Bills &ndash; decide to impinge, restrict or constrain the rights of Members of the Oireachtas. I have made this case on every occasion it has arisen over the last 13 or 14 years but with little success. On the odd occasion we have succeeded in getting change. People should not be restricted from greater participation because of their decision to get involved in public representation.</P>

      <P>I support all Senator O'Toole has said. There is potentially an element of the word processor working here in that some elements seem to be lifted from one piece of legislation to the next. We must resist that kind of activity. There are a number of professions or careers where people should be limited in relation to when they can run for election. One of these would relate to national broadcasting stations because an obvious conflict does arise. A conflict would also arise in the Civil Service but I cannot see where the conflict might arise in relation to the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. How could being on the board of the Ordnance Survey be in conflict with running for election? I ask the Minister to consider all the points made by Senator O'Toole and to take a broad view of what we propose here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have great difficulty in not accepting the logic of what other speakers have said and particularly what Senator O'Meara said in relation to the word processor. I also see where this proposal comes from and I understand that it may be difficult for the Minister to agree with the amendment today without full investigation. Many people nominated to stand for election never make it and are never heard of again, particularly capable people who are headhunted for Oireachtas elections. I remember a number of people who had no great activity in politics previously who were headhunted, defeated and never heard of politically again. I accept that they should step aside for the period of the election campaign. I understand that if they have an interest in politics possibly that is how they will be from then on, but many people disappear from the scene and they have no further political involvement. They have not come from the grassroots political scene and they have never been involved in parish pump politics. I feel they should be asked to step aside for the period of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> They must step aside if nominated for the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. They must do so if elected to a local authority, but not if they are nominated to one. Most people selected to stand for local authorities are active, and will continue to be so, whereas people standing for the Oireachtas or the European Parliament often fall by the wayside. We are trying to attract good people into politics but this could turn them off. Many State boards are composed of people nominated by the Minister of the day who are active in politics even while on the board.</P>

I felt gutted &ndash; that is the only word I can use &ndash; when for almost the first time in the State's history I became a victim of this policy. I was a member of the board of the BIM from 1979 to 1982. In 1981, I was elected to the Seanad while another board member, G. V. Wright, was nominated and we were both disqualified. What is here is different. It is now accepted that elected Members should not be on boards like this. I know people who were nominated to stand in the past 12 months and that includes people on both sides of the House. As Senator Bonner stated, some people nominated will never be heard of again.</P>

As an aside, on a point of principle, I personally dislike the whole section. I do not agree with the notion that a person in public life is a lesser being, less honest, caring, or committed than people from other walks of life. It is a professional career like any other. I say that for what it means. The difficulty is that in present times of accountability and transparency public perception forces things on us.

I give my word on that on the basis of Senator Doyle's amendment and what others said that it is wrong. I am uncertain about the constitutional issue &ndash; I am not a legal person &ndash; but I suspect that Senator O'Toole may be right about that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the Minister's decision and his extended comments on the issue. We need to address this matter. I raised often in recent years the right of public representatives to be members of boards while involved in other areas. The difficulty in making the case is that one always has to make clear that one has no interest in being a member of a board. I am concerned about the signals we are sending.</P>
      <P>The problem is, as the Minister said, the issue of openness, accountability and jobs for the boys or girls. There must be a way of dealing with it. There should not be a restriction as is in the Bill, but, instead, if any member of the board is a current Member of either House of the Oireachtas or whatever else, their approval should be required by a particular committee. That need not be a committee of the House but a body above reproach or reproval. It would give its seal of approval for someone's appointment.</P>
      <P>The Constitution's wording on requirement for election to the Seanad is for the person to have knowledge and experience of an area. To get on the agricultural or fisheries panel, for example, a person must show knowledge and experience of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that a person can be nominated by a body without his or her know<Col N="422" /> ledge. A member of OSI's board could be nominated for the Seanad by a well-meaning supporter without his or her knowledge and suddenly be taken off the board.</P>
    <P>Before anyone stands for a Seanad Éireann panel, he or she must have relevant knowledge and experience. A requirement similar to that could be included in this Bill. A person could be appointed while being a Member of the Oireachtas but would need the endorsement of a committee of the House or another body. It would be a step away from the perception of a person being appointed because of political affiliation.</P>

I spent my lunch hour trying to deal with a problem arising from the Act which can cause difficulties. I am not 100% sure that I like the amendment as the Act outlines the method by which it can be extended. In the past six months one of the sub-committees of the House has examined how it applies in certain areas and taken advice from the Departments and agencies required to conform with it. I want to be assured that the amendment is necessary. Such a provision should not be included in this way, rather the Act should be extended at the end of each year or two year period when each Department must produce a full report which is then considered by a committee of the House which makes a report available to both Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, this section provides that the Minister may make an agreement called a service order with the OSI related to the performance of its public functions and that funds shall be advanced by the Minister out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas to perform these functions. It deals with the functions of the Ordnance Survey and the way in which it performs its duty. I have some criticisms of it and take the opportunity to make them.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance Survey is the national mapping agency and while some of its maps are up to date and have been revised in recent times, there are entire areas where there has been hardly any revision of either the 1:10,000 or 1:2,500 maps. Given that we are voting public moneys to its functions I hope the areas which have had no updating of data on their maps will be attended to. I come from a rural part of County Roscommon. The first Ordnance Survey map for the area was published in 1837, revised in 1885 and again in 1914. There has, however, been no revision of the 1:10,000 map since 1914, which, frankly, is unacceptable. There have been huge physical changes in the countryside in the intervening period. Modern and up-to-date Ordnance Survey maps for an area must be to hand for new roads or infrastructure. Maps for many areas, particularly rural areas in the west, have not been updated since 1914 while the 1:2,500 maps have not been updated since the 1920s. I accept that in areas around Dublin, for example, updating does take place and understand a new series of colour photographs of the country has been taken and will be published next year. In 1995 a black and white series was produced, but it is prohibitively expensive to get a high resolution copy from the Ordnance Survey or its few agents throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development employs a private map digitising company to digitise land areas to cover, for example, the extensification scheme, a very important income supplement for farmers. On applying for area aid, a farmer must provide an accurate area map of the land which is related to the subsidy available and, in turn, stocking density. Farmers are very well aware of the area of their farms. Part of the pride of owning land is knowledge of the area down to the last half perch. Farmers take the information they supply to the Department from their folios and OSI maps. The old maps had a scale of 25 inches to one mile and the area of every field was measured to three decimal points. This information is submitted to the Department. Land Registry and Valuation Office maps are also used. These digitising com<Col N="425" /> panies have reduced the size of many farms. I wonder if they will reduce the size of the country from the 32,000 square miles that this island represents.</P>
    <P>Farmers are aggrieved that there is no single agency with which to deal. They must deal with Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Land Registry and the Valuation Office, stating to them that the area of their land is X number of acres or hectares, and the new digitising company based in County Louth and operating through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development tells farmers that their land area is less. As a result, many farmers have suffered severe penalties in relation to the amount of money they can receive. There should be a single agency &ndash; Ordnance Survey Ireland should be that agency &ndash; to determine exactly what is the area of any given townland or parcel of land. This would be preferable to having a private agency albeit employed by a Department. Ordnance Survey Ireland should be the arbiter.</P>
    <P>I have an interest in maps, particularly old maps, and they are very important tools in the study of the social and economic history of the country. It is amazing to see what an area contained in the 1830s and 1880s, and the changes that had taken place by 1914. Indeed other changes which have taken place since that time have not been recorded in maps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Senator on the section is an interesting one. The first part of his argument in the context of up-to-date mapping is important. The mapping of rural areas of the country is very much out of date and requires to be brought up to the current standards of technology application. The rural mapping database is now being undertaken and it will take about four years to complete the entire programme. Equally important in that context is that there will be a rolling cycle on the database of not more than three to five years between updates. I am dealing with the Valuation Bill in the other House and that also has no current or continuous valuation.</P>
      <P>There is a range of private companies in the business of providing maps. OSI depicts <i>de facto</i> the area that is surveyed. It is not up to me to comment on what a private company may say, and a judge in a court of law will make his judgment if it comes to that. The Bill deals with most of the Senator's points. OSI recognises the expanded role it must fulfil and this is why we are creating a new structure for Ordnance Survey Ireland so that it can do what the Senator wishes and compete in the marketplace for private business. That will bring consistency into the system. The quality of the work achieved by OSI is excellent and it is hoped to maintain that. The Senator can be assured that the rural mapping question is being addressed. It will take about four years to complete and it is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (2), line 15, to delete &ldquo;three months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments speak for themselves. I think that this House should make an effort to enhance good management practice by putting a sense of urgency and speed into how things are done. Deadlines are now being put on reports. I would like to see them being issued more speedily. Most of the bigger banks now publish their accounts within days of the end of the financial year. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 do not deal with publishing but rather with reporting of accounts. The United States public companies which report on a quarterly basis also have very strict time deadlines. We in Ireland have a bad history of not reporting regularly enough or early enough. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are separated from amendments Nos. 13 and 14 and amendment No. 18 is a different topic altogether.</P>
      <P>About three years ago I requested the RTE annual report for the previous year in the first week of December and I discovered that it had not yet been published. I asked RTE for a publication date and was told that the Minister of the time had received the report some months earlier and it had not been published. When I was involved with An Post, we set a standard of ensuring that our reports could be handed to the Minister within three months. We then discovered that the Minister would not necessarily publish the reports immediately. There are two points here. I wish to put pressure on State organisations to adopt good management practices which ensure that they report to their shareholders and to the Minister within one month. I want to put pressure on the Minister to then publish those reports within three months. I believe that is good management practice. I will speak about amendments Nos. 15 and 16 later.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 states:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (3), line 20, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as soon as may be after receipt and in any case not later than three months after the end of the financial year to which the accounts refer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe that is good management practice and it would be a good discipline to instil in any organisation, not just OSI.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendment. All too often by the time reports are received, they are historical documents. Efforts have been made during this Government's time <Col N="427" /> and the previous Government's time to make reports relevant to decisions we are trying to make for following years. I suggest to the Minister that it would be well worthwhile accepting these amendments. Similar amendments have been accepted in the past regarding other reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators, particularly Senator Quinn, for the amendments. I understand the precise point the Senator is making. He will be well aware that there has been a huge improvement in this area in the very recent past when there was no timeframe in existence. That might also have been the time when the Senator was involved in the other organisation he referred to. Since that time, the whole question of introducing a timeframe has become part of the general approach. The three month span is a reasonable time. I do not think it would be realistically possible for OSI to have accounts ready within a month of the year's end. It will probably happen that the one month timeframe will become the norm. It does not have to be three months, it can be three weeks. Three months is just the outer limit, not the minimum required. I think that is working reasonably well.</P>
      <P>To try to submit all the accounts to the Oireachtas by mid-March is unrealistic. As the Senator will be aware, all the audited accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General have to be submitted by 30 June. That is an enormous volume of work and I would not like to prescribe specific timeframes. Given the volume of work the Comptroller and Auditor General has to do, the importance of his role and the scrutiny which is expected of his office, six months is a short time.</P>
      <P>A major improvement has been made. It would not be appropriate to introduce more sudden changes. I would rather wait and see what happens. We should bear three things in mind. Three months is the outer limit. The current requirement is a substantial improvement on the previous situation where there was no limit whatsoever, and the technology which is now available will probably further reduce the time taken to one month.</P>

      <P>I accept that there has been a considerable improvement in recent years and I recognise that this is a step in the right direction. I will continue to push very hard to instil a sense of speed and urgency into State organisations. It has not been there in the past but it is developing now.</P>
      <P>The largest company in the world at the moment is Walmart. It publishes its weekly sales figures every Monday at 12 noon. This gives an idea of the ability of modern technology to publish. If we are determined to do something, it can be achieved. I merely want to instil a sense of urgency. I accept what the Minister says and I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an example of how things can be speeded up. I repeatedly asked that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals be published more speedily. The first year Deputy Cowen was Minister for Health and Children the report was published almost 15 months after the end of the year in question. The Minister said the report would have to be produced more rapidly and the next year it was published nine months later. Last year the report was published six months later. That report is most complicated because it includes a report from every mental institution in the country. If people are told they must produce reports more rapidly, they will do so. In general they are pleased to do so because they realise that more notice is being taken of what they are doing.</P>

      <P>I do not understand subsection (2). In the private sector accounts are not usually approved by a board until they have been audited, but subsection (2) refers to the approval of reports by a board before they go to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Quinn's point regarding subsection (3). I also appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement that there have been vast improvements. The reports of other State bodies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta and IDA Ireland often arrived two years late when the figures they contained were obsolete.</P>
      <P>I would be more inclined to support Senator Quinn's amendment if he proposed a limit of six months. It would be impossible for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to have accounts available for submission to the Oireachtas within a three month period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual deadline for the publication of reports of State bodies is six months after the end of the financial year. It is important that accounts are done within three months. I do not wish to create difficulties.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle enunciated by Senator Quinn. The entire Civil Service and public service must take their part in driving the economy forward. They must be as keen as the productive sector in using technology to deliver information into the marketplace as quickly as possible. To that end the Office of Public Works, which is a huge office, has been divided into six business units. Although I am not required to do so I now produce accounts for each business section. I benchmark my architects against the best architectural practice in the private sector. I request information on costs, benefits, delivery and quality. The State has a right to know this and my staff support me in doing so. It is the first office in the Civil Service, not alone in Ireland but almost throughout the world, to have achieved ISO 9000 on project management. I expect that by the end of the summer we will have achieved ISO 9000 on our architectural practice and we are aiming for ISO 9000 on the six business units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The Senator is aware of my approach to business and my understanding of what is needed. I appreciate his point of view and I agree with everything he has said. However, I do not wish to impose unnecessary frameworks which cannot be achieved. Everyone is beginning to understand what must be achieved. These time limits will become irrelevant because systems will deliver as one would expect.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), line 41, to delete &ldquo;6&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has worked very hard since taking responsibility for the Office of Public Works and the result of that work is evident, particularly in the achievement of ISO 9000. I like to hear him speak about benchmarking, transparency and the use of technology. This is exactly what I am referring to in amendment No. 18. This amendment deals with a different topic from amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 and it should not have been grouped with them.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes that the OSI publish its report by electronic means. This would ensure that the report is made available to everybody. Most Bills which come before the House fail to recognise that the world is changing in that a large number of people do not use paper for communication. Those of us who have children in other parts of the world know they communicate electronically and no longer write letters. Given my former involvement with An Post, I am saddened by that. Young people use e-mail to communicate and use the Internet for information. I want to see every State company acting like a private sector company and making sure that information is available to people without having to buy a paper copy of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday's debate on waste management was particularly interesting when we talked about the amount of paper Members receive on our desks, 90% of which goes into the bin unread. The sensible, rapid and most efficient way to gain information is through electronic means. I want to force every company to publish its accounts electronically &ndash; I use the term &ldquo;electronic means&rdquo;. When I tabled similar amendments to a Bill a year or two ago I used the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and it was pointed out to me that the Internet was less than ten years old and might not last another ten <Col N="430" /> years. The term &ldquo;electronic means&rdquo; is wider and includes various means of publication.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey Ireland office probably publishes all its documents electronically already. I want to be sure it recognises that those who want information should not have to take a bus to the city centre to buy a paper copy of its report but should be able to get it at home.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed the importance of speed. Where the speed of publishing is concerned, reports are sometimes made that sit on a Minister's desk and are not published there. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are to urge their publication rather than have them sit on a desk.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 is on a different topic. It is to urge publication by electronic means. That is an amendment that the Minister will be able to accept even if he has problems with some of the others. It has a worthy objective and is a means of achieving that regarding which the Minister has set a good example. He spoke of transparency, using technology and benchmarking standards in the private sector and that is exactly why he should accept amendment No. 18.</P>

      <P>As Senator Quinn said, amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, have been well covered. When we were discussing the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, over the last few days with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, Senator Quill and I, along with other Senators, addressed the serious problem of the number of copies of reports that are produced and are never read by Members of the House. This is the kind of copy that could be easily produced by electronic means and would be available to all Members of the House and the public.</P>
      <P>We said it was important that the Houses of the Oireachtas try to take the lead in reducing the amount of printed material that goes into various dumps. As the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, stated, the accumulation of paper in landfills is one of the most difficult things we have to deal with. We can avoid the production of more printed material because many people only need to look at a specific part of a report. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

The argument that many reports given to Members of the Oireachtas are probably never read does not apply to the general public. Many of the reports that are made in relation to semi-State and public bodies are of great interest to the public, and therefore annual reports should be published. They should be published in two forms because we are all up to date with the new technology.</P>

      <P>On the point made by Senator Doyle, when I get a report on my desk, I invariably have some supporter or acquaintance <Col N="431" /> interested in it. I immediately put it in the post and send it to them. There is an automatic assumption that reports, such as annual reports, should be available immediately on the electronic systems. People who read of a report in the media will want to know the website address so they can gain access to it without difficulty. Senator Quinn is correct in saying that the younger generation communicates using only electronic systems, such as e-mail&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising an important point, but we should understand that this Bill is giving the OSI the means to do a lot more than it can within the constraints imposed upon it by the Civil Service structure. It is already at the forefront in using electronic means. It will clearly need to be if it is to win customers in the marketplace, which is the whole point of the new status it is getting. It will have to earn income and set up companies. It will not be given State money to do so. It will be subject to market forces and will use viable business plans in partnership or on its own. It will go to the financial institutions in the same way as anybody else to raise funds.</P>
      <P>One of the shop windows for the whole thrust of the development of the OSI will be its annual report. It is clearly in its own interest to get it to the market as quickly as it can, and to do so in all forms that it can. That will, and already does, include all electronic means available to it, which it shall continue to develop. In answer to Senator Doyle's point, publishing its report will be an important issue for the OSI because it will be a marketing tool to demonstrate to the public the quality, range and speed of its services. The annual report will become something very different from what it was in the past, which was just a piece of paper to be laid before the Oireachtas. It may have been important, but was probably ignored by most.</P>
      <P>Concerning amendments Nos. 17 and 18, the OSI is already publishing by electronic means and there is no need for me to amend the legislation to bring this about. It is not known what forms of electronic forms of publication will be available in the next ten years, but the OSI is already using whatever ones are available. It is common sense to do so.</P>

It would be wise to accept them and make sure that somebody does not slip up in the future for want of being reminded. If the OSI is to be as commercially driven as the Minister says, it will have to continue publishing electronically. I want to make sure this is stitched into the legislation, but I will not push it.</P>

      <P>In page 20, lines 27 and 28, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>This amendment to delete subsection (1) is put forward because I am advised that there is no need to dissolve the OSI. It has no corporate status, certainly none made available to it by any Act passed since 1922. Therefore, it is effectively a branch of central government and consequently transferred adequately by section 32(2). The amendment is largely a technical one.</P>
      <P>Where amendment No. 20 is concerned, the schedule to the 1924 Act sets out the areas for which the Minister for Finance is responsible. As the Minister retains the function to give directions to the OSI under section 5 of the Bill, why is it necessary to retain the OSI in the 1924 Act? I am advised that there is a second reference to the OSI in the 1924 Act that is not being deleted. I wonder why this is the case.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this at some length at Second Stage and I disagree with Senator O'Meara. It is clear that if the OSI is to function in a commercial sense it must move outside the Civil Service structure. OSI will now have the ability to set up commercial companies under its aegis, not funded the Exchequer &ndash; that is, the taxpayer &ndash; but with moneys raised in the marketplace to develop new services etc. Under its present structure it cannot do that. If OSI were to remain in the Civil Service it could not have this freedom and so its capacity to meet its customers' demands and exploit new opportunities in the marketplace would be severely limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has accepted this view as one of the reasons from it to move forward. It was validated by the interim board, appointed by the previous Government, which came to the same <Col N="433" /> conclusion. The effect of the amendments would be to keep OSI within the Civil Service structure which is contrary to what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>The amendment is unnecessary as the Irish language equivalent of Ordnance Survey Ireland is provided for in section 3. It is essential from an historical and commercial point of view and in view of the fact that the new body will retain its traditional role of providing a national mapping service for the State that the words Ordnance Survey be retained as the new body's title. Ordnance Survey is a title that has been used for 177 years and is familiar to everybody. It would not make sense to risk losing this high degree of public recognition by changing or diminishing the use of the name Ordnance Survey. The Irish title will continue to be used. Having built up a clearly defined grand name over 177 years we do not want to do anything that would undermine it. In any event its Irish title is contained in the Bill.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen): I am pleased to be in a position to make the changes I signalled earlier in the Seanad. I was not sure at the time that it was possible but I said if possible I would accept it. The amendment meets the fundamental point raised in Senator Doyle's amendment and also the points raised by Senators on both the Government and on Opposition sides who put forward cogent and coherent arguments.

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen): I thank Senators for their contribution to the Bill not only today but on Second Stage and I appreciate the comments made. I was happy to bring forward amendments to the Bill which had been suggested here by Senator O'Toole, in particular, in relation to education being mentioned in the Bill. It was also mentioned by many Members during the debate on Second Stage. I am delighted there was such a fruitful discussion and that I could listen to Members and make appropriate adjustments. I hope the Members are aware that I take the Seanad seriously; I always have, given that I am a former Member. Nobody can claim legislation is perfect but, collectively, we have much to contribute to it and that has been demonstrated in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank my staff and those involved in Ordnance Survey Ireland for their help in preparing the Bill. I look forward to its speedy passage through the Lower House and into law.

    <Title>Foot and Mouth Disease: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern): I last updated the House on developments in relation to foot and mouth disease on 27 March. Since the beginning of the crisis the Government has adopted a policy of openness and transparency in relation to developments. Both Houses of the Oireachtas have received updates from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and me on a regular basis. We are grateful for the Opposition's support for the Government's efforts to deal with this national crisis. It speaks well of politics in this country that when the chips are down all sides of the House recognise that some issues are, simply, too big to play politics with. Sectional interests must be set aside when the national interest is at stake.</P>
    <P>I am pleased again to provide an update for the House on the most recent developments in relation to the disease. Since my last speech to the House, the news has been largely positive. We are by no means out of the woods yet and must continue to proceed with extreme caution. This morning's announcement by the North's Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Bríd Rodgers, that there is a new suspect case in Cookstown, County Tyrone, is a salutary lesson to those who suggest the problem is over. The suspected case is on a large dairy farm and I understand around 80% of 20 heifers examined showed symptoms suggestive of the disease, although the veterinary view appears to be that these symptoms might be attributable to another viral condition found in calves. The suspect holding is some considerable distance from the Border and I understand the 10 km surveillance zone will not traverse the Border into the South. Nevertheless, we anxiously await the results which are expected this evening.</P>
    <P>My Department has built a close relationship with our Northern colleagues, both at ministerial and official level. I am sure the entire House will <Col N="437" /> join me in hoping the result from Cookstown this evening will be negative. Senators are aware that a local authority abattoir in Bray, County Wicklow, has been closed because two lambs slaughtered yesterday were found, on post mortem examination, to display symptoms of the disease. Initial results on samples sent to Pirbright received today were negative. We have also received today final clear results from the case at the ICM plant in Navan.</P>
    <P>We have had only one case of foot and mouth disease in this country. There has not been a further case since that in Proleek on 22 March. The three weeks since then, however, have not been without their tense moments. Senators will be aware that the negative test results from Camolin and Bunclody, County Wexford, and, most particularly, Piedmont on the Cooley Peninsula were greeted with a huge sigh of relief throughout the country not just from the farming community, but from all sectors of society, where people from all walks of life have made an enormous contribution to the effort to contain and eradicate foot and mouth disease. All those who have contributed to the tremendous effort to keep foot and mouth disease from spreading in this country deserve special mention and thanks.</P>
    <P>Our gratitude must be accorded to sports organisations such as the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU which have cancelled games, the business and commercial organisations which have cancelled trade fairs and shows, members of the farming community who have strictly adhered to the guidelines laid down and ordinary members of the public. There is, however, another group of people who deserve special mention. It is a very small group who have made their own contribution to this national crisis. I am talking about the tiny minority of unscrupulous people, mainly dealers, who have betrayed this country, the people of Ireland, their neighbours and friends by flouting the health certification rules in place regarding international trade in live animals which successive Governments, in partnership with other member states of the European Union, have put in place to protect animal health, but, more importantly, human health. These are not just abstract concepts debated by bureaucrats in Europe; they are serious issues affecting real people in Ireland and elsewhere as the recent foot and mouth disease crisis and before it the BSE crisis have illustrated clearly. These issues affect ordinary people in their day-to-day lives and those who flout these rules are affecting the lives of these ordinary people just as surely as if they had perpetrated an act of physical violence directly on the individuals concerned. Any remaining loyalty to these unscrupulous people is misguided and those who have information on illegal activity must come forward, even at this late stage, to the authorities. It is their clear duty to do so for the sake of the health, well-being and future prosperity of their own children and those of their neighbours and friends and that of the national economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> Let me focus on the potential impact on the national economy. The scale of what is at stake is considerable. In the United Kingdom, primary agriculture represents 0.8% of gross domestic product, 2% of employment and 4.6% of exports. In Ireland, primary agriculture is far more important to the economy, representing 3.5% of gross domestic product; 7.3% of employment and 5.6% of exports. These figures represent primary agriculture only. The food industry is also a major contributor to national wealth and employment in Ireland. Output from the industry currently stands at around £11 billion per annum, representing almost 25% of all industrial output. The industry provides direct employment for 40,000 people and accounts for 10.5% of total employment. In addition, it provides indirect employment for a further 280,000 people on farms and in sub-supply industries and ancillary services. Food and drink exports in 2000 were valued at £5.4 billion or 9.4% of total exports.</P>
    <P>These figures, while impressive, do not tell the whole story. In terms of gross output, the industry accounts for almost 50% of indigenous manufacturing industry and, because it uses mainly native raw materials &ndash; it is estimated that its annual purchases of raw materials, labour and services represent over 70% of total sales &ndash; it is a significant contributor to our balance of payments position. Due largely to its geographical spread, the industry makes a particular and substantial contribution to agricultural and rural communities and because it is 90% Irish owned, its exports account for 27% of net foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>The industry comprises over 700 companies and while some of these have become major international players, the vast majority are categorised as SMEs. The main components of the industry are the beef, dairy products-ingredients, other meats, prepared consumer foods and drinks sectors. A significant development within the industry in recent years has been the growth of the prepared consumer foods sector. Between 1993 and 1998, output from the sector increased from £797 million to £1.4 billion. This figure is expected to reach £2.6 billion by 2006. There is also a small, but important and growing speciality foods sector comprising some 200 companies, employing 1,500 people and with an annual output of £100 million. It is clear that the spread of foot and mouth disease would have a very serious impact on the sector.</P>
    <P>The spread of the disease would have a knock-on effect on many other sectors, most notably the tourism sector which brings in over £3 billion annually in foreign exchange earnings and represents over 4% of GNP. The Minister indicated in the Dáil recently that if foot and mouth disease was not controlled and eradicated, the tourism industry would, almost certainly, collapse.</P>
    <P>These are the stakes and this is the reason we must continue to proceed with caution. On a more positive note, it appears that work we have done to date has been effective and provided there are no further cases in this country in the <Col N="439" /> meantime, the Commission decision imposing export restrictions on Ireland is due to expire on 19 April.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the House on 27 March, an expert group, under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD, has been established to review the controls in place on an ongoing basis. This group is continuing its work on the basis of an analysis of the risks and announcements have been made regarding a phased resumption of a variety of activities on a controlled basis and, in many cases, subject to strict protocols agreed by the expert group. Announcements have been made regarding the resumption of a variety of activities.</P>
    <P>In particular, the group proposed an indicative timetable for the resumption of the transport of fodder to areas of shortage with immediate effect, subject to observance of the relevant disinfection procedures; the importation of horses from non-infected areas in countries other than Great Britain from 9 April, subject to permitting arrangements administered by my Department; the use, from 16 April, of marts as assembly centres for properly identified animals going directly for slaughter, subject to the agreement of a protocol with the mart groups; the resumption, from 19 April, of Al services, subject to a protocol agreed yesterday; the resumption of repopulation of herds affected by BSE or brucellosis, subject to the consideration of each case on its merits and the attendant risks; the resumption of horse racing on a limited basis from 16 April, subject to strict adherence to agreed protocols, and the normal fixture list from 19 April &ndash; point-to-point racing, however, is still not permitted; the resumption of greyhound racing from 19 April, subject to an agreed protocol; and St. Patrick's Day festivities will be allowed to proceed in mid-May.</P>
    <P>In addition, the expert group yesterday revised its guidelines to the general public. These are available on my Department's website. Events such as horse racing, show jumping, greyhound racing and livestock shows which involve animals continue to pose the highest risk and restrictions will continue to apply, except where codes of practice have been agreed with my Department. Nevertheless, the group reviewed the 1 February date which had been included in its earlier reports. In the light of the current situation, it has now been recommended, and the Minister has accepted, that this aspect may be adjusted and that lands to which susceptible animals may have not had access in the last 28 days may now be accessed for a variety of events. A variety of other events, however, may proceed, subject to adherence to the recommendations laid down by the expert group.</P>
    <P>Let me turn briefly to developments in Europe, particularly in the context of a prospective lifting of the Commission decision on Ireland of 19 April. The position in Great Britain continues to <Col N="440" /> be critical and the fact that the rate of increase in the number of cases has slowed in recent days is of little comfort to the farming community there. The horrifying scenes of funeral pyres and mass burials will leave an indelible imprint on a whole generation of farmers and their children who will carry the tradition of farming in the next generation. Yesterday there were 37 new cases, the highest number of additional cases for a number of days, bringing the total to 1,200 cases. Recent evidence that the movement of people may have been a factor in the spread of the disease highlights the necessity of maintaining our vigilance at ports and airports, and those who must travel to the United Kingdom should strictly adhere to the guidelines laid down by the expert group. We must continue to be on guard in the face of mounting pressure to relax controls over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In France the prognosis appears reasonably good and no new cases have been identified for some time. I am extremely concerned, however, about developments in the Netherlands, where two new cases were identified yesterday, bringing the total to 22. That country covers an area little larger than Munster and has a population exceeding 15 million people. The remarkable efficiencies of the Dutch economy and the intensive nature of their agricultural development will not assist in the fight against this disease. It is difficult to predict anything other than further cases in this extremely densely populated country. I am aware that Germany is extremely concerned about developments in the Netherlands, in particular because the border between the two countries is an intensively farmed livestock area.</P>
    <P>All this goes to show that the fallout from this crisis will continue to occupy Governments throughout Europe for some considerable time to come. This is most certainly true of this Government and we will continue to stress the absolute need for vigilance until the United Kingdom is declared free of foot and mouth disease, regardless of what happens here or in Northern Ireland between now and 19 April. As to when the United Kingdom authorities will succeed in eradicating foot and mouth disease is a matter of speculation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that when the dust settles from this crisis, some valuable lessons will have been learned. The need for improved animal traceability has been highlighted and the House will be aware that new arrangements are being put in place for the tagging of sheep. On 2 April my ministerial colleague, Deputy Walsh, outlined the principal elements of the national sheep identification system, NSIS, which is to come into operation in May. That will involve the tagging of all animals moved off farms from May and from the national flock before the end of the year. It will encompass producers, marts, meat factories and others involved in the sheep sector and will provide for traceability from farm of origin through to the eventual carcase. To meet this objective, not alone will producers be required to tag their <Col N="441" /> sheep but meat factories will be required to link the individual tag number to the number of the finished carcase and to satisfy themselves as to the provenance of any animals which they purchase. Separately, arrangements have been made for the regulation of dealers in animals and poultry and this will help to restrict the activities of rogue dealers who are detrimental to legitimate trade.</P>
    <P>In addition, significant legislation, the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in recent weeks, although a colleague from my county called it draconian. In light of today's events and given the information that is not being received from those people concerned and their lack of co-operation, that legislation is not draconian; it is urgent and necessary. Some people are still not telling the truth, even at this stage. Some people are not coming forward to give information. They are refusing to recognise there is potential for a national crisis here. A person appeared in a court case to prevent implementation of the legislation, having illegally imported animals. Therefore, there is a major problem and it is time we all came together to ensure the future of our industry in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, provides important additional powers to authorised officers of my Department and significantly increases the penalties applicable to offences in the animal health field. I am certain that when this crisis has passed its lasting legacy will be a more tightly regulated and consumer-friendly animal trading sector. In the meantime we will continue with our cautious approach, maintaining controls where they are seen to be necessary and easing them only where a risk analysis by experts shows this is reasonable in all the circumstances obtaining in Ireland, the UK and the rest of Europe. This approach has served us well to date and I see no reason to change it now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Members of the House to ensure the message gets across that those who have deluded us and told us lies in the face of this potential national crisis should be cut out from our society and farmers should not buy stock from them. They should not be part of the trading. Individuals and groups such as choral societies who are not involved in the agricultural world have co-operated and people have inquired on helplines whether they should go to their holiday home in Wexford or go to see a grand-daughter in Cork, yet there is a group which is still not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>I learned last week that 14 weanlings were left outdoors in a part of my constituency following the introduction of this legislation. They were left to roam the roads and had no identification. They are, therefore, unidentifiable. Cows calving were left in a wood, starved and dehydrated to death because they are unidentifiable. Those people concerned do not deserve to be part of our society in the name of animal welfare never mind <Col N="442" /> in the interests of the country. They are not fit to be primary producers. They give the decent people who are in farming a bad name. These are a small minority. If we have a cancer, we should cut it out. Those people should be cut out and there should be no tolerance for them. Let us implement this legislation to the full rigours of the law and punish those people concerned by example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State on the occasion of these important statements we have on a weekly basis on the foot and mouth disease outbreak. I commend the Government parties on having this important discussion. The issue is of such significance to the country nationally that it is important we discuss it in this House, examine it and keep it monitored on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister started off by commending the Opposition. That is what Parliament should be about. We should be able to have a good debate, particularly at a time of crisis, on an issue of national importance, and at no time should we politicise the issue. We did not do so in this instance. The Minister referred to the level of interest communities took in co-operating on this matter. I have never heard of so many people responding to inquire what they could do in their own small way. That was significant. I would go further and say that the response and the attitude of people living in urban Ireland was something for which rural Ireland, including the farming industry and farming organisations, should always be grateful. When we look back on history on how town and country have had a go at each other, the way city folk and town folk responded to this emergency should be recorded.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that we considered the measures introduced some weeks ago to deal with rogue dealers and the eradication of this disease as draconian. We did, but we agreed they were essential. I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister of State's statement. We have witnessed in the constituency we share in recent weeks that people there are concerned they will be given a bad name simply because some individuals are reckless about the way they operate and do not uphold laws we have made in this House. I am proud we were involved in making those laws. I am also proud they will have an effect in the long term of putting those people out of business. Some of those people have given agriculture and our food producers a bad name at home and abroad. At the end of this learning and, perhaps, cleansing process we will probably have a better industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been dealing with the movement of stock to the best of its ability. We are all concerned about the situation in the North and will keep our fingers crossed for the next few hours that the results will be negative. This time of the year is a time of change in the farming world. Animals, including calves, are being put out to grass. There is a major problem, partic<Col N="443" /> ularly in southern counties where farmers are accustomed to selling their calves and young store cattle. This gives rise to a serious financial problem because farmers are relying on the sale of stock to pay outstanding bills. For example, in the case of ACC loans, there is a moiety due for payment on 1 May, which farmers will be unable to meet if they are still restricted from selling cattle. The situation should be reviewed in the context of once-off movement, possibly, under a permit system under which either Teagasc or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development would identify and establish contact between those farmers with calves to sell and those wishing to buy. I am not advocating wholesale unlimited movement of livestock, but rather a carefully controlled and managed system of movement. The problems arising from both food shortages and financial difficulties need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that changes are due to come into operation shortly in relation to the current restrictions on the operation of the artificial insemination service, but I am requesting clarification of the situation, including the operative date and the arrangements with regard to private operators. This is a critical time of year in the cattle breeding process as the supply of calves next year will depend on decisions being made. Unless the situation is properly managed and monitored, the quality of livestock could be adversely affected as a result of the activities of unlicensed operators.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the effects of the current restrictions on the tourism sector, including agri-tourism. This affects many people in rural areas for whom the income from tourism, holiday homes and various small businesses is an important part of their livelihood. The director of CERT addressed a meeting of South Tipperary County Council last week. One of the issues raised on that occasion was the difficulty of those involved in the hotel and catering industry and related tourism activities in meeting their due payment of rates. I urge the Minister of State to bring that issue to the attention of the Government. He will be well aware of the plight of many small businesses in the current crisis in his own county and throughout the country. As a gesture of recognition of the problems of that important non-farming sector in terms of borrowings and their commitment to employees, the Government should consider a once-off abatement of rates.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government side of the House for agreeing to the facility for a weekly review of problems and concerns arising from the current restrictions. I trust that the news expected shortly from Northern Ireland will be favourable.</P>

Training and certification will be compulsory from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to give an update on developments concerning the foot and mouth disease crisis which has hit the economy. The disease is rampant in Britain and spreading in other European countries. We are left with questions which need answers, some of which are not available. The point at which the Minister of State concluded his statement is where I would like to start. All sides of the House have supported the efforts of the Government to ensure the disease is contained and will not spread beyond the one outbreak in County Louth. The rogue dealers to whom the Minister of State referred have no place in society or the practice of farming, whether in Tipperary, Louth, Cork or any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>Good farming practice is an endeavour to produce a quality food product. While this is not a human health issue, it is part of a programme of good farming practices. When the relevant legislation was before the House I had no problem in saying that it was not draconian. I asked if it went far enough because what has been happening has threatened to destroy our major industry. Thanks to the vigilance of the Government, the co-operation of the Opposition, hard work by departmental officials and the many agencies concerned the situation has been kept under control.</P>
      <P>There is a risk of complacency creeping in. There are even signs of this in the agriculture sector, perhaps due to the farming pressures with which the Minister of State is very familiar. There is a danger in the requests for an easing of restrictions. We are aware of the difficulties in the dairy sector in the south and the pressures in relation to calves, stores and pure-bred stock. We need, however, to consider how much greater the pressures would be if the disease took hold in the countryside and the enormous difficulties to which that would give rise. It is vitally important that farmers do not become complacent. The temporary hardships can be overcome, as farmers overcame hardships in past decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I particularly welcome the level of co-operation achieved between Northern Ireland and the Republic. When we debated the Animal Diseases Bill I called for a combined effort, North and South, in a one island approach to the control of animal diseases common to farming in both areas. I am glad this is in progress and that the farming organisations, North and South, have come together. It will not be easy because there are many problems, but it would be a wonderful achievement if we could have an all-Ireland approach to finding solutions not alone to this problem, but to others down the road. With close co-operation and the regionalisation of the North, which Europe has accepted, it would be possible, even now, to take an all-<Col N="445" /> Ireland approach to the control of diseases and the many other common problems that we have. Were that to occur in the long term, a protocol could be put in place to enable a common approach to all problems. That would be a great achievement.</P>
    <P>My one great concern is how the disease came into Ireland, the UK and Europe. For some time now, I have been asking how good are the regulations governing the importation into the EU of food products, particularly meat products, and how well these regulations are being enforced. I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister of State to raise these issues at European level at a more appropriate time. We all know that diseases from Asian and South American countries are finding their way into the EU. Are they coming in through legal or illegal transactions? These matters should be discussed at EU level and one of the issues I will raise at the meeting this evening of the Joint Committee of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Commissioner David Byrne is the border controls required to stop them. I am aware that the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, his Minister of State and Department officials are engaged in that debate.</P>
    <P>We face another problem. Senator Tom Hayes referred to the build-up of calves in the south. Because we are no longer exporting those animals, there has been a huge build-up relative to last year when this country exported about 400,000 live cattle. This raises a question of growing importance which I have referred to in the past, that is, the continued free movement of live animals within the EU. There is a need for a new protocol. We as an exporting nation need to protect the live export trade to both European and non-European countries. This requires certain protocols and changes in approach, which are a matter for the EU.</P>
    <P>If we do not protect this trade, it will have a huge negative impact. We have to be aware that policy makers in certain European countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, both of which carry considerable weight, are beginning to speak loud and clear about changing policy on live exports. We have to pre-empt the possibility that these countries will set a policy in train, which could totally negative and impact upon the export of live cattle. God help us this year if we had not had that trade last year. We need those exports for the balance of trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Tom Hayes both referred to my next point. Whether we are talking about tourism or the farming industry, people have financial difficulties at present. The financial institutions have a role to play in meeting this challenge. The bottom line, making profits, should not be the determining factor in how they deal with clients who have borrowed money. That factor should be more human and social and it would be right for this House to call on the financial institutions to show a social conscience and <Col N="446" /> refrain from pushing people in the farming or tourism sector to the wall.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that there are cattle to be sold, money is not being paid back to lenders and people are under pressure for various reasons. It is fair to ask the financial institutions to play their role in this crisis like the ordinary people who have done so well. I join in the words of thanks and appreciation that have gone out to the various organisations who have played their roles and to the people at large. It could be said that foot and mouth is an agricultural problem, that it is farmers' trouble, but the public at large has done a tremendous job that has extended even beyond rowing in behind every request made of them.</P>
    <P>We, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister of State are coming under pressure for greater releases. Let it be done in a most studied fashion. We are not doing too badly. There are inconveniences and we are suffering a bit but how much more would we suffer if the disease were to affect us to anything near the extent that it affects our neighbour? I will not reflect on what our neighbour has or has not done. There is no point as the story tells its own tale. Let us keep the disease out. We have to withstand the pressures we face.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister's comments about the rogue dealers and farmers. There is no place for them. They do not represent me or the thousands of farmers out there who do things reasonably well. They are a cancer. The factories and abattoirs have been getting away with blue murder. They must also be examined and brought within the ambit of the law. Let the full rigours of the law take their course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I share time with Senator Henry? I will be very brief. The Minister and his words are welcome. He talked about a national crisis. I believe the words for crisis and opportunity are the same in Chinese. This is an opportunity for us. Senator Callanan has talked about an opportunity. We have not used these opportunities in the past. In 1996 when BSE hit Britain, we were aware that we could do something about it, yet just last week we were told we can no longer sell T-bone steaks on the bone. Britain and Portugal can do so but in those five years we did not do what we should have done. We did not introduce ear tagging. We have nobody to blame but ourselves. If there is a crisis, it is also an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will touch on one other point. We talked about the spirit of working together and the commitment of the nation, particularly of those not involved in agriculture. The tourism business has been given a huge wake-up call here. This is an opportunity. The part of the speech that I waited for and which I was delighted to hear is that the St Patrick's Day festivities will be allowed to proceed around 18 to 20 May. As the Minister mentioned, I am chairman of the national St. Patrick's festival. We <Col N="447" /> will go ahead with all the planned events which we will announce next week.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister encourage the Government to regard this as the biggest St. Patrick's festival ever? It will celebrate getting over this problem. I know it is too early and we must wait until 19 April, but I hope on 20 April we will announce the best ever St. Patrick's festival taking place next month. It will contain all the elements we had planned before but will be seen as a celebration and an expression of gratitude to the people, particularly the non-agricultural sector which dedicated and committed itself with enthusiasm to getting over the problem. The opportunity is there and we should be sure to grasp it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me. Thanks probably have been sent already but I feel sure that other Members of the House would like to join me in sending our thanks to the staff of the Pirbright laboratory who have given us incredible service over the past few months. I express some interest here because the head of the laboratory is a constituent of mine. Dr. Donaldson is a veterinary graduate of Trinity College Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written to thank him personally but I feel the Seanad would like to let him know that we are very grateful. I heard mention at the beginning of this outbreak that we should have a viral reference laboratory for foot and mouth disease. That would be absolute madness. It is a very infectious virus and should we wait 50 years trying to hold on to it in a few vials before the next outbreak? The only other foot and mouth viral reference laboratory I know of is on an island off Denmark. We should also recognise that to have the facility of a laboratory of such high international repute is very important.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in this country none of the initial antibody tests which proved negative were later proved wrong with the growth of virus from tissue. That is very important. Once we had initial negative tests we were in a good position to know that the follow-up test when the virus was grown would also be negative. It is very fortunate that we have such a laboratory so near at hand to do work for us as well as the enormous amount of work it has to do in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to give us an update. I share the Minister's concern about the report from Cookstown, County Tyrone, this evening where there seems to be serious concern among veterinary and Ministry officials that this may be a positive case. We can only hope otherwise. The chilling aspect of this is <Col N="448" /> that it is a case affecting dairy cows. That would be a new departure in the spread of the disease. There is also a huge pig population in that part of Tyrone and we all know that if foot and mouth disease gets into the pig herd it is extremely serious. One can only feel trepidation at what is unfolding. We may know the result within an hour but can only hope that it will be a false alarm.</P>
      <P>The situation in the United Kingdom is very serious. Some of the outbreaks this week were in areas far from areas of existing outbreaks. It has jumped outside excluded areas and one can only presume the disease was transmitted by human contact. The precautions in place in the UK do not match those of this country. We do not wish to interfere in their affairs but we have a serious interest in this. We should say that we are not happy with the arrangements in terms of exclusion zones etc. It is clear that the mass epidemic they now have has to do with the fact that there is laxity in how they have sealed off areas where an outbreak has taken place. We can only appeal to them to redouble their efforts. The politics and the economics of agriculture in the UK are entirely different from those here. Britain will pay a terrible price for this outbreak because when it is all over it will cost billions to their food industry. They need to take that into account, despite the fact that primary agriculture accounts for very little of GDP output and very little of employment share in the UK.</P>
      <P>The last day I spoke I asked about the situation in regard to Athleague. The first major scare we had south of the Border after the outbreak in Meigh related to the taking of sheep from that farm to be slaughtered in Athleague. Those sheep were afterwards exported to France. It is clear that illegality surrounded that consignment of sheep. There has been intensive Garda activity surrounding the issue but everyone wants to know if anyone will be charged. Surely the Minister knows more than he is saying. I know he may be precluded from saying too much because of ongoing Garda investigations but there are things he ought to be saying about it. People need to be assured that the issue is being pursued by the Garda, that it has identified suspects and that it intends to press charges. It is important to assure the public and the farming community that the matter is being taken seriously by the authorities. The Minister should be less taciturn and say a little more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extensification payments etc. will soon be issued to farmers and some of these payments are subject to inspection. Each year a number of files are pulled by the Department and they are sent for compliance inspection. Obviously there have been no compliance inspections this year since the scare took place. In view of the financial pinch farmers are feeling, I ask the Minister to ensure there will not be a withholding of payments under the beef premium scheme, the suckler cow scheme, the extensification scheme, the <Col N="449" /> headage scheme and the various sheep schemes. There should be no delays in payments.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes mentioned that in the south of Ireland the aspect of dairy farming where calves have to be transported to the west for sale cannot happen because of the ban on the movement of all animals. That is having a serious effect on the fodder situation on these farms which in turn translates itself into a serious effect on the income on the farm. The majority of farmers here would not survive without income support. Nothing irritates or frustrates farmers more than a delay in income support payments. They see them as an entitlement and they have budgeted on their arrival on a certain date. It is necessary to have a compliance inspection, but then payment is delayed for many months. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there is no delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for updating us and keeping his word to me. When the legislation was debated last month I proposed an amendment which would have required tagging to be made compulsory by law. The Minister, on the basis of a guarantee given by him that this would be done, asked me to withdraw the amendment. I did so and it was taken on board. That was appreciated. It is important to acknowledge this because we work on the basis of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Department's important decision to ease the prohibition of movement and allow the activities mentioned by the Minister of State. From dealing with the Departments of Education, North and South, I am aware of the problems. I was glad when the TUI received permission from the Northern authorities to hold its conference in Belfast.</P>
      <P>I compliment the authorities on both sides of the Border, particularly on the southern side, on the arrangements in place. Many complain that there are inadequate checks on the Border. I have an office in Belfast to which I often go. Knowing that we would discuss the matter today, I took careful notes on my visit to Belfast yesterday. On the way there and back, there were four separate Garda checks, not just on the Border, but on the N52 on my way north and the N1 on my return. There were also two RUC checks on the A1, not on the Border, and my car was sprayed four times. It is important to realise that this is happening.</P>
      <P>Taking nothing away from our Northern colleagues, I also compliment the Department on the efficiency of the spray system on the southern side of the Border. This should be noted. Listeners ought to ring Marian Finucane's radio show to tell her in order to bring balance to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the impact on tourism in respect of which there should be advice about school tours. Many small businesses which advertise in our magazine have been devastated, losing one year's income, because agricultural related and outdoor tours have been prohibited for the last <Col N="450" /> month. I took a call from one operator whose arrangements had been cancelled and could hear his wife crying in the background. I would like such tours to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The three teacher unions are holding their annual conferences shortly. While it would be a great relief for a general secretary not to have to do so, we realise the impact they will have on the local tourism industry. Our conference next week is a recognition that the industry in Tralee can deal with it. We have received advice from the Department &ndash; I have spoken to the Minister directly &ndash; and advise members to take every precaution to ensure they do not cause any difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. That would be perfect. Hoteliers in Tralee were relieved when we informed them two weeks ago that it was our intention, unless advised otherwise, to go ahead with the conference.</P>
      <P>The work of groups such as AgriAware which interact with schools has been inhibited. In the next two weeks there would have been the usual annual urban-rural day activities which have now been cancelled. They are also a loss. The Department might consider easing restrictions in these areas where all those involved are security conscious and responsible. As some of these activities take place on farms, this might not be possible. Many farms and outdoor activities depend on school tours for business. We can see the difference in Leinster House where at this time of year the House is normally packed with pupils and people begin to see what it is like to be a teacher. None of these activities is taking place and there is a sense of loss at all levels.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on providing for tagging and thank the Department for the arrangements in place on the Border and the important decisions taken regarding access for British visitors. It has done a great job. I am as happy for it as the country that the disease is contained. I hope the news from County Tyrone will be good.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is good that the disease is contained. I hope this will continue to be the position. I agree with previous speakers that certain restrictions should be reviewed. The Minister of State spoke about AI services, a matter which affects County Clare where small to medium dairy herdowners rely on the service provided, unlike larger farmers in the Minister of State's constituency of Tipperary South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State might not be aware of how this service affects small to medium farmers. He stated that from 19 April AI services will be available, subject to a protocol. Will he give us the full details? This will <Col N="451" /> have an economic impact next year on milk production. This must be considered.</P>
      <P>While we appreciate the difficulties that arise in the movement of cattle, we must look at the practicalities. The entire population has taken the matter seriously and responded responsibly. Dairy farmers have calves on their farms which normally would be sold at this time of year. Despite the difficulties, something must be done about movement. The stipulation that a lorry can only enter and deliver animals from one farm to one other location must again be reviewed. It is working against medium and small farmers and the cost involved is serious.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity of complimenting the group on the work it has done. It has addressed matters in a very serious manner. I also compliment the public which has responded in a very responsible manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, among others, has lifted restrictions on visiting various parks and public facilities. I ask the Minister of State to examine the area of walking holidays. Many come to County Clare for walking holidays and use the green roads across the Burren. Many of those involved in the tourism business are experiencing a huge impact, with up to 70% cancellations for walking holidays. The Minister of State is familiar with Lisdoonvarna where a number of business people are feeling the impact. I am making representations directly to him at the behest of people from the area and ask him to raise the matter and address it with the review group. Even allowing people walk on public roads, rather than green roads, would relieve the situation. The apparent ban which currently applies across the board is a disincentive to those coming on holidays. If the Minister of State wishes to respond, perhaps he could do so at the conclusion of statements as his antics are distracting me.</P>

    <P>I would also like details on the protocol relating to AI operators and ask for some common sense in relation to dropped calves because people do not have fodder and there is huge congestion, which raises animal health issues.

      <P>As I explained to Senator Hayes, there is a protocol in place for AI. Provision has been made for those involved to attend courses and be given certification on how to take proper precautions. Worryingly, in recent weeks people have been operating illegally. They have not followed the proper protocol and we do not know the origin of the animal bloodline or how good it is, which will be a problem. This time next year, however, we will know from the dates of birth of animals who followed it. There will be traceability, a vital component. I look forward to the results.</P>
      <P>It is still necessary to be extremely cautious. When regulations were relaxed in England in 1967 the disease spread for a second time like wildfire. The farming community is getting very impatient when they are the ones who will receive the greatest benefit from the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government to introduce measures to facilitate the attendance of undergraduates from Northern Ireland at universities in the Republic; furthermore it strongly encourages a new initiative to negotiate reciprocal academic scholarships and student grants with the Government of the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland Executive to enable residents of all communities in both parts of Ireland to study at third level in each other's universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Universities Bill, which was introduced in this House some years ago, spelt out as one of its objectives that one of the fundamental objectives of universities in this country was to promote good relationships between both communities in Northern Ireland and the communities here. That <Col N="453" /> was an amendment which was proposed initially by me, accepted by the Minister of the day and supported by all sides of the House. Those objectives are now enshrined in law. It is with this in mind that I put down this motion tonight. It is not good enough just to have an aspiration. Nobody believes that aspirations expressed by politicians are meaningful unless they are transformed into concrete measures.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Government would accept this motion this evening without dilution and accept that concrete measures could be taken to facilitate an exchange between undergraduates here and in Northern Ireland, at the very least. One of the worst aspects of a university education in Ireland in the past two decades has been the reduction in numbers of students coming to the Republic from Northern Ireland. More than 25 years ago when I was at Dublin University &ndash; sorry, 30 years ago&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are sixth class sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a very backward student, unlike Senator O'Toole. When I left Dublin University 30 years ago, the numbers of undergraduates from Northern Ireland and from both communities ran into the teens in percentage terms. It was a very large number. That resulted in an exchange of views between people educated in the Republic and people educated in Northern Ireland, which was greatly to the benefit of both communities. Unfortunately, since then the numbers have declined dramatically, partly as a result of the troubles which broke out in 1969. The numbers now are, in the case of Dublin University, below 5%. Figures I received today from Dublin University indicate that only 107 people were admitted from Northern Ireland last year out of a total of 2,051 undergraduates. The year before saw 124 out of 2,129 undergraduates. This is less than 5% and is declining. The figures from UCD are even worse. Only 1.36% of the undergraduate numbers now come from Northern Ireland. That is pitiful by any standards. If the Government is serious about cross-community education, cross-Border education and a cross-Border exchange of views, it could respond to this motion, not with an amendment but by saying that it will facilitate and promote the exchange of undergraduates from both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>There are other difficulties which I must acknowledge. In recent years a habit has grown of undergraduates going from Northern Ireland to Scotland. That habit is becoming more and more entrenched and the pattern has, to some extent, supplanted the previous one of Northern Ireland undergraduates coming south, particularly to Dublin University. That is a shame. Edinburgh and other universities in Scotland have replaced Dublin University as the natural place of third level education for these undergraduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> There are other reasons. Universities in the United Kingdom, to which many students are directed, now make early offers of places. These must be accepted and, in many cases, money deposits given. Having accepted these offers it is often very difficult for students to renege on their acceptances, sacrifice deposits and come to southern universities, even if they have made application here.</P>
    <P>There is also the obvious difficulty of different examinations. It is harder to equate A levels with the leaving certificate than to equate one A level with another. It is more natural for people who have been educated in the United Kingdom system to go to universities which accept A levels as their natural entrance qualification than to deal with the Irish system of equation which some regard as unfair, variable and difficult to make a judgment on. These are the difficulties which are put in front of us and offered as reasons for this decline.</P>
    <P>There are also difficulties about the universities not promoting themselves sufficiently or effectively in Northern Ireland. It is doubtful if southern universities particularly want students from Northern Ireland or if they care about this matter or regard it as their role to promote cross-community and cross-Border education.</P>
    <P>Incentives from the Government are needed to push the universities to promote their great benefits to people across the Border who are thinking of coming here and financial incentives are needed for people who are thinking of coming to study in the Republic. I am talking about special arrangements for people from the North to study here. Preferential maintenance grants and scholarships should be given to people in all communities in Northern Ireland to come to all the universities down here. The Government must open negotiations with the British Government so it will give reciprocal grants to people from here to go to Northern Ireland. If people gain a financial benefit it will be easier for them financially to come here than to go to universities in their own localities. It would be worth it. Some things are worth giving Government subsidies for, particularly the greater good of the whole island and better community relations.</P>
    <P>Such measures would also help Northern Ireland universities. The number of people from outside who go to universities in Northern Ireland is pitifully small. It is regarded by many as a very localised and inward looking province. We will become inward looking if we do not encourage people from Northern Ireland and overseas to come here.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has proposed an amendment to a non-contentious motion for which I would have expected all-party agreement and which was deliberately phrased to make it almost impossible to oppose. I am disappointed it took so long &ndash; until 3.30 this afternoon &ndash; for the amendment to reach the Independent Senators. It is unusual to receive an amendment so late in the day. I presume some bright manda<Col N="455" /> rin in the Department suddenly saw some hidden danger in this motion and decided that an amendment must be put down to dilute it.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has used this opportunity to congratulate itself and to take credit for what has been happening under an EU umbrella. In anticipating what the Minister may say, I hope he does not refer to grant entitlements already due to residents of Northern Ireland. These grants are due to anyone in the European Union and are not a special entitlement. They are mostly gained by virtue of residency over a period of five years or more.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not take the time or trouble to propose specific measures which could be taken. In this Chamber we have a model which has served us well. I congratulate successive Governments on taking significant initiatives in 1981, 1982, 1983 and subsequent years. One of the most enlightening injections to this House was the introduction of Members from Northern Ireland who were appointed by the Taoiseach. Senator Manning and I have served with all of them. People like Seamus Mallon and Gordon Wilson may have provided something of a culture shock to all of us when they arrived, but they educated us and taught us more about the point of view of the opposition than we could ever have taught ourselves. We had some excellent debates about the North in which people spoke with authority on issues.</P>
    <P>In the past in Dublin University &ndash; the only one I feel qualified to talk about &ndash; there were amazing and very emotional exchanges of view between undergraduates in debating chambers and inside and outside various societies where people of both communities were introduced to each other. Unfortunately that has virtually gone. I would like the Minister to play a small part in promoting its return by asking the universities to consider quotas of students from Northern Ireland on a reciprocal basis by giving financial incentives to those who wish to come here and by getting reciprocal arrangements from the Government of the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ross for asking me to second this motion. I have rarely felt so comfortable in supporting a motion tabled by Senator Ross as I do on this occasion. I am saddened by the Government amendment. It is unnecessary and I appeal to the Minister not to pursue it. I am sure Senator Ross would accept the Government amendment as an addendum to the main motion. It will portray a very poor image of the House if a motion which merely asks that something be facilitated and strongly encouraged is opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent yesterday meeting, among others, the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and the Minister for Education. When I talked to them about taking a common approach to third level education I found them completely open to the <Col N="456" /> idea. On coming down here the following day I found a completely different approach. This is not good enough. The Minister needs to take this by the scruff of the neck. I appeal to him to find a way to make this work.</P>
    <P>There should be a common application scheme for third level colleges on this island. This has been requested before. The INTO put the question to the previous Minister and possibly to this one also. It has not happened. Is it beyond our capabilities to produce an application form which would be compatible with the needs of UCAS and the CAO in order to cover the whole island? I believe this is crucial.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment sends out an unacceptably negative signal, one which does not reflect the views of people on any part of the island. It also contravenes Government policy as articulated by its spokesmen over a period of time and is at odds with the joint initiatives which the Minister has undertaken with Minister McGuinness. The Minister should look at this issue again.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issues raised by Senator Ross in proposing it, this is a good idea because it could lead to a greater degree of mutual recognition of qualifications on a European level for those people with professional qualifications on both parts of the island. That is something that has not yet been achieved. I can give examples in relation to teaching and the Minister is no doubt tired of hearing them. The President of the INTO, speaking in Belfast this week, said that it should not be necessary for every teacher in the Republic to be qualified in the Irish language in order to ensure that every pupil has access to Irish, the option of being taught through Irish, and that those requiring an all-Irish education could avail of it. We have to be open.</P>
    <P>The President of the INTO can say we should be able to recognise that people from the northern half of the island who would wish to complete all their education through English should be accommodated. If that is not the case then I believe we are not reflecting the true spirit of a republic. At the moment there is a shortage of teachers in the Republic and a corresponding over-supply in the North. This problem could easily be resolved if we had a greater respect and a mutual recognition of each other's qualifications.</P>
    <P>This motion as proposed could lead to significant academic achievement, as it would allow colleges to gain a reputation by specialising in certain areas. In my last conversation with the Minister the issue of the shortage of educational psychologists was addressed. It is not a reflection on colleges of education in the Republic to say that Queen's is the most professionally advanced in the field of educational psychology. This is an area they have developed and brought forward and we should recognise it. There are also economies of scale that can be achieved by allowing resources to be put into certain colleges for certain courses for certain qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> This is a crucially important motion in terms of the real issues on this island, in terms of parity of esteem, in terms of the recognition and accommodation and openness to difference, in terms of a welcome to people from different backgrounds and communities. I appeal to the Minister to look closely at what is being said in terms of what can be done. It would be cynical if not hypocritical not to accept this motion while the Minister and Minister McGuinness are trying to get the National Council for Curriculum Assessment (NCCA) in the Republic to work with the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in the North. How can we move with large structures if we are not prepared to allow movement for people on the ground?</P>
    <P>In terms of what we are doing here, there are questions of compatibility, synthesis of content and a mutually agreed curricular approach. I raised the question at a North-South meeting some 18 months ago as to who would have the courage to produce a history course encompassing both the sash and the shamrock. It is possible to address these issues.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this motion which contravenes either the policy of the Minister or the amendment before us. Why can we not simply put &ldquo;and&rdquo; between them both and show a common approach to an issue on which I hope we are all of a united mind? Let us be able to say that this is where we stand, and move things forward on that basis.</P>
    <P>Let us say that we really believe in parity of esteem and prove that we are open to people from a different background. Let us show that we are open to making the necessary movement to accommodate those people who have a slightly different approach. Let us also be realistic in terms of the mutual recognition of qualifications and the significant academic gain that can be made, and the economies of scale.</P>
    <P>I hate quoting people of some hundred or more years ago, but if we read Newman's<i> The Idea of a University,</i> its essence is the interaction between people of different backgrounds, the debate and the cultural attachment made between people. This occurs most easily in an environment where there are slight differences of approach, slight tensions and people coming at the same problem from different perspectives and bringing new, creative abilities to bear on it, as well as by people learning from each other.</P>
    <P>Anything which allows people from different cultural, political and traditional backgrounds to learn with and about each other, can only be in the best interests of the future of the country. It will help to create a generation which is more tolerant, open, progressive and understanding. The Ministers' Northern counterparts have just produced a major document on tolerance in education.</P>
    <P>I know him well enough to know that this is also the view of the Minister who has proven himself time and again to be open on and supportive of these issues. I urge that this amendment be <Col N="458" /> changed to an addendum, allowing us to move forward. I have great pleasure in seconding Senator Ross's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add &ldquo;and commends the Government on the measures, including student supports and reciprocal academic scholarships, which facilitate mobility between third level students in Ireland, North and South, and between Ireland and Britain; and welcomes the NDP provisions for support of co-operative actions in research between third-level institutions on this island&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It took me about two minutes to understand how I would put an addendum to this. I understand and agree with the viewpoints of Senators Ross and O' Toole. The above wording adds up to the full sum of what they are saying. Now I can talk at ease, because earlier I was very much in sympathy with Senator Ross in relation to the points made. The motion urges the Government to facilitate the attendance of undergraduates from the Northern Ireland at universities in the Republic. That has to be taken as a statement in itself.</P>
      <P>Wearing my other hat, I am a career guidance counsellor by profession, I am a member of the local authority and I was a member of County Dublin VEC for nine years, yet I had a difficulty in understanding what support systems existed for students in Ireland or for those who moved from the North to the South or the South to the North. The word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; is good and is one we should latch on to in regard to what is available and what could be available under North-South co-operation. The Government has brought forward measures for student support, particularly in regard to the second part of the motion which encourages a new initiative to negotiate reciprocal academic scholarships and student grants. I did some research on that. Student support grants are available at undergraduate level but I ask the Minister to make that fact more widely known to those who are trying to administer them. Maintenance grants will have to be reviewed and the Government is looking at how best it can bring forward initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>On the question of reciprocal arrangements for North-South scholarship co-operatives, I understand the purpose of the Irish Post-graduate Research Bureau is to enhance scholarship schemes. I understand the Irish Research Council, serviced by the Higher Education Authority, is a new mission for cross-Border initiatives and co-operation. The Minister has announced that a new science research council is coming on board and that it will be presided over by the Provost of Trinity College. These are initiatives that will encourage North-South co-operation, be it the flow of students from the North to the South or the South to the North. The Government is doing its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> Under the National Development Plant the Government has provided £12 million over a six year period for North-South collaboration in research. That is a new initiative but it may not be known in the wider arena. Perhaps our colleges are not implementing the ideas put forward by the Government. I suggest the presidents of all universities, North and South, should sit around the table and discuss how best to use the money the Government has allocated. Will the universities in the North and elsewhere allocate funds to enhance North-South, cross-Border, across-the-Irish-Sea thinking? There will have to be a consensus approach. The universities may be sitting back. They are intellectual academics who presume everybody understands what is happening in the background when that is not the case. Neither do guidance counsellors know what money is available to undergraduates and post-graduate students and how it should be tapped.</P>
    <P>The North-South agreements and the new Northern Assembly of Education should enhance consultation and co-operation. I agree with Senator Ross that we must facilitate all that action and further consultation and co-operation. The Government should be commended on providing the money. I suggest the presidents of the universities sit around the table and decide how best that £12 million can be spent in the enhancement and promotion of mobility of students, be it from the North to the South or the South to the North, or even across the Irish Sea. As a member of the European Union we have to respect the regulations. As this is a European regulation we should all come together for the purpose of enhancing the education of our young people in the European Union and particularly North-South co-operation. The motion in the name of Senator Ross with the Government's addendum is the way forward and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to disagree with anything Senator Ross has said or that the Minister will say in his contribution. It is only common sense that, given our history, on a small island we should encourage the greatest degree of co-operation. There is a great deal of co-operation at third level, co-operation between the presidents of universities and between individual departments and disciplines. The number of inter-disciplinary institutes, bodies and associations set up in recent years is impressive. The amount of travelling between universities is also impressive and there is a degree of pooling of resources which did not exist in the past. All that is good and is basic common sense. It probably always existed at a lesser level and will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much point in the Minister's amendment which will become an addendum. Why Ministers like to commend themselves like small children wanting to be commended for doing something good escapes me. We will let it <Col N="460" /> proceed since it is seconded by Senator Ross. However, a number of points have to be made.</P>
    <P>There is a great danger of making education a political tool and making it serve the purpose of peace and greater understanding. That is not what education should be about. Education has values and rights in its own regard and it is these that should have priority. If I was asked today what should be the priority in our third level education system I would go back to the 1916 Proclamation which says that all the children of the nation should be treated equally. Today access from deprived areas in the Republic is a much bigger problem than providing places for people from Northern Ireland. It should have a much greater priority. Universities and the Department should put greater resources into sustaining the types of programmes which will not only encourage people into but help them to remain for the full duration of the course. The second priority in our third level system must be the achievement of excellence in post-graduate research. If we cannot achieve standards of excellence our universities will not have the sort of recognition worldwide that they need. They will not be able to provide the types of supports and research for industry which will keep the economy going. That also has to be one of the great priorities.</P>
    <P>Our third level system has to be flexible so that it can adapt to the changing conditions in society. It has to promote excellence not only in the sciences but in the arts and the humanities and it must be able to attract some of the best students from overseas at post-graduate level because many Irish students in the current prosperity find it more attractive to take a job immediately after doing their primary or master's degree rather than go into post-graduate work. All these are more important than encouraging cross-Border co-operation. They are much more important in the long-term sustainability of our education system.</P>
    <P>This is a time of year when I am asked daily by my students for advice on where to go for post-graduate work. I rarely advise them to go to Northern Ireland. I advise them to go to the places where they will get the best possible training in their disciplines, occasionally it is Northern Ireland, but I would put their future ahead of making any political statement through cross-Border co-operation, good as that may be in its own way. If the conditions in Northern Ireland are right and if they can attract our students, we should encourage them to go there but we should not make pawns out of them by sending them to courses for which they may not be suitable.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke eloquently about the great benefits in the past of having large numbers of Northern students down here, but he is wrong. Most of the Northern students who came down in my time and later in his time, if Catholic, went to UCD where they were very much part of the Nationalist tradition. They learned little which would have made it easier for them to break down barriers when they returned to Northern <Col N="461" /> Ireland. When they came to Trinity College, they came to what was still an Anglo enclave in the middle of Dublin where they met few Catholics or Nationalists and where many of their own feelings were, probably, reinforced. Let us not romanticise the past.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to students from Northern Ireland? In the case of UCD, for which I can speak, a total of 1,000 students from Northern Ireland applied through the CAO for places. One quarter of that number were made offers, but only 50 took up places. The reasons they did not take up places were, we believe, the cost of living in Dublin and the cost of accommodation, costs that face all out of town students. It might be possible to subsidise students from Northern Ireland, but will we thereby discriminate against students from Cork, Kerry and so forth who also wish to come to Dublin? I do not know the answer. The main reason for the small take-up of places is the cost of living and accommodation in Dublin. It is not ideological.</P>
    <P>In UCD there is a tradition of holding a certain number of places in the faculties of medicine and veterinary medicine for students from Northern Ireland. These are areas which, probably, could be examined. With regard to the school liaison programme in UCD, for which I can only speak, the number of visits it makes to schools in Northern Ireland is almost equal to the number of visits it makes to schools in the Republic. The university is doing its bit to reach out and to, at least, make the courses known to students. In the coming year students from Northern Ireland will be eligible for entrance scholarships. Such scholarships were only awarded on leaving certificate results. These are just some of the developments taking place.</P>
    <P>Everything Senator Ross said was unexceptional which, for him, is a record. Normally he manages to insult a few people and make a few controversial statements in the course of even a brief contribution, but everything he said tonight was apple pie and motherhood, as it were. They were aspirations to which all Members would aspire. It is important, however, to keep the issue in perspective. Education should not be used as a tool in a peace process, however worthy that is. Students should not become part of an experiment. The first priority should be the interests of the students and providing them with the best education possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the sentiments of the motion and will do anything I can to promote co-operation between North and South in this area. I appreciate that more could, probably, be done in terms of making the opportunities, possibilities and supports known. More could also be done to find out the reasons people are shying away from taking up places in the South. Senator Manning thinks it is the cost&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Col N="462" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a factor, but we should know more about the reasons. I welcome the opportunity afforded by the motion to speak about the Government's efforts to promote co-operation in higher education with Northern Ireland and Britain. Co-operation in the field of education between both parts of the island and with Britain has been greatly facilitated by the establishment of the new institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that under strand two of the Agreement education was one of the six areas identified and agreed for co-operation through the mechanism of existing bodies in each jurisdiction. To date, two meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in education sectoral format have been held and a number of joint working groups established in relation to the following areas prioritised for action: education for children with special needs, educational underachievement, teacher qualifications and school, youth and teacher exchanges.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to prevailing political circumstances, it has not proved possible to hold a meeting of the education sector North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, since last July. Work on this and a range of other areas, however, has been ongoing between officials from both jurisdictions in the interim and I hope circumstances will allow for the resumption of formal NSMC meetings at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The NSMC, meeting in plenary format last September, agreed to commission a study of obstacles to mobility between the two parts of the island. This study will examine the obstacles in both the public and private sectors in a wide range of areas, including education and the recognition of qualifications. The study is being taken forward by a steering group of officials from both North and South which will report to the council. My Department will contribute to the examination of obstacles which is being conducted by consultants commissioned for the purposes of the study.</P>
      <P>Although there is no formal provision in the institutional framework established under the Good Friday Agreement for a North-South Ministerial Council on higher and further education, I have met informally with the Minister, Dr. Farren, on a number of occasions. In addition, my officials have had ongoing meetings with their counterparts in the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment with a view to enhancing co-operation in a number of areas in our common interests. These areas have included the development of relationships between the Higher Education Authority and the Northern Ireland Higher Education Council and the role of the Conference of Rectors of Irish Universities, CRI, in promoting co-operation between the nine universities on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CRI was formed by the heads of these nine institutions in 1992 to encourage and facilitate greater North-South university collaboration. In the intervening period the CRI has worked with <Col N="463" /> officials of my Department and others with a view to substantially increasing the level of co-operation within the university sector on the island. The CRI launched a directory of such collaboration in June last year. The publication demonstrates the contribution being made by the universities to increased North-South co-operation and understanding in areas as diverse as music and biochemistry.</P>
    <P>Other areas for discussion have included research and development, enhancing links with enterprise and adult basic education. Potential areas for future discussion of collaborative initiatives might include mutual recognition of qualifications and addressing skills needs on an all-Ireland basis. The latter could involve the assessment of supply and demand for the entire island. A case could be made for consideration to be given to adopting a joint approach to high cost specialised provision.</P>
    <P>Improved networking between researchers at university level has been facilitated by the work undertaken by the CRI and will be further facilitated by the availability of funding for collaborative activities under the national development plan. In addition, support is being made available under the NDP to enhance information networks between institutions, North and South. This will involve upgrading the link between the HEA-net and the North's JANET. It will significantly reduce response times and facilitate real time research and collaborative activities.</P>
    <P>Uniquely, Ireland's National Development Plan and its Northern equivalent share a common chapter which has been approved in both jurisdictions. It provides an agreed context within which a number of co-operation measures may be progressed. The common chapter of the NDP acknowledges the considerable co-operation across all aspects of the education sector, North and South, including higher and further education. It recognises that the valuable linkages which have been developed provide the basis to establish more closely integrated, coherent approaches in the future with clearer policy objectives and outcomes.</P>
    <P>The common chapter identifies the type of activities which will be promoted, including interactive approaches at university and further education level in areas such as research and development, support for small and medium enterprises and the development of lifelong learning, adult guidance and counselling programmes. In this context, funding for North-South collaborative research activities is set aside under the strategic research sub-measure &ndash; one of four education sub-measures &ndash; in the productive sector operational programme of the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The total funding allocated to North-South activities over the duration of the plan is £12 million or 15.2 million, of which £9 million is recurrent and the balance is capital. The strategic research sub-measure is co-financed by the European Regional <Col N="464" /> Development Fund, with £1.8 million allocated towards the North-South strand.</P>
    <P>The aim of the North-South sub-measure is to facilitate and encourage cross-Border co-operation and research between third level institutions. Discussions are ongoing with Northern officials with a view to developing a strategic approach to effecting this provision. I expect to be in a position shortly to announce details of a scheme to promote developments in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also a significant international dimension to the programme for research in third level institutions &ndash; PRTLI. As part of cycle 3, announced in December 2000, funding will be made available for the development of strategic co-operation with leading world institutions. Support will also be made available to enable the attraction of leading international researchers and research teams.</P>
    <P>Regarding the technological sector, there have been a number of formal meetings between the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology and the Association of Northern Ireland Colleges &ndash; ANIC &ndash; over the past two years. These meetings focused on a range of issues of mutual interest and led to the signing of a protocol on 20 September 2000. The joint protocol has many valuable and important elements. In the context of this protocol, both organisations have agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, to share staff and expertise on quality assurance panels, interview panels, external examiners and substitute teachers where appropriate; investigate in joint co-operation and with other national agencies joint purchasing arrangements; share information on good practices north and south of the Border; jointly seek funding for the development of a cross-Border project on national recognition of awards in further and higher education; share expertise, in particular in vocational areas of mutual benefit; plan together skills forecasts so that the labour force of the island of Ireland has the best possible training; and share contracts and networks to the mutual benefit of both organisations.</P>
    <P>Regular contact is maintained between the council of directors and ANIC through their respective offices and I strongly welcome the initiative of ANIC and the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology in agreeing this protocol. I have no doubt that the outcome will be of mutual benefit to the institutions, their staff and students, North and South. In this context, my Department has approved a proposal from the council of directors to proceed with a pilot project in open and distance learning. This project will include the development of an e-business module and the council will be inviting ANIC to become involved in this element of the pilot programme.</P>
    <P>In another example of positive action, my Department has given approval to the Sligo Institute of Technology to commence a pilot project in conjunction with Fermanagh Institute of Further Education, Enniskillen, in the area of apprenticeship provision. The intention is to provide phase 4 training in carpentry and joinery. <Col N="465" /> The pilot project will commence in 2001 and will run for a three-year period. Depending on the success of the project, consideration will be given to providing further apprenticeship training blocks in other skill areas.</P>
    <P>Many of the institutes of technology, including Athlone, Cork, Dundalk, Letterkenny and Dublin, are involved in a number of cross-Border projects with local enterprise and training agencies and with several third level educational institutions in the North such as Magee College, University of Ulster and Queens University, Belfast. A number of these institutions have accessed funding under the EU INTERREG and peace programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department is seeking to maximise support for education initiatives under the new EU Peace II Programme, the successor to the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Under the cross-Border priority of the Peace II Programme, measure 4 provides 10 million over four years, both North and South, for co-operation in the areas of higher and further education and training. Meetings between officials of my Department and the relevant Departments in the North are ongoing, with a view to identifying, in consultation with the Special EU Programmes Body and other agencies, appropriate priorities under this measure and drawing up programme complements. It is envisaged that priority areas in higher and further education should include research and development in higher education, to include e-learning, basic skills, including literacy and numeracy, enterprise education developing entrepreneurial and creative skills and retention in education, particularly of young males.</P>
    <P>Institutional co-operation in higher education, both on a North-South basis and between Ireland and Britain, is also encouraged through other EU education programmes such as ERASMUS. I understand that for the year 1999-2000, 64 students went to the UK from Ireland, while 75 UK students came to Ireland under the programme in the same period.</P>
    <P>As part of a general effort to promote co-operation between Ireland and Britain, a limited number of research scholarships are made available to Irish post-graduate students for study in the United Kingdom and for UK post-graduates to study in Ireland under the Ireland-Britain exchange scholarship scheme. The scheme is publicised in Britain by the Irish Embassy in London and in Ireland by the British council. For the academic year 2000-01 there are four British students studying under this scholarship scheme valued at £6,950 per annum, while 11 Irish students are studying in Britain where the value of the scheme is approximately £7,000 sterling.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences offers post-graduate research scholarships and post-doctoral awards in the areas of humanities, social sciences, law and business studies. These scholarships are open to applicants from EU member states, while the post-doctoral awards are open to applicants <Col N="466" /> of all nationalities. The mission of the council includes the encouragement of excellence and the promotion of cross-Border co-operation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The flows of students between institutions in Ireland, North and South, over the five year period from 1993-94 to 1998-99 provide an interesting point of comparison. A total of 1,117 full-time students from the North were studying in the South in 1993-94, while 2,624 full-time students from the South were studying in the North in the same year. In comparison, 1,006 full-time students from the North came to study in the South in 1998-99, while 3,246 full-time students from the South were studying in the North in that period. Therefore, while there has been little difference over that five year period in the number of pupils coming to study here from the North, the number of Southern students going North to pursue their studies grew by 622, or almost 24%.</P>
    <P>The flow of students between both jurisdictions on this island and between Ireland and Britain is facilitated by the free fees initiative and the third level student support schemes administered under the aegis of my Department by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. The third level student support schemes offer financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. Students from this State who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses at higher national diploma level or higher which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of our schemes. Maintenance grants are also made available to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states, including Britain. In general, the approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of tuition fees in Northern Ireland, England and Wales all EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fees subject to the same conditions as apply to students who have been resident in Northern Ireland and Britain. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees. The maximum tuition fee payable in the 2000-01 academic year is £1,050 sterling. Students pursuing approved post-graduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for assistance under the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees scholarship scheme in respect of maintenance grants and also grants in respect of the cost of their tuition fees, subject to a maximum fee limit, which is currently IR£3,064.</P>
    <P>Tax relief has been available for tuition fees paid for full-time qualifying undergraduate courses in publicly funded universities or similar third level colleges in any EU member state, including Northern Ireland, since 1999-2000. The <Col N="467" /> Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students.</P>
    <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in a member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to a third level course. This condition applies to all EU nationals in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. EU nationals who are ineligible under the free fees initiative can apply for a means tested fees-only grant in respect of approved courses in third level institutions in this State subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance access fund. This fund is administered by third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000. The fund is allocated annually among approved colleges and institutes and all students registered with the approved colleges may apply for assistance from this fund, irrespective of nationality.</P>
    <P>Under the special fund for students with disabilities, allocations are given towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for such students who attend courses in third level institutions or post-leaving certificate courses. The scheme applies to students who have serious sensory, physical or communicative disabilities. Grants are provided to students for the purchase of special equipment, special materials, technological aids, targeted transport services, sign language assistance such as interpreters and personal assistants.</P>
    <P>In 2000 I approved an allocation of £1,233,000 for the fund, a significant increase of £700,000 on the allocation for 1999. In the current academic year 512 students are being assisted from the fund and an allocation of over £84,000 has been made from the overall funding to students from here who are currently registered on courses in Britain and Northern Ireland. Students from Northern Ireland, who are registered in a third level institution or a post-leaving certificate course here, are eligible to apply for and receive aid from this fund.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that this summary of provision for students from here who are studying in Northern Ireland and Britain, and for students from Northern Ireland and Britain who come here to study, represents a generous package of <Col N="468" /> measures to facilitate students to attend the third level institution of their choice here, in Northern Ireland or in Britain. I have set out the broad range of activities currently taking place to promote co-operation in this sector. I favour the maximising of co-operation in education on this island and with Britain, with a view to ensuring the highest quality of provision and the broadest range of opportunity. I am anxious to promote the mobility of pupils, students, academic staff and researchers on the island. I am confident the steps taken to date will provide a solid foundation for achieving these objectives. I will continue to explore the possibilities for further extending co-operation in the third level and wider education sectors in the context of available resources.</P>
    <P>Some of the points Senators have made are relevant, for example, we will have to look closely at how courses are advertised to ensure what is available is fully understood. Universities are very keen in that regard as they seek to attract students from Northern Ireland and further abroad. They pursue candidates widely, as do universities in the United Kingdom who particularly target undergraduate students. There is a big scramble to get good research graduates for post-doctoral work which I agree must be encouraged on a North-South basis. This debate will serve as a reminder to me to do more in that area.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ross for initiating this interesting debate. It is appropriate that we debate this matter in the Seanad, where Senator Quinn initiated an amendment to the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill making scholarships available to American students in universities on both parts of the island. We all know what a success that has been. The Minister, Deputy Woods, has given us extremely interesting figures on students crossing the Border for full-time education. There have probably never been more students going north of the Border and I will return to the numbers involved, which are amazing.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the extremely good co-operation at post-graduate level which has existed for some time. I wonder if post-graduate study is more worthy of our concentration than undergraduate study. Any problems I have encountered as regards post-graduate co-operation have originated from the northern side of the Border because grants could only be given within the United Kingdom. Co-operation in Northern Ireland had to take place with Great Britain and was not possible with the Republic of Ireland. To my relief and that of the Minister, I am sure, we managed to change that so that co-operation between departments became possible on a North-South basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very important nutrition survey in the Minister's discipline has just been completed by University College Cork, Trinity College Dublin and the University of Ulster. It showed the importance of research on an all-Ireland basis. An enormous amount of such co-operation is taking <Col N="469" /> place, for example, into micro-electronics in UCC and the University of Ulster, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross rightly pointed out that a small proportion of students here are from Northern Ireland, less than 5% in the case of Trinity College. For almost 150 years, until about 30 years ago, Trinity College was associated with Magee College in Derry. People could spend two years studying in Magee College and then come to Trinity to graduate with a Trinity degree. While the numbers now coming to Trinity are very low, this is because very few people from the North come to study science, the arts or sociology. We need to look carefully at the situation in professional schools all over the island. Senator Manning spoke of setting a quota from the North for some professional schools, which I would be anxious about. At least 30% of the intake to the school of law in Trinity College in the past five years, including courses in law and French, law and German and legal science, has been from Northern Ireland,.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into a discussion about the merits or otherwise of A levels as opposed to the leaving certificate. My anxiety about keeping a certain number of places for people from Northern Ireland is that it is much more difficult to get six A1s, or three A1s and three A2s, in the leaving certificate than to get high marks in three A levels. This seriously affects our students' ability to compete for places in professional schools. I do not suggest that we need to put a quota on Northern students to keep them out, but we need to look at the matter very carefully.</P>
    <P>Law has been the most seriously affected faculty and I have received complaints about that for many years, but medicine has been affected too. Between 15% and 20% of places on medicine courses in Trinity College are being taken by students from Northern Ireland. The figure may be smaller in other schools of medicine but not by much, certainly it is still almost 15%. There is huge competition to get into these schools. High A level results are easier to acquire than three very difficult A1s and A2s in higher level papers in the leaving certificate. Other courses like pharmacy, veterinary medicine and dairy science in UCC are heavily subscribed by students from the North.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is greater justification for this here because, after all, these are all-island schools, but I would like to be made aware of the success level of students from the Republic of Ireland applying, for instance, to the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge for courses in veterinary medicine before I would be inclined to say that those coming here from Northern Ireland should receive preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for those applying to professional schools in the United Kingdom, which includes Northern Ireland, who must compete with leaving certificate results which are made available two to three weeks later than A level results. These students, therefore, <Col N="470" /> are at a disadvantage in that all the available places may have been taken.</P>
    <P>The University of Ulster is, probably, the recipient of most students from the South who study outside the State. I was extremely pleased to be given an honorary doctorate in science by it some years ago and at the conferring ceremony I was fascinated by the number present from County Donegal. I wonder how many of the 2,000 students concerned are commuting to Derry. It would not involve travelling a great distance which we envisage when people must come to Dublin for undergraduate education. For students in County Donegal, it is quite natural to travel to Derry. I would be interested in seeing a breakdown of the figures. An illustrious Member of the Oireachtas, Deputy Cecilia Keaveney, is a graduate of the university. Whereas many from Northern Ireland always travelled to Dublin for music education, it is interesting that there is now a flow of students for such education to the University of Ulster. This cross-fertilisation cannot but be good.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about people with disabilities who perhaps are being catered for better in Northern Ireland. Do we have any idea of the number of people with disabilities, especially from peripheral areas around the Border, who study in Northern Ireland? It is important to take geography into account in this exercise and remember what is practical.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senators say that the universities have been doing their bit. Trinity College Dublin has had a schools liaison officer, Mr. David O'Neill, for at least ten years whom I am aware has visited schools in the North for, at least, that many years. The university has, therefore, been trying to encourage people to study here.</P>
    <P>In the motion Senator Ross refers to scholarships and maintenance grants. The latter may be even more important. I would prefer to use the word &ldquo;bursaries&rdquo; or &ldquo;sizarships&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; because we should not have people coming here on an academic basis only. If there are people who want to come here to study in areas of special interest, it is most important that they are facilitated. While I support all the ideas about undergraduate education, it is the blossoming at postgraduate level which we all should celebrate. It has been splendid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Ross showed me the text of the motion my mind immediately jumped to what happened with the George Mitchell scholarship a couple of years ago. The House may recall that the scholarship was presented to honour Senator George Mitchell. The concept was that the students, usually from America, would study in Ireland. Although the Bill had passed through the Dáil, we discovered that it would be limited to study in the State. Fortunately, we discovered this in this House and the then Minister, Deputy Martin, responded to the recognition that this would be out of kilter with the intention, that <Col N="471" /> somebody might, possibly, come from the United States to engage in peace studies in Ireland only to be told that the scholarship did not cover study in the Six Counties. First we were told that it could not be done because the Attorney General or somebody else had said that there would be a problem, but the then Minister, Deputy Martin, returned the following day and said that they had found a way around the problem. I was particularly pleased last month, when the first students took up the George Mitchell scholarship, that several of them had decided to pursue their studies in Northern Ireland rather than in the Republic. This is a reminder of what can go wrong with our thinking. Nobody said that we should exclude Northern Ireland. What happened was that it did not cross anybody's mind to include it. It needed a change of mindset.</P>
      <P>That is the reason I welcome the motion which, in effect, is an effort to try to remind us that we can do something differently. It seems that common sense dictates that students living on the island should be able to attend any university, North or South. For some reason, however, administrative barriers intervene and stop this happening. The main administrative barrier is in our minds because when we put together plans for scholarships or grants it seems that we do not think matters through. This does not mean that there is no cross-Border liaison because there are students who cross the Border to study. It happens more, however, under the EU framework than under the relationships between North and South. We must find a way of reminding ourselves that this should happen and must be encouraged if we are to achieve reconciliation on the island.</P>
      <P>In this context, I thought of a country I visited a couple of years ago, Cyprus, which is much smaller than Ireland. In 1974, Cyprus was partitioned. The barbed wire meant that there was no contact, even by post or telephone, between those who lived on the Turkish side and those who lived on Greek Cypriot side of the island. In the intervening 27 years, students growing up on Cyprus have been unable to study, meet, communicate or talk to students from the other side. In contrast, one must look at the opportunities available on this island where people from both sides have had the opportunity to cross the Border. We do not avail of the opportunity to cross the Border as often as we should and, certainly, do not avail of the opportunities to study. To study reconciliation properly one must live in that part of the world. If we do not provide students with an opportunity to study there, we will create a huge barrier to our ability to achieve the reconciliation which we are seeking to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the point I made about the George Mitchell scholarship, the thinking of which I was critical was not deliberate. Nobody said, &ldquo;Let us bar students from going north&rdquo;. Our Administration did not even think of it. At the time I accused us of partitionist thinking, <Col N="472" /> although the thinking behind the scholarship was the very opposite. Those who do not believe in partition are the very ones who do not think of the North as part of this country. We must change this mindset. I welcome the motion from that point of view because it brings to mind what can be done. I also welcome the words used by Senator Ross in the motion because he throws out some suggestions and ideas and recommends actions which we can take. It deserves our support.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Senators Henry, Quinn and Manning and all those who surround me with honorary doctorates from various universities &ndash; I do not think the Minister's is an honorary doctorate &ndash; for their participation in the debate which has been constructive in that we have reached a degree of agreement about the need for the aspiration which we have all expressed. Perhaps it is disappointing in terms of material proposals because the Minister has not come up with a commitment on reciprocal agreements between North and South or reciprocal grants.</P>
      <P>As the only opposition to the proposals I put came from Senator Manning, and it was calm, reasoned and logical&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I take this opportunity to respond to one or two of the points he made. I do not argue to any extent with the point he made about the need to give educational opportunities to the poor. It is a point at the forefront in UCD and Trinity College Dublin and has been well publicised recently. I would hate it to be misinterpreted that there is competition in terms of giving places to people from Northern Ireland or priority being given to people there over the need to give places of this sort to people from poor backgrounds or people who cannot afford it. That is far from the truth. I do not wish to yield to anybody on that point. I accept the absolute crying need to give people from all backgrounds in the Republic as well as Northern Ireland equal access to university. This is not a competition between one and the other. This debate is simply about one of them.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning's point about the applicants to UCD was well made. The figure I gave that only 1.36% of the entrants to UCD now come from Northern Ireland was given to me by UCD today and is true. I accept the figures the Senator gave that of the approximately 250 students offered places, only about 56 accepted. The Senator went on to say that the reason for that, which is interesting, and I am sure he is right, was probably the cost of coming to live in Dublin. If that is correct, he is making a strong argument for the motion I tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking unapologetically about subsidising these people. I make no bones about that. I say, &ldquo;Give them the money to come here&rdquo;. If it is too <Col N="473" /> expensive for them to live in Dublin, we should give them maintenance grants. We should remove the obstacles. We should say to them that while it is more expensive to come to live in Dublin, we will make it easier by removing that obstacle.</P>
    <P>There are other obstacles which we, the Government and the universities can help to remove, which I suspect are the ones I pointed out, exams, the time difference involved and that people have to accept other offers. There are other reasons also, but I do not accept the criticism Senator Manning made. I apologise profusely for not insulting anybody today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the sense of piety during Holy Week. It is important we unite on issues of this sort. Some issues are too important to make political points of. I did not insult anybody today because we were to a large extent speaking in a sense of unity. There was apple pie, but there is no greater apple pie than coming out and saying &ldquo;I stand for the poor&rdquo;. That is the greatest apple pie in the world. We all stand for the poor. The Senator stood for the poor today, but he should not get up and say &ldquo;I stand for the poor&rdquo; and then accuse me of apple pie. The Senator thumped me on the apple pie stakes this evening and then accused me of not insulting people enough &ndash; that was the most amazing performance. The Senator is an academic and I am not. He knows more about this issue than I do. He knows a great deal more about apple pie, he is a master of it. He did it well this evening and I congratulate him on that.</P>
      <P>The Senator said that I referred to bringing people from Northern Ireland many years ago and to the atmosphere that existed then. He went on to say that I was romanticising about a period in the past, but he is completely wrong. I accept his bona fides. He may or may not be right about it having been an Anglo-Irish university at the time. I doubt if he is right, but that is a matter of definition. It was not, it had certain Anglo-Irish people in it. He was right when he said those were Unionists who came here then. I welcome that Unionists came here then and that they had an opportunity to mix with people here at the time. I would welcome even more if people from both communities were to come here now. They would come not to an Anglo-Irish university &ndash; the Senator was talking about 30 years ago &ndash; but to a university where almost all people there are from the Republic of Ireland. That is why I want them to come from both communities. I want Nationalists in the North to come to meet Nationalists in the South. We talk here sometimes as if there is some homogenous agreement between Nationalists in the North and Nationalists in the South, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the minority community in Northern Ireland were to mix with people here, they would find huge differences and that is a divide that could <Col N="474" /> also be bridged. Let us not pretend that one is parallel with the other. We are not living 30 years ago, we are talking about people from here going to a changed situation up there and about people from there coming to a situation, especially in the university I represent, Trinity College Dublin, that is dramatically and totally changed. That is why it is more important it should happen now than then because an exchange of views are being offered between two totally different communities now rather than the one, as Senator Manning pointed out, where there might have been similarities, where the exchange of views might not have provoked so much discussion and friction as it would now. That is why I proposed this motion. This is a fight worth fighting for. It is an issue worth fighting for. I hope the Minister will go away with serious intent to produce proposals so that between the communities a better atmosphere is fostered by our educational establishments.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Genetic Testing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister for Education and Science is taking the debate. I agree with what he said on the Private Members' motion. There is a large amount of interconnecting research at post-graduate level. That ties in with my concern about the topic of genetic testing, which I wish to raise.</P>
      <P>Patients may be deterred from seeking genetic testing which could be beneficial to their health because of fears that it would adversely affect their status with insurance companies. The Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Treacy, has been kind enough to listen to my concerns in the past and he has said that his Department will try to make progress in this area as soon as possible. My constituents in several medical areas, including molecular genetics and cancer, have impressed on me that legislation in this area is urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise the medical situation, we know that some people have genetic susceptibilities to some diseases and that ameliorating measures can sometimes be taken to modify the effects of these genes. For example, Irish people have a high level of cardio-vascular disease. In recent years it has been discovered that lack of an enzyme to lower the level of homocystene in the blood is associated with cardiac disease. The presence or absence of this enzyme is genetically determined, but if a person who lacks this enzyme increases his or her intake of folic acid, homocys<Col N="475" /> tene levels decrease and damage to the heart decreases. Therefore, in spite of any genetic predisposition, one can do something about the condition.</P>
    <P>This shows how important it is that we identify people with this predisposition, so that they can increase their folic acid intake. Indeed, the condition is so common in Ireland that I have previously suggested that we should fortify bread with folic acid. Because of our genetic predisposition to having problems with regard to folic acid, we already have the highest incidence in Europe of spina bifida and other neuro-tube defects. The House will be aware of the television campaign to encourage women who are contemplating pregnancy or who are in the early stages of pregnancy to take folic acid to ameliorate the effects of the genetic susceptibility.</P>
    <P>Individual patients may be afraid to take this test because they fear an adverse effect if they seek life or health insurance. There is no certainty that a person with high levels of homocystene will develop cardiac disease, but generally speaking it is wiser for them to make efforts to reduce it. Interpreting genetic testing is difficult. There are multifactoral conditions involved in this issue and many genes, rather than one gene, may be involved in the development of a specific condition.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports imply that members of the Government's national cancer forum have told the Department of Health and Children that genetic testing should be part of the treatment and care of patients and that it should be integrated into cancer prevention and treatment services. Genetic testing could be used, particularly within susceptible groups or families, to determine if a person is more susceptible to a particular type of cancer. For example, bowel cancer is a very serious problem in Ireland, our incidence being exceeded in Europe only by the Czech Republic. Just because a person has a genetic susceptibility, this does not mean that he or she will get cancer. As I have said, many factors are involved in the development of cancer, but a change of lifestyle might help to lessen the risks of developing cancer.</P>
    <P>If insurance companies are allowed to request applicants for insurance to undergo genetic testing before granting cover, some people will be seriously disadvantaged because genetic testing is in its infancy and complex questions frequently have to be asked about the interpretation of results. Insurance company personnel may not be the best people to do this assessment. A simplistic assessment of genetic tests could lead to serious disadvantage to some patients. Where a person has an existing genetic disorder, it is the same as when a person has an existing illness and information must, of course, be disclosed to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>A particular example would be a young person from a family with Huntington's chorea. This is a fatal neurological condition which involves a <Col N="476" /> gradual physical and mental deterioration, but this does not develop until a person is in his or her forties or fifties, prior to which he or she may lead a perfectly normal life. There is no cure for this disease. If insurance companies obliged young people with a family history of Huntington's chorea to take a genetic test, what might be the effect on a person who showed a positive result to the test? They might even contemplate suicide.</P>
    <P>It could be beneficial to insurance companies to encourage people to have genetic testing for their own good. For example, in pharmaco-genetics, we know that some people have a genetic susceptibility to certain drugs. It would be to the insurance companies' advantage to let such people find out about these conditions, so that adverse reactions could be avoided. Those with a predisposition to certain conditions could modify their lifestyles and thereby lead longer and healthier lives. This, of course, would also benefit insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Once again, I emphasise that this is a very complex issue. The Association of British Insurances already has a code of practice under which genetic testing will not be sought for all relevant types of insurance, including health and life insurance. The same companies are also major operators in the Irish insurance market. It has been suggested that not all companies are honouring this voluntary agreement and that some are asking for genetic testing. I suggest to the Minister that a voluntary code is not adequate and that legislation is needed in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of genetic information for insurance purposes raises specific and complex issues. It should be remembered that the actual science involved is developing at a very rapid rate and there seems to be uncertainties at present regarding the science itself, actual testing and the appropriateness of using the results in the insurance area.</P>
      <P>There are also wider issues involved, including public health, protection of personal data, insurance solvency and consumer protection. It is, therefore, appropriate that wide consultation takes place before any policy decisions are taken. This is what is actually happening at present. Senators may be aware that the insurance industry in Ireland does not request genetic information about those applying for life assurance policies. There is, therefore, an opportunity for all concerned to engage in the discussions and consultations that are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Education and Science are currently involved in a number of consultation processes, both within the Department and outside it. In the departmental area of responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, consultations have taken place with the Office of Science and Technology and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Department of Health and Children and the Society of <Col N="477" /> Actuaries in Ireland have also been consulted. These consultations have not yet been concluded.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is involved with a group set up under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and comprised of officials of that Department, the Department of Health and Children, the National Centre for Medical Genetics &ndash; Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin &ndash; the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland and the Inherited Disorders Organisation. A number of meetings have taken place and the work of the group is progressing.</P>
    <P>A task force on biotechnology was established by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation &ndash; ICSTI &ndash; which operates under Forfás. I understand that it recently submitted a report to the council and that this is currently being finalised for publication in the near future. The Irish Insurance Federation has already prepared a draft code of practice on genetic testing for its members. The draft code sets out the conduct to be followed by the industry in Ireland in regard to use of genetic tests and seeks to balance the legitimate interests of insurers and of the totality of policy holders with the concerns of individual consumers. The IIF has engaged in consultations on the draft code, including the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform group, which I have already mentioned. I understand that the IIF regards those meetings as very productive and that they have influenced the proposals that the IIF will bring forward in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the insurance industry in Ireland does not request genetic information about those proposing for life assurance policies and does not and will not require applicants for insurance policies to undergo a genetic test to obtain insurance. The requirement to disclose a previously undertaken genetic test is to protect the insurance company from being selected against and to protect other insurance policy holders who would have to pay more into the insurance pool. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Treacy, has asked his officials to inquire further into how significant this increased risk might be and what the resulting increased cost to the pool would be.</P>
    <P>The Minister is open to persuasion on the need for a legislative framework in this area and I have noted what Senator Henry has said. I fully accept that public health policy concerns are legitimate and of enormous importance. Once the consultation process which is under way has been completed, he will consider the issue of legislation in the light of the results of that process and in the light of the views expressed in this House and in the course of public debate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for being present to take this item on the Adjournment. St. Anne's school in the Curragh is one of a small number of schools nationally that provide specialist care for children with mental handicap. In the past five years or so it has been designated for children with moderate to severe and profound handicap. This means that the profile of St. Anne's has changed and the range of ability has broadened to encompass children who have high dependency and slow rate of progress and who need a high staffing ratio to achieve even basic goals. It has been proven that with the correct staff input and a properly structured programme the students can achieve in areas that would in other times have not been considered.</P>
      <P>Several of the students at St. Anne's, where there is a significant second level stream involving about 40 of the student population of 80, have other conditions. They may have autism and there are other factors affecting their welfare in the school, giving rise to a demonstration of challenging behaviour. This can manifest itself in volatile, aggressive and unpredictable violent outbursts from time to time. These students often do not succeed in learning in groups as they need intensive, structured and individualised lessons and require one to one tuition. The school has on occasion been able to provide one to one cover and where that has happened the progress that has been observed in the case of the students has been exceptional.</P>
      <P>For some time there has been a request with the Department of Education and Science focusing on allowing the school to continue to develop its vocational programme for students in the 12 to 19 year old category. We acknowledge that the Department has approved 700 additional teaching hours to this school which has enabled a range of subjects involving woodwork, home economics and horticulture in particular to be provided to the second level students. Those 700 hours were allocated at a time when there were just two classes of students in the 12 to 18 year old category. Now the school has grown to a point where there are 40 students in that area and the Minister's Department has received a request for an additional 900 teaching hours to meet the needs of these special needs students.</P>
      <P>I salute the Minister for the outstanding work he has done since coming to office in combating disadvantage and providing right across the country for people with special needs. This school has an urgent need and we ask for the Minister's attention and hope for a positive response. I invite the Minister to come and see the outstanding work being done by St. Anne's school.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has raised this matter and given me an opportunity to clarify to the House the current position. St. Anne's is a special school which caters for special needs pupils across the age range four to 18 years. It provides educational programmes at primary and post-primary level for these pupils. It caters for pupils with a moderate general learning disability and for pupils with a severe or profound general learning disability. The school has a current enrolment of approximately 76 pupils. It has a principal and 11 teachers allocated directly to the school by the special education division of my Department. Staff are allocated to the school on the basis of a ratio of 8:1 for pupils with moderate general learning disability and a ratio of 6:1 for severe or profound general learning disability. The school also has 14 special needs assistants. In addition, it has for a number of years additional teaching resources provided through County Kildare VEC under a co-operation arrangement.</P>

    <P>I am aware that the school now serves children and older pupils who have high dependency. These pupils may have a slow rate of progress and require a high staffing ratio to achieve educational goals. The school has over recent years had increasing enrolments, particularly in the post-primary age group. This has resulted in a changing profile in pupil intake. It has also required the development of appropriate programmes to meet changing educational needs of pupils. Originally the school had two senior classes and this has now increased to five senior classes. It provides a practical vocational education and training curriculum in home economics, horticulture and woodwork for its senior <Col N="480" /> pupils in the age range 12 to 18 years. The VEC supports St. Anne's by allocating teaching resources to the school as part of the VEC remit to provide for continuing education in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee's co-operation arrangement with St. Anne's school provides for an allocation of teaching hours in the practical courses provided for the school's senior pupils. An allocation of 20 hours per week has been provided up to now. Following receipt of a request from St. Anne's for increased support, County Kildare VEC applied to my Department for an increase in the approved allocation. The application was referred to my Department's inspectorate for consideration. Having considered its report, I am pleased to inform the House that my Department has approved an additional allocation of 25 teaching hours per week in respect of St. Anne's. This will enable the school to provide an enhanced practical curriculum to meet the needs of its expanding senior class enrolment. I am pleased to approve the additional resources requested to enable this successful co-operative support arrangement to further develop and enhance educational provision for pupils in the school.</P>
    <P>As with all VEC co-operation arrangements, the allocation will be reviewed annually by the committee and by my Department. I would like to take the opportunity to commend the management and staff of County Kildare VEC and St. Anne's school for their initiative, commitment and achievements in developing appropriate programmes for special needs pupils.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 April 2001.</P>
