      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken not earlier than 12.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I wish to raise the issue of the foot and mouth crisis. I renew today the appeals from all sides of the House for the fullest possible co-operation with the authorities. It now looks as if there may be some major scam involved which has accelerated or facilitated the spread of the disease. A full inquiry into the matter is required to establish how the disease spread and whether people are guilty of grossly irresponsible behaviour. These facts need to be established immediately. In the meantime, the battle against the spread of the disease must be heightened. It is clear from news reports that there are some very serious gaps in our defence measures. I do not wish to attack anybody but I appeal to the authorities not to be defensive where defects are pointed out but to take every opportunity to seal off the gaps.</P>
      <P>Today's picture in <i>The Irish Times </i>showing the lack of precautions at Holyhead was not just frightening but criminal. The disease has spread here from Great Britain where there are indications of a very lax approach. We have a right to expect the highest standards to operate there. As a practical measure, I suggest that from next week people entering this House should also be disinfected. People will leave these Houses today to go to all parts of the country and then return for next week's business. We should set an example by having disinfectant pads at both entrances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a danger that this issue which affects our whole economy will be seen as something to do with a certain group only. It has not permeated that it is as much a city issue as a rural one and it is not just the agri-industry but every industry in the country that is involved. If we have to clamp all movement everyone will suffer. Will the Leader suggest to the Government that it would be helpful if Opposition agriculture spokespersons took part in the special advisory group? They should not be seen as potential causes of political division in this case. This is a matter of national urgency and all the wisdom, intellect and brainpower available should be directed towards it. It would give a sense of confidence that we are approaching this in a different manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what has been said on the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain and the apprehension that it is also here. The real danger facing us is that there are a number of irresponsible people. There also seem to be considerable gaps in the measures introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. They are not as stringent as they should be. I agree with what Tom Parlon, the IFA president, said this morning. Anybody found in breach of measures to report outbreaks should be treated harshly. It is ridiculous that the maximum penalty is £5,000 for anyone who knowingly fails to report an incident. The maximum should be at least a custodial sentence. I call for an inquiry into the outbreak and also into the absence of a comprehensive plan to deal with emergencies of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with what has been said on this matter. The issue is of such gravity that it should be kept under review. Several useful ideas, which may not have been thought of by the task force, have been put forward in both Houses. One was the suggestion that everyone entering the country should fill a form showing where they have come from and to where they are going. We need to show an example, and there should be precautions at the gates of Leinster House. Yesterday I made the point that Senator Rory Kiely is from a farm in Limerick and I am from a farm in Kildare, and we were sitting beside each other. That indicates that quite a few people from farms come to the House on a daily basis. Perhaps the Cathaoirleach could convey the suggestion to the superintendent or maybe the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possible fraudulent transfer of animals to Athleague meat plant is a major concern. One <Col N="811" /> of the things we could do most effectively here is appeal to the people with influence in south Armagh to use their good offices to ensure that everybody north and south of the Border co-operates with the authorities. That is a <i>sine qua non. </i>People must understand that there is a £5 billion export industry at stake here. The capacity of this country to export its food products all over the world and to be able to vouch for their safety is at risk.</P>
    <P>I commend what the chairman of the Irish Racehorse Trainers' Association, Mr. Willie Mullins, said. He is very conscious of the implications for the industry. The cancellation of racing at Cheltenham would be a blow to the racing industry. In my own area, there are many thousands of sheep on the Curragh and they mix with horses. It would only take a few horses making a return journey from Cheltenham to the Curragh to cause a problem. That is the background to the decision which the Irish Racehorse Trainers' Association must make this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Because of the seriousness of the foot and mouth issue, I have allowed some considerable latitude to the various leaders this morning to discuss this matter on the Order of Business. It was debated all afternoon yesterday and any further points that Members wish to make should be reserved for next week when we see how the situation develops. I ask Members not to be repetitious on this issue. If the views expressed by the leaders reflect the views of all Members, perhaps we could leave it at that this morning. I assure the House that I will be very flexible in the amount of latitude I will allow next week on the Order of Business when we see how the situation develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader when the House will discuss the rail safety Bill? This Bill is to strengthen the powers of the independent rail safety authority. I ask this question because of the extraordinary situation which arose in the Dáil last week. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, gave one reply in relation to a rail accident near Athlone on the Dublin to Mayo line. He was then forced to come into the Dáil two days later and give an entirely different reply. The issue of rail safety and the investigation of incidents on the railway lines needs to be dealt with by an independent body. That is the purpose of the rail safety Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears the Leader misunderstood a question I raised yesterday. I requested a debate on slavery. Members will be aware that yesterday Trócaire commenced its lenten campaign against <Col N="812" /> slavery worldwide. According to the various United Nations humanitarian organisations, slavery involves about 27 million people. Slavery or bondage, in a very subtle form, exists in this country. The Leader seemed to confuse my request with one for a debate on low pay. I request a debate on the whole issue of slavery worldwide and its possible existence in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>

      <P>A very brief question to the Leader, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Since yesterday, the situation has become much more serious. There is a rumour now that a farm in Kerry is under surveillance. That brings it very near to my home. I agree with what Senator Costello and the President of the Irish Farmers' Association said as regards the rigours of the law. Are there disinfectant mats at the entrances to all farms? It should be compulsory.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the poor coverage given to the proceedings of this House in the newspapers. This is especially so when important issues such as foot and mouth disease are discussed. The <i>Farming Independent</i> is very hard to get in the Library. There is a Dáil report every Thursday and very little on the proceedings of this House, even when there have been various debates on agriculture. <i>The Irish Times</i> has been reporting on the Seanad but at the moment it only carries a Dáil report. I ask the Leader to ensure that the proceedings of this House get the required publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will obey the ruling about speaking on the foot and mouth issue, but I would like to echo what Senator Kiely has said. Reference was made to a significant picture in <i>The Irish Times</i> but there was no written report to accompany it.</P>
      <P>There was a very good debate in this House yesterday. There were very useful suggestions made and a wide range of knowledge and expertise was brought to bear on the issue. It is disappointing that there has been no coverage at all this week. <i>The Irish Times</i> is a commercial concern and it cannot be forced, even when serious issues are discussed in the House and particularly when the public must be alerted. This is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask a question regarding No. 22, which deals with the question of sanctions against Iraq. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="813" /> Deputy Cowen, had discussions yesterday at the White House and explained to the American officials the Irish position on sanctions. We need to explain clearly our position on sanctions to the Irish public and to both Houses because mixed messages are being given. Most of us are against sanctions as they impinge on the children of Iraq. It is intolerable that children should be dying daily because of sanctions. A very honourable Irishman, Dennis Halliday, indicated in a programme last week that he had resigned from the United Nations because what was occurring was tantamount to genocide. We cannot stand idly by while this is going on.</P>
    <P>I move an amendment to the Order of Business today, that we take No. 22 which is a matter that concerns both me and my friend and colleague, Senator Ross. He will second this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader what he intends to do about motions Nos. 11,12, and 13, which deal with the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations, 2001? The concept of freedom of information is evolving. Will the motions be debated or presented to the House in the next few weeks for a decision without debate? </P>
      <P>I am in a difficult position with respect to Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business. It would have been helpful if he had told us in advance that he was going to make this proposal. My Leader has already agreed that we support the Order of Business. To present us with what are very worthy issues without some form of notice both trivialises the House and trivialises&mdash;</P>

      <P>Being as familiar as I am with the peculiarities of the Independent group, it still does not mean that I will reveal them to the public. Whatever about my short-term memory, there is a campaign of state terrorism being conducted which is meant to keep Saddam Hussein in power but harmless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue deserves more than a proposal, without notice, to change the Order of Business. However, I support the sentiments expressed regarding the imposition of sanctions on Iraq. The bombing of Baghdad and the desig<Col N="814" /> nation of no fly zones have no basis in international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion and think it is a great pity that Senator Ryan does not support the motion also. There is no reason a political party or grouping should be locked into the Order of Business a day early and when issues of this urgency come up do not feel able to support them. We would welcome the support of our socialist friends on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis and Rory Kiely expressed their horror and shock at the hour by hour announcements on foot and mouth disease. We hope that the disease will not come to this country but the revelations on events in Armagh over the last 24 hours have helped us realise the massive difficulties we will face and which are currently being faced by the United Kingdom's farming community, and food, manufacturing and tourism industries. Every person and industry will be affected if this disease comes to Ireland. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development would welcome the involvement of the Opposition parties and spokespersons in assisting the task force which is meeting on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the suggestion from Senator Manning that disinfectant pads be placed at the gates of Leinster House and feel that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could look in the short term at activities in the House, such as school tours, etc. We welcome those who visit the House but this borders on an emergency and the survival of our community and nation depends on the action taken at this time.</P>
      <P>I commend those who have been vigilant. Every citizen is responsible for the security of the island and should be performing vigilant tasks with the help of the Garda and the Army. If there is illegal activity that will endanger livelihoods, jobs and the very being of the farming community &ndash; which has been badly stretched in recent years &ndash; we owe it to that community to play our part. Illegal activity should attract the full rigour of the law. As Senator Costello pointed out, if we must increase fines and sentences, that is what our position as legislators demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor called for a debate on rail safety and I have no difficulty allocating time for this. There was a call for a debate on slavery also. I saw an interesting programme on India <Col N="815" /> recently and fully agree with the sentiments expressed. I will allow time for this subject.</P>
    <P>I send condolences to the families of those who lost their lives yesterday in the dreadful rail crash in the north of England and I sympathise also with the injured who number close to 100. It was a horrific and freak accident caused by a truck leaving the road in bad weather, leading to the tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely and Senator Norris expressed their concern at the lack of coverage of the House by the national press. Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times </i>has given great coverage to the Seanad but that newspaper's coverage has suffered as he is currently ill. <i>The Irish Times</i> gives us fair coverage, however. I do not understand why other newspapers are not covering the House as one third of all legislation is now initiated here and those newspapers are missing many stages in the passage of legislation. I am grateful for the fair coverage given to the Seanad on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and RTÉ is to be commended for that.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris, Ryan and Ross called for an amendment to the Order of Business. I can allow time for this matter to be discussed next week if the House will agree, or I can allow time at the end of business next Tuesday if this will assist Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 39 to 40, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs co-operation convention provides for special forms of co-operation especially in relation to certain types of infringements, such as cases involving illicit trafficking of drugs, smuggling and illegal importation of weapons. <Col N="816" /> These special forms of co-operation are hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, covert investigations and joint special investigational teams. These provisions would have the effect of allowing customs officers from one state to enter another state to carry out their investigations.</P>
    <P>The convention allows member states to opt out of applying the provisions relating to hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance and covert investigations. The other provisions are mandatory. The Government proposes in the Bill to avail of the opt-out provision and to make a declaration to this effect when Ireland lodges its instruments of adoption of the convention. However, if at some future date circumstances change and Ireland wishes to opt in, the subsection I am seeking to delete provides for this by way of Government order and the necessity to enact amending legislation is avoided. This matter is of such importance that it should only be facilitated by legislation, not Government order. That is the reason for tabling the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. However, his concerns are met by section 11. It provides that if we were to opt in, it can only be done by laying regulations before both Houses. It would have the same effect as primary legislation in that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to approve subsection (2) becoming law. The Government cannot do this simply by order; both Houses of the Oireachtas must approve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the same as ministerial orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I lost faith in the practice of amending legislation by regulation after reading the Ombudsman's report on the nursing home subventions. It shows we should be wary of passing legislation which permits the same legislation to be amended at a future date by regulation. That is my worry in this case. This is a matter of grave importance and if the State decides to opt in, it should do so through amending legislation, not by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I are <i>ad idem</i> but we are discussing two slightly different issues. It is not a question of just lodging the regulations in the Oireachtas Library. The way the matter is dealt with in the Bill is unlike how the other issues to which the Senator referred were dealt <Col N="817" /> with. It must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The provision simply means we will not have to draft new legislation and suffer the time delays and so forth that might be entailed in coming up with exactly what is in the subsection. To give comfort to Members, these issues are not simply a matter of a ministerial order being laid in the Oireachtas Library. It must be brought before the Dáil and the Seanad, so the effect is the same as legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle raises an important point. We should not introduce legislation whereby the Minister can, almost by ministerial nod, change important provisions in relation to inter-activity between different states, such as cross-border surveillance, hot pursuit and so forth. If it is not as Senator Doyle suggests, where the regulation is put before the Houses and if there is no objection within 21 days it comes into operation, is the Minister saying that a formal draft of every order will be put before each House, will appear on the Order Paper and will be voted on or approved by each House? In that case, it would be open to debate by each House over a period of time and we could invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter. Only then would it be approved and become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. My note on section 11 might be helpful to the Senators. Section 11 sets out the criteria which will apply in relation to the making of orders or regulations under this legislation. The making of orders or regulations by the Government or a Minister is a function which does not require a specific enactment of the Houses of the Oireachtas. As a safeguard, it is normal practice in framing legislation to provide that before any order or regulation is made by the Government or a Minister under an Act, a draft of the order is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Subsequently, that order or regulation cannot be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House. The Act provides limited possibilities for the making of orders or regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is clear that they must be put before both Houses and it is only following the resolution of both Houses that this subsection can take effect. It has the same effect as me coming before the House with primary legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, to the House. I would not have been surprised if he had deferred consideration of this Bill. On a day when there are many other crises it seems almost out of place to divert our attention to the minutiae of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I telephoned a short while ago to see if a Government amendment had been tabled. I am happy with it as it overcomes the problems I was having with my amendment. Last week on Committee Stage the Minister promised he would look at this matter again. The Government amendment seems to cover the points I was trying to make. When I tabled my amendment, I wanted to ensure that we strengthened the appeals process. While it does not go as far as I would like, the important element is to ensure that the appeals process is as strong and independent as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was worried about the wording in the original <Col N="819" /> amendment, particularly the reference to the appointment at the pleasure of the Minister. My mind was put at rest when it was pointed out to me that it was taken word for word from the social welfare appeals system. There was no reference to the Civil Service Commission in the social welfare appeals board. The Civil Service Commission was the appointment authority for the social welfare appeals board. The inclusion in the Government amendment of the phrase, &ldquo;Civil Service means the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State&rdquo;, addresses my concerns. I will withdraw both my amendments on the basis of the changes I have seen today. I thank the Minister for responding to the deep concerns expressed in the House last week.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Quinn's remarks. We appreciate that the Minister of State is here today given the onerous duties he has elsewhere. I welcome the Government amendment which meets many of the concerns raised last week. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would table an amendment to meet our concerns. I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 3 as the Government amendment addresses the point raised in it.</P>
      <P>As regards &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo;, I accept that this phrase appears in the social welfare appeals legislation. However, it is an archaic and unacceptable phrase to be included in legislation and we should take this opportunity to remove it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Quinn and Hayes for agreeing to withdraw their amendments. It is unusual, particularly today, that we should be <Col N="820" /> talking about &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; since this week has not been a particularly pleasurable one for the Minister in any regard.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to amendment No. 4 in the names of Senators O'Meara, Costello and Ryan. While I do not wish to be obstructive, Government amendment No. 2f2&gt;a fully meets the objective of amendment No. 4. I am hopeful, therefore, that Senators will accept my amendment which has been drafted to give effect to the commitment I made last week. The reference to &ldquo;person's&rdquo; in the amendment proposed by the other side is obviously unsatisfactory. The phrase &ldquo;during the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; is superseded entirely by the wording in section 2 which I am proposing. The amendment, therefore, provides that the staff will be appointed from the entire pool of civil servants across all Departments and offices. The net effect of this amendment is that recruitment for the position of appeals officer to the agriculture appeals office will be more open than any other comparable body in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn was initially anxious to see the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs being used as a template. I am informed that the entire staff of that office, which comes under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is drawn from the staff of the Minister's office. I mention this to show that the social welfare appeals office is not the only one whose staff is entirely appointed in-house. As Senators on both sides of the House will know, the work of both those offices has quite correctly been applauded, notwithstanding their in-house recruitment. I hope, therefore, Senators will accept that we have gone a long way to meet their insistence on recruitment from across the wide range of the Civil Service. There is no other comparable body in the Civil Service whose recruitment is not specific to its sponsoring Department, as the agriculture appeals office will now be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the undertaking I made in this connection last week, and for obvious reasons, I arranged that consultations should take place between the trade unions and staff associations within my Department. Very strong objections were expressed by the unions across the board. Nonetheless, I am hopeful that they will approach the arrangement now proposed in a spirit of co-operation. The misgivings of the unions and staff associations derive from the fact that, unlike the corresponding appointments in social welfare and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, appointments as appeals officers in the agriculture appeals office will not be reserved to in-house candidates. While I understand the staff's viewpoint on this issue, nonetheless I remain hopeful that the text I am now proposing will meet their concerns. The concerns of those <Col N="821" /> people, in general, might also be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments seek such independence for this appeals board that it could have been drawn from anywhere outside the Civil Service. The Minister actually answered that point for me last week, although I had not recognised the dangers of political appointments that could include party members. I realise that I was not taking into account the concerns of the unions and I now understand that it is wise to limit it to civil servants. I appreciate that such appointments will now come from the wider Civil Service and will not be limited to that Department alone. The Minister has listened to us but he has not granted the total independence I thought we would have, such as with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Minister has explained, however, that even in that case appointments came from within the same Department. I am happy with the matter. The term &ldquo;during the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; is certainly an archaic one and should be deleted. Senator O'Meara's concern about social welfare appeals should also be taken into account, although it is not a matter for today.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this procedural amendment is simply to make clear that the right to request the holding of an oral hearing rests with the appellant and not with any third party. It is not likely that a difficulty will arise here in any case, but it is conceivable that a witness, or even an officer of the Department, may wish to call an oral hearing for reasons which have nothing to do with the legitimacy of the appellant's claim.</P>
