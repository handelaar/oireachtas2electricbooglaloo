      <P>We have been joined in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery by the speaker of the senate of the Czech Republic, Senator Petr Pithart, and a parliamentary delegation from the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of all my colleagues in Seanad Éireann I extend a very warm welcome to you and sincere good wishes for a very successful visit. I hope that you are enjoying your short stay with us and that you will take back with you to the Czech Republic many happy and pleasant memories of your time in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Thérèse Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the retention of the eleventh mainstream post in Talbot Senior National School, Dublin 22, as the suppression of this post will breach the Department's guidelines for disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding for the purchase and refurbishment of Stella Maris Nursing Home, Lisdoonvarna, so that the elderly of north Clare can be provided with proper facilities.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at <Col N="442" /> 2.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 10 minutes; and No. 3, statements on rural and western development, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If business is not concluded the remaining business will be taken after 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. May I raise two issues very briefly? The first is of importance, particularly to those of us from the west, south-west and north-west. It is Iarnród Éireann's proposed fare increases. It is inappropriate that any State or semi-State company should impose increases without giving value in return. Instead of raising fares and infusing Government money into an archaic system, I ask that the Minister come to the House and indicate to us proposals to upgrade the system and then when we have the value we can charge for it.</P>
      <P>The second issue is in regard to the insurance industry. It has been brought to my attention that the Central Bank regulations on the Irish insurance industry are very restrictive in comparison with those experienced by an English company or any foreign company that wishes to establish itself here. The same regulations do not apply and therefore it is not a level playing field. I ask that the Minister come to the House to explain how these regulations can be adjusted so that we can ensure all will be treated equally and that the Irish industry will be treated on the same footing as any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, due to a technical regulation, the Chair made a correct ruling which did not allow us to put down an amendment to the Order of Business. I respect that ruling but I wish to put it down today. It is that we take No. 19 today immediately after the Order of Business. The reason is the continuing controversy about the European Union and Ireland's role in it and the welcome intervention this morning of Mr. Pat Cox, MEP, in reply to Mr. Michael McDowell. It would be appropriate if this particular debate took place in these Houses. We had the support of Fine Gael for it yesterday, and we had the opportunity for the Government side to support the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his attitude to the reprimand by Mr. Solbes. We have already noted that Mr. Solbes has decided not to meet anybody from here as Senator O'Toole said yesterday.</P>
      <P>I am just about to finish as I see the Chair getting a little edgy. That is not a pejorative remark, it happens to all Members of the House. An opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his attitude should be provided, not only to the Fine Gael and Independent Senators who supported the proposal yesterday but to those on the Government side too.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Enterprise to come to the House to discuss Iarnród Éireann's fare increases, which have already been mentioned. Aer Lingus is going into the red for the first time in recent times. An Post will lose £8 million this year and £80 million over the next three years. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, should come to the House to discuss these important areas of public service which fall under her remit. We need to have a full debate on areas which are in crisis, like public transport, Aer Lingus and An Post.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the European Union. This country has become a Tower of Babel and many things are being said that should have been said in advance of the discussion on the substance of the treaty.</P>

      <P>This debate should have taken place before the question was put to the people, but it did not. It is time that level-headed politicians took a grip of the situation and constructed a coherent and reasoned argument that can be put to the public.</P>
      <P>The McKenna judgment and the Referendum Commission restrict politicians to the extent that it is not possible to add substance to a debate on a referendum on any issue, domestic or European. It is not possible to communicate a message to the electorate, a problem that needs to be addressed. If an argument is stripped of the voice and the conviction of those who believe in it, it will die as it did in the last referendum. Voices were heard on our televisions at a cost to the taxpayer of about £1 million.</P>

      <P>Today is World Refugee Day. I raised yesterday the need for the Minister to come in to discuss the issue of refugees and asylum-seekers. It would be fitting if the Minister were to extend a work permit to those who were here before December 2000 as they are anxious to work and to contribute to the social and economic life of the country. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come here within the next few days to discuss the possibility of granting more work permits to celebrate World Refugee Day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a disturbing report on the front page of Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i>. It gave hope to the victims of paedophilia, particularly those abused by members of the Catholic Church. The headline said that a fund of £90 million was to be created to be given to them. An article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> contained a denial that any discussion had taken <Col N="444" /> place about the fund. Victims of paedophilia and child abuse, whether at the hands of the State or the Catholic Church, have endured much in recent years. It is neither sensible nor right that a newspaper should contain a headline such as appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday. The people involved have suffered grave abuse and the headline in Monday's <i>Irish Independent </i>was a further abuse, which was compounded by Patsy McGarry's denial in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that this happened. I expected that the <i>Irish Independent </i>would have responsibility&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Martin Hynes, chief executive of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, stated in a recent report that there is a crisis in blood transfusion services in Ireland. We must have a debate on the Lindsay tribunal and on why there is such a significant problem with blood transfusion services. People are not giving blood and there are major emergencies as a result. The matter should be discussed so that it can be established where the Lindsay tribunal is heading.</P>

      <P>May I trespass on your patience, a Chathaoirligh, as I am also a Member of the European Parliament, and endorse your welcome to the speaker of the Czech Republic Senate and his colleagues? Given the situation in Ireland following the Nice treaty referendum I, like most of my colleagues, look forward to the day the Czech Republic, building on its unique history and culture, will be in a position to contribute fully as a member of the European Union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> I endorse the request by Senators Ross, Quill and others for a debate on Ireland's policy on Europe following the Nice treaty referendum as distinct from a debate on EU policy. It is a kind use of language to refer to a lack of coherence in Government strategy. We know what that means.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House because he has a particular opinion on this issue? He is a good debater and a proper debate should be structured whereby different positions can frankly be put on the record of the House followed by a question and answer session, which the Minister would welcome because he would be able to think on his feet. A frank, honest and healthy debate about Ireland's position could be held as a result, which I would welcome. Perhaps the debate&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters can be discussed among the Whips. The time for the Order of Business is limited and a number of other Senators wish to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trespassing on your patience, a Chathaoirligh, but you were generous with others.</P>
      <P>There are also concerns among the farming community about Europe. Farm leaders are in Brussels today awaiting the latest news on EU intervention. If that issue cannot be discussed in the debate I have requested, could time be made available to address the concerns of the farming community <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Lanigan. I was in Shanghai yesterday and I did not, therefore, get an opportunity to read the newspapers. Having listened to his contribution, I have had a complete digest of yesterday's Irish press.</P>
      <P>I second Senator Ross's amendment. I am particularly pleased that a number of interesting political sources have publicly caught up with the position taken by those of us who opposed the Nice treaty because of its military implications. I concur with what Senator Doyle said and I am very glad she was here to say it.</P>
      <P>We on this side who opposed the Nice treaty always uniformly supported enlargement of the EU. I ask our Czech friends who are here with us to take the message home that it was not a rejection of them or of our other colleagues. We have principled and conscientious reasons that we wish to retain military and moral independence and neutrality as far as possible. We have found it extremely useful in terms of world diplomacy.</P>
      <P>If democracy means anything, it means that when one is asked a question, one has the right to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; just as much as one has the right to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The Government is foolish if it starts to lecture the electorate and to tell it how confused, stupid and ignorant it is. That is the way to get another &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>

      <P>Awards have recently been given to airlines, which must be congratulated. Yesterday Ryanair was given an award for its competence in running an airline at little cost to the taxpayer. However, the opposite is the case in Aer Lingus. Millions of pounds have been poured into Aer Lingus over the years and millions of pounds have been lost. There is no accountability from anyone within Aer Lingus to the Minister, to this House or to the other House.</P>
      <P>We talk about the press and the way it can say what it wishes, particularly about semi-State bodies. There is a need for someone from Aer Lingus to come into this House to explain what is going on and if it is facing more losses this year. The airlines we have given little funding to over the past ten years are now getting international awards. There are serious questions to be asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome more debate in this House on the European Union, particularly its future development. I agree with what Senator Avril Doyle said. I thought we had an arrangement whereby European personnel could be brought before this House for a useful debate. I suggest that should happen, although I am not taking away from the suggestion that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, should come before us.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan's comments about Iarnród Éireann. The first priority must be to improve the service in terms of carriages, timing and elimination of overcrowding. I also agree with his remarks about the regulation of the insurance industry. A level playing pitch must be a <i>sine qua non</i>. I would welcome a debate in this House on that issue.</P>
      <P>I read in the<i> Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that the payment of the EU ewe premium to hard pressed sheep farmers might be delayed until September. I ask the Leader to pursue this matter urgently with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development because these people are in dire straits as a result of the year they have had. Those payments should be expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on his comments about the way our fishing industry has been treated over the past 30 years by the European Union. I ask the Leader for a debate on the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has raised two important points since he became Minister. The first relates to how controls are being implemented, particularly in the other member states. The second point, which was raised yesterday, relates to the fact that many of our fishing rights were sold out in the early 1970s. He is the first Minister to speak out about <Col N="447" /> this issue. I would like a full debate on this issue in the House so we can hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the rail fare increases to be introduced by Iarnród Éireann. It is disgraceful and unacceptable that of the thousands of people who travel on the same train between Dublin and Dundalk, passengers from Malahide, Skerries and Balbriggan will not pay increased fares, while those from Laytown, Drogheda and Dundalk will pay an 11% increase from next week. It shows the arrogance of Iarnród Éireann. I ask the Minister to come into the House for an urgent debate on this issue.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senators Ross and Norris. It is a very thought-provoking and timely interjection which could be coupled with the call for a debate on Europe by Senator Doyle. As the only Member of the European Parliament here, and as she is in the country today, perhaps time could be provided for a short debate.</P>

      <P>Senators Coogan, Costello, Dino Cregan and O'Dowd called for a debate on the portfolio of the Minister for Public Enterprise, particularly on the increases proposed by Iarnród Éireann and on Aer Lingus, An Post and other State agencies. I will make time available for such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity. I remind the House, however, as Senators will be aware, that all the business we are dealing with over these weeks is legislation. I understand two more Bills will be initiated here next week and we will sit four days each week from now until mid-July. That will be extremely difficult and I will have to discuss with the leaders and the Whips later today the way statements can be taken in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan also called for a debate on the increase in insurance fees, particularly motor insurance, in light of the fees insurers have to pay in the European Union. I have given a commitment that time will be allocated for that debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Ross, Doyle, Norris and Cosgrave supported an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 19 be placed on the Order Paper today. To facilitate the Independent Senators, I can allow an additional hour for the Independents Private Members' time next week.</P>

      <P>&mdash;as was the Fianna Fáil group in regard to tonight's Private Members' Business.</P>
      <P>Senators Quill, Doyle, Coghlan and Cosgrave called for a debate on the European Union, particularly in relation to the Nice referendum and including the McKenna judgment. I can make time available for this debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on asylum seekers. I gave a commitment that I would allow time for that debate at the earliest possible opportunity. Senators Lanigan and Ross called for a debate on the responsibility of the press. The debate on the Children Bill, which will come before the House at 2.30 p.m. today, will provide an ideal opportunity to do that. Senator Lanigan also called for a debate on the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Those points can be made in the debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, which will be taken immediately after the Order of Business. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Dino Cregan in congratulating Ryanair on its award and the excellent work it does. As I have said in the House on many previous occasions, it has done a great deal for tourism. Ten years ago no one could have imagined that air travel would be so affordable. Everyone can now come home from wherever they are and from wherever Ryanair flies to almost every second weekend if they so wish. I wish to be associated with the congratulations expressed.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator's Coghlan's views to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding prompt payments to sheep farmers. Senator Bonner called for a debate on the fishing industry. This sector offers great potential for increased employment and exports if it is supported by way of investment. I will try to arrange such a debate. If this cannot be done, I will allow time during Fianna Fáil's next Private Members' time in three or four weeks. I will pass on Senator Cosgrave's views to the Minister and arrange a debate on the courts structure and the time involved in setting court hearings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>This is an extremely important Bill and we hope, within Fine Gael policy, to provide health care to everyone through the introduction of health insurance for all, but today we are dealing with this Bill. This amendment was also tabled in the Dáil and the Minister dealt with the points raised there, but I would like him to reiterate his position and prove once and for all that out-patient services or general medical practitioner services are included in the definitions.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks a deletion from the Bill of terms which prohibit cash plans from paying benefits directly to health service providers. This requirement is intended to ensure that there is a clear distinction maintained between cash products and indemnity products. In the interests of clarity for consumers I want to minimise the possibility of a situation recurring such as that dealt with by Deputy Noonan as Minister for Health when a question could arise concerning the establishment of a Lego effect between risk-rated cash and community-rated indemnity plans. The intention in the section as published is to keep clear blue water between these two different types of insurance. On that basis I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 has already been met by the amendment accepted on Committee Stage in the <Col N="451" /> other House. The section now incorporates wording which exempts from the definition of a health insurance contract any insurance contracts, or any insurance arrangements, the sole purpose of which is to provide for the making of payments in respect of sickness, injury or disease of amounts calculated by reference only to the duration of the treatment of the sickness, injury or disease. Amendment No. 3 has, in essence, been accepted in the other House.</P>
    <P>As I want to keep clear blue water between the risk rated cash and community rated indemnity plans, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for missing the start of the debate as I had to get my notes. We are still on section 2 dealing with amendments relating to the definition section. I want to raise a point about the Voluntary Health Insurance which has come to my attention. You can, a Chathaoirligh, assist me by letting me know whether I am in order.</P>
      <P>We are discussing services and out-patient services generally, and the total package of health insurance as distinct from simply the end delivery of cash payment when everything has been agreed. I do not know if the Minister has noticed the VHI website. I draw his attention to it and ask him to take the matter up with the VHI. The website is a part of the VHI's information service to patients in the &ldquo;advise yourself&rdquo; era now evident in dealing with health matters. I do not know how long the website has been in operation but it has only come to my attention recently. I do not know if the matter I am about to raise is new to the site.</P>
      <P>There are recommendations on the site which are quite outrageous in relation to fluoride use during pregnancy. My concern, which I raised on the Adjournment last night, is with the recommendations of the Food Safety Authority on its feeding guidelines of 1999 on the use of fluoridated water, that is, tap water which most parents of babies would use in a mixing formula. The Minister has established a forum on fluoridation on which I commend him. He should ensure those who criticise the forum as a pro-fluoride forum do not turn out to be correct. I have concerns on that matter. I respect individual professionalism, but there is a view that this will turn out to be a pro-fluoride forum.</P>
      <P>An Irish health insurer has a website lauding the use of fluoride. I will be more specific on this matter. The website asks the following questions: &ldquo;Why do I need fluoride? How much do I need? Should I take a supplement? What are the best food sources?.&rdquo; It goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> Fluoride is a trace mineral best known as a dental cavity fighter. It also helps to form strong bones by bonding calcium and phosphorus. Your baby needs fluoride when the teeth begin to form at 10 weeks; later, in the second and third trimesters, fluoride is needed to develop primary incisors, molars, and permanent teeth.</P>
    <P>On how much is needed, the website recommends that about 1.5 to four millogrammes daily is considered safe for adults. However, at the very best, the scientific jury is out on this matter. Some 95% of the countries of Europe, not just the European Union, have abandoned fluoridation of public water supplies, which has been used as a form of mass medication to prevent dental cavities. The correct use of the precautionary principle, which is often abused or used when people are uncomfortable or ignorant, is political or governmental interference in the scientific world, or political risk management of scientific research.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure such advice is not supplied by health insurers because it will confuse people. Such advice will also prove incorrect because the forum on fluoridation will not come up with an answer. Will the Minister immediately investigate the VHI website and the advice it provides on fluoride, which I consider to be outrageous, particularly in the light of the uncertain state of the views of members of the international scientific community on this matter?</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, replied to the matter I raised on the Adjournment last evening. The Minister of State is a doctor and I have a qualification as a biochemist, although it has been some time since I obtained it. However, the knowledge I amassed while studying means I understand the literature and can follow the debate. In that context and in respect of this particular issue, I disagree with the Food Safety Authority's view on infant feeding. I do not want any insurance company, albeit it dressed up as a service to patients using their websites, to give advice which will eventually be contradicted. It is only a matter of time before this happens.</P>
    <P>It is extremely dangerous that pregnant women and the mothers of infants up to two years of age should be steered in the wrong direction. They would be better doing without any supplemental fluoride until we obtain the scientific facts. That is the advice of the British Medical Association and the authorities in Canada, America, Japan, New Zealand and Finland. As the facts have been provided by the international scientific community, why is Ireland out of step in terms of the advice it provides mothers in respect of the use of infant formula?</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to this matter and thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for granting me the latitude to raise it. I am extremely concerned about the information that has appeared on the VHI website and believe the Minister <Col N="453" /> should take steps to have this changed, at least until the forum on fluoridation makes its report.</P>

The requirement is intended to ensure a clear distinction is maintained between cash products and indemnity products. In the interests of clarity for consumers I want to minimise the possibility of a situation recurring where a question could arise concerning the establishment of a Lego effect between risk-rated cash and community-rated indemnity plans. We dealt with this matter in the Lower House where I did not accept a similar amendment. However, I did accept an amendment similar to amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator Doyle, I have not seen the VHI website or the advice to which she refers. However, I will refer the matter to my Department's chief medical officer for his consideration.</P>

      <P>That said, however, we established the forum on fluoridation to engage in a detailed and calm debate on the issue of putting fluoride into the public water supply. The medical advice I have received from the World Health Organisation and other bodies suggests that there is no definitive research to show that fluoridation of water supplies causes harm to people. I am obliged to pay heed to such advice. When we established the forum on fluoridation we invited organisations opposed to putting fluoride into public water supplies to take part but, regrettably, they declined to do so.</P>

      <P>As regards toothpaste and such matters, other factors are involved, such as the extraordinary dependence of children in Ireland on confectionery. In a recent survey we rank second highest, with Scotland, in terms of consumption of confectionery in OECD countries.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 17 and 18 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the substitution of the following definition for the definition of &lsquo;health benefits undertaking':</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;health benefits undertaking&rdquo; means a person (including a body established under the laws of a place outside the State) carry<Col N="455" /> ing on health insurance business in the State;',&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's response to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment concerns the addition of the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; to the existing definition of a health benefits undertaking contained in the principal Act. The definition contained in the 1994 Act reads as in the amendment but does not include the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is not considered necessary to include these words in the definition for the following reasons. Health insurance business is defined in the 1994 Act as meaning the business of effecting health insurance contracts. We must, therefore, look to the 1994 Act's definition of health insurance contracts. Such contracts are defined as being contracts of insurance or any other insurance arrangement which provides for the making of payment specifically for the discharge or reimbursement of charges in respect of the provision of hospital in-patient services or ancillary health services.</P>
      <P>The Act further specifies that hospital in-patient services and out-patient services have the meaning accorded to them in the Health Act, 1970, that is, services of such kind to be provided within the functional area of a health board. Therefore, health insurance contracts relate to health services to be provided for persons within the State by definition and by reference to the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill cannot in any way impinge upon the right of insurers authorised to conduct the relevant class of business covering sickness insurance in another EU member state to engage in the provision of such services into Ireland on a service basis. Under EU directives, an insurer is not obliged to establish an office or branch in another member state as a condition of engaging in business there.</P>
      <P>The Department previously received legal opinion on other matters which touched materially on this subject and it stated that the term &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; does not cover the provision of hospital in-patient services or ancillary health services where those services are constructed to be provided for someone outside the State and, save in limited circumstances, would be provided outside the State. For all these reasons it is unnecessary to include the phraseology in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the legal opinion the Minister has received and hope it is 100%. The thrust of the amendment was to make it clear the State was not seeking to impose control extraterritorially on health insurance business conducted from outside the State. The Minister stated definitely from the advice he received that the provisions of the Bill would not impinge on the right of insurers authorised to conduct the rel<Col N="456" /> evant class of business covering sickness insurance in another EU country to engage in the provision of such services in Ireland. He has checked that out and his legal opinion states there is no difficulty or risk inherent in this.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) the insertion of the following definition after the definition of &lsquo;the Registrar':</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;relevant risk&rdquo; shall be construed in accordance with section 12(10)(<i>a</i>);',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were tabled on Committee Stage in the other House. Risk equalisation has been the most controversial aspect in the issue of health insurance. I would like the Minister to assure me and members of the Fine Gael Party that there is no need for this amendment. I would like a lengthy response from him on risk equalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. As these amendments touch on the crucial area of risk equalisation and how it will operate and because of the importance I attach to risk equalisation as an integral part of an effective regulatory framework supporting community rating and open enrolment, I will take the opportunity, as the Senator asked, to outline the general considerations governing policy in this area.</P>
      <P>Before the introduction of the principal Act in 1994, it had been indicated by successive Ministers that risk equalisation would be a central feature of our health insurance industry and regulatory framework. It is also important to bear in mind that risk equalisation measures are permitted under the European Union's third non-life insurance directive.</P>
      <P>Our private health insurance system operates under the principle that insurers must accept all comers irrespective of age or health status and charge them a standard premium for a given level of cover. In other words, insurers cannot be selective about the risks they will cover or the price they will charge. This also means there is solidarity between the young and the old and the healthy and the sick. People do not have to buy health insurance and their trust and confidence in the long-term stability of the system are vital if this solidarity is to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> This is fine as long as all insurers' risk profiles are broadly similar. There is a serious danger, however, that the market could be destabilised if significant variations in risk profiles emerge. For example, if some insurers, by accident or design, end up with a younger, healthier population, they will be able to charge lower premiums. The other side of the coin is that premiums will inevitably rise for those insurers left with a higher proportion of less healthy and older individuals.</P>
    <P>It can be argued in this scenario that the market risk equilibrium would be corrected by the people switching from the higher charging insurers to those with lower premium rates. This is fine in theory but, in practice, the people most likely to switch in this way are those at the lower end of the risk spectrum. This would have the direct effect of pushing up rates even more for the less fortunate insurers, ending up in what could easily become a self-destructive rates spiral with the risk that one or more of the affected insurers would collapse. This would seriously undermine public trust and confidence in the stability of the system which is vital in a voluntary, community rated environment such as ours.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation can ensure this type of potential destabilisation does not occur. It aims to equalise differences in health insurers' costs that arise due to significant variations in their risk profiles. It can thereby ensure no section of the insured population is placed at a disadvantage due to the emergence of differences in risk profiles. In our health insurance system, the equalisation of differences in risk profiles is not unreasonable given that insurers cannot be selective about the risks they will cover or the price they will charge. Risk equalisation levels the playing pitch in an area where insurers should not compete in the first place. They can still gain competitive advantage in many other areas, such as customer services, provider relations, product innovation, claims management, purchasing and administrative efficiencies.</P>
    <P>Many have said this is a theoretical risk, but we can point to certain experiences internationally which bear out our view that risk equalisation is central to the regulatory framework. Until the beginning of the 1970s, the Dutch private health insurance market was dominated by community rating without risk equalisation. During the 1970s and 1980s the market equilibrium was unravelled by risk selection and premium differentiation. Several private health insurers were caught in a deadly spiral of a worsening risk pool and increasing premiums.</P>
    <P>The experience of instability in the Dutch system during the 1970s and 1980s has a parallel in a current difficulty in the German sickness fund. BKK Stadt Hamburg has recently run into serious financial difficulties and has an accumulated deficit of DM100 million. The two primary reasons for this are the relatively high cost of health care in the Hamburg region and the fact that the fund has experienced a disimproving claims ratio due to the loss of younger healthier <Col N="458" /> clients, for which it was not adequately compensated by the existing German risk equalisation system. The resulting increase in premiums has meant it has lost even more younger healthier clients, further exacerbating its difficulties. The German Government commissioned an expert group to review the German risk equalisation system. The group, which reported in February 2001, recommended that the existing risk equalisation system be strengthened.</P>
    <P>On the amendments before us, the purpose and intended impact of introducing the term &ldquo;relevant risk&rdquo; suggests somehow breaking down the composition of the community rated market for unclear ends. The intended replacement of the term &ldquo;insured risks&rdquo; throughout section 9 is very unsatisfactory from my perspective. The definition refers us to section 12(10)(<i>a</i>), but when we get there all we find is that it involves a reference to risks of such class or nature as may be prescribed. This does not take the Legislature very far in terms of knowing what it is actually providing for, nor does it provide much to go on as regards the formulation of regulations pursuant to the Legislature's wishes.</P>
    <P>The definition provides the basis for a number of other amendments under section 9 which seek to remove a reference to the risks as represented by the entire insured population who have traditionally contributed to and in their time enjoyed the benefits of intergenerational solidarity through community rating and to replace it with a more selective but unspecified concept of relevant risks. Such an approach does not appear to support the application of community rating across the insured community as a whole and would not, therefore, serve the interests of the common good. That is the basis on which the amendments were rejected in the other House and I am bound to reject them here also.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment elsewhere in the Bill which ensures that any regulations that may flow from this Bill, particularly regulations that may flow in relation to risk equalisation, must be brought back to both Houses for debate and approval. In the normal course of events, regulations are laid before the House but they do not have to be debated. They can only be raised by Members through a motion to annul the regulations. Because of the complexity of the situation and the very significant interest among Members of the House, the general public and the various insurance companies, a provision is included in the Bill which ensures the regulations setting up the scheme of risk equalisation to be introduced will come before the House. I will deal later with the scheme itself in the course of the debate on the amendments.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on sticking to the opinion that risk equalisation must be included because, without community solidarity internationally, health services will run into far too much trouble. He pointed out the European experience but the American experience has <Col N="459" /> been even worse over decades when they did not have risk equalisation. My amendments later propose to extend risk equalisation to the genetic level.</P>

      <P>The later amendments propose that the regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The general public find the terms &ldquo;risk equalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;community rating&rdquo; difficult to understand, as I did when reading the discussions on the issue in the other House and listening to contributions from both health insurance companies. It is very important that the regulations in this regard are brought to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind the amendments is to make any reserve power or risk equalisation scheme proportionate. I am aware the Minister debated this issue at length with Deputy Gay Mitchell on Committee and Report Stages. This is the kernel of the Bill and I accept the Minister's clarification on the issue. However, there are varying shades of opinion and different interpretations in regard to the Dutch experience. I will withdraw the amendments while stressing the importance of bringing the regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>We have moved a long way since the White Paper and the 1994 Act. I have had extensive consultations with both insurance companies in this country and my Department had discussions with the broad insurance industry in the preparation of this legislation. On the introduction of risk equalisation, we are absolutely committed to protecting the stability of the market, in the first instance, and the concept of community rating and open enrolment. We see risk equalisation as essential to achieve that.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, we will establish the health insurance authority. I have established the authority on an interim basis under the 1994 Act. We have given significant discretion to the health insurance authority <i>vis-à-vis</i> the actual commencement or triggering of risk equalisation. Some of the amendments would have the effect of waiting for a doomsday situation to arrive when either the health insurance authority or the Minister of the day would have to intervene. My experience is that that would be too late because if one waited for the system to be almost teetering on the brink of collapse, confidence would be lost and the system would be irreparably damaged and very difficult to retrieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We received significant actuarial advice, including independent advice, on this issue. Our approach is both balanced and flexible. Both of the main players would be critical of our approach on different sides of the spectrum. Some believe we are being too restrictive, while others believe we are being too liberal. There are already suggestions in regard to the mechanisms and trigger points for the introduction of this provision, which suggests we are getting the balance <Col N="460" /> right. However, the provision needs to be refined further and there is some work to be done prior to bringing in the regulations which will establish the scheme of risk equalisation. An objective of the Bill is to facilitate competition while at all times retaining stability within the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4.&ndash;Section 2 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, is hereby amended in subsection (1) by the insertion after &lsquo;as it may think fit' of &lsquo;and may provide such other services, including services to persons outside the State, as it may think fit',&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 arises from the inclusion of an amendment under the Bill to extend the powers of the VHI in regard to the products and services it is empowered to provide. I tabled an amendment to address this issue on Committee Stage in the other House, which was accepted. This now stands as section 14 of the Bill, which should be sufficient to meet the needs of the board pending legislation specifically to address the nature of its corporate status.</P>
      <P>The amendment would give the VHI undefined powers in regard to the services it could provide. It would represent a departure from the existing legislative structure which requires the approval of the Minister of the day to propose schemes of health insurance. It would literally give the VHI the power to provide any service it saw fit. However, under its existing status, the VHI is not an authorised insurer for the purpose of carrying on either life or non-life insurance business in accordance with the prudential and other requirements of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is considered that the proposed amendment would conflict with the existing legislative framework which requires the approval of the Minister of the day for new schemes and VHI's exemption from meeting the normal requirements for authorisation as an insurer. It is considered appropriate, therefore, that any new scheme should be subject to the approval of the Minister and, where necessary, any regulatory conditions he or she may deem appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues that fall to be determined in subsequent legislation or in consideration of the overall corporate status of the VHI. We have employed consultants to advise us on the future corporate status of the VHI. In the meantime, because of the regulatory framework within which the VHI works which emanates from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="461" /> ment, it would not be possible to give a broad base for the approach as the amendment would suggest. We have gone a long way and we did accept an amendment giving additional powers and authority to the VHI to pursue a range of services. It was relatively satisfied with that and that represents significant progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)Subsection (1) does not apply to any arrangement entered into by an employer whereby the employer agrees to discharge the whole or part of any fees or charges which have been or may be incurred by an employee, or any dependant of the employee, who is a party to or named in a health insurance contract (effected with a health insurance business other than the employer) in respect of health services received by the employee, or his or her dependant, which are not payable by the insurer under that health insurance contract.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was addressed specifically in the other House and I would like a comment from the Minister in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that arrangements whereby employers meet or guarantee to meet the hospital in-patient costs of their employees are deemed to constitute a health insurance contract. As currently drafted it provides that an employer who agrees to reimburse or discharge the fees or charges incurred by employees or any dependant of an employee in respect of hospital in-patient services will be deemed to be carrying on a health insurance business and will be subject to the amended legislation.</P>
      <P>Any opportunity for significant health insurance of this kind on the part of employers will have the effect of damaging community rating by removing a predominantly young and healthy population from the general risk pool. Clearly such a development, which is common practice among larger employers in the United States, would threaten the solidarity between generations which again underpins community rating. Providing scope for the development of risk related gap insurance product for insurers would have a similar effect. The very specific reason for this provision is to support the financial integrity of community rating as it operates in our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of self-insurance practices on the part of employers, if it becomes widespread, would damage the system by removing or diminishing the contribution which employer paid <Col N="462" /> schemes provide to the system. Corporate or employer paid business represents about 20% of the market in terms of total premiums paid and is growing quite significantly. Amendment No. 7 appears to suggest that this positive contribution to the overall risk pool represented by the entire population is not fully needed. Such a development would impact on the cost of insurance generally for those who are not paid for by their employer.</P>
    <P>The amendment, if accepted, would provide an opportunity for insurers to segment the employer paid portion of the market by offering the minimum level of cover permitted under the regulatory system on a community rated basis and cover for anything above that on a risk rated basis. I do not see the opening of the door to such practices as enhancing the strength of community rating. I have made the necessary provision in the Bill to facilitate existing practices in the employer paid sector of the market relating to payment of excesses which was recently brought to the attention of the Department. We put a limit on that which was accepted as an amendment in the other House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 25, after &ldquo;sex&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;genetic profile&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking some of my amendments on the Mental Health Bill and I thank Senator Jackman for bringing them through the House yesterday. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt deserved some good luck after the time he had with me last week.</P>
      <P>The reason I was not here relates directly to this amendment. I was at a meeting in Brussels of the temporary committee on human genetics involving members of the national parliaments of the member states and the applicant countries. Part of this meeting was specifically on the use of genetic information and data protection. It relates exactly to this amendment.</P>
      <P>My colleagues in clinical genetics, as well as many other people, are extremely concerned about the fact that genetic information could be used by insurance companies. Virtually all the European countries now have legislation, or are in the process of bringing through legislation, banning the use of genetic information in the calculation of insurance policy premiums. It is about time we began to do this here. There are several reasons it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Genetics is a very new science and as yet we have very little qualitative assurance in the field. As a result we could have test results from unreliable laboratories and we could have great difficulty with interpretations of these tests by those <Col N="463" /> in the insurance business. For example, there was a considerable amount of trouble in America recently, where they use genetic testing in some insurance companies, owing to the fact that people who had sickle cell trait but not the disease were being classed as having the disease and their policies loaded accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that the genetic profile of a person involves the interdependence of genes. We really know very little yet concerning how these genes interrelate and how they work physiologically. We do not want to get ourselves into a situation where people, who should be advised to take a test to see if they have a particular gene, refuse to take the test because of the implications it might have for their health in the future.</P>
    <P>We do know that environmental factors and one's genetic complement also interplay. There may be an important personal reason for a patient to know what their genetic profile is, but naturally they do not want to take a test, although it may be to their advantage, if they feel an insurance company will treat them in an adverse manner because of having taken it. This is a little like the position some years ago people were asked by insurance companies if they had taken a test to see if they had HIV. These are delicate areas and we need to be careful.</P>
    <P>Once one person in a family takes a genetic test it has an effect on the whole family. Parents, siblings and children of that person will have to consider whether they too have whatever faulty gene is considered to be the problem. We are getting into an area of predictive medicine on this. There is a lot of work to be done in the whole area before we should agree that genetic profiles are important considerations.</P>
    <P>At the meeting in Brussels it was considered extremely important that a moratorium be put over this area so that the science can develop properly and we can enjoy the benefits of genetics rather than having people shy away from them. That is what my amendment is about. People should feel it is quite all right to get a genetic test if they want. It should not interfere with risk equalisation. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. We must start somewhere on the issue of genetic testing and insurance and it might as well be here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for introducing this amendment and thereby introducing the general issue of genetic testing. I thank her also for her comments on the Bill that went through the House yesterday. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, and I were in a position to bring forward some amendments following the Senator's robust performance on the previous occasion. We reflected on that and were in a position to accept some of her amendments. Senators Jackman, Lydon and others on the Government side of the House made their views known to me also in terms of the desirability of accommodating <Col N="464" /> some of the amendments and I was glad to be in a position to facilitate them.</P>
      <P>I accept the Senator's concerns in relation to the use of a person's genetic profile by insurers in setting premiums for insurance cover, particularly given recent publicity which other areas of the insurance industry have attracted. I reassure the Senator that the amendment proposed is fully provided for under the existing text of the relevant section which was drafted under the instruction to preclude health insurers from using any forms of predictive diagnosis of health problems as a basis for varying premium levels. The import of the Senator's amendment is therefore already catered for in the provisions of the principal Act as repeated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The existing section specifically provides, by the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;the suffering or prospective suffering of a person&rdquo;, that genetic factors cannot be taken into account. This is in addition to the general provision in section 5(2) that states that its provisions apply &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1)&rdquo;. The latter subsection generally obliges insurers to charge the same premium in all circumstances for contracts and prohibits them from offering contracts that are not community rated.</P>
      <P>Senators may be interested in a Government memorandum written during the drafting of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which formed the basis of instructions to the parliamentary draftsman preparing the Bill. The important issue of fully preserving the principle of community rating, notwithstanding envisaged developments in genetics, was addressed in the memorandum. It was pointed out that genetic data might be used to predict the likelihood of disease-causing genetic variants in the population. At the time, genetic developments were becoming increasingly accurate, permitting insurance companies to take account of disorders not apparent when applications for insurance were made. This gave rise to concern that insurance companies may use genetic data to seek to reduce exposure to risk and consequently refuse insurance cover to those whose genetic disposition makes them likely to suffer from a serious condition in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union did not have a policy in this area in 1994. While a number of countries were considering their options, there was no common approach among member states to genetic testing and screening for insurance purposes. The 1994 memorandum advised that the general policy to be adopted regarding the use of results from genetic testing and screening should firstly be determined in relation to life assurance. It was considered prudent to copper-fasten the position in relation to health insurance by precluding insurers from using predictive diagnosis of health problems as a basis for varying premium levels. The memorandum to Government shows that those drafting the Health Insurance Act, 1994, had particular foresight in relation to genetics and other developments that might have enabled pre<Col N="465" /> dictive diagnosis and thereby affected premium levels. The preclusion of such practice in the 1994 Act is repeated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the 1994 Act was prepared by the parliamentary draftsman as a result of the requirement outlined in the memorandum. This Bill retains the safeguards included in the 1994 Act, including the general prohibition of non-community rated contracts, which is important, and the specific prohibition in section 2 relating to prospective suffering. I am satisfied that these safeguards satisfy the intentions of the amendment proposed by Senator Henry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come a long way since 1994. While we should not blindly follow other countries, many of them consider it significant that genetic testing be mentioned. Why bother mentioning age, sex and sexual orientation if everything is blanketly covered by the mention of community risk? This is an important amendment. Ireland is to the fore regarding biotechnology, but we are making no attempt to apply European conventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ahead of Europe on this matter. The memorandum to which I referred was written seven years ago and we should acknowledge the foresight of those who wrote it. I accept that the field of genetics was not as advanced in 1994, but much research was being conducted at the time. This Bill precludes any form of predictive diagnosis and thereby provides for future developments that may come on stream. Insurers would be in breach of primary legislation were they to attempt to preclude someone from an insurance contract on the basis of genetic testing, they would be breaking the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point, but I am not sure I agree we are far ahead as British legislation in this area was produced in 1990 and 1995. Why mention age, sex and sexual orientation in the Bill if everything is covered? We need to include the words &ldquo;genetic profile&rdquo; or &ldquo;genetic information&rdquo; in legislation, as it is an important area. If genetic profiling has become commonplace in ten years time and everyone has accepted its use in these matters, we will not worry. This amendment is very important to the insurance industry, as is this Bill. There has already been trouble in America. While the VHI is an Irish company, most companies dealing with life insurance operating here are British. A voluntary code of practice for insurance companies is used in the United Kingdom and I suppose it will apply here too, although I would like statutory legislation.</P>

A contract cannot, therefore, be refused. The other amendment to which I alluded relates to the phraseology of predictive diagnosis or any suffering from which people may suffer in the future. People might develop chronic conditions later in life and we want them to be covered.</P>

      <P>This has become a matter of semantics. I referred to the memorandum that led to the 1994 Act and it can clearly be seen that section 7 of that Act was specifically prepared by the parliamentary draftsman to accommodate concerns regarding genetic testing. The language used in the 1994 Act, as opposed to the words preferred by Senator Henry, was deliberately chosen to cover all eventualities in this and other fields that may lead to a person being denied health insurance because of predictive diagnosis. The decision made in 1994 should be acknowledged as the language used undoubtedly covers genetic testing.</P>

      <P>The amendments touch on the conditions under which risk equalisation will commence. It may be useful to the House if I outline my thoughts and proposals in this area. In the beginning the health insurance authority will carry out risk equalisation calculations on a notional basis. It is not intended to resort to actual financial transfers between insurers under risk equalisation unless there is a material level of distortion in the risk profiles of competing insurers which would threaten the operation of genuine community rating across the system.</P>
      <P>As regards the wide parameters to be set in regulations, it would first be a matter for the health insurance authority to decide when the degree of difference, as measured by the level of notional transfers, was such as to warrant the commencement of risk equalisation, having had regard to all other relevant considerations. We will set forward in the regulations parameters which will be extensive and on the basis of tests being applied in certain instances. The specific test to be applied in this instance will be whether potential payments under the system remain below a lower trigger point &ndash; we are looking at approximately 2%. Anything over that is the lower trigger point the health insurance authority would look at. If the potential payments lie between the lower trigger point and an upper trigger point, the payments on the risk equalisation will only commence if the authority makes a recommendation to that effect and that recommendation is accepted by the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> As regards potential payments under the system exceeding the upper trigger point, we suggest that approximately 10% is the upper trigger point, but that is subject to further discussions and reflections on submissions made on that approach. The 10% was included not to say to the health insurance authority it can only act then, but to say that if it does not act by that stage it is time for the Minister to get involved. If potential payments exceed the upper trigger point, risk equalisation will commence unless it appears to the Minister of the day, having consulted with the authority on the matter, that there are not any good reasons for doing so. They are the types of issues reflected in the risk equalisation scheme which will be part of the formal regulations and which must come back to this House, as I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>It is open to the health insurance authority to take into account whatever factors it considers relevant in exercising its crucial discretions in relation to the regulation of health insurance business in the overall best interests of the consumers of health insurance. However, its consideration of the process must include regard for the stability of community rating and the facilitation of competition. We have included that as the broad principles of stability of community rating and the facilitation of competition. The approach outlined would position risk equalisation as a genuine reserve power to be put into effect in circumstances where an independent body, the health insurance authority, determines that material distortion in the risk profiles of competing insurers represents a threat to the stability and maintenance of community rating. It further provides that it will be fair and proportionate as regards commencement and application.</P>
    <P>The amendments before us are far-reaching and ones we have opposed in the other House because they seek to severely limit the ability to have recourse to the use of risk equalisation as a necessary protection for community rating. They also seek to ensure that if ever risk equalisation is brought into effect, it will be so limited in its impact as to be of no avail to correct what would, by then, constitute major and established distortion in the community rated market. They fail to recognise that risk equalisation is an instrument of stability, not some panic measure. To return to my earlier point, there is no point in commencing risk equalisation when the system is collapsing. It is too late, and the amendments before us suggest that kind of belated intervention into the market when, to all intents and purposes, stability has collapsed.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation has to be an instrument of protection, a pre-emptive strike against the collapse of the market. There have been arguments as to whether our scheme is enough of a pre-emptive mechanism to prevent the collapse of the market, and representations have been received from one insurer on that basis. The other insurer is arguing it is too restrictive and punitive. I do <Col N="470" /> not accept that because we are committed to the person who is insured. That is our number one priority &ndash; the person who is taking out the insurance &ndash; and the solidarity between generations and community rating. That is the reason we are concerned about these amendments and are not in a position to accept them. No doubt we will have an opportunity to debate this issue again when it comes back to the House in the autumn.</P>

      <P>While I accept what the Minister said about the protection aspect of risk equalisation, the other side of the coin, which he referred to, is facilitating competition. That has been the controversial thrust of the Bill throughout. On the two amendments, we have to be fair to both sides. The Minister said the amendments suggest that risk equalisation only comes into the picture at a time when there is a little instability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, and that is extremely important because it is knit into many of the amendments that there would be a period for discussion when the regulations come back to the House and that they have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, but will there be a little more leeway in relation to the points made in this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the health insurance authority having discretion. The health insurance authority will have to get in the data. We do not yet have complete data from the insurance companies so we are not in a position to assess whether there is a distortion in the risk profiles of the competing insurers that would threaten the <Col N="471" /> stability of the market. That is the job of the health insurance authority. It has to examine the stability of the market, facilitate competition and then take decisions in the general interest of consumers. Those are the broad principles within which it operates. The regulations would also provide a specific framework within which it would operate in terms of the actual triggering of the mechanism, but in the framework we propose we are allowing sufficient flexibility.</P>
      <P>The health insurance authority will take in its data and will have certain flexibilities between percentage points as to when it actually triggers the mechanism, so it is far less restrictive than it was previously. We have come a long way in terms of refining the framework within which risk equalisation will operate, but our priority throughout all of this is community rating and stability in the marketplace. That is uppermost in our minds and I would be wary of creating a liberal, flexible regime that would be too wide and which would, in itself, contribute to instability in the marketplace. That is a serious concern because the community rating concept and solidarity between generations are important principles which those who have taken out health insurance for a long time would like to see supported and ring-fenced by any legislation we introduce.</P>

      <P>&mdash;we will deal with later relating to my decision to allow any new entrant into the marketplace a window for 36 months? The Senator tabled an amendment to reduce that period to 18 months, and we debated that in the other House. The purpose of extending the period to 36 months was to provide for competition. All Members of the House say they are in favour of competition and from our work and research &ndash; we are not infallible &ndash; the advice we have received and from talking to people who might be interested in coming in, they saw the window issue in terms of start-up, development costs and so on as a key factor in facilitating competition. Some people who might be interested in coming in did not see risk equalisation as a prohibitive factor in terms of participation in the market. It was articulated to us that they saw risk equalisation as a sensible, logical part of the process. Extending the window &ndash; risk equalisation does not kick in until three years after a new entrant comes into the marketplace &ndash; is probably a more significant factor to facilitate competition than anything we might do under risk equalisation.</P>

      <P>Yes. We have provided for that. I refer the Senator to section 33 of the principal Act which requires the authority to submit an annual report to the Minister who shall lay it before each House of the Oireachtas. This will ensure that the Minister and the Oireachtas are <Col N="473" /> advised of the authority's activities, excluding its functions, under the legislation.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that under section 32 of the principal Act, the authority's annual accounts must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The Act requires the Minister to lay the said annual accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports thereon before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the principal Act require the authority to operate to a high degree of accountability and transparency, as well as specifically ensuring the Oireachtas is kept informed of its activities. We have also provided elsewhere in the Bill that there will be an annual report on the operation of any risk equalisation mechanism.

      <P>We touched on the subject matter of this amendment a few moments ago. This amendment seeks to replace the 36 month period with an 18 month period. This issue was the subject of much discussion in the Dáil and the Minister has responded. I am surprised by the change as the White Paper proposed an 18 month timeframe for exemption from risk equalisation for new insurers and 36 months is a long time. Why has this change been made? The Minister attempted to explain the reason, but I would ask him to again outline the rationale behind the change in the timeframe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing situation was not doing the business in terms of facilitating competition. The White Paper proposed giving new entrants to the market the choice of an exemption from risk equalisation for a period of 18 months in recognition of the value which they can bring to consumers. Following the publication of the White Paper, departmental officials engaged in widespread consultations with interested parties <Col N="474" /> and the broad insurance industry and it became apparent that the general view was that the proposed window was not considered to be of sufficient duration to be attractive to potential market entrants. In other words, the 18 month window was not doing the business in terms of promoting further competition. This answers the Senator's question regarding whether I was surprised that there is no further competition. It is very much down to the issue of competition. There was a view that this measure needed to be improved upon if we were to provide sufficient attractions for people to consider entering the market. This measure is aimed at facilitating further competition in the market.</P>
      <P>There is a recognition that entering the market involves significant start-up costs. It must also be recognised that it takes time to build up a critical mass of numbers. Taking both issues into account, it is considered that the 36 month window is appropriate as it strikes a balance between entering and becoming established in the market, and protecting the principle of community rating.</P>
      <P>The provision of a 36 month window is a key move in the direction of creating the opportunity for more competition. This is the reason we introduced this measure in the Bill and I refuse to accept amendments which would bring us back to the 18 month window.</P>

The indications are that this issue is more significant than some of the Bill's provisions regarding risk equalisation. People are saying that there must be a generous entry period to allow insurers to become established in the market. The indications are that this issue is more significant than measures introduced regarding risk equalisation.

      <P>This amendment proposes that the Bill would not discriminate unfairly between registered undertakings, that it would promote competition in the provision of health insurance, and, most importantly, that it would protect the interests of consumers, having regard to the need to preserve community rating in the provision of health insurance for essential health care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We take a different view than the proposals contained in paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). This comes back to the philosophy underpinning the Bill. It is not the function or the overriding objective of the Bill to promote competition, but it will facilitate it. In other words, promoting competition is not superior to protecting community rating. In that sense, the amendment does not <Col N="476" /> take proper account of the delicate nature of community rating, its central role in the success of the voluntary health insurance system and the need for a balance between stability and competition. We struck a balance between them.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of a reference to promoting competition in the section could be interpreted as being a superior consideration to that of having regard to the need to preserve community rating. The amendment is wide-ranging in its applications and impacts as it covers the exercise of the Minister's and the authority's powers under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The protection of the rights of consumers is already provided for in the Bill in that the health insurance authority must give overall consideration to the best interests of consumers in the application and triggering of risk equalisation. We have been responsive regarding paragraph (<i>a</i>), but are opposed to paragraph (<i>b</i>) on principle. The provisions in paragraph (<i>c</i>) are covered in section 9(10)(<i>a</i>)(iii) which states, &ldquo;the best overall interests of health insurance consumers includes a reference to the need to maintain the application of community rating across the market for health insurance and to facilitate competition between undertakings&rdquo;.

      <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) negates paragraph (<i>b</i>). The problem we all face, however, is that if one promotes unbridled competition, the customer or patient will suffer. The best example is in the mobile phone sector where there are two major players and one small one coming in. The VHI and BUPA Ireland are dealing roughly with a market of one million people and they must provide the service. If one allows unbridled competition something will suffer, as in the American private health care system. In the end, the customer or patient is the one who will be let down as a result of this unbridled competition.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;unbridled&rdquo; is exaggerated because there are two health insurance companies operating in the country at present and I do not see that they would provide unbridled competition. I may be wrong but we have not seen any such evidence so far. The Minister of State said there were a few little tremors as to whether people will come into the market. After the passage of the Bill we will see whether it will promote more competition.

      <P>This amendment might be too late. Will the Minister indicate whether the nominees have been appointed?

      <P>I disagree with it in principle. There are hundreds of bodies &ndash; I am not talking about big State boards &ndash; to which we appoint people from the community. The idea that they <Col N="479" /> should come in for some cross-examination by an Oireachtas sub-committee is one of which I would not approve. Though I think the amendment was tabled for different reasons, the matter requires far deeper consideration. We have nominated the members of the health insurance authority and I can assure the Senator that the appointments were made pursuant to my powers under the principal Act of 1994. The process of constituting the authority commenced a considerable length of time before the announcement.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper, this process included consulting relevant independent bodies about the nomination of suitable persons to be considered for appointment to the authority. In that connection, nominations were put forward by the Society of Actuaries, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Irish Insurance Federation. I am grateful to these bodies for responding and for the subsequent agreement of persons nominated to accept the request to participate in the authority in a voluntary capacity, as a public service. Senators will appreciate how important such a culture of public service is to our system of Government and administration. The authority is currently going about its work of preparing to undertake the important independent functions it will fulfil under the legislation. The people we have appointed are of high calibre and represent a broad mix of experience. I am confident they have the capacity to discharge their responsibilities effectively and impartially in the interests of insured persons and the health insurance sector. I can also confirm that there is no Cork person on the health insurance authority. Perhaps that is one of the reasons the amendment was tabled.</P>

    <Title>Children Bill, 1999: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mór an onóir domsa an píosa mór dlí seo a chur os comhair an tSeanad and to open the debate on flagship legislation, the Children Bill, 1999. Not alone is it flagship legislation, it is also one of the most important and far reaching Bills to have been brought before the House in many years, because it is a blueprint for a new system of juvenile jus<Col N="481" /> tice and will charter its course for many years to come. The Bill will also affect the lives of many thousands of children and their parents and guardians in coming decades. My wish and belief are that it will affect their lives for the better.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill has been a long time in preparation but as evidenced by the broad approval the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received on its publication in autumn 1999, the wait was worthwhile and well justified. We have used the time wisely to bring a balanced, comprehensive, innovative and imaginative Bill to fruition. The time since publication has also been well used to prepare for the speedy implementation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to unduly take up the time of the Seanad to rehearse the many twists and turns in recent years that have eventually culminated in the Bill but it is fair to say that the Bill we are now debating is substantially different from that which has gone before. Its underlying philosophy is radically different, just as its provisions are the distillation of the accumulated wisdom and best practice worldwide in the area of juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>I readily acknowledge that the previous Bill, published in 1996, had some good features, which the Minister has incorporated into this Bill. Not for one minute do I doubt or question the commitment of those persons responsible for the publication of the 1996 Bill to overhaul our system of juvenile justice but the Minister believed passionately that our generation of public representatives had realistically only one shot at the type of fundamental overhaul of the system in mind. That is the reason I engaged in a deep analysis prior to producing this radically different and innovative Bill.</P>
      <P>My clear focus was to produce enlightened, enduring and forward thinking legislation. In that respect, it was imperative that during this Government the opportunity be used to get it right. In this Bill we have realised that goal.</P>
      <P>For the reasons outlined, a thorough reappraisal of the 1996 Bill was ordered, with the emphasis on introducing into our law, where appropriate, the most up-to-date and sophisticated measures for dealing with juvenile justice and associated child welfare and which took into account best international practice. The aim was also to get the Bill to deal more progressively with parental responsibility and identify and correct the structural weaknesses in the way services are provided for young offenders and disturbed non-offending children. The Minister was also unhappy with the way in which the age of criminal responsibility had been dealt with in the 1996 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first it appeared that we might be able to amend the 1996 Bill but examination of the Bill and a contemporaneous study of recent advances in dealing with juvenile crime identified the need for so many changes that the Government agreed to prepare a totally new Bill. Had we stayed with the existing Bill we would have ended up with somewhere in the region of 400 amendments and <Col N="482" /> that does not include the many other drafting and presentational changes that while not essential were highly desirable. Senators will agree with me when I say that while we gave it every chance, in the circumstances the 1996 Bill could not realistically be saved.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1999, covers four main areas of the law. First and predominantly, it provides a modern statutory framework for the further development of the juvenile justice system. Second, it provides for family welfare conferences and other new provisions for dealing with non-offending children who are out of control. Third, it re-enacts and updates provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have custody, charge or care of them. Finally, it provides for a Special Residential Services Board to advise the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children on policy matters relating to the remand and detention of children and to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders have been made.</P>
    <P>The starting point for this Bill was the Children Act, 1908. That Act was the basis for the establishment and development of a juvenile justice system that has, despite its many weaknesses, served this country quite well throughout the greater part of the 20th century. However, it is clear that further development of the system would have been impossible without a new statutory framework to underpin it. That is essentially the purpose of the juvenile justice provisions of the Bill. When the Bill becomes law, our juvenile justice system will have the capacity to continue developing within the statutory parameters of the most up-to-date thinking internationally on how to prevent juvenile offending and further offending by juveniles who have already committed an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister was well aware when preparing the legislation of mistakes made over many years by other countries when revising their juvenile justice systems. Probably the main error, continually repeated, was to devise systems based exclusively on a particular approach to the problem of juvenile offending. In practical terms this meant that the system in vogue was all important. A young offender could only be dealt with within the narrow confines of the system in favour at a particular time, no matter what he or she had done and regardless of his or her needs. Senators will notice that I am proposing in the Bill to supplement rather than supplant the provisions on which the present system is based, apart from the obviously archaic or unacceptable. It is essential in legislation such as this not to close off avenues for dealing with young offenders. At the same time policy should not be dictated by hard cases. That approach has underpinned the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will outline the major policy areas of the Bill rather than go through it in a sequential manner. It would not be practical to attempt to deal in <Col N="483" /> detail with every provision in the Bill in a Second Stage speech. An unusual feature of the Bill is that many of its constituent parts are supported by a set of principles or objectives. The importance of this feature should not be underestimated and will become more apparent when the Bill is enacted and implemented. Thus, Part IV, which places the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis, is supported by a new principle that obliges the Garda to consider for admission to the programme children who have accepted responsibility for their criminal behaviour. That obligation is subject to the interests of society and Part IV of the Bill. Part VI, which deals with the treatment of child suspects, obliges the Garda to have due regard to the dignity of children as human persons and their vulnerability owing to their age and level of maturity. Part IX establishes the rights of children before the courts charged with criminal offences. These include an important new right which was not in the 1996 Bill, that is, the principle that criminal proceedings will not be used solely to provide any assistance or services needed to care for or protect a child. Part IX also includes a comprehensive list of principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children. These have been strengthened since they first appeared in the 1996 Bill.</P>
    <P>Part X establishes the principal object of children detention schools. These are the schools which will provide for the detention of children aged from 12 to 15 years, inclusive, who have been found guilty of offences and in respect of whom the courts deem no option other than detention is appropriate. It emphasises the role of the schools in promoting the reintegration of the children referred to them back into society. This will be done mainly through the provision of appropriate educational and training programmes and facilities.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill that has probably attracted most comment is the one that proposes to raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven years to 12 years. This represents a radical departure from previous policy on how young children whose actions would, but for their ages, constitute offences should be dealt with. It means that children under the age of 12 years will no longer have the capacity to commit offences. The question of raising the age to 12 years was one that exercised minds for some time but the decision was based on the belief that as a society we should not criminalise children under 12 years of age; that the alternative policy for intervening with such children, that is, by the health boards, often in concert with other agencies, was credible; and that health board personnel would deal with these children in their usual professional manner.</P>
    <P>We were also concerned that of the relatively small number of children under 12 years of age who appear in court on criminal charges, some may have been criminalised for the wrong reason, however well meant. There may have been a <Col N="484" /> temptation to bring charges for the sole purpose of ensuring that the child received care and protection in an institutional setting. That cannot happen under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is relevant that 12 years was the age recommended by the former Dáil Select Committee on Crime in its first report, and that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child criticised us in the context of the proposal in the 1996 Bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 10 years. The Minister was unhappy, and said so in his contribution on the 1996 Bill, with the proposal to raise the age to 10 years, and to provide for its eventual raising to 12 years by regulations following reviews at regular intervals. The Minister argued then, and repeats it now, that this was far too important an issue to be left to regulations. It is an area where we have to make up our minds and act decisively. That is why we have now raised the age of criminal responsibility from seven years to 12 years.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Bill dipped its toes into the area of restorative justice. Admittedly, at the time the 1996 Bill was being prepared, restorative justice was a relatively new concept and few studies had been done on its efficacy. It seemed to be a concept that had real possibilities and the officials thoroughly researched how restorative justice provisions were operating in other jurisdictions. The outcome was encouraging and the result can now be seen in this Bill. I emphasise that the restorative provisions are additional features to be used only in appropriate cases. They are not mandatory.</P>
    <P>The decision to place the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis has been retained but the family conference which was to have been an integral part of that programme has been greatly expanded, so that it now incorporates within its parameters the modern restorative justice measures to which I have just referred. The primary focus of the conference will be on issues of accountability rather than welfare. It will be convened by the Garda Síochána and will formulate an action plan for the child in respect of whom it has been convened. The action plan may include provision for many matters, including the making of an apology or financial or other reparation to the victim. It can also include provisions relating to the child's lifestyle such as his or her attendance at school or participation in appropriate sporting or recreational activities. In practical terms, the range of possibilities is almost limitless, as long as they are agreed to by the persons present at the conference. The action plan is no easy option but it does have the advantage of involving the child and his or her family in the decision-making process and being a party to the decision. This will increase the likelihood of co-operation and compliance.</P>
    <P>The victim of the child offending may be invited to attend the conference and, if the victim does attend, the child will be confronted by the consequences of his or her criminal behaviour. Experience abroad suggests that the victim usu<Col N="485" /> ally welcomes the opportunity of being present at the conference, and that is borne out in the pilot schemes being operated by gardaí in preparation for the implementation of this legislation. Some victims will stress the value of expressing their feelings to the young offender and ensuring that the offender learns from the experience. Other victims will want to contribute to the offender's rehabilitation or to show their support for the process. Yet other victims will emphasise their own interests; they may want to make sure that things are done properly and to get reparation. They are all understandable and valid reactions.</P>
    <P>To underline the seriousness with which the action plan must be taken, it will be in the form of a contract. The facilitator for the Garda-convened conference will always be a member of the Garda Síochána, usually a juvenile liaison officer or a community garda. However, in a new approach in the Bill to conferencing, it will be possible in appropriate circumstances for the chairperson of the conference to be somebody other than a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Another innovation is a provision which will allow the victim to be present at the administration by the Garda Síochána of a formal caution. This is known as restorative cautioning and will be a suitable mini-conference type response in circumstances where a full conference is not warranted. It means that the child offender can be confronted with the consequences of his or her offending and be invited to apologise or make some form of reparation to the victim in a low key atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Children Court is also being given a totally new role in implementing the restorative justice provisions in the Bill. The court will have the power to adjourn appropriate cases and direct the probation and welfare service to convene family conferences as an alternative at that point to proceeding to a finding. An action plan formulated by the family conference will remain under court supervision and, for that reason, will be enforceable. The court will, on the resumption of the case following completion of the plan, have the discretion to decide whether or not to proceed to a finding. Compliance by the child with the terms of the action plan will obviously be an important factor in the court's decision.</P>
    <P>To sum up on conferencing, children tend to be more open emotionally than adults, more quickly prepared to say sorry and mean it and less likely to stand on ceremony &ndash; attributes that make children particularly amenable to conferencing. It is also a particularly suitable way of dealing with the irritating anti-social behaviour exhibited by some young persons and this is borne out in the pilot schemes. Of course, conferencing is a way of ensuring that the interests of victims are not overlooked in situations where they might otherwise be on the sidelines.</P>
    <P>The court will also have the power to adjourn cases where it considers that a child's real problem is a need of care or protection, even though the child is before the court on a criminal charge. <Col N="486" /> In such cases the relevant health board will be directed by the court to convene a family welfare conference in respect of the child. The health board will have to report back to the court on what action, if any, it intends to take. For example, it may apply for a care order, a supervision order or a special care order for the child or inform the court of any services or assistance which it intends to provide for the child and his or her family. As with the provision for family conferencing, the court will have the discretion as to whether it should proceed to a finding.</P>
    <P>The new powers I have outlined will enable the court to deal with children before it on criminal charges without proceeding to a finding, and where the finding would have been one of guilt the consequences of that will be avoided. Where the court does proceed to a finding of guilt, it is being given an array of imaginative new community sanctions which it may impose. Of the ten community sanctions provided in the Bill, eight are new. It is unnecessary at this stage to give details of those sanctions other than to say that their purpose is to ensure an appropriate and suitable sanction for each child whatever the child's needs or misdeeds. These sanctions are of the utmost importance in that they give tangible effect to the principle in the Bill that detention will be an option of absolute last resort.</P>
    <P>We all know that many parents of difficult and out-of-control children are devastated and often bewildered by their children's anti-social behaviour. They do their best as parents, however inadequate that might be in some cases. However, I think most people are also aware that some parents have a totally irresponsible attitude towards controlling their children. Effectively, they opt out of their responsibilities, sometimes to indulge their own ill-disciplined lifestyles.</P>
    <P>The Bill has three provisions dealing specifically with that type of parent. The parents can be bound over to exercise proper and adequate control over their child, where that child has been found guilty of an offence. The parents can be ordered to pay compensation. Before making a compensation order the court must be satisfied of the parents' ability to pay and that there was a wilful failure on the part of the parents to take care of or to control the child that contributed to the child's criminal behaviour.</P>
    <P>The third and new provision is one under which the court can make a parental supervision order. As with the compensation order, this order can only be imposed on parents where their child is found guilty of an offence and where the court is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour. This order provides the court with a carrot and stick option for dealing with such parents. For example, if the court is of the opinion that parents lack the necessary skills to properly look after their child, it can order them to undergo a parenting skills course. Similarly, if the problem is one of substance abuse, the court can order the parents to seek <Col N="487" /> treatment for that abuse. As with all the other orders and powers of the court in the Bill, this order will not be suitable in all circumstances. It might be a suitable response in a relatively small number of cases, that remains to be seen, however, it is very important to give the courts power to deal with whatever situation with which they are confronted.</P>
    <P>In formulating the policy on which the Bill is based, a fair balance had to be struck between the needs and interests of the child offender with the protection of the community and what is good generally for society. I have spoken of victims in the context of the conference. Their position is highlighted and protected throughout the Bill. The principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children specifically protect the interests of victims of child offending and the Garda convened conference and the family conference, which will be convened by the probation and welfare service, will be obliged to uphold the concerns of the victim and to have due regard to his or her rights.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in more detail with the three Parts of the Bill which specifically relate to the child welfare and protection area. The first of these is Part 2, which establishes on a statutory basis the family welfare conference which will enable health boards to intervene with other agencies at an early stage in relation to children who need special care and protection as defined in the Bill. The second area is Part 3, which amends the Child Care Act, 1991, to impose a duty on health boards to apply for a special care order or an interim special care order in relation to a child residing or found in its area who is in need of special care and protection, which he or she is not likely to receive unless the court grants such an order. The third area is Part 11, which provides for the establishment of a special residential services board. This board will co-ordinate residential services for children detained in detention schools and special care units and will also have a role in individual applications for special care orders and the placement of children in children detention schools.</P>
    <P>A major innovation in the Bill is the establishment of family welfare conferences on a statutory basis to deal with children who have been charged with an offence and where their case has been referred to the health boards by the courts and children who are the subject of applications for special care orders. The objective of the family welfare conference is to maximise the use of a child's social and family support networks at a time of crisis in their lives. The concept has been established successfully in a number of countries. In this country, the East Coast Area Health Board has been operating a pilot project which is being evaluated. An interim evaluation has been produced which indicates that the concept can be successfully applied here. In anticipation of the enactment of this Bill and its implementation, the Department of Health and Children allocated <Col N="488" /> £3.5 million to the health boards in this year's letters of net determination to the boards, with instructions to them to introduce family welfare conferences on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The principles underlying the conferences are that: the child's interests are paramount and that in so far as is possible the child is best looked after within its own family; the vast majority of families will make safe plans for children; the co-ordinator responsible for the conference will be independent; there will be private family time for planning; and family plans will be accepted unless they put the children at risk. Research has demonstrated that the family conference process is much more successful in encouraging the participation of family members than the existing care planning processes. It is seen by families and professionals as empowering families to come to their own solutions in co-operation with the professionals. I, therefore, believe that this is a very important innovation in the area of family welfare and child protection.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill amends the Child Care Act, 1991, and imposes a duty on health boards to seek a special care order or an interim special care order in relation to any child in its area whose behaviour is such that it poses a real and substantial risk to their health, safety, development or welfare and requires special care and protection, which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the court makes such an order. This provides an additional range of powers for boards to intervene to ensure that non-offending children with behavioural problems receive proper care, protection and education.</P>
    <P>The High Court has held that the 1991 Act does not empower a health board to detain a child. It also held that the State is under a constitutional duty to provide suitable secure accommodation for children who need to be detained for their safety and welfare. A small number of children require this type of secure accommodation because their behavioural difficulties are such that they cannot be catered for in the general residential care system. Under this Part of the Bill, the boards will have responsibility for ensuring the provision and operation of appropriate services and facilities, including special care units, for children who need to be detained in their own interests.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Bill is drafted in such a way as to make clear that a child would, except in emergencies, only be detained in such a unit as a last resort. It is a very serious decision to detain a child and the philosophy of the Bill is that the application for a special care order and the detention of children in special care units should only be used as a last resort when all other options have been explored and found not to be feasible. For that reason the Government has built a number of checks and balances into the system to ensure that this will be the case. A health board before applying for an order must first arrange for the convening of a family welfare conference. When the conference has completed <Col N="489" /> its deliberations, if it is still proposed to apply for a special care order, the views of the special residential services board, which will be established under Part 11, must be sought. Where a health board is seeking an interim care order it must be about to arrange a family welfare conference, or a conference must be in place or the board must be in the process of seeking the views of the special residential services board.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that boards can make alternative arrangements or provide other accommodation for a child who is the subject of such a special care order, as part of the programme for the care, education and treatment of that child. This is fully in line with the philosophy underpinning our child care services which emphasise the need to provide a continuum of services for such children, from family support services to special fostering arrangements to residential care.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the implementation of this Part of the Bill, the Government has launched a number of initiatives to tackle the problems of children at risk and those with behavioural difficulties. This year, the Government allocated a further £33 million in revenue for the further development of these services. That means that over £90 million extra has been provided during its term of office. The Department of Health and Children has approved the development of an additional 110 high support-special care places. Approximately half of these have been provided. Included in this figure are the places provided at the purpose-built special care unit in Ballydowd. It is anticipated that over the next 12 months most of the rest of the places will come on stream, bringing the total number of places to 160. Significant progress has been made in meeting these targets, despite the many difficulties such as objections to planning permission, problems recruiting staff due to the current economic climate and opposition from local communities.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to tackling the problems of children in need of special care and protection is demonstrated by the launch of the Springboard initiative. This initiative has established 17 pilot projects across the country, the object of which is to prevent at-risk children and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a proactive, interagency response to support these young people and their families. There are two key elements to this approach. The first element is the establishment of formal collaborative structures involving relevant State agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community. The second key element is the identification or establishment of a local centre which will act as a focal point for the delivery of services to young people and children. The centres will be a resource for parents and children. These projects will provide a model for helping families with multiple problems and the wider communities living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Another major innovation in the Bill is the establishment of the special residential services <Col N="490" /> board. The board is designed to ensure the efficient, effective and co-ordinated delivery of services for children placed in special care units under Part 3 of the Bill or placed in detention schools under Part 10. Non-offending children with behavioural difficulties who are the subject of special care orders and child offenders will be kept in separate residential accommodation. However, it is acknowledged that they regularly present with similar problems, require similar care and treatment and benefit from similar types of services.</P>
    <P>The board will have a wide remit in the co-ordination of such services, ensuring their appropriate use, liaising with the courts on the level and nature of these services and advising the Minister on any adjustments in the provision of accommodation or services for young offenders or children with behavioural difficulties. The board will also have a function in research and evaluation relating to the detention of children. I am convinced the board will enable services to be delivered in a more co-ordinated manner. It will also have a role as part of the checks and balances I mentioned in giving its views on any proposal to seek a special care order and assisting the courts in identifying suitable places in children detention schools for children found guilty of offences. I established the Special Residential Services Board on an interim basis this time last year in anticipation of bringing into operation Part 11. Its views and expertise have already influenced some of the progress of the Bill through the other House.</P>
    <P>Part 10 establishes children detention schools which will be under the aegis of the Minister for Education and Science. These schools will provide for the detention of children aged between 12 and 15 years, inclusive, who have been found guilty of offences and in respect of whom no option other than detention is deemed appropriate. It emphasises the role of the schools in promoting the reintegration of the children referred to them back into society. This will be done through the provision of appropriate educational and training programmes and suitable facilities in which to deliver these programmes.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is founded on the principle that the imposition of a custodial sentence should be a matter of last resort, it recognises the reality that there will continue to be a need for custodial centres to accommodate the most serious cases. The Department of Education and Science is embarking on a major development programme to enable it to meet its obligations under the Bill and also to address deficiencies and weaknesses in the existing facilities. These plans, when completed, will fully equip children detention schools to meet their obligations under the Bill, including the obligation to provide for the most unruly or depraved children who, heretofore, would have been transferred to the adult prison system and also those children convicted of offences who have serious therapeutic needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Part 12 updates the child protection provisions of the 1908 Act, thus allowing that Act to be repealed in total. An important addition to this Part arises from my acceptance of a recommendation of the then Select Committee on Social Affairs in its 1997 report on non-fatal offences against the person in respect of children. The effect of the change is that the meaning of a child's well-being in the section on cruelty is expanded to include mental and emotional well-being, and the expression &ldquo;ill-treat&rdquo; will include frightening, bullying or threatening a child. The legislation will give a clear message that cruelty can mean more than physical cruelty or neglect.</P>
    <P>This is a balanced and comprehensive Bill. It balances the needs, rights and interests of the child offender, the vulnerable child, families and communities, the victim and society generally. From the beginning of the preparation of the Bill and its predecessor there has been a high level of co-operation between officials from the three Departments concerned. The results of that co-operation are clearly seen throughout the Bill. That co-operation continues as preparation is made for the full implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I started out by emphasising the historic nature of the Bill. It provides a new way for dealing with juvenile offending without, at the same time, discarding procedures and policies that have been seen to work. There is something in it for all young offenders, regardless of age, needs or the type of offence they commit. It will also have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable children and their families and develop further the legislative framework for the development of services for these children and their families, enabling them to break out of the cycle of disadvantage and become fully included with the rest of society. Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. The Bill is comprehensive and extensive work has undoubtedly been done in the Department to get it to this stage. There are a number of concerns, however, one of which is that there is no commencement date. Other than the Minister of State establishing the Special Residential Services Board, nothing has happened to suggest the provisions of the Bill must be enacted within a specific timeframe. The Minister of State might, before the Bill is passed by the House, ensure a time is specified. As it stands, it is conceivable the Bill might not be enacted until 2010 or beyond. The House needs to be assured by the Minister of State on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal in a wide-ranging manner with issues which have been current for some years. As the Minister of State said, the legislation of 1908 is out of date and has been amended on various occasions to bring it into line and make it capable of dealing with situations which arise in modern Ireland. While I know she did not mean it, I inferred from her speech that <Col N="492" /> the children in question are separate from us as a society, whereas they are part of what we are and we have created them. That is the unfortunate reality, and we have a responsibility to deal with them humanely and sympathetically. They may be disruptive but it is for specific reasons and because of specific circumstances. Ireland has changed in the past 30 years. It has moved from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population.</P>
    <P>A number of Departments have responsibility for this area, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government and, by extension, local authorities in the area of planning, which is a major contributory factor to the advent of these problems. Large public housing estates often do not have green areas or facilities. Many disruptive children come from such estates which are deprived areas within towns and cities. Nothing is being done by the Department or local authorities in their various county development plans to address this, despite it being fundamental to the origins of many of these problems.</P>
    <P>Wonderful improvements have been made to facilities in schools in terms of resource and remedial teachers, and it has also been recognised that many children suffer from attention deficit disorder, although that is only a recent recognition. The disorder makes children disruptive and creates difficulties in classrooms and society in general.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with disruptive children in society by putting in place a legal framework to address their behaviour. Within that legal framework are facilities for family conferences and children detention centres. While I welcome these centres which are commendable, I am concerned about the need for trained personnel to service them. The level of aspiration in the Bill is commendable. It aspires to establishing secure units within health board areas and special schools under the remits of the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While this is our formula for action, there is a difficulty in that we do not have sufficient trained personnel in the respective Departments to enforce the various provisions of the Bill. The Minister of State must address that problem.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having these aspirations when we do not have the trained personnel to deal with problems which arise. We are especially short of psychologists and people who will spend time <i>in loco parentis</i> in the detention schools and have a facility and training to deal with these children. These people are required. Where and how does the Minister of State propose to recruit them? Are preparations being made to provide training in this area or are people being recruited? What will happen? This is a fundamental issue which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the Garda Síochána whose members are the first people to deal with the problem on the ground. Many welfare officers and members of the Garda Síochána must be <Col N="493" /> commended for the good work they do. Some of them take on a particular role in regard to individuals within particular towns. In many cases they work above and beyond the call of duty in the interests of humanity, for which they must be commended.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a Bill from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which means it is very legalistic and court orientated. I am very uneasy talking about courts and children because I do not think they fit well together. While I commend the Minister of State for raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12, it should be 14. The barometer under which assessment is carried out in regard to criminal responsibility is basically the child's ability to decide the difference between right and wrong, which is a fairly basic analysis. There are many other circumstances which will force a child into a particular line of action, despite knowing the right or wrong of the situation. This is much too simplistic an assessment of a child's mental capacity <i>vis-à-vis</i> criminal responsibility. While I am aware the courts could be asked to deem a person not of criminal age because of their state of mind or mental incapacity, I would appreciate if the Minister of State would consider raising the age to 14.</P>
    <P>This issue needs to be addressed because once a child of that age is referred to the court, one is automatically tarnishing, targeting or identifying the child in a very particular category. From there on, no matter what one does with a child, the fact that he or she has been before the court at such a tender age will do unlimited, if not irreversible, damage. Despite the proposed subsequent support and attention from the Department of Education and Science and the health board, there will still be an underlying problem to address which may be difficult to reverse. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider that aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Family conferences, the details of which are outlined in the Bill, are a welcome development. I am pleased the Garda and health boards will be enabled to call a family conference if deemed necessary in the interests of the child. This provision, including the circumstances under which it can take place, are extremely commendable. However, there is one oversight, that is, that the onus rests within the health board or that, following a court order, the Garda can call a family conference or, indeed, an informal type of conference. Unfortunately, parents cannot call a conference, which is a deficiency in the Bill. Many of the cases that have recently gone to court have been brought by parents who found a deficiency in the system whereby they were unable to deal with a child who was out of order. These parents pursued the law to get a service for their children. The Bill does not appear to enable parents to instigate a conference. The Minister of State should consider that issue which has arisen in regard to a number of recent court cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> On detention schools, the Minister of State said the matter would be the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science which would put in place people with the necessary skills to ensure children are provided with proper welfare services. Will she elaborate in greater detail on the type of services that will be provided in these detention schools and whether the normal type of educational programmes that currently exist in the classroom will be provided? Will the junior certificate be conducted because the schools will facilitate 12 to 15 year olds? Given that the main reason for holding these children in detention schools is to address their particular difficulties, what additional personnel, other than educational personnel, will be in those detention centres to meet those children, talk to them individually, assess them and try to reorientate them and bring them back into society and their communities where they can have a normal life and a normal standard of living?</P>
    <P>That will be a huge task and there will be a huge onus on these people who will get young people at a very vulnerable and impressionable age and who will have either the making or breaking of them. The people involved will be vital to the future of these children, therefore, it is important that those with the most expertise are involved in the schools. I hope the Minister of State will elaborate in greater detail on what the Department of Education and Science intends to do in regard to that specific area. Much of what has been said here appears to be aspirational and, while I commend and support it, I am concerned about the practical realities of it.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a deficiency in the section dealing with proceedings in the children's court which appears to be more procedural than welfare orientated. This is a procedural section which does not seem to impact on the rights, needs, wishes or circumstances of the child. The entire section in Part 8 needs to have a more human face because it seems very legalistic, remote and removed from the situation of the child. I hope the Minister of State will look at that section and take a softer angle, so to speak.</P>
    <P>On Garda Síochána involvement, it is an important aspect that it does not have to go down the route of proceedings but can call a family conference. This attempts to take care of the particular difficulties in that scenario. The Minister of State referred to involving the family. We are all aware that the best place for a child is to remain within the family and community surroundings. However, she will be aware that the reason children end up in these circumstances is lack of family support and supervision. The parents of these children are themselves the products of families which lacked family supervision and support. What we see is one generation begetting another generation, which not just increases the problem but exacerbates it from one generation to the next. There is a fundamental problem whereby particular families do not have the capacity or ability to deal with basic issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> The Minister of State referred to sending parents on parenting courses. Given some of the parents I know, that proposal would be a total waste of time and is not a realistic option. While it is a desirable intention, it would not work for many of the people concerned. A more practical and realistic approach should be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House and add my congratulations and support for this important legislation.</P>
      <P>I look on this Bill as one of the landmark pieces of legislation over the last 30 years or more. I would equate it with, perhaps, the Companies Act, 1963, which was innovative at the time and also with the Succession Act, 1967, a major reforming Act which stuck out in our minds when studying law. I would include this Bill in that tranche of landmark legislation that is innovative, forward looking and reforming. It is a sort of renaissance as far as juvenile justice is concerned. In that regard the Bill must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the previous Government introduced a Bill. Since then both that Government and Deputies O'Donoghue and Hanafin have done a lot of work in improving the initial Bill and inserting new sections which give it a new complexion. Everybody in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, particularly those involved with this Bill, deserves congratulations on the efforts on this mammoth legislation.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to the Bill. The age of criminal responsibility, which under the 1908 Act was seven years, and which possibly had a moral or religious connotation related to making First Holy Communion at the age of seven, has been raised to 12 years of age. That is an important step. It recognises that, once the Bill is enacted, a child under the age of 12 cannot be guilty of committing a crime. Some would argue, as Senator Taylor-Quinn did, that maybe it should be 14 years. It is very difficult to get a happy medium.</P>
      <P>The Minister has looked at other jurisdictions and the role model for this type of legislation can be seen in places like Australia and New Zealand. The Minister, the Department and officials have looked at what happens there and, having taken everything into account, they have fixed on the age of 12 years. That seems sensible and should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I will not go through the various sections of the Bill which number 271 &ndash;  it is frighteningly large &ndash; but will confine my remarks to a number of important areas. It provides for special care orders. This means that the health board must convene a family conference before applying to the court for the order. The Minister touched on this. The 1991 Child Care Act was found by the High Court to be inadequate in so far as it ruled that the health boards had no right to detain a child. In this regard the special care order is a step forward and must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The court has power to make a special care order if it is satisfied on a number of issues. The child's behaviour must pose a real and substantial risk to his or her health. In this regard this Bill is children friendly and is designed to create a sort of safety net for children. The court can make an order also where a child needs special care and protection which he or she is unlikely to get without such an order. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>There is also the provision for the setting up of special care units. The health boards will be empowered to provide and maintain special care units or make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide and operate them. Here we see the cross co-operation between the various Ministries involved with justice, health and education. The special care units are to be welcomed. In 1977 there were 17 places available. There are now approximately 85 or 86 and it is hoped that by the end of next year there will be 160 safe places of detention. This is very important. Comments made by a number of High Court judges criticised the Government and the Department on the inadequacy and deficit in this area. That is now being addressed. I welcome the Minister's statement that funding is being provided for such care units.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the family welfare conferences is a very welcome new approach. I laud the Minister and her senior counterpart, the Minister for Justisce, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on this approach. A family welfare conference is a mechanism for early intervention in respect of children who are at risk or problematic children. This innovation is a breath of fresh air. Here if possible we get the parents involved, even if separated. They sit with the child, possibly with the assistance of a probation officer, to see how they can help this child. By child we mean someone, as defined in the Act, between the ages of 12 and 18 years. The family conference will examine the problem to see what can be done to sort it out. The health board will appoint a co-ordinator who will generally share in such a conference.</P>
    <P>The family welfare conference should not be confused with the Garda conference. Perhaps the Minister will be able to elaborate on this but my understanding is that the Garda conference will only come into force when something a child has done is brought to the attention of a junior liaison officer or a garda. The child may have committed a crime, be about to commit a crime or be under observation by the Garda. Both types of conference are critically important.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect is that conference decisions must be unanimous. Perhaps the Minister will indicate in her reply what the situation is in a case where there may be seven people in the room and six to one in favour of a particular approach. Would that mean the conference had failed or would have to be reconvened? I may have misunderstood this but it does specify a unanimous decision. In the case of separated par<Col N="497" /> ents the husband and wife might decide to go different ways on an issue. I would like some clarification on that. The child must attend these conferences and that too is important. This involves a direct approach by those who have or should have responsibility for the care and upbringing of the child.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect of the Bill is the welcome introduction of a diversion programme where children have committed an offence. This is another innovation as far as juvenile justice is concerned. Under the diversion programme the child will not be prosecuted for the offence which led to admission to the programme. In other words, if a child has committed or is about to commit a crime or has done something stupid at a tender age between 12 and 18 years, this system makes every effort possible to keep the child out of court. It diverts the child from our frightening and sometimes archaic adult system of justice.</P>
    <P>The diversion programme will obviously involve junior liaison officers and community gardaí. They play an important role. Having worked with the legal system for over 20 years, my experience is that the Garda must be lauded for their efforts on the ground in helping out in difficult situations. They take a practical approach to the delicate matter of children committing crimes and this Bill will strengthen their hand.</P>
    <P>There was a time when a child who stole a penny bar was technically deemed to have committed larceny and it was felt that one might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb, but this Bill shows we have moved from such an unfair brand of justice. The Bill provides for a formal or informal caution to be administered in a Garda station or in the child's home in the presence of the child's parents. The child and his or her parents will be told that the child's actions were not appropriate and that future behaviour will be observed. This form of justice should work very well.</P>
    <P>The supervision of children is also important. Senator Quinn mentioned the notion of rehabilitation through giving advice to parents, which is a good idea. While certain parents may be a lost cause because of alcohol or drug abuse, there are important things to be learnt by others. The Bill allows for a conference where the child apologises to the victim of his or her crime. This is important and although it will not be effective in certain cases, it might work wonders. Many children who are made to apologise contritely to the victim of their crime will not re-offend as their eyes will have been opened to the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>I do not fully understand the idea of a child between 12 and 18 making financial reparations to victims and perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the matter for me. Most children of that age do not have a job and therefore have no income unless they receive pocket money from their parents. In many instances such children will come from socially deprived areas and neither <Col N="498" /> they nor their parents will have money. I would like this feature of the Bill to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Participation by young people in appropriate sporting or recreational activity, training or education is of huge importance. In many cases, children step out of line because they are not involved in sport or have opted out of school. It is positive for a young person to be involved in athletics, football, swimming, basketball or any other sport and this Bill enables them to do so. Young people will be encouraged to get involved with a sports club or go back to school, which is a fresh and appropriate approach. This is important for those of us who are parents, as many of us intentionally or unintentionally neglect our children. The Bill makes provision for a curfew system which will work wonders, whereby certain children must be at home at specified times and stay away from specified places or people. A juvenile liaison officer or a probation officer will speak to the parents of a child who is going to unsuitable places or mixing with inappropriate people and direct them to ensure such behaviour does not continue. It is an important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Children Court has been successful and huge strides have been made. It is important to recognise that this Bill broadens the remit of the court and makes it more user-friendly and child-friendly. This legislation means that if a court remands in custody a child under the age of 16, he or she must be sent to a junior remand centre. Those between 16 and 18 may be remanded to an institution specified by the court. Section 89(5) allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Education and Science, to &ldquo;designate as a junior remand centre any place, including part of a children detention school, which in his or her opinion is suitable for the custody of children&rdquo;. If the remand centre is part of a children detention school, those on remand must be kept apart from those in detention. The approach to this important issue was more eloquently and delicately elaborated on by the Minister of State earlier. Attendance at the Children Court by a parent or guardian of the child is compulsory, which I welcome. If a young person commits or attempts to commit a crime, parents should be involved in all stages of the process of justice.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this user-friendly Bill is that it ensures that every other penalty will be contemplated before prison is considered. The Bill empowers the court to reprimand a child or make a number of different orders, including a conditional discharge order, an order that a child pay a fine or costs, an order that a parent or guardian be bound to the peace, an order of compensation, a parental supervision order, an order that compensation be paid by a parent or guardian on behalf of a child and an order imposing a community sanction.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, the Bill does everything possible to protect vulnerable children and to give them a fair crack of the whip. Instead <Col N="499" /> of taking the easy option of locking them up and throwing away the key, society will now take a sensitive and humane approach. I welcome and commend the Bill to the House and wish it a safe passage. As a final point, I ask the Minister of State to respond in her reply to Senator Taylor-Quinn's request that this Bill not be allowed to remain on the shelf for very long. I hope it will be enacted within the next few weeks rather than the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and her Bill to the House. It is an enormous improvement on existing legislation and it must have taken a great deal of work to get it to its current state. It shows dramatic changes from the Bill originally envisaged and it has been improved. I applaud the Minister of State for listening to the concerned groups who contacted her, as they had the best interests of children at heart. The progress of this Bill shows that if reasonable and properly considered representations are made with the right motives, legislation can be changed. It is helpful for me to be able to make that point to people.</P>
      <P>Looking at this Bill, I think of the appalling section of the Mental Health Bill, 1999, dealing with children, which went through the House yesterday having passed Committee Stage last week. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, deserved his luck yesterday when my aeroplane back from a meeting in Brussels was delayed, meaning that last Wednesday was the only day of my ire he had to tolerate.</P>
      <P>I presume the special care orders that can be made to safeguard the health of a child can be made regarding both mental and physical health. It might be wiser if this Bill, rather than the Mental Health Bill, were used in relation to the care of mentally ill children. I take particular exception to the lack of specific criteria in the latter Bill regarding the approved centres to which children can be sent. I have received the most appalling representations about children involuntarily committed to adult mental institutions and sexually abused in them. I was asked to try to ensure children could not in future be put in adult mental institutions, where they could potentially be abused. I was not asked to do anything else and I am appalled that amendment was not made to the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill was passed using the lowest common denominator in terms of facilities. It did not even provide that a registered psychiatric nurse could detain a patient for another 24 hours. That demonstrates what a woeful state the mental health services are in. It would be better if children suffering from mental illness were detained under a special care order. Nothing would be worse that invoking section 25 of the Mental Health Bill, 1999, to commit them to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those incarcerated in mental hospitals as children have even been denied access to the Laffoy commission. I cannot understand the reason <Col N="500" /> the Government has decided to do this. It is not as if the victims wanted compensation. They wanted to explain what had happened to them and ask why it will be allowed happen again to other children. One victim named a paedophile, who faced a large number of charges, with whom she shared a closed psychiatric ward when she was 14 years of age. She was not sexually abused by him but I cannot say that others were not.</P>
    <P>I am slightly concerned about section 161 which deals with the segregation of those detained on criminal charges and others. Only those detained on criminal charges can be detained in day care and other juvenile centres except under this section, under which the Minister may enter into arrangements with persons for the provision by those persons on behalf of the Minister of a place providing facilities for the detention of children found guilty of offences. We have run into problems in this area where the Minister has been in a position to buy health care from private institutions, although I understand the reason that may happen.</P>
    <P>However, section 161(5) states, &ldquo;Any such place need not cater exclusively for children found guilty of offences&rdquo;. This is at variance with other sections which provide that children committed for criminal offences would only be detained in certain detention centres while those committed for other reasons would not. In the past detention centres held children who were orphaned or had been involved in petty crime or who it was felt should be placed in such institutions. I am concerned that such a mixum-gatherum of children could arise under this section. Will the Minister provide any safeguards? This is a Dáil Bill, which has been introduced towards the end of the session, and it is most unlikely that I will be able to table amendments on this. The section is odd and I would like the Minister of State to comment on it.</P>
    <P>I am also a little unclear about the position of children with intellectual disabilities who experience challenging behaviour. This is important in regard to children with intellectual disabilities who are older or suffer mental illness and are quite violent within their homes. Nowadays fathers, in particular, are driven out of their homes by young violent adolescents because there are very few places to put them and no safe places for fathers. This has not been addressed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Donovan's concern that there is a difference between the various groupings for the family welfare conferences. I had been advised that they were called family group conferences for which there is a specific definition. The family is defined as &ldquo;including the children, parents, extended family, significant friends and neighbours&rdquo;. Why is it not called a family group conference? I have taken part in such conferences and the Minister of State's recommendations in this regard are good and practical. I was particularly taken by the provision which allows for people to be thrown out if it was felt they <Col N="501" /> were not being helpful. What is the position of the non-marital father at such conferences? That will be important, for example, in disputes regarding guardianship. I am president of Cherish and, while we want both parents to be involved in the upbringing of the child, there are scenarios where the child, for example, is the product of a rape. What rights does the father have in this regard?</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the child following discharge. Community follow-up is extremely important, no matter from where the child is being discharged. I understand the reason the probation and welfare service would become involved with children who have committed a crime but it is not clear what the position is in regard to children who are the subject of special care orders. Unfortunately, if a child has been released from a special care unit or a detention centre, he or she can fall between two stools while the situation is worse for adults. However, a great effort has been made to divert children from detention centres. It would be unfortunate if a child left a place of detention or special care unit and ran into the same problems again.</P>
    <P>I commend the establishment of the juvenile liaison programme on a statutory basis. It has been an incredible success and it is worthwhile to put it on a statutory footing. I also commend the section dealing with foster care. It was a good move to raise the legal age to 12 years in this regard. However, it is frightening to witness the reaction in England to the potential release of the killers of James Bulger. It was an appalling crime but the two boys were ten at the time and neither was sought by anyone in their families until after midnight. The Minister is trying to create a safety net for such children but it is difficult. Many in Great Britain and almost 80% of Liverpudlians believe the killers should not be released and that they got off too lightly.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with the courts are good. Unlike Senator Taylor-Quinn, I believe the courts have been very good in regard to children. I commend Judge Paul Carney who recently said he would try to give cases involving children who have been sexually abused and so on special priority over remand cases.</P>
    <P>I tried to point out during the debate on the Mental Health Bill, 1999, that mental health orders for children should be reviewed every six months rather than every year because a year in a child's life is totally different from a year in the life of an adult. However, I got nowhere. That could easily have been changed because the Bill had to be sent back to the Dáil. I was cross about that.</P>
    <P>There is confusion about what happens when the child is taken into custody by a garda. In some cases gardaí will not be able to get the parents to come to the station. Under sections 58 and 63 the child can nominate the adult he or she wants involved in the case, but he or she cannot do so under section 61 which states that the father will <Col N="502" /> decide what adult will go to the interview. I cannot understand the reason that was decided given that the child has been well dealt with up to this. If the parents will not come, an adult he or she wants to come is allowed under section 58, under which the child is entitled to have an adult relative or other adult reasonably named by him or her given the information. However, under section 61, in the absence of the parent or guardian, &ldquo;another adult (not being a member of the Garda Síochána) nominated by the member in charge of the station&rdquo;, shall be the person who shall be there during the interview of the child. I cannot work that out. Under section 63 an adult relative &ldquo;includes any adult reasonably named by the child pursuant to <i>section 58(2)(a)</i>&rdquo;. That seems to be an anomaly.</P>
    <P>It is a pity section 26 of the Child Care Act, 1991, was not amended. Under this section the child can have either a legal representative or a guardian, but cannot have both. I am sure representations were made to the Minister about this, but there must have been a good reason not to amend it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance puts his hand into his long pocket and gives the Minister of State all the money she needs for this Bill. I am glad the probation and welfare service seems to have found a way to get more staff. I warmly applaud this and those who managed to find a way around the difficulties of getting more people appointed. It has been well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill because it puts as much effort as possible into prevention. That is what we want to do. We do not want children before the courts and in detention centres. We want to do everything we can to try to prevent this. I like the provision relating to victim support. It is worthwhile to get young people to face up to those to whom they have caused damage. I like the idea of making plans for what a person will do and getting the child to sign up to them. These are the type of things children understand. We will fail in a certain number of cases, but we will succeed in a number as well. I hope the Bill will go a long way towards improving the situation for children who are neglected.</P>
    <P>It is dreadful that we must include sections on begging and putting children into prostitution. A court case in Waterford the other day highlighted the fact that a child of 13 years was sold into prostitution. I was disappointed that no one from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform went to the recent European meeting on human trafficking. There is also human trafficking of children. I am aware that it was not the Minister of State's place to go, but it is a pity the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which talks so much about refugees and displaced persons, could not have got someone to take part in this important discussion. Another area is the selling of children into prostitution which I am sure will be covered by this Bill. By the time anyone gets to this end of the line, there will be <Col N="503" /> someone here to receive them. I am sure something will be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. I would like the Minister of State to amend section 26 of the Child Care Act, 1991, to include both a legal representative and a guardian. Section 63 of this Bill should also be amended unless there is a good reason the child cannot choose the person to be present for the interview. I was fairly calm about the rest of the Bill on which I congratulate the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation and want to comment briefly on a few of its more important sections. This Bill will totally repeal the Children Act, 1908, with modern comprehensive legislation which will cover three main areas of law. It provides a framework within which the juvenile justice system can continue to develop. It re-enacts and updates provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have custody, charge or care of them. It also provides for a family welfare conference and contains other provisions for dealing with out-of-control, non-offending children. It is also notable and welcome that some of the main sections of the Bill come under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children, such as the family welfare conference, children in need of special care and treatment and Part 11 which deals with the Special Residential Services Board. I also recognise there are overlaps between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children, which is testimony to the integrated nature of the Bill. The court may write to the health boards to convene a family welfare conference for a child before it on a criminal charge if it is of the view that the child's problem relates to the need for care and protection, for example, in section 78.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the reason for the Bill. Young offenders, by reason of their age and level of maturity, deserve to be dealt with differently or more humanely than adult offenders. The juvenile justice system developed under the 1908 Act was incapable of further development unless it was underpinned by new legislation, particularly restorative justice measures. However, the modern thinking reflected in the Bill means there should be a noticeable decrease in juvenile offending over time. The objectives of the Bill are to divert first time and non-serious child offenders from inclusion in the criminal justice system under the statutory diversion programme, which will include restorative justice measures; to provide the courts with the means by which they do not necessarily have to proceed to a finding which would usually be of guilt and referral to the health boards or the probation and welfare service, which is an example of restorative justice, for the convening of a family welfare conference in more serious or persistent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> There are a couple of examples of restorative justice in the Bill. The first example is in Part 4, which deals with the Garda diversion programme. Incorporated in the programme is a conference which may or may not be chaired by a garda. It will provide a forum for the child, his or her parents, other family members, other interested persons and, where appropriate, the victim to discuss the child's offending and the reasons for it. It will confront the child with the consequences of his or her actions. It will establish the basis for a lifestyle which does not include anti-social behaviour and allow the child to apologise and possibly make reparation to the victim. It is a welcome and innovative development to bring the child through that course of action rather than through the courts.</P>
    <P>There is also a unique provision called restorative cautioning in section 26 under which the victim may be present for the administration of a formal caution to the child. This allows for a less formal type of conference which will suit cases where the more structured conference might not be appropriate or justifiable. The courts will also be given the power to direct the probation and welfare service to convene family conferences. These will be similar to the Garda conferences but will be appropriate in cases where the Garda considers it has no option but to prosecute. For example, where the non-enforceable aspect of the Garda conference might have led to compliance difficulties, the benefit and advantages of the court directed conference are as follows: there is an opportunity for the case against a child to be finalised without proceeding to a finding and all that would entail; the child and his or her family will have a say in finding a solution which will not have been imposed by the courts, which is important and the outcome of the conference will be supervised by the court and enforceable. The outcome will not be easy in that the recommendations of a family conference may include the making of an apology to the victim, the making of reparation, a restriction on the child's movements and participation by him or her in supervised activities.</P>
    <P>The age of criminal responsibility was mentioned by many speakers. I welcome the fact that arrangements are being made in this legislation to raise the age to 12 years. Some Members commented that it should be raised to 14 years, on which there will be disagreement. I agree with Senators Henry and O'Donovan that 12 years is an appropriate age.</P>
    <P>In regard to the reasons the Government arrived at this age, the former Dáil Select Committee on Crime, after a thorough examination of the issues involved, recommended an age of 12 years in its first report. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child criticised our low age of criminal responsibility. That was another factor which led the Government to decide on 12 years.</P>
    <P>It is important to note also that the number of children under 12 years of age who come to the <Col N="505" /> notice of the Garda is relatively small. The 1998 crime report shows that the number of children under 12 years of age reported to the Garda national juvenile office on suspicion of committing offences was approximately 1,000. By no means will all of these children require alternative intervention. Although raising the age to 12 years will mean that children under that age who commit offences will no longer qualify for admission to the Garda diversion programme, they will still have contact with community gardaí, which will be on a more integrated and co-operative basis with other agencies such as the health boards. It would not be possible to raise the age in stages by means of regulations, as proposed in the 1996 Bill. This is because of the Supreme Court decision under which it is likely that a power to raise the age in regulations would, if challenged, be found unconstitutional. Regardless of the specific arguments, the raising of the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years is the right decision.</P>
    <P>The detention provisions are largely similar to those in the 1996 Act, although they have been substantially redrafted. Some important changes have been made. First, because of the fear of a revolving door system developing in the education of children in detention schools, it is made clear that the court cannot order the detention of a child under 16 years of age unless a place in such a school is available. The alternatives for the court in such circumstances are to defer making the order until a place is available or to impose a community sanction as an alternative. The latter provision is new and was not contained in the 1996 Bill. That is important because orders were made to have children placed in care, but suitable places were not available at the time those orders were handed down. The second change is the introduction of a detention and supervision order for 16 and 17 year olds. This would allow the court to split the sentence equally between detention and supervision in the community, thus allowing for better aftercare and reintegration.</P>
    <P>The protection provisions are essentially an updating of the 1908 Act provisions. They have not changed radically from the 1996 Bill but there are two significant differences. First, the scope of the cruelty offence has been broadened to include a child's mental or emotional health or well-being. The 1996 Bill referred only to physical health or well-being. Also, the meaning of &ldquo;ill-treatment&rdquo;, one of the ingredients of cruelty, is being expanded to include frightening, bullying or threatening a child. These changes give effect to the recommendations of the then Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs in section 246 of its 1997 report on non-fatal offences against the person in respect of children.</P>
    <P>Second, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, is being amended to, in effect, raise the penalty for soliciting a child for the purposes of prostitution. This is essentially a holding operation pending a more considered examination of the issue of child prostitution in the context of <Col N="506" /> the analysis of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences. They are two welcome changes in the area of protection.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation which is vitally important. As has been said by previous speakers, it is about the protection of our children, being innovative and providing alternatives for the criminal courts system. That is to be welcomed. Some fantastic ideas are being brought forward in legislation. In many cases they will work effectively. In others, we may not be so fortunate but the sooner this legislation is on our Statute Book, the better for our children. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill. It is a major move forward and reflects a huge amount of work by the Department. There are certain aspects of it with which I am not completely satisfied but the officials dealing with it have listened and tried to do their best to move forward this huge tome of legislation.</P>
      <P>On my first ever visit to this Chamber, some years before I was elected, Fine Gael was in government and the Fine Gael Whip was a family connection, Senator Luke Belton. I was visiting the House because a criminal justice Bill was going through at the time. Many of us were trying to get the age of criminal responsibility raised above seven years, with which we had no success. There was a great deal of Special Branch interest in us because we spoke on public platforms etc. on this issue. I was late arriving into the House, only to meet the Fine Gael Whip running down the corridor. He did not have time to talk to me because, he said, O'Leary was voting against the whip. He was referring to the then Senator O'Leary of Fine Gael who is now a judge in the Circuit Court. That is an issue in which many of us have been involved for many years.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons the issues in this legislation have become appropriate and interesting in the course of this week. This day week in the House, Senator Costello raised the issue of the 15 and 16 year old Irish children detained in a German prison in circumstances which did not reflect in any way the United Nations rights of the child obligations. It concerns many of us that this could happen to a child in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Before saying anything negative about issues in the Bill, it is worth recognising that it is positive and progressive in comparison with many of the events we have seen in the European Union. It is also topical and appropriate that we would be discussing the Bill in a week when the two convicted murderers of Jamie Bulger are due before the probation boards in the United Kingdom for the first time. A heated and emotional debate is taking place in the United Kingdom on the appropriateness or the morality of the possible release of these young men. It is appropriate, therefore, that we are discussing the issue here in the cold light of day and dealing with the facts in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> The Minister of State will be aware that my own organisation, the INTO, made a number of representations to the Minister at various times in the past 18 months. We have taken on board the views expressed to us by INTO members, teachers in particular, on some of the detention centres &ndash; Oberstown, Finglas, Clonmel and others. We brought those views to the Department and I am glad to see that some of them have been included in the Bill. There are a number of issues outstanding to which I will also come.</P>
    <P>The preventative focus in the Bill is, philosophically, its most crucial aspect in terms of what we should welcome. In trying to get the balance right, it is vitally important that the Bill has both a preventative and a community-based focus. They are the two most important elements if it is to have a long-term positive impact. Putting into legislation a strategy to divert a child away from detention and the prison system is vitally important and strongly reflects the views of those in the community, including teachers and others, concerned for the welfare of the child, the community and the common good. It is important that that would be welcomed. It is also important that we would carry it through in providing an alternative to detention and prison for adults also. There is a positive connection in the Bill to the probation system and the juvenile liaison service. Those are important aspects which should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Much has been written recently about the role of parents. I have not read every line of the Bill but some sections have a significant focus on the role of the parent. As legislators we need to be clear on the philosophical basis on which we determine the role of parents. In my discussions in a teaching medium and in advising teachers and the education partners, I have often come across parents who are in fear of their children. I have seen parents and teachers who, with the best will in the world, cannot control their children. This is even the case at primary level and it is important that people recognise this fact.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that teachers and care staff in detention centres and special detention schools have a difficult job during which they are regularly assaulted, physically threatened and in fear. This is part and parcel of the work of the teaching and care staff in places of detention.</P>
    <P>In recognising the problems faced by parents with difficult children and the pressure they are put under by such children, it would be unfair to suggest that parents should be responsible for their children's actions. Parents should be accountable, but not necessarily responsible. Parents are responsible for parenting and can be held responsible if they fall down in that role. Parents can also be made accountable for their children's whereabouts and so on, inasmuch as they are able and it is practicable to do so. However, it would be wrong to hold them responsible in all cases for their children's actions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The parents of children who are delinquent, who are in breach of the law or who have caused problems should, in the first instance, be held accountable, but not necessarily responsible. Section 54 recognises that, whereas a child under the age of 12 or 14, as appropriate, might find himself or herself responsible for an act for which, were it not for his or her age, he or she would be found guilty of an offence, anyone who aids or abets a child in such an act can be found guilty. This is an important provision and is the best manner in which to approach this issue. If it transpires that a parent guided a child into a life of crime, it is right that the parent be held responsible. However, the provision must be confined to such restrictive circumstances. We should recognise that the Bill finds an acceptable balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>There may have been a recent change to the legislation which I have not seen, but can we not recognise that there is a difference between a child of 12 years of age and an 18 year old who is almost an adult? As far as I can see the legislation does not distinguish between the needs of a 12 year old &ndash; a young teenager &ndash; and an older teenager. I stand to be corrected on this point and I will listen to the Minister of State's response. However, this is a flaw in the Bill as there is a significant difference between the two age groups, even in terms of their physical demands. Children of 12, 13 or 14 years of age might have different needs from persons of 17 or 18 years. The Minister of State might consider changes in this regard. This issue is reflected in one section of the Bill which deals with places of detention and stipulates that the place should be appropriate for a child in the case of someone under the age of, I think, 14 years. However, that is not enough and the Bill is flawed in this respect.</P>
    <P>In making representations to the Minister when the Bill was published, we drew attention to the fact that it did not include provision for a minimum period of detention. We made strong representations to the Minister and the Department to the effect that, for many practical reasons, a minimum period of three months should be stipulated. I am glad this point has been taken on board, for which I thank the Minister.</P>
    <P>There have been many recent newspaper reports of gardaí arriving at detention centres to be told by the director that there are no places available and that the child cannot be admitted. It is important that there is a sustainable regime in detention centres whereby there are no disruptions late at night or problems of over-crowding, discipline or supervision, as a result of which safety is put at risk. We made strong representations that a director should be able to refuse to accept a child if there is no available place.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the Bill has been changed since first published to the effect that a judge must ensure that a place is available for a child before he or she can issue an order. This ensures that the judge takes responsibility. However, we would be happier if the court order was delivered <Col N="509" /> to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or an appropriate section of the Department, which would be responsible for finding an appropriate place for the child. That would be a preferable, more effective and more efficient manner of doing business.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise other issues. Whatever reservations I have about the Bill, I particularly welcome the increase in the age of criminal responsibility. I have sought such a change for 25 years and I am glad it has finally been achieved. The age should be 14 years without distinction, qualification or modification. Unfortunately, it has been increased to 14 years with some modifications. However, this is a step forward. I welcome the legislation and I look forward to further improvements in the coming years. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and one of the most important Bills to come before the Oireachtas in recent years. The Bill is important for future generations of children. In the past, the justice system looked upon children in the same way as adults. For the first time this Bill treats children as children, not as miniature adults.</P>
      <P>The Bill's approach relies more on the carrot than the stick with the option that, if the carrot is unsuccessful, one can fall back on the stick. Children respond accordingly to a positive, rather than a negative, approach from adults. The Bill is progressive and forward-thinking in terms of future generations.</P>
      <P>We must accept that many families are dysfunctional and experience a lack of parental involvement and control. In the past, the extended family acted almost like a guardian angel in respect of children. Unfortunately that is no longer the case and family supports and structures are no longer available. Regardless of some of the Bill's implications, such supports can be provided if the Bill is implemented fully and the resources necessary for that full implementation are provided.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of parents being made responsible for their children, but I take a slightly different view. The Bill places greater responsibility on parents which is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives parents more responsibility and involves them in the processes envisaged by the Bill. The legislation also empowers them by making them aware of what is happening from the initial stages, whether by way of a special care order or through family welfare conferences. If parents feel they have lost control of their children and cannot deal with them, the provisions of the Bill will assist them in many ways by giving them more power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I read in one of the national newspapers about a mother who had approached the Garda Síochána to have her child taken into care. She felt the child was in danger of being approached by vigilantes because of his anti-social behaviour. It is a sad reflection on society <Col N="510" /> that parents should feel unable to rear their children. The Bill is extremely important in that respect. While it places a responsibility on parents, it places an even greater responsibility on health boards. Over the years, there has been much criticism of the way in which health boards have dealt with children, including the social worker aspect. Complaints have often been made about delays in the administration process, which spans so many different levels, that children can fall between the responsibilities of two Departments or community services. Now that there is a proper, co-ordinated approach there is a great responsibility on health boards, particularly concerning special care orders.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Bill will be a fundamental issue. Unless resources and properly trained personnel are put in place, not only in health boards but also within the Garda Síochána and the probation and welfare service, we will fail in this regard. From my reading of it, the Bill represents good legislation but the most difficult aspect will be to implement its provisions. We are aware of the difficulties in recruiting special staff to work with problem children in special units but when the structures envisaged in the Bill are put in place we will have a greater problem on our hands in getting properly qualified staff and keeping them. The focus must be on having a co-ordinated approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>In discussing children at risk, I am not only talking about children who are at risk of offending but also about the protection and care of children in general. We must put in place structures, including social workers and gardaí, that can deal specifically with children. Such people must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, if a family problem arises after 5 p.m., children are often placed in an acute hospital for their protection and specialised personnel are not in place to ensure that such children are properly cared for. When children have to be removed from the family home it is not good enough to place them in an acute hospital which does not have the required facilities.</P>
    <P>Social workers, child psychologists and gardaí who are specially trained to deal with children should be in place around the clock because such problems do not just arise during office hours. On many occasions, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, has stated that the best place for a child is in his or her own home but sometimes it is safer for a child to be out of the family home, if even for a short period. I have experience of cases where children have been abandoned in hospitals, particularly in Dublin, and their parents returned to collect them at a later date.</P>
    <P>While objections have been raised regarding the proposed special units, if they are properly regulated and manned, they will be the best places for such children. I have no doubt that such units will ensure that children are rehabilitated so they may take their place in society as adults.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I welcome the establishment of the diversion programme for children between the ages of 12 and 18 who have committed offences. Surveys in other countries have shown that when offenders are faced with their victims it often acts as a deterrent to commit future crimes. The involvement of victims, but most importantly parents and professionals, can have a positive effect on young offenders, including children. The adoption of such a positive attitude can provoke a domino effect, ensuring that children respond in a more positive fashion than they might otherwise do.</P>
    <P>I agree with the increase, from seven to 12 years, in the age limit of criminal responsibility and up to 14 years unless the prosecution can show that an individual committed a crime. We must be aware, however, that in some cases a child of 12 or 13 can be extremely streetwise, whereas a young person of 17 or 18 may not be. The diversion programme will be in place for children who admit responsibility for their actions but what happens in cases where such children do not admit responsibility? I could cite one example where a 14 year old allegedly sexually abused a very young child. After being questioned by the Garda Síochána and other professionals, the 14 year old continued to deny having committed any abuse. However, three year olds do not tell lies and in many cases do not even understand what has happened to them, although they can explain it in their own language. In a case like that, it is possible that nothing can be done for the 14 year old if he or she does not admit responsibility. I am fearful of what will happen to this child if it continually denies the act. What case is open to the victim's family to ensure that the child does not suffer repercussions in 20 years' time as a result of what has happened?</P>
    <P>If an individual does not accept responsibility, even if he or she is only 14 years of age, what will happen in two or three years' time? If at the age of 14 the person is abusing a child, God only knows what he or she will do at 16 or 17. There is something evil with a small minority of children in society that is causing them to carry out such acts. Despite the fact that they deny everything, I am afraid that we will experience even greater problems from them later.</P>
    <P>Juvenile liaison officers have a major role to play in implementing the provisions of the Bill. When allegations have been made, a liaison officer should be appointed for a short period, even if the accused person denies perpetrating the act. If at all possible, such people should be rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>It has been revealed that some young offenders are subsequently diagnosed as having attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. It is only when they come to the attention of the criminal justice system that this is identified. While the Minister for Education and Science is involved in this, it is even more an issue for the Minister for Health and Children to put in place more educational and clinical psychologists for children to ensure <Col N="512" /> we identify and diagnose them at an earlier age. As has been proved, early intervention and treatment is the key to success, particularly for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which will affect the lives of thousands of children in coming years. The detail gone into and the wide-ranging, inclusive measures in relation to the professionals and the family are for the betterment of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to correct something I said earlier. I apologise to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for saying he had not accepted my amendment regarding the detention of children under the Mental Health Bill. I said they could still be kept in a mental hospital or institution for one year but the Minister accepted my amendment and they can now only be held for six months without being reviewed. I apologise unreservedly to him for the mistake I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry's remarks on the detention of children in any mental institution. It is preferable that they are taken out of such institutions and that there is a special care order to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and give a guarded welcome to the legislation before us. It is about time we had a Children Bill. The old legislation dates from 1908 and pertains to a different era and jurisdiction. Believe it or not, it was passed by a Liberal Party Government which was updating and liberalising legislation. It was widely seen as a major reform, and so it was because it made provision for children to be detained in special schools as opposed to prisons. The special schools were reformatories and industrial schools. Unfortunately, as we forgot to properly monitor and manage them, we now have the disgrace of so much abuse having taken place. The reforming measures were put forward and rather than dump young children in prisons they were put into special places of care, education and training, but while we look back on the Act of 1908 as something terrible, it was not. It was very progressive for the time. The unfortunate decision was that people had to spend four years inside and if there was an abusive system in place, there was very little hope for a youngster to come out at the other end of it in any fit condition.</P>
      <P>It was also unfortunate that the age of criminal responsibility was put at seven years, deemed to be the age of reason, which meant young children of very tender years could end up in institutional care. Due to the uncaring nature of the powers that be, young children between the ages of seven and 15 years spent long periods of time in these institutions. They could be locked away for long periods because of minor misdemeanours and non-offences such as truancy. It is unfortunate that we did not properly develop the system laid out in the 1908 Act and were negligent in implementing its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> Some of our European colleagues have not got around to reforming their systems. Last Thursday, I raised in this House the matter of two young boys &ndash; one aged 15 years and the other 16 &ndash; who have been detained in a German prison since 1 June. They had no contact with their families until yesterday. They have been held incommunicado by the German authorities. Action by a lawyer to get them some communication was turned down by a judge and when the parents spoke to the boys yesterday it transpired they were being held in the same cell as a murderer and a drug pusher. That is the state of affairs which obtains in one of our peer EU countries. Furthermore, one of the boys attends a special school here, which has not been taken into consideration. The German authorities are clearly in gross breach of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Department of Foreign Affairs has dragged its feet and when the children's parents sought for the embassy to make a visit it gave the excuse that it is understaffed. On Monday the visitor from the embassy negotiated a telephone call for the parents, to be made on Tuesday. That has been the extent of direct communication with the boys. They do not speak the language.</P>
    <P>It is awful that such a practice is allowed to continue. We may listen every now and again to Mr. Justice Kelly decrying the facilities provided here but, bad as they are, we are certainly light years ahead of some of our European Union partners. It is time to resolve this matter and the onus to examine it is on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, particularly the brief on children, not just the Department of Foreign Affairs. There should have been some statement from the Government on this matter but there has not been one word.</P>
    <P>It has taken a long time to bring this Bill before the House. The original Bill was produced in 1996. This Bill is dated 1999 and now, in 2001, we at last have it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Now it is here, many of my colleagues on both sides want to have it fully implemented as quickly as possible and the resources made available to allow that to happen. A great deal of resources are required as is always the case when it is a question of legislation on children. Health boards have to be properly resourced for the new responsibilities they will have, as do the Children's Court, the Garda and the bane of my life, the probation and welfare service. The service is totally under-resourced given the work it will be doing but it is still to have a major role in the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a substantial commitment in implementing this legislation. The Bill comes from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is about justice, accountability and offending but what must be remembered is the overall context in which a child becomes unruly and needs care, the wider context of the quality of life the child has while growing up, the environment in which he or she grows up, the <Col N="514" /> housing in which he or she is reared, the education and back-up services provided to ensure he or she does not fall through the net and leave school. The resources are not available for many children in areas of deprivation, initially at child care level, to give them the start available to children in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>The education system does not have the remedial back-up and that is a major cause of our problems. That is where much of the money will have to go. The Minister of State said this was a Bill of juvenile justice, which it is, but one cannot have juvenile justice without juvenile care, protection, support or rights. Those are the primary matters that have to be put in place. As we go through the Bill I note the attempt to bring those in at every stage, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>At the same time, my conclusion is the same as that reached by Father Flanagan when he set up Boys Town &ndash; there is no such thing as a bad boy. A boy or girl only becomes bad according to the context in which they are reared. If they are reared in a proper, humane family and community environment, nobody will be bad. In that context I am still looking for the set of principles the Minister of State says is in this Bill. The Minister of State said the Bill was underpinned by a set of principles. He stated:</P>
    <P>An unusual feature of the Bill is that many of its constituent parts are supported by a set of principles or objectives. The importance of this feature should not be underestimated ... Thus, Part 4, which places the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis, is supported by a new principle that obliges the Garda to consider for admission to the programme children who have accepted responsibility for their criminal behaviour.</P>
    <P>That is not a principle, it is a procedure. Where is the principle? The Minister of State went on to talk about Part 9. He said:</P>
    <P>Part 9 establishes the rights of children before the courts charged with criminal offences. These include an important new right which was not in the 1996 Bill, that is, the principle that criminal proceedings will not be used solely to provide any assistance or services needed to care for or protect a child.</P>
    <P>What principle is that? That has always been the principle, that criminal proceedings will not be used solely for criminal purposes. No principles are enunciated in relation to the Bill and I would like to see it put in that context, the rights of the child, the supportive environment for the child, the parental supports and the community context. None of that is there. This is not a Bill placed in a fundamental principled context. What are being presented as principles are merely procedures. All that is being presented here are assertions that those are principles and they are not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The age of criminal responsibility has now gone from seven to 12 years, which is welcome, but why have a cut-off point at 12?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. It is 14 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Within certain conditions. This goes back to a 20 year old document, a report on children from the early 1980s. I would have thought 15 years the appropriate cut-off age, as that is the compulsory schoolgoing age. All these provisions for dealing with children could be dealt with in the context of not treating them as criminals; one could still put the paraphernalia of conferencing and garda diversions in place without engaging in that.</P>
      <P>Something that is glaringly absent from the Bill relates to the substantial level of parental responsibility built into the conferencing procedure. I have no problem with that but we must realise that the nuclear family is no longer quite the norm in Irish society. One cannot simply talk about parental responsibility without going into the broader family context. That resource will have to be expanded into the immediate family, the wider family and the community. The people we are dealing with here are not amenable in a simple parental fashion, much as we would like that. This provision will have to be broadened and the Minister of State should respond to that. We are talking about dealing with drugs and the task forces are being put in a community setting, as are development and the partnerships. However, while this is put in a parental or family setting it is not in a community setting. There is no reason the community cannot be brought into the conferencing or peer models within the community cannot be brought into the situation. Often the parents can do nothing about the matter for one reason or other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>How that is done will determine the success or failure of the Bill. That is the key.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There is much to be teased out in relation to it but I take it as a step in the right direction in dealing with a problem that needed to be addressed for a long time. I hope the Minister of State accepts some recommendations and amendments on later Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as have previous speakers who highlighted its good points. It adds a new dimension and upgrades the juvenile system by creating a framework. Nobody doubts that there will be teething problems but if we get the concepts right we can work on that. We can deal with sections of the Bill that require work for implementation. It is a broad, worthwhile Bill which allows everyone the opportunity to get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> The Bill will also protect children against persons who have custody or care of them and provides for the new development of the family welfare conference, and it is to be supported for those reasons. The Bill also raises the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years and up to 18 years while also introducing a series of measures designed to divert children away from crime. That is the core of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is that children should not be imprisoned until that is the only option left after all other community-based measures have been tried and then only if they fail. The Bill deals with children who are at risk of committing an offence, who have committed offences or who are charged and convicted. That is it in a nutshell and if we get that right, we can deal with each area separately and it should be easy to tackle each Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In a previous capacity I dealt with young offenders in an area where the fabric of society had failed and I understand the problem. I understand how these children get into difficulties, why they have behavioural problems and why they are out of control and have no sense of responsibility. We must reflect that when creating a mechanism or programme which is to help those young offenders.</P>
    <P>We must realise that society has changed. With marital breakdown the family has changed drastically and that has made new measures necessary. That gives cause for new thinking.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the Bill that differs from my experience relates to the special care order. This will also be added to the care orders and supervision orders. It is for children at risk from their own behaviour. It is welcome that in this case a garda can speed up the measures and introduce a special care order if that garda finds that such children are at risk. This gives a new dimension to the legislation and gives comfort to those specialists who deal with young offenders.</P>
    <P>The family welfare conferences and their workings are also to be welcomed in so far as the Bill deals with the composition of these welfare conferences. I understand that such conferences will be put on a statutory basis. Up to now, we have had such conferences but they were not called welfare conferences. Instead, they were called case studies. In these case studies the principal of the school concerned was involved, as was the psychologist, the career guidance teacher, the home-school link person, the remedial teacher, the probation officer or social worker, the JLO and the attendance officer. I have sat in on many such case studies. However, they were not on a statutory basis and there was no monitoring of decisions made as a result of those case studies. In the middle of this, the young offender got lost in the process.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the move to this special conference, which will be monitored and will have a co-ordinator with special skills in dealing with such matters. Its function will be to decide if <Col N="517" /> a child needs special care. The composition of the conference will be very important. There are people who claim they are professionals yet would not have a clue how to deal with the problem of young offenders. I am speaking against my own profession by saying this, but we must be careful that the composition of such conferences is correct. If we are not sensitive, or get too clinical, we may ignore the core reasons why such conferences were established. It is important to be selective in choosing people for these conferences.</P>
    <P>I like the area of the Bill dealing with first offences. These are to be dealt with through the diversion programme. I love the phrase &ldquo;restorative justice&rdquo;. We used to feel in the past that once a person committed an offence, they were deemed to carry that with them for the rest of their lives. An attempt is now to be made to make the child aware of his or her responsibilities. The child will perhaps apologise to the victim.</P>
    <P>However, it may prove difficult to implement this proposal despite the concept being an excellent one. Who will implement the programme? Who will deal with it? Will it be the juvenile liason officer, the teachers concerned, or some outside body such as the health board? To get that right at the first stage &ndash; at the first offence &ndash; will be a good day's work. If a child can be made to understand that he or she is responsible for their own behaviour, that the victim has been hurt and that an apology is necessary, then this will be a good thing. A programme should be devised that will be implemented in the community. I agree with the concept. I know that the Minister is trying to put this on a legal footing but success will depend on the implementation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to implement new measures for administering a caution, be it informal or formal. This will again be subject to the monitoring of the JLO. I have worked with many excellent JLOs but some are unsure of the broad concept.</P>
    <P>We must also devise an action plan for punishment. These children have done wrong, and they must be punished to make them understand that they have done wrong. How to do that is a key question. The experts in this area must talk to the children involved. The children may not have outside supports. They may not have their parents with them. They may have other people coming in from the community. They may be lost as children. We must devise a plan for them, be it community involvement by parents, apologies, reparations, monitoring the child's movements or attendance at school. The schools will always play an important part in this process.</P>
    <P>This must be done sensitively. The Minister has set up a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the diversion programme. I would like to see that enlarged before I am convinced that it will work. I am playing devil's advocate here as I have worked on the ground in relation to case studies and know how successful or not they have been. <Col N="518" /> The only difference here is that the proposed conference is on a statutory basis which gives it effectiveness in implementation.</P>
    <P>There is much good in the Bill. I am concerned about the Special Residential Services Board, although I do not want to play the devil's advocate about it. I hope it will work. This is a good Bill. The conferences, the diversion programmes and the child orientation are all welcome. If we get the proper personnel to deal with it in the schools, in the home-school link and in community involvement, that will be welcome. I do not know how it will be done, but it is how the Bill is implemented that will decide its success or failure. It is a good move forward. If I were back in my old profession, I would love to be implementing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate and an important Bill. It is one which has been due for some time and is an area in which this House takes a particular interest. The previous Bill in 1996 spent a good deal of time in this House and I recall it with particular interest and affection. Members are entitled to claim a measure of credit for this House. Senator Ryan and myself put down a new section in that Bill which introduced the guardian <i>ad litem </i>for the first time. That was important and showed how this House could work in the area. I will not take too much time and hope that I will be reasonably cogent. I apologise to the Minister if what I have to say is a little hazy. A part of my not very large brain is still suspended somewhere over the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>There is acknowledgement from all sides that this legislation is necessary and timely. We should have done this a long time ago. As politicians, we stand reproved by a series of remarks by learned judges in the Irish courts. In 1995, in the FN case &ndash; just the initials were used &ndash; Mr. Justice Geoghegan said that the State had a constitutional obligation to provide &ldquo;as soon as reasonably practicable suitable arrangements of containment with treatment for troubled children.&rdquo; That was six years ago, so it has taken some time to reach this point. We need to look at this with a degree of urgency. I do not mean this as a criticism of the present Minister as she has worked very hard both in her Department and within Government to secure funding in this area. However, we all stand reproached. In October 2000, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly threatened to hold three Ministers in contempt if they did not provide suitable residential accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept this is only one area with which the Bill deals. We must, however, be careful in how we proceed in respect of that area, particularly when we consider the abuses which occurred in Artane and Letterfrack. We must remember that the abuses to which I refer were carried out within a system for which we, as lawmakers, had a moral <Col N="519" /> responsibility. It is important, therefore, that we get it right this time.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Minister of State has a good and vigorous record in terms of the work she has done in this area. That comes as no surprise because I had the pleasure of working with her some years ago on the women's rights committee. I do not believe it was mere partisanship when Deputy Andrews in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 3 March expressed his concerns about this area and pointed out that approximately 4,000 children are already in care, quite a number of whom are looked after by foster families. The Deputy proceeded to discuss the Minister of State's work and stated that in last December's budget she achieved almost a trebling of the foster care allowance to £200 and £220 for children under 12 and over 12, respectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State proposes to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years. This does not mean that children under 12 cannot do wicked things. One need only consider the Bulger case to discover the truth of the matter. Children are capable of monstrous acts and the special skill of a child psychologist is required to discover why that is the case. Part of the thinking behind the Bill is to try to ensure that we can limit the damage as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals in some measure with teachers and schools. By taking pre-emptive action, we can reduce the necessity for this kind of care. I wish to relate to the House a particularly heart-warming story. I was invited, with other Members of the Oireachtas, some of whom actually put in an appearance, to the Central Model School in Marlborough Street two weeks ago to take part in the activities for children's reading week. On my visit to a class of seven to eight year olds, I brought along a small model of Beatrix Potter's Mrs. Tiggywinkle and the book that accompanies it. When I first entered the classroom I thought, in my ignorance, I had arrived at the wrong school. The children looked as if they had been bussed in from Dalkey, Howth or some rather grand place. They were an absolute joy, beautifully dressed and extraordinarily courteous. They did not pull at the book when they wanted to read it, they asked to be allowed and were desperate to do so. Their parents were part of the programme and co-operated with the school.</P>
    <P>The children to whom I refer come from places such as Sean McDermott Street, Gardiner Street, Champion's Avenue and other areas in which there are many social problems. The reason they are developing so well is the Breaking the Cycle initiative, where the ratio is one teacher per 15 children. This initiative works and it should be expanded because it will help to obviate many of the problems with which the Bill deals. I am extremely proud of what these children have achieved but I am concerned about what will happen to them when their time in the Breaking the <Col N="520" /> Cycle programme reaches an end. In my opinion, they will fall back into the quagmire. I know this matter is not strictly appropriate to the Minister of State's brief, but perhaps she could raise it with her colleagues in Government. The Breaking the Cycle initiative must be continued in areas of deprivation and extended to second level schools to give these children a chance. It is horribly cruel to give them hope and then, just when they need further support, dump them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision of resources, particularly in terms of ensuring that teachers have special expertise, that there will be properly qualified professionals etc. I accept there will be a delay before these people enter the system. I hope the Minister of State is in a position to reassure the House that proper and adequate resources will be made available. I am sure Members on all sides will give her their strong support in terms of her going back to the Government and obtaining as much assistance as possible.</P>
    <P>I like the concept of family welfare conferences. Such conferences will be a good and humane development and will give children and their families support instead of demonising either of them. I say this because many years ago I was involved in a number of awkward situations involving my family and other families. On a number of occasions, otherwise well-meaning people said, &ldquo;It is very sad but I do not want to get involved.&rdquo; We must get involved. Children cannot be left waiting for the State to assist them.</P>
    <P>The concept of restorative caution is excellent. Requiring a child to face up to and accept responsibility for his or her misdoing in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána and the victim of their anti-social behaviour will, in the case of most children, leave a mark and may help them reconsider their actions and ensure that they do not enter a fully professional life of crime.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the Bill is a step forward and is part of a process. I appeal to the Minister of State to perhaps take up with her colleagues the suggestions put forward by Members, particularly those relating to methods of positive intervention such as the Breaking the Cycle initiative. Previous speakers referred to remedial teachers, the numbers of whom are simply not adequate. I have spoken on a number of Adjournment debates in the House about tragic cases where children began to backslide because suddenly, for financial reasons etc., the services of speech therapists and others were withdrawn. That is a cruel way to treat the children who rely on these people. Proper resources must be provided to allow the provisions of the Bill to be fully implemented.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí uilig a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo agus is léir go dtugann siad tacaíocht don Bhille agus do na prionsabail atá taobh thiar de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Bhí an-chuid le rá ar na hábhair éagsúla agus, ar ndóigh, d'fhéadfaimis a bheith anseo ar feadh tamaill fhada eile ag labhairt ar na hábhair go léir atá sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that this is major legislation. As many Senators stated, it is a landmark Bill and is the first major updating of the Children Act, 1908. It is high time that this was done. The Bill is a reflection of the Government's commitment to deal not only with children who are offenders but also children with behavioural difficulties. We must ensure that we can put in place for these children the statutory framework to protect them and give them the support they require as part of our overall policy on child protection and child welfare.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the level of juvenile crime. It has been stated that the younger generation is probably more angry than those which preceded it. It is important to recognise that the anger among young people is a result of what is happening in society. As Senator Taylor-Quinn indicated, society has created these young people. We must respond by ensuring that society will now cater for their needs. Where anti-social behaviour occurs we must support the young people involved while also putting in place measures that will prevent it happening or, where it does happen, prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <P>I stress that the Bill does not provide for a juvenile justice system that can be neatly packaged and implemented in a rigid manner. It does, however, set out the process for the future development of the juvenile justice system and contains a great deal of scope in that regard. It ties together those three Departments responsible for young people who are offenders and non-offenders. This substantive Bill is a measure of the co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science. It is noteworthy and noble legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the first questions which will continue to be asked is how and when the Bill will be implemented. That the Bill has come this far is evidence of the commitment of the Government. Some preparatory work has already been done on the juvenile justice side: the extension of the probation and welfare service, the piloting of family group conferencing, both family welfare and family conferences, the establishment on an interim basis of the Special Residential Services Board and the capital investment in providing places not just for young offenders but also for children with behavioural difficulties. That has laid the groundwork for the phased implementation of the Bill. Some elements will be introduced immediately while other elements will take time. Nonetheless, we intend to expedite this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to children with difficulties in school. When children are identified as having such difficulties, that is the time to put in place immediately the appropriate services for <Col N="522" /> them. The Education Welfare Board recently established by the Minister, Deputy Woods, will go a long way towards doing that. The National Children's Office set up under the national children's strategy is working on a model to see how the various agencies respond and work together at local level in the interests of children. This inter-agency approach is the way to go because it will support the work of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Where children are in need of services, they must be met by trained personnel who have the facility to deal specifically with children. That is also the case in the children detention schools, an issue raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn. Children in existing detention schools have fully qualified child care staff. Care plans are put in place for the children in which there is psychological and psychiatric input and for which there is medical expertise and services. The children also have trained teachers who work with a very low pupil-teacher ratio to ensure the children receive education and training. I have visited each of the centres: Trinity House in Lusk, Oberstown in Finglas, St. Michael's, St. Laurence's and Clonmel. The manner in which they respond to the different age groups they have within their care is laudable. That is something we want to keep under review to ensure children receive every opportunity to take State examinations so that they will be on a par with other children when they leave those centres and to ensure they receive the special therapeutic care they need.</P>
    <P>Therapeutic care is essential for children who have behavioural difficulties but have never offended. These children are in high support and special care units. There have been difficulties recruiting people for these centres, especially social and child care workers. One of the issues was salaries and we recently sanctioned an increase in the salaries for child care workers to try to attract people to this area of work which, while difficult, is undoubtedly rewarding. These children deserve the best and our aim is to ensure additional social workers will be trained, as will be the case in the next few years as new places are created in colleges and special courses in child care are developed, and to ensure they receive the salaries to compensate them for the type of work they do. These are some of the initiatives which will help.</P>
    <P>Having custom-built places of the highest standard will make the working conditions more attractive for such people. Having additional special care places means we can respond not just to the needs of staff but also to the needs of children. Investment is also being made in family and family welfare conferences. By putting all this in place, we are making a valuable contribution to the child welfare and protection system.</P>
    <P>That is also true of the probation and welfare service. Senator Henry asked a question which she subsequently answered when she said a number of different probation and welfare officers have been recruited. It is encouraging to see the <Col N="523" /> uptake in that area. Their role is crucial to young people and young offenders as outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We will through the Bill deal with children in different ways. The raising of the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years means all those children under 12 who might otherwise have come before the juvenile criminal justice system will now come into the care of health boards. Many Senators had suggestions about the age of criminal responsibility. Senator Costello said it should be 15, Senator Taylor-Quinn said it should be 14 and the suggestion in the 1996 Bill was that it should be ten. It is a debate which has been ongoing for some time. Having examined it carefully, the age of 12 was decided upon. That is one of the highest ages in common law jurisdictions. There is also a rebuttable presumption in the Bill that a child aged between 12 to 14 is incapable of carrying out a crime. This is known as the <i>doli incapax</i> rule. The extension to that age group will protect those children.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to principles in the Bill. It is unusual to find a Bill which sets out principles as well as procedures. It is one of the welcome features of the legislation. It is set out clearly that they are in the Bill to protect children and to recognise the role of families and their ability to work in their children's interests. That is valuable and I reject Senator Costello's comment that they are only procedures. They are not. The procedures are laid out in the legal sense and these are supported by strong principles based on good child welfare practice.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan likened the Bill to the Succession Act, which every woman recognises as among the most important legislation ever, and to the Company Law Act, 1963. I know the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would be glad to know the Bill was likened to those two major Acts. There is merit in that argument. The Senator also spoke about those who could attend the conference. Having examined this carefully, while we believe a unanimous decision of the family conference is crucial if an action plan is to work, a situation may arise where someone disagrees or is awkward or difficult, and that is covered in the Bill in that it will not invalidate the proceedings of the conference.</P>
    <P>I know Senator Henry has an interest in the welfare of children with a mental illness and she contributed to the debate in that area last week. She was concerned children should not fall between two stools. The answer to that is in the inter-agency approach and ensuring that work is done on that basis locally and nationally. The issue of psychiatric services for children and adolescents is a serious one. It was not tackled for many years and is only now being tackled through an investment by the Government. I recently received a report of the child/adolescent needs working group which has set out its plan for what is needed in the next few years. Work is already <Col N="524" /> under way in providing residential services for young people with psychiatric problems and ensuring other services are put in place for them. I know a great deal of work remains to be done but we are ensuring a beginning.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made the point about the court having to satisfy itself that there is a place in a children detention school before making an order for detention. This will be one of the great values of the Special Residential Services Board. There have been situations where children were sent by the court to a centre only to find there was no bed. The value of the Special Residential Services Board will be to co-ordinate the work of the centres and involve the different Departments. Having been established on an interim basis, the board will be aware on a daily, weekly and monthly basis of what beds are available and where. The fact that it will be able to advise the court in its work will mean the liaison between the courts and the centres will ensure the interests of the child are preserved and that he or she will not be sent from one place to the other until a service is available for him or her.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred also to the orders affecting parents. We all recognise the difficulties of parents in rearing children, particularly unruly children who can pose particular difficulties for parents. These parents need to be supported. The Bill should also be seen in the context of the whole family support programme.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I addressed a conference of the Springboard family support projects and the launching of new documentation and research which shows that family support works. The extension of family support projects throughout the country will identify families with children at risk and help them. However, as I said, there are families who for whatever reason, perhaps their own selfish needs or their lifestyle, have abdicated responsibility for their children. Our aim, including that of every child, is for children to live with their family. This is something which struck me very forcefully during the preparation of the national children's strategy where children throughout the country said the most important people in their lives were their families. We need to bring about a situation where the family is able and willing to support its children in the interests of not just the child, but of the family and, ultimately, society in general.</P>
    <P>While I talk about giving support to these families, under the Bill the court has powers available to it to target problems within families, in particular, in regard to addiction and encouraging positive lifestyles and good parenting for these families. It is important to see the carrot and the stick, the support and the forced co-operation by the courts, in the same context, which is designed to support the children and their families.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard asked what would happen to a child who did not admit to an offence. Obviously, if there is sufficient evidence and it is a relatively serious offence, the child will be <Col N="525" /> charged. However, the aim of the Bill is not to bring charges or criminalise children. Every child will be innocent until proven guilty. Obviously, if a child admits to committing a crime, he or she will be able to go down the restorative cautioning road and, all things being equal, participate in the family conference where the victim would be present. All the options are included in the Bill to protect the child.</P>
    <P>The community is important also in a child's life. Senator Costello raised this issue in the context of the family conference. Any person who in the opinion of the co-ordinator can make a valuable contribution to the conference can be invited to participate. That may include a teacher, social worker, sports leader or someone who has worked closely with the child. We recognise that a child cannot be isolated from his or her family or community. Another area where the community is involved is where the court can appoint a mentor for the family who might be a family member or a responsible member of the community who might know the family well. That, too, will put the provision in context.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked who will initiate the conference. Obviously, a Garda conference will be initiated by the director of the Garda national juvenile office. The probation and welfare service convened conference will be initiated by the courts and remain under court supervision because it is a formal part of the whole process in protecting the child.</P>
    <P>Senator John Cregan spoke about the alternatives being used for the child and using family conferences before going down the road of detention. He recognised, as we all do, that the principle behind the Bill is to have detention as a last resort.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is our intention to implement as much of the Bill as possible quickly. I recognise much needs to be done. We need to complete the building programme, recruit staff, train people and adopt an inter-agency approach. Given that the work has already begun, that there has been added investment by the Government in the last three years and that we will now have the legislative process in place to give a statutory framework to all our work, in conjunction with all our other policies, we will shortly be in a position to work, not just for the benefit of such children, but for their families and society.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this major legislation and look forward to coming back on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Seanadóirí as ucht cuireadh a thabhairt dom teacht isteach sa Teach inniu agus labhairt maidir le cúrsaí forbartha tuaithe. Creidim gur ábhar fíor thábhachtach é seo agus is ábhar é nach mbaineann amháin le na ceanntrachaí tuaithe ach a mbaineann freisin leis na ceanntrachaí cathrach.</P>
      <P>There is no question but that stabilisation of population will become a very important issue in Ireland, North and South. As recent reports have shown, and yesterday's newspapers highlighted this, a large number of our cities, particularly Dublin, are bursting at the seams and cannot cope in terms of social, transport and other physical infrastructure with their present population, not to mind the increases forecasted. Gridlock is the order of the day. On the other hand, a lot or our rural communities face the opposite problem. They have the basic social infrastructure like schools, shops and other services but lack the population to maintain viability. In such a scenario it would seem reasonable that we should redouble our efforts to ensure that our young people are not forced to migrate in ever increasing numbers to the city. This is one of our major tasks for the future and one to which I am paying particular attention as Minister with responsibility for rural development.</P>
      <P>I would like it to be seen that rural development is not something we are pushing at the expense of cities but as a policy that in the long term will lead to more sustainable and rational development and enable the provision of infrastructure in our urban areas to catch up with population growth. As somebody who has worked for 25 years in rural development I can see that the challenges have changed tremendously since I started in 1974. The biggest challenge at the moment is not just the creation of jobs but the creation of jobs suitable for third level graduates. One of the great things about rural Ireland is the huge number of our young people who are getting third level education. I am delighted with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must recognise, however, that third level education has become the single greatest reason for migration from the rural areas. If we want to stop that we will have to meet the challenge of providing graduates with suitable employment in rural areas. This is possible, although some people will tell me it is not. Certainly, with good transport facilities we could put everybody in the country within a 45 minute drive of a wide variety of job choices. New technology and communication will also be of great assistance in creating the possibilities for jobs for those with higher education in <Col N="527" /> rural areas. If we provide suitable comprehensive infrastructure I have no doubt that we will then create the jobs.</P>
    <P>When I became responsible for rural development I looked at the existing policy instruments. We have the Leader programme which in all reality is a small programme. It has done good work but the expenditure is less than £1 million per county per annum. If we compare that to the cost of miles of motorway the £20 million a year would build about four miles of motorway. In terms of investment it is not enough to redress the imbalance. It is a similar story with the Western Development Commission. When I questioned the effectiveness of that I was not questioning the people working on the board. I was just saying that £5 million would not solve the problems of seven counties from Clare to Donegal. If anybody thinks the problem is that simple to solve they are welcome to try. One has to look at a £48 billion plan and then work out the percentage that £5 million or £25 million will represent in that totality.</P>
    <P>I am working at the moment on a programme called Clár. This had its genesis in the Rapid areas that were selected in the cities. The idea is to pick 15 or 16 areas on objective criteria and to give them special priority for expenditure under the national development plan. I have decided to go for one very simple criterion. Social poverty and deprivation is not very easily spatially identified. I looked at the maps of social deprivation according to the experts but what I know is the situation on the ground did not match the maps. The main problem of rural development is the withdrawal of services and transport because of lack of people. It affects rich and poor alike. I am as susceptible, living in Corr na Móna, to the lack of job opportunity for my offspring, to the bad roads and to the withdrawal of services as my less fortunate neighbours. Rural problems, unlike city problems, are not so clearly spatially divided and there is not the same social segregation.</P>
    <P>The areas that we most identify with the classical rural problems we all talk about are those areas that have lost the most population in the last 70 years. I looked at the various centres and I chose to start from 1926. There are a huge number of areas that have lost more than 50% of their population since then. Some have lost 60% or 70%. Their problem is that having lost their population they now find it impossible to attract infrastructural development because people feel it is just not viable to service the area. They get caught in this vortex and at the same time other areas of the country are suffering from exactly the opposite problem.</P>
    <P>Our idea is to get this programme up and running by mid summer and to see it as an implementation programme. We have had the plans, the CDBs &ndash; county development boards &ndash; the ADMs, the Leader programme etc. What this programme will set about doing is getting effec<Col N="528" /> tive delivery on the ground and it will prioritise physical and social infrastructure projects in these areas.</P>
    <P>I have also had a number of successful meetings with the Western Development Commission and we have examined how we can bring their plans to delivery and how their work can be enhanced. The biggest problem and the biggest excuse always in depopulated rural areas for not providing services is lack of population. This has become a vicious circle. My job is to end that vicious circle and to say that the very lack of population should be a priority reason for getting investment rather than a reason for not getting it. Our objective will be radical and will be to turn the world on its head and say that a declining area that has suffered all the classical symptoms of rural decline will now come to the top of the list.</P>
    <P>When I was responsible for the Gaeltacht and the Islands, as Minister of State in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I tried these techniques of development. The islands were the ultimate challenge in rural development, being cut off, small and isolated and most people would have said that they did not even have viable populations. For very moderate expenditure these techniques were hugely successful in terms of motivation, self-development and kick starting regeneration of these areas. If it worked on islands, I have no doubt it will work in much more populous areas, including others that have suffered depopulation. This makes sense when one considers its economic logic. We are taking people out of rural areas and putting them in cities where a social, economic and physical infrastructure needs to be developed, which costs a huge amount of money.  </P>
    <P>Areas other than those on the western seaboard have suffered from depopulation, including parts of counties Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Tipperary, Cork, Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim as well as those on the Atlantic like Sligo. In every rural community one will find schools with plenty of classrooms but not enough children, health centres that could handle twice as many patients, football, hurling, rugby and soccer clubs crying out for players and a lack of customers for pubs, shops, buses and trains. Social and economic infrastructure, whether private or public, tends to be under-utilised in rural areas. Children in urban areas grow up spending half their childhoods in housing estates without ever benefiting from the basic community infrastructure they require. Logic shows that if we develop communities where there is infrastructure and a strong community bond, there will be social advantages and economic sense will be made.</P>
    <P>Our ability to do this is limited only by our vision. Our commitment is all that constrains us in tackling this problem and our will is all that limits us from making sure these areas grow again. Ireland is a small island, not much more than 300 miles long by 150 miles wide so there is no such thing as a peripheral area compared to <Col N="529" /> countries like Canada and the United States. It is possible to ensure that every area shares economic growth. We must manage the spatial distribution of population so that 30 years from now the population of every significant area will have increased compared to 70 years ago. Such a vision and a commitment to its achievement are needed by everyone, whether from an urban or a rural area. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leat, a Chathaoirligh, as ucht an deis labhartha. I am willing to respond to the points Senators make, as there is no point in having a debate if the Minister does not try to address the points that have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate on rural development, which takes place at a critical juncture. I welcome his conversion to the merits of his job as I remember him being less than enthusiastic about his new responsibility for rural development when he was interviewed on radio following his transfer. He said at the time that he is a doer, not a talker and that nobody likes a powerless politician which he felt he was about to become. Having spoken to the Minister of State since his transfer, I feel the history he has inherited will not do him justice as he is developing a flair for his job. Sometimes a poor beginning makes for an exciting end and I hope that will be the case in regard to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>This Government and its predecessors have spoken endlessly about rural development, but nothing substantial has been done. Reference has been made to the Western Development Commission, which I will deal with later. A meeting of the National Rural Development Forum took place in Ballinlough, County Roscommon in 1999, at which the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, said that the publication of the White Paper on Rural Development was a milestone for rural development. Deputy Davern said the national development plan's £6.7 billion for rural development would bring the aspirations of the White Paper to fruition. Equally important, he said, was the fact that many State bodies and the social partners in the private, voluntary and community sectors had an active role to play in delivering the measures of the plan and thereby securing the future of rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years later, we are still talking about rural development and although some progress has been made in planning, nothing substantial has happened on the ground. The frustration of the people is beginning to surface as a result. I cannot go through all the deficiencies in rural areas, such as poor infrastructure. Last Sunday a convoy of articulated trucks held a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; protest about the state of the N26 between Ballina, Westport, Castlebar and Tarmonbarry. The protesters drove from Swinford and Roscommon to Ballaghadereen, where they converged. People are beginning to lose patience and there is a percep<Col N="530" /> tion that one would need to live to 170 to see substantial development in rural Ireland. Actions such as last Sunday's result from such frustration.</P>
    <P>Having done nothing to the N26 for 30 years, it is interesting that Roscommon County Council has begun to make substantial progress. The road has been widened so it is much safer and I am sure many motorists have noticed an improvement as small things can make a difference. Many things needed will be not be dealt with under the national plan until 2015 or 2020, but the commercial life of rural Ireland and especially the west will not wait for a major road until then.</P>
    <P>There are many facets to rural development. Tourism is much neglected in many parts of rural Ireland and there is a considerable imbalance between the west and the east. A total of 30 million people visit Ireland annually but only 10% travel to the west.</P>
    <P>Rural tourism and part-time farming are compatible. Farming is going through a difficult and possibly disastrous period in many respects and farmers must supplement their income with a part-time job in the manufacturing or tourism industries. The IDA's record in attracting industry to the west is very poor. When Galway city is taken out of the equation, the number of jobs created in the five Connacht counties is negligible. A total of 56 jobs were created in County Mayo last year. Part-time farmers in the region are not getting an opportunity to take up employment in industry and this must be focused on. If we are to have a vibrant and affluent rural society, job opportunities must be created in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is conscious of the development of our major cities and there is a concentration on encouraging the IDA and other State agencies to attract industry to rural areas. Industrialists say infrastructural deficiencies do not entice them to set up in the regions. For example, the electricity supply to the west is inadequate. There are few areas west of the River Shannon that could cater for a major IT company such as Intel or Hewlett-Packard, which have set in the Dublin region. The west does not have the infrastructure or electricity generation capacity to support such companies.</P>
    <P>The ESB is planning some major developments, including a 220 kv line in Castlebar. However, it has been stymied by planning obstacles and objections. The process has been delayed and this has added to the ongoing frustration of people in the region. A generating station at Bellacorrick has been mooted to replace the peat-fired station there. However, it will only be a 60 or 70 megawatt station, which will not contribute significantly to the generating capacity of the ESB in the west.</P>
    <P>There is no major port on the west coast and products manufactured in the region must be transported across the country to Dublin Port. If the Government made a substantial investment in this sector the problem would be alleviated. <Col N="531" /> Investing £20 million or £25 million in a deep sea port in the west would cost less than the glass in the windows of the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; in Dublin. Such investment is needed in the west.</P>
    <P>Money is the primary need for rural development. The Western Development Commission has a budget of £5 million this year. Given current economic values, there will no evidence on the ground of its expenditure. Vision and money are needed. The Minister of State has vision and I hope he has enthusiasm. I look forward to progress in the area of rural development over the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of the State to the House and I wish him well in his new portfolio. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion. The Minister of State made a crisp and straightforward contribution regarding what is needed in the area of rural development. I welcome his enthusiasm for his brief and his firm approach to rural development. It is a substantial task which will be measured by the commitment of Government through its response and investment.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey's view that there is a need for targeted investment and to do away with the culture of using the population of an area as a measurement for investment. The N5 was not included in the national development plan on the basis of traffic levels at a particular time but its potential to carry more vehicles was not considered.</P>
      <P>The Government delivered Objective One status for the BMW region and this has provided it with an opportunity to invest specific moneys totalling £18 billion there. It is fervently hoped that the Government will make a firm commitment to address the investment needs of rural Ireland. Targeted investment can redress the imbalance that currently exists and provide an equal opportunity to all citizens. There are serious concerns that if the Government misses this opportunity development in the State will be seriously imbalanced. Population statistics were published recently which highlighted that 53% of our people reside in Leinster. That represents a significant imbalance, which has the potential to increase given the investment that has been outlined in the NDP for the region.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said the education system drives our young people out of rural Ireland. Approximately 70% of second level students in County Mayo continue to third level and 50% of them do not return because they have a high rate of achievement. They will not return until the economic, leisure and other facilities are in place and there are job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey and I are not looking at this issue from the point of view of Mayo, Galway or the western region. This is a national problem which affects places from Cork to Tipperary and Carlow. There has been major decline in many <Col N="532" /> parts of the country and many post offices have been closed. I heard on a radio programme today that Allied Irish Banks has closed 37 rural offices and regional depots in the past year and a half and that most of the ten or 15 offices it has opened are concentrated in colleges, third level education centres and shopping centres. Consideration is not being given to what has been taken away from the public and that has led to a decline in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the financial institutions and post offices. I understand the British are introducing a card system through their post offices which will provide services to pensioners and people who do not have bank accounts. ATMs are important for the tourism and agri-tourism business in towns with 700, 800 or 900 people where banks have been closed. People must have access to money. It costs a financial institution approximately £30,000 per annum to service an ATM. We must consider using post offices to provide basic services which will add to the economic structure of a town.</P>
    <P>The Government recently took a stand in relation to the establishment of a section in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to meet the commitments given to the BMW region. I would like more positive decisions, a more targeted approach and the creation of more jobs in the BMW region. I would like to see reports brought before the House which deal with the need for jobs in these areas and the distribution of employment in the regions, particularly the BMW region.</P>
    <P>Substantial investment will be made between 2000 and 2006 under the national development plan to deal with some of the structural defects in the State. If this is not handled properly, a bigger imbalance will be created and that will not help the country in the long term. This is an opportune time to look at the country as a whole. We are in the process of introducing the national spatial plan which should help the Government to see where financial commitments are required.</P>
    <P>I hope the airports, such as Knock International Airport and other airports in the BMW region and throughout the country, are part of our economic and industrial development. Although there has been State and local investment in them, they have been shabbily treated by Governments. The people who run these airports have shown great commitment. Many of them had great difficulty dealing with airlines and with other people who provide services. Because these airports have been managed properly, they have paid for themselves and a service has been sustained in these areas. There is a tremendous opportunity for the Government to give a firm commitment to these airports to allow them to achieve their potential by developing them and providing the necessary financial and other facilities in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the first time the Minister of State has been in the House since he was appointed Mini<Col N="533" /> ster of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We dealt with him when he was Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I thank him for his commitment to north Mayo which has suffered substantial job losses in recent years. This area does not have much opportunity for job creation. I also thank him for establishing the core group which analysed the prospect of investment in Mayo, particularly north Mayo. This commitment to the north Mayo region is a priority of the Minister of State and it will be delivered on in the future.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, county enterprise boards and other groups have a role to play in supporting and maintaining community development. Local authorities are doing substantial work to rejuvenate our towns. There has been little take-up of the tax incentives for small towns recently announced by the Government. Local authorities can play a greater part in encouraging people to avail of these tax incentives and in informing the public. Positive work can be done in this area. Improvements have been made in infrastructure and in the provision of services, such as sewerage and water, which will help these towns to grow. We have a substantial way to go but we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is a major task ahead of us, but there are also tremendous opportunities. I support the Minister of State's approach in identifying the specific areas of major decline. If we, with the support of the Government, deal with 15 or 16 areas in a positive, planned and determined way, it will form the basis for further investment in the future and it will be a great way to monitor the input of the Government and this committed Minister of State to rural development. It will be the blueprint for further development. I expect the Government will support the Minister of State's proposed plan to tackle this issue, which is a major challenge and needs to be addressed in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment to this portfolio. I was extremely pleased to hear his contribution. I am not someone who lightly gives plaudits to anyone, but his contribution was outstanding. It was the best contribution on rural development I have heard in this House since I became a Member. He identified and understood the issues and he showed a positive and enthusiastic outlook for the future.</P>

    <P>One of the difficulties with rural development is that, too often, it has been linked with the decline and the changing face of agriculture, but it is much more than that. We should look upon rural development as being about people and living communities. It does not matter whether people are involved in agriculture, tourism, health care or whatever. We must strive to have towns and villages throughout rural Ireland in which people enjoy living. What can we do to <Col N="534" /> bring that back into rural Ireland, which is dying on its feet? There is little point in saying otherwise. All the schemes we have in place, albeit doing good work in their own areas, are only scratching the surface. That is the reason I was interested to hear the Minister of State talk about the Clár programme. I look forward to that with great enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>If we examine the issue in the context of the development of the economy over the past five or six years, the economy has thrived. We have a huge balance of payments surplus. Unemployment is down to 3.5%. Who could have thought of figures of that nature five, six or even ten years ago? They were just pie in the sky. Unfortunately, however, people are still leaving rural areas and, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, they are leaving areas where the social fabric exists to move into towns and cities where it does not exist. That is causing a total imbalance and it is imperative on us to try to put in place a structure whereby the balance can be tipped the other way.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves a fundamental question. Are we prepared to have a bias in favour of rural areas to bring about that balance? We should have that bias. What form it would take is open to suggestion and debate, but we should have that balance. If a post office is not turning over enough money or a bank is not doing enough business, the answer is to close it down because the faceless men and women in suits in offices somewhere say it is uneconomic. The figures back them up, so they close the office down. Our definition of economics needs to be redefined because figures mean nothing if people cannot live. We must set up a system whereby people in rural Ireland want to live there.</P>
    <P>The frightening statistics about the decline in population in rural areas hide one major factor, that is, the age structure of those people. All the enterprising and educated young people are moving out, and these areas are left with those who are not in the same position to drive the local economy. We must put in place the systems, structures and investment in rural areas regardless of whether it is the west, the east, the South or the North. It happens everywhere. These systems must be put in place to encourage young people, having achieved their educational qualifications, to come back and invest in their own communities by way of their presence. I see nothing wrong with people wanting to live in Kiltimagh, Ballon, Knocktopher or wherever and working ten or 15 miles away, but it is important that they live in these areas. I have no doubt that if we do that properly, the quality of life will be enhanced, not just in rural Ireland but in urban areas also.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I fully support the programme to develop the major roads infrastructure. I am aware many people are putting question marks over that issue. Communities in my constituency and many other constituencies feel strongly about where these roads might or might <Col N="535" /> not be sited, but it is imperative that we have them because it will mean that people can move around much more freely. Equally, our rail service has to be improved. People will say it is uneconomic, but what is economics about? </P>
    <P>The issue of decentralisation has been debated here at length and it has been looked upon as the panacea for all the ills of our local areas. It is imperative that we decentralise, not just in terms of central Government but even in terms of local government. If an area has a particular advantage in terms of decentralisation of a particular body or organisation, it is important that we go for it because it has that strength and advantage. A case in point is Carlow, which has an institute of technology and the crop science centre for Teagasc, yet the Teagasc headquarters is based in Sandymount Avenue in Dublin. We must get real. What is the point in having the headquarters in Sandymount Avenue? </P>
    <P>The crop testing centre of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is based in Backweston. It also had a location in Ballinacurra, in Cork, until relatively recently, but many of the trials carried out by those Department centres were tested in Oakpark, in Carlow. Why not move all of them together to a location where everybody can work in conjunction with one another? Because of the presence of an institute of technology, there is also work in the area of crop biotechnology. It should all be moved together and allowed to develop because we will get the ribbon effect throughout the area in terms of development. There will be a professional capacity within an area and all their work has to be serviced. The towns five, ten or 15 miles away will provide those services and people will want to live in that area. That is the way decentralisation should take place.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not put decentralisation on the back burner, which I am concerned is currently the case, but when we decentralise we must do it for the right reasons. We have to think not just in terms of the next five or ten years or, unfortunately in the business we are all in, the next general election or the one after it. We have to think in terms of the lifetime of communities.</P>
    <P>A matter that causes me great concern is the difficulty people experience in getting planning permission to build houses in rural areas. As a landscape architect, I abhor what we all call ribbon development. It is wrong and it does not enhance any society or the area in which one lives, but if somebody wants to live in rural Ireland and they have a site on which to build a house, no local authority should be in a position to tell that person they cannot live there. That is wrong. It is important to listen to people. We can develop new and old housing in rural areas far better than we have done in the past and far more sensitively in terms of the landscape, but we can also enhancing rural communities. If we do that the right way, get these faceless people who sit in <Col N="536" /> offices making decisions out of our hair and make the decisions properly, we will move forward much more positively in the future.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length, but it is important to focus on a few issues. I compliment the Minister of State. He has been in the Department a relatively short time but his background is coming to the fore. I look forward to the developments he will bring forward in the future. I sincerely hope that in ten years' time, the people in this House and in the Lower House will be able to say that we have a vibrant countryside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, and wish him well in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. From his work in other Departments and in the private sector before becoming a Member of the Dáil, I know he will make a great success of his new role.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate on rural and western development. This issue includes many areas such as infrastructure, agricultural development, industrial development, community development, tourism and education. We must examine these issues carefully if we are to protect rural areas.</P>
      <P>Things are going well in many areas. This is the time to examine what is happening and what we can do to improve facilities and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. National primary routes are being developed which are essential to bring people into and through the regions. However, problems arise as a result of these developments and some people perceive difficulties. Many people must stand back and look at the bigger picture. They must consider the long-term development of the country and the regions and allow these roads to be developed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We must carefully examine the question of tolling these roads. If one is going to the west or to Galway, one may have to pay two tolls. The BMW region is a disadvantaged area which needs more people, more development and more money. We need these roads, but we should not start by charging people to come into the region.</P>
      <P>Public transport services do not exist in many rural areas. Senior citizens are entitled to a free bus pass. However, many such people point out that this would be fine if public transport was available. We must address this issue. There must be co-operation between local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies to provide public or feeder transport to bring people to major towns and to the main rail and bus networks.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new gas pipeline which will bring supplies from the gas field off County Mayo. All towns in the region must be connected to the pipeline to provide development opportunities based on gas supplied at a reasonable cost. Coming from the midlands, we tend to be passed over as regards such developments. The gas pipeline must be extended into the midlands as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> The development of rural areas is largely based on agriculture, but many farmers survive on low incomes. The Minister of State should examine the farm retirement scheme under which many farmers retired to allow well-trained, qualified farmers to take over their businesses. Most farmers need an off-farm income. However, one condition of the scheme is that the off-farm income cannot exceed 50% of the on-farm income. If a farmer earns more than 50%, the individual who took the major step of retiring to allow his or her son or daughter to take over loses the pension. This is a deplorable provision which must be changed quickly if we wish to keep people in rural areas and attract young, active people into farming. The industry has gone through a difficult period since this scheme was introduced and young farmers require an off-farm income to enable them to stay on the land and to develop their farms. This issue must be examined immediately.</P>
    <P>The midlands has experienced the closure of ESB stations and cutbacks by Bord na Móna. However, I welcome recent developments such as the granting of planning permission for a new ESB station in Shannonbridge and other developments in Lanesborough. These are welcome and positive developments and I hope these stations come on stream quickly. At present industrialists must install generators to guarantee a supply of electricity to enable them to continue to provide employment in rural areas and small towns. They should not have to do so as we should have an adequate supply of electricity to enable industrialists to create employment without worrying about being left in the dark at a critical production period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the town renewal schemes. However, many of these schemes will be non-runners because the expert group which dealt with this issue did not visit the towns to examine them closely. Areas with nothing but grass were zoned for refurbishment. How can one refurbish such a site to enable people to develop buildings and avail of tax breaks? This is wrong and the group should have allowed people to build or to refurbish sites for residential or commercial use. This issue must be revisited as quickly as possible as we depend on the town renewal scheme to generate development in rural towns.</P>
    <P>Recent CSO statistics indicate that the population of Dublin will increase by about 500,000 while there will be a reduction of about 20,000 in the midlands. People will move from the midlands, which is not what we wish to see. We must ensure that regions such as the midlands develop and prosper.</P>
    <P>As local authority members we must also examine developments in the regions, including, as Senator Gibbons said, county development plans. In many cases we tend to move through such plans without giving proper thought to rural development. Major problems have arisen as a result. I <Col N="538" /> thoroughly agree we should not have ribbon development but people from rural areas should have the opportunity of providing their own homes, thus enabling them to remain there. In that way parish schools will avoid closure and hurling and football teams will survive. Many rural areas are facing such problems.</P>
    <P>The projections for general economic and population trends in the midlands signal difficult times ahead. It is time to consider seriously the establishment of a development commission for the midlands along the lines of the Western Development Commission, with real powers and an appropriate investment budget. As the Minister of State said, the time for talking is over, it is time for action. Everyone here has confidence in the Minister of State to ensure there will be a turnaround in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on his contribution on this important issue. I cannot think of anyone more suitably qualified to hold the rural development portfolio than him. During the years, a large percentage of his contributions have dealt with revitalising and renewing rural areas. This is an important issue, particularly for those who represent constituencies in the midlands and west. For such decisions to be made, however, people must also believe in them on the east coast because that, to a great extent, is where the power lies. Unless decisions are made here that take account of the difficulties we are experiencing in the midlands and west, they will not have the desired effect.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Government on a number of issues, including the case taken to Europe by it to retain Objective One status in 13 counties of the Border, midlands and west region. Other important initiatives have also been undertaken by it, including the funding of the Western Development Commission and the designation of a tax incentive scheme for rural renewal. While I would like to see the scheme being extended, it certainly has contributed enormously towards the revitalisation of a number of rural villages. If there is a setback, it is that copybook planners apply Manchester guidelines to rural county villages, which is a major impediment. Why can a national policy not override those type of impractical guidelines that are not in keeping with what is intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Famine, 150,000 people lived in County Roscommon without electricity, running water, sewerage schemes or reasonable housing. Today the county has a population of 50,000. We have all the facilities I mentioned, yet it is practically impossible to get planning permission for a house in a rural area. Something must be seriously wrong for such a situation to have developed. How are we to ensure population growth and revitalise rural areas unless simple housing development is part of the policy? The <Col N="539" /> onus is on local authorities to grant planning permission for such development.</P>
    <P>As things stand in many parts of the west and north west, industries cannot be established due to inadequate electricity supplies and the lack of fibre optic cable for telecommunications. Thus, a large section of the country is being excluded from industrialisation even if industrialists wished to establish businesses there. As regards the road infrastructure, there was a protest last week over the condition of the N5. That national primary route includes a 40 miles stretch running through County Roscommon and a further 50 miles stretch running through Mayo, but it is sub-standard. If any industrialist travelling on that road got back home without crashing his car, he certainly would not go down again to establish a business. It is a major impediment to progress.</P>
    <P>Strategic decisions should be taken to install heavy duty cable for electricity supplies, fibre optic cable for telecommunications, and a reasonable road infrastructure for improved transport links. Those basic requirements must be prioritised in order for the west, north west and midlands to develop. While there are many fine elements in the national development plan, those basic elements are missing. The NDP states that the N5 will be considered for funding in 2019, although some parts of it have been included in the current plan.</P>
    <P>I represent an electoral area comprising 9,000 people, where only one village has a public sewerage scheme. How can an area develop if it does not have such schemes? Modern sewerage schemes are cheap and can be installed for £500,000 with a contribution of £50,000 or £60,000 from the developer. The technology is excellent and units can be lifted into place by crane, catering cheaply for 100 or 200 houses. Practical steps can be taken to effect rural development and the Minister of State is the right person to do so. Long-winded policy statements may sound great, particularly when made at conferences attended by the media, but when the headlines are forgotten the potholes and dangerous bends remain and there is still no sewerage in the village.</P>
    <P>County managers and State agencies should be called in and asked what they have in mind for the counties concerned. We should see what input they can make concerning communications infrastructure, for example. I understand the money is available for such projects provided that we go about it in a practical way.</P>
    <P>A very strong case for decentralisation should be made. Dublin is bursting at the seams, as the Minister of State said in his statement, and the projection is that things will get worse. The Government decision we are told is imminent should be to decentralise to the areas where there is an opportunity to increase population, taking away pressure and revitalising the counties in the Objective One area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> The matter of jobs will not be handled properly until infrastructure is in place. However, there are opportunities that are not being pursued by the agencies. I still believe there is a bias towards the city even for companies which do not need the type of infrastructure I am talking about. I have found this recently and I ask that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland be instructed as to what Government policy is and told it is their job to implement it. They are not independent republics and they cannot go ahead and do things as they see fit. While these agencies may not be direct Civil Service entities and have certain statutory remit, that remit must be to implement Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is great opportunity in forestry. We have an existing policy on forestry but tens of thousands of acres of cut-away bogs and other areas are being made available to us. For some reason the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will not entertain proposals regarding them. The Department says it is unsuitable, that it does not have a policy on it and that therefore it cannot be taken on. I fail to understand that. Cut-away bogs and low-lying areas are suitable, if not for broad-leafed trees then certainly for spruces or pines. While it is not within the Minister of State's remit I ask that he take up that point.</P>
    <P>The issue of health services is a national one. In the absence of general hospitals and public transport it is important that we have welfare homes and geriatric facilities. The most horrible thing that can be done to an old couple is that one of them is made to go 40 to 50 miles to get a place in a geriatric hospital, meaning their spouse has to get there once every two or three weeks by hired car. No greater hardship can be suffered by an elderly couple than that. What is needed is the provision of welfare homes in suitable locations to which people ten miles away can get. This is not understood in cities. In some cases, from Galway city I could get to Dublin quicker than to the furthest ends of the Western Health Board area. I bet that is not understood at Department level.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State and the House for the opportunity to say these few words. I will give him every support I can and I have no doubt that during his term he will advance the case of developing infrastructure in the areas mentioned. What will naturally follow is that people will move to and live in them. That is what we want at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend my support to much of what has been said here. The last topic spoken of by Senator Finneran was one of the things I was thinking about. It is wrong to take people out of their own environment and move them 40 or 50 miles away. Though I hate to say it, it definitely shortens their lives to be away from their people and everything they have been used to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> If the Minister of State does half as much in rural development as he did for the Gaeltacht regions when he was in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the whole country will be changed. I may be a little parochial on this &ndash; that is the way the cookie crumbles &ndash; but in the Gaeltacht of west Kerry there are not five yards of bad road. Every yard has a perfect surface but when you come out of those areas and into those the county council is responsible for, the roads are bad again. What the Minister of State did at his last Department was confined rural development to the Gaeltacht areas. He put small amounts of money into slipways and piers and then started on the roads in a proper manner with the scéim na mbóithre áise. He threw down the gauntlet to county councils saying, &ldquo;There is £200,000, you match it with £200,000 and get the roads done.&rdquo; He insisted the roads be tackled from the farthest points away and come in to the baile mór. They came in a lot quicker than was ever thought possible. The Minister of State wrought a total change in all the Gaeltacht areas in terms of roads and other matters.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Caffrey and I too saw on television last week those who were disgruntled about the condition of roads in Roscommon. Even if you got a magic wand in the morning and said all the roads would be improved it would still be an impossibility. There has to be a priority. You have to start somewhere and end somewhere. Just like those people up the country we have a road from Tralee to Dingle which is down as being first class when only 12 miles of it have been improved. Part of it is in a terrible condition and part of it has been upgraded. The NRA report clearly specifies that the road will be brought up to national secondary route standard by 2006. Those living along it and travelling it are not satisfied with that. I would rather turn my attention away from the roads because there is a huge amount of money available for all types of roads and I do not know why we are not getting down to it. They are being done but my big worry is for the small villages and towns. To use the term &ldquo;village&rdquo; signifies the post office, the church, the creamery and the football field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of planning. There is a little baile between Tralee and Dingle and there is a 30 mile speed limit through it. It is not really a town but a cluster of houses along two miles of road. Planning permission was applied for recently by four people but they were turned down. I could not believe it because I was slightly involved with local politicians across the board, Fine Gael and other parties. Together we tried to get planning permission for these people. The local engineer checked and said there was no problem with the sites. The road had been widened eight or nine years previously and from the <Col N="542" /> road to the fence there was about 25 to 30 feet in places. They were turned down. They did everything necessary and provided one opening for the field and a slip road and so on, but they were turned down. To make matters worse, they were told if they applied again they would get planning permission.</P>
      <P>When I was on the council it was part of the county development plan that a farmer's son, daughter or family member would be entitled to build on their own land. If we acted according to our council and planning officers they would knock some of the houses built 80 or 90 years ago. One sees three or four scattered houses in the countryside. That would not be allowed today because those in charge say we are spoiling the countryside, but it is they who are doing so. This creates a bad taste in the mouth for young people.</P>
      <P>I am referring to Lispole, a place Senator O'Toole knows well. There is a 30 mile limit and four houses with one opening involved. Planning permission was refused.</P>

      <P>There are grievances everywhere regarding planning.</P>
      <P>We are going to reach the stage where we need post offices again because the banks are not coming up to standard. They are not doing what ordinary people want them to do. The new fangled approach involves filling out a form and phoning the bank to have your bills paid, but many people are suspicious of that because there will be a charge every time. We are fast drifting away from the day when one could go the bank to pay one's ESB and telephone bills. The banks do not want to see people any more.</P>
      <P>Two post offices in the peninsula have been closed, ceann amháin i nDún Chaoin and another in Inch. The nearest post office to the people of those communities is seven or eight miles away, where public transport is terrible. One can only get a bus at 7 a.m. and at 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister of State to do what he did for the Gaeltacht areas. If he does the same for rural Ireland he will be remembered a lot longer than his grandfather.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan is part of our future. The internal migration in the country is utterly damaging and is eroding communities. It is also completely unnecessary. I have often told the story of the difference in infrastructure between us and our neighbours. For example, my opposite number in the UK, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, lives in York and his office is in north London. He leaves York every morning on the 6.45 a.m. train, arrives in King's Cross station in London at 8.30 a.m. and gets to his office by 8.45 a.m. To put that in context, he lives further away from his office than I would if I lived in Dingle. The idea of someone in Ireland com<Col N="543" /> muting those distances is something we do not understand.</P>
    <P>Mayo has had an extraordinarily strong campaign to get third level education more widely available in the county and it has had some success, despite the lack of an enthusiastic response. That is one way to deal with this issue but there is no reason people cannot travel from Castlebar to Dublin, if that is where they attend college, by leaving at 7 a.m. and getting to Dublin about 70 minutes later. This would give them plenty of time to get to college and to get home in the evening. They could nearly go home for lunch if the system were right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how long the lunch break could be. This week, in Mór-roinn na hEorpa, a new rail service is being opened from Calais to Marseilles. Those trains travel at over 100 m.p.h. and the reality is that they are still investing. Why is it necessary for local communities to agitate and persuade politicians about something as reasonable as opening a railway line from Sligo to Limerick? The same people closed down the Harcourt Street line years ago against the available advice, when we said they were completely wrong. The same people wanted to put roads along the canals, which was proposed not long before I entered the Seanad. The same people are now closing down railways, though rail travel is the most efficient, effective and luxurious form of transport. The Victorians knew something about travel. They stuck with the railways and they were right.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell is in the House. In recent times there has been some improvement in the Dublin-Sligo rail line but it has been a shambles and an embarrassment to the people of Sligo. I remember arriving in Sligo on a number of occasions by train and on every occasion people would say how terrible the rail line was and how at least the train was only 20 minutes late. That was what the people of Sligo had to put up with. They could seldom use the train because they did not know if they could depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These investments involve small amounts of money. When the Athlone bypass was built the new bridge across the Shannon was erected at Athlone. That was very important in terms of opening up western infrastructure and I have no complaints about it, but if the same amount of money had been spent on the Sligo-Dublin rail line it would have brought the line up to the standard of the Dublin-Cork or Dublin-Galway lines. That needs to be done and the people of those areas should put the boot in hard on Governments of whatever hue to make sure it happens. If there were easy access between Sligo, towns in Mayo, Galway, Ennis and Limerick a whole new area would be opened up. There is a third level college in Sligo, part of a third level college in <Col N="544" /> Castlebar and a number of third level institutions in Galway and Limerick.</P>
    <P>If I had to go to a funeral at 7 p.m. in Cork tomorrow I could not return by train. That is ludicrous. The same applies to the west, which means we are clogging up the roads unnecessarily because of the lack of investment.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachaise, táimse cinnte dá mba rud é go raibh daoine in ann oideachas a bheith acu sa chéad, dara agus tríú leibhéal ina áit dúchais fhéin, sa Ghaeltacht in some places but not sa Ghaeltachtaí i gcónaí, dá mba rud é go raibh sé sin ann agus go mbeadh a gcairde acu sa háiteanna sin ag dul tríd na trí leibhéal oideachais, sin iad na cairde a bheadh acu go deo. It is well known that the friends people make at third level are the friends they have for life. If those people were from their own communities and areas a whole new set of relationships and synergies would be created which would be useful for the future.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the development of rural Ireland which is not mentioned often enough is the need for grant aid and support to ensure that those in the west and rural areas have the same access to cultural activities as those in the centre of Dublin. There should be proper grant aid support for orchestras, for example. The Limerick Chamber Orchestra is particularly good at touring the west and went to Inishbofin and various other places last year. We should ensure the quality of life and access to culture for those in the west is on a par with anywhere else on the island.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald's point about housing is crucial. It has now reached the stage where people cannot live in their own areas. I hope the Minister of State agrees that the way in which the tax deal for certain areas was operated &ndash; where those building houses could get a tax break &ndash; created ghost towns and villages. I am not totally opposed to this, but it could be better directed. However, a situation where a deal is available to people from Dublin to buy a house in Westport while Westport children cannot build or buy a site for themselves, is to move backwards. We must discriminate positively in favour of local people. It will not work any other way in any community. It must be attractive for people to stay in their own areas.</P>
    <P>On the question of transport infrastructure, the railways are not being developed due to the views of the business community, particularly IBEC, which has a view of the world which includes a cost survey of the running of railways which suggests that railways will not make a profit. There is no service from which to make a profit. If people knew they could walk out of their front door for trains that ran every hour to and from Dublin until about 11 p.m., they would not travel in their cars. If the service was available, it would create its own demand.</P>
    <P>We should not listen to the negative thinking of people in the centre of Dublin who believe that there are no people interested in living in the <Col N="545" /> west. The majority of those who migrate from the west to Dublin do so out of economic or practical necessity, not out of a desire to live in a large city. The future of the west and rural Ireland will be maintained and protected and advanced by investment in infrastructure more than anything else. People should not lose out in any way, be it artistically, financially, culturally or educationally by staying where they are. That is where we must focus our attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuiv, to the House. It is always great to see him returning to where he started off as a Member of the Oireachtas and to see him doing so well in his portfolio standing up for the parts of Ireland that are not getting their fair share of the success of the Celtic tiger. I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole. This topic is being discussed following a request from Senator Chambers on the Order of Business and I am glad that we found time to discuss it before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a case for three particular parts of the BMW region: the north Westmeath area where I live, the north Longford area next door to me and that part of County Cavan close to Mullahoran and Bellenagh which has witnessed a decline in population in the past 30 years of 41%. North Westmeath is an area only 50 miles from Dublin, while it is only 70 miles from Dublin to north Longford and County Cavan. In 1967, my home area in north Westmeath was in a five seat constituency, it then dropped to a four seater and is now a three seater. It is just 55 miles from Dublin. If the population is allowed to decline in a similar fashion, in the next local elections we will be part of the Mullingar local electoral area. This is neither acceptable nor fair.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State has offered to spend a day in my area, meeting the various organisations, assessing how he can best help us and what incentives can be given to help the communities in those areas help themselves. The areas that I mentioned have been spoken about many times by many organisations. However, there has been substantial recent road infrastructural investment in the area. There is a dual carriageway to Kells, a motorway from Kilcock to Mullingar and the Mullingar bypass which will continue on to Longford. I hope these projects will be open to transport by the end of 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's attitude has been a breath of fresh air to both Members of the Oireachtas and the people. He is the person in charge of the attempt to create a master plan to protect the survival of rural life in the areas I have mentioned. It is unfortunate that certain professionals &ndash; gardaí, bank workers, teachers and others &ndash; are now living in our larger towns. Their loss to the smaller communities and parishes where they work during the day is enor<Col N="546" /> mous. Some 25 to 40 years ago, these people were the backbone of the many social and sports organisations making a contribution to the vibrancy of a parish. It is always a few people who keep things going in every parish, and the loss of these community leaders is a new development in the past ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>If we could have a level pitch in Mullingar, we should have the gas pipeline running to the town. I am aware that it is running from Galway to Dublin and will stop at Dalystown. However, I would like to see the supply of natural gas extended to Mullingar, to give the town an opportunity of standing on a level playing field when it attempts to attract new industry and jobs.</P>
    <P>The people of Mullingar and north Westmeath are looking forward to the proposed Irish Transport Museum, under discussion with many Departments. The museum project will be a catalyst for countrywide tourism development. Its concept has been developed in collaboration with the National Railway Museum in York, of which Senator O'Toole spoke. He has a friend who was communicating daily from it. It is Europe's largest transport museum and the current European Museum of the Year.</P>
    <P>I hope the museum in Mullingar will provide for a uniquely interactive recreation of our transport past and it will be a tribute to the men and women who worked on our railways, roads and canals. The project will be the catalyst for new tourism enterprises along the Royal Canal from Killucan to Ballynacarrigy and beyond. The museum points the way to the creation of a heritage railway line in County Westmeath from Mullingar to Athlone, linking our two principle towns &ndash; from the Shannon to Mullingar and the area just north of Mullingar which I have pointed out is rapidly declining in population.</P>
    <P>This line from Mullingar to Athlone will give tourism opportunities to the villages of Castletown Geoghegan, Streamstown and Moate, providing ideal locations for filming and other tourism related activities. There is a virgin line, probably the longest in the British Isles, running from Mullingar to Athlone. It is 29 miles long. Linking with the existing attractions in the area, this project is aimed at making County Westmeath a tourist destination rather than a stopover. More than that, its scale means that it will be a flagship project for the entire midlands.</P>
    <P>This project is also planned to include a strong additional commercial element which would allow the museum to be an attraction of the highest international quality while providing additional high quality jobs for the area. Its inclusion in a plan for economic and infrastructural development around Mullingar station would make this very special. It would allow Mullingar and County Westmeath to take the imaginative leap into major employment in new information technologies. Midland towns such as Longford, Tullamore and Cavan, the home town of the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, were all favoured <Col N="547" /> with decentralisation. Mullingar has not been so favoured. That would be one way for the Government to make an investment that is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Victorian station in Mullingar offers unique tourism potential. The town has an existing fibre-optic infrastructure to allow many new industries to locate there. Mullingar also has the powerful combination of a semi-State company anxious to develop profitable services, local business investors who believe in the town and an excellent and forward-looking local authority in Westmeath County Council. These interests can come together to make Mullingar a model town and Westmeath a model county for the new era.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to contribute. I hope I will be able to pass on a copy of the press release on Mullingar station from which I quoted to the Minister of State after he concludes his business in the House this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am not as well prepared as the Leader because I did not believe I would have an opportunity to contribute since I had to attend a number of meetings today.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State for the work he did for the Gaeltacht areas, most of which are situated in the west, and for the islands in particular. Prior to the last general election he was solely responsible for preparing our party's policy on rural development. While only part of that work was relevant to his work as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, a great deal of what he prepared has helped to rejuvenate Gaeltacht areas. The Minister of State entered the Department and I do not know whether it was because there was so much money in the Exchequer at the time, but he managed to extract from the Minister for Finance substantial funding for the Gaeltacht areas and the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking in the area I represent I have often stated that we did not need the Minister for the Environment and Local Government because we had a Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, acting in that capacity at the Department of the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. He was extremely successful in procuring substantial funding for Gaeltacht projects and infrastructural work, such as repairs to roads etc., which had been neglected for many years. Although we were sorry to see the Minister of State leave the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, we now have one of our own <i>in situ</i> and I assure him that she is carrying on the fantastic work he began. I am delighted the Minister of State has taken up his new position because I know he will encourage the Department and its officials to provide the funding he requires to do his job. In addition, I know he will ensure that a <Col N="548" /> proper level of money is invested in rural and western development.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach visited Gartan prior to the last general election and stated that he intended to retain Objective One status for the west. He succeeded in ensuring that this status was retained for the 13 counties which form what is known as the BMW region. Some structures have been established by the Western Development Commission, but progress has been extremely slow and we are still waiting for certain programmes to come on stream. The latter are meant to be in place in the period 2000 to 2006 and 2002 is almost upon us. I hope the Minister of State will be able to cut through the bureaucratic red tape that is delaying progress. Should the money in the Exchequer disappear in future years &ndash; the foot and mouth disease crisis will probably have a particularly adverse effect on this year's budget surplus &ndash; we may be left behind. It is important that we get things up and running as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will take a leaf from Senator Cassidy's book and discuss my county. Donegal is completely cut off from the remainder of the country as a result of partition. It is similar to Alaska in the United States in that it is isolated in the uppermost corner of the island. When I hear other Senators refer to the placing of tolls on bypasses and CPO compensation for farmers in respect of the new motorways being built in the midlands and the south-west, I immediately think about the tortuous journey I am obliged to make on each occasion I return to Donegal. There are no plans to improve the A5 which runs through the centre of the county and leads into Northern Ireland. On many occasions I travel through Sligo, but I often encounter difficulties in making this journey. I also encounter difficulties when travelling on the N3 through County Cavan and into County Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be an impetus in the NRA to provide the proper funding for road development in the west and the north-west. When I say &ldquo;the west&rdquo;, I am referring to the area that runs from the Minister of State's constituency up into Donegal. Regardless of whether Senator Tom Fitzgerald likes it, the west is not comprised of Counties Galway, Kerry etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Those areas have been well catered for. Senators Chambers, Burke and Caffrey often refer to the disgraceful condition of the railway line to Mayo. County Donegal does not have a railway line. It had such a line when I was at secondary school and I used to catch the train at Strabane, pass through Northern Ireland and transfer to the Dublin train at Portadown which would bring me to my school in County Meath. However, that line no longer exists and the only means of entering Donegal is to travel by road. <Col N="549" /> Plans for the N2 have been totally rejected. It is proposed to build a motorway which will run as far as Ashbourne and after that a number of bypasses will be put in place around the towns between Ashbourne and Monaghan, but that will not be sufficient to attract industries to Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have attended meetings in Donegal at which industrialists stated that the regional airports at Carrickfinn and Derry would not provide the solution in terms of gaining quick access to the county. In the first instance, major airlines will not service the area because a large enough proportion of the population will not travel by air and, second, people would be obliged to travel an hour or two each way to get to the airport. The road network is the main infrastructural tool with which to attract industries into places such as Donegal. Many young people are leaving the county because they cannot obtain employment. It is not possible to create jobs unless the required infrastructure is in place to attract business.</P>
      <P>Two small computer companies, one of which Senator Fitzgerald is familiar with because his son worked for it, located their operations in Dungloe, but they were obliged to leave because they could not attract properly skilled management operatives to come in and train other personnel. One of the reasons it is not possible to attract properly qualified people who require ample salaries is that they encounter major difficulties getting out of the county if they want to go somewhere for the weekend. In addition, there are no social activities, leisure centres or certain sports facilities available for these people. Part of the reason for this is that the same criteria are applied to Donegal as are applied to other counties when it comes to making judgments. For example, Deputy Gildea is supposed to have received a promise of funding for a swimming pool in a rural area of the county. The matter has been discussed at local authority level and we have met consultants who insist on applying the same criteria which obtain in respect of building a swimming pool in counties Meath or Dublin. They must realise that the levels of population are completely different and rid themselves of the idea that standards, rules and regulations must be strictly applied. If we are intent on developing underdeveloped areas, we must bypass the bureaucracy and provide the proper funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment schemes are being effectively shut down by the rules and regulations that are being introduced. I do not know why the rules for such schemes which obtain in Navan should also obtain in Cornamona or Dungloe because the level of unemployment in the latter areas is high, while in other areas there is almost full employment. Community employment schemes are great because they take people off the dole and give them the opportunity to feel proud by virtue of the fact that they can go out to work and contribute to their communities. <Col N="550" /> They are supposed to be training schemes, but in the west they should be a source of unemployment benefit because of the high levels of unemployment there.</P>
    <P>The required tourism infrastructure is not being put in place. I will bet that when the new programme comes on stream, the old reliables that sucked up the funding in the past will do so again. Proper grants and tax relief must be provided. I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in three successive budget debates, to put in place a rural renewal scheme for west Donegal but I am still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on my main hobby horse, the fishing industry. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fahey. He was a bit slow in getting out of the starting blocks and I was afraid the civil servants in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources had nobbled him the way they had every Minister in that Department for the past 25 years. He spoke recently about the controls we have had to accept while the Spaniards, Dutch and everyone else do whatever they want, and the way our fishing rights were dissipated in 1973. We in west Donegal have little industry other than tourism and fishing. I do not see why, to satisfy the rules from Brussels and the rest of the European population, we in west Donegal cannot use our natural resources. We have 11% of the territorial water and 4% of the quota.</P>
    <P>I have great confidence in the Minister of State's ability in the portfolio he has been given and I hope the Government will accede to his requests. I know he has the ideas and I know that, as with the Gaeltacht, he will try to put the budget in place to allow significant improvements in infrastructure and the standard of living of those in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for the debate. Much of what was said mirrors concepts I have put forward since I came to the job. I believe the ideas reflect what politicians at all levels, both local and national, have said but which have not been put into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey referred to statements I made when I came into the job. He was right. I did not want to be in the job if I could not walk out at the end and say I had made a significant difference, that I had delivered on issues Members referred to, which every politician in rural areas knows need to be done. I am full of enthusiasm because, in the intervening months, the support I have received from Government, especially from the Taoiseach, in developing and progressing this programme has been incredible. When I articulated my views &ndash; I do not beat about the bush <Col N="551" />&ndash; about what needed to be done and what was being taken on when I came to the job, the Taoiseach responded positively.</P>
    <P>The model for what I want to do in rural Ireland is the same operation we put in place in the Gaeltacht areas and the islands, only on a much larger scale. If it can work in places as peripheral as those, it can work more easily and effectively in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first question we must ask ourselves is whether people want to live in rural Ireland. I will give the answer to that question in two lines. First, who travels on the buses parked on Friday evenings on the quays in Dublin? It is young people going home. Second, the waiting lists in the Civil Service for transfer to decentralised offices run to years. People are trying to get back to the west, north-west, south-west or wherever. If one does not believe people want to get back to those areas, why are people queuing, in one case every weekend and in another for years, to get back to these areas?</P>
    <P>From my experience in developing industry, infrastructure is vital, but we have always developed it <i>post factum</i>. In other words, we have development and then we develop the infrastructure. That is nonsense and we must break that vicious circle quickly. Roads were mentioned. My attitude is, if some people do not want motorways built in their area, I know people in the west who will take the money tomorrow and spend it. If they do not want motorways on the N8 or N7, they should be scaled down and we will take them on the N56, N80, N59 and N5. If the Department is spending the money, there are many people who would get down on their hands and knees and offer the land for free to build the roads.</P>
    <P>There is one good characteristic of the people in the Gaeltacht I must mention. When I said I would widen the roads in Gaeltacht areas, land was needed to do that. Although they received very little for it because the acreage being used was so small, with few exceptions the people there signed immediately to give the land in return for a wall and about £50 to £100 each. If there is a problem spending money on main routes, we should take the attitude that there are other places which will take it.</P>
    <P>Railways have huge potential, although I believe in transport of every type. I see it with my family who are at university in Dublin. The greatest thing that happened for the average student from the west who attends college in Dublin is the buses which go home at frequent intervals all day and late into the evening. Without those buses the weekend trip home would not be possible. The private sector had the courage to realise that frequency would create demand which would have a knock-on effect of creating greater demand and greater frequency. We were told 20 or 30 years ago that this would never be <Col N="552" /> realised. I understand it was a young civil servant who started this in the first place.</P>
    <P>Power is needed. To the objectors to the 220 kv lines going through the countryside I say that if they do not want them, others do. Let us construct the lines where people are willing to accept them. Broadband, new technology, sewerage, airports, gas, and town and village renewal are all key aspects of development. It is much easier to attract industry to a town which looks nice and vibrant and is well presented than to one which looks derelict. I remember going through one midlands town thinking that it looked derelict. I wondered how any industry could be attracted to it.</P>
    <P>Jobs can be created in many areas, but we always look to industry. Few people working in Dublin work in industry. In terms of heavy industry, the countryside has not done that badly because many urban areas will not take heavy industry. The major growth in jobs is in services. One of the largest employers is the State. The major industries in Galway are education and health. While the central hospital cannot be moved, I certainly concur with those who say that any service, be it the local authority, health service or whatever, should be brought to local level. That makes sense. For example, bringing care for the elderly to local level not only provides a much better quality and much more accessible service for people by helping them stay in their community, it also provides jobs for carers in the community. We must focus on bringing services to local level. I am delighted that issue was raised.</P>
    <P>It is similar with education. A certain amount of snobbery has grown up around third level. It does not matter which university is in question, in many cases the equipment used is still a blackboard and chalk and perhaps an overhead projector. This is simple equipment which is in secondary schools as well as third level. University College Galway would not have had more than 1,000 students in the 1950s, yet it had every faculty, medicine, science, humanities etc. We now have the idea that we cannot have a third level institution without 8,000 students. It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I was impressed when I visited the Teagasc farm facility in Athenry. I discovered that six or seven PhD students in biotechnology operate out of there with the best of equipment. The dispersal of such opportunities for students and the people who train and teach them is incredible and is such that we do not have to wait for the mobile investment. If we have such institutions, the mobile investment will follow.</P>
    <P>I recently did an interesting mental survey. While attending a football match, I got the programme and looked at the Galway team, which tells us something about the society in which we live. One-third of the population of County Galway lives in the city, while two-thirds live in the rural area. <Col N="553" /> There was not one player on the panel from the city area, even though one could say they play other sports. However, there appears to be a disproportionate number of rural players on the top league team.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect is that of the 30 players on the county panel, none has left his club. Many of them spend their life commuting to play for their clubs. This indicates a great parish loyalty, which is a good thing. Young people today do not join clubs in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or wherever, preferring to go back home every week-end. The tie is still at home and they want to be home where their friends are. I have found this to be the case with many young people in my area. There is a draw there. I believe this says something about the quality of life for young people in rural areas. That there is a super quality of life is indicated by the fact that a disproportionate number of top athletes come from these areas. There is a certain bonding and quality of life, whereas urban children are subject to different types of pressures and problems. Because of social breakdown and social segregation, certain urban areas are losing out. There is a serious social issue which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>One aspect I ruled out in the Department is talking about rural Ireland in terms of deprivation and so on, as if it was a terrible place to live. Given the right circumstances, it is a fantastic place to live, which is why it should be developed. Agriculture and fishing, which are key to development, are the linchpin of rural Ireland and must be further developed.</P>
    <P>In regard to financial institutions, post offices and so on, we must recognise that the world has to change and burying our head in the sand will not stop the rot. Anyone who says that every rural post office must be kept open and everything must be kept as it was 50 years ago will wind up in total defeat. I have noticed a change. Given drive and energy, if the banks close, credit unions can be set up. In other words, rather than always fighting a rearguard action, we should be proactive and take positive action. I have seen this happen in the more progressive rural areas. Instead of being reactive all the time, they have been proactive. If the institutions are withdrawn, they set up their own institutions to replace them. I have seen extraordinary things happen in that regard. There are parts of south Connemara, for example, that now have their own banking services, even though they never had a banking service in the past, because the people of the area set them up themselves. I felt there was a negative approach at times where we held on to what we had instead of saying if the times have changed and something must go, we can get something good to replace it.</P>
    <P>The contributions on planning were very interesting and mirror my ideas on the issue. Senator Gibbons was absolutely correct. Ribbon <Col N="554" /> development and linear development of our roads has been the destruction of rural Ireland from a visual point of view. The number of houses is not the problem but the siting of the houses and the absolute obsession of planners and planning institutes with linearity and road frontage. All the houses in rural Ireland could be situated in a way that would not be obtrusive in a visual way. County councils and local authorities must take ownership of this aspect.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of Galway County Council priority was given to people whose permanent dwelling would be in the countryside. Even though we were in a tourist area, priority was given to the sons, daughters, nephews and nieces of landholders who were going to settle down, live permanently in the area and commute to their jobs, or to someone working and living in the area who, like myself, came from outside but was permanently resident in the community. If we develop reasonable planning policies &ndash; it cannot be a totally open door and those from the west coast understand what I am saying &ndash; and work together to come up with a coherent vision of where planning should go, we can accommodate houses.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the arguments about septic tanks and eutrophication. We spend huge money in towns and cities providing sewage treatment plants, and rightly so. We must bear 100% of the cost for the citizens who avail of the service. Why can we not consider the possibility in a conceptual way of developing the technology and providing funding so that one-off houses do not become a blight on the landscape in those terms? The solutions are in our hands.</P>
    <P>This debate has been incredibly useful from my point of view. It reinforces my belief that what I have been working towards since becoming Minister mirrors the consensus among people living in rural Ireland as to the real rural issues. I will take great heart from tonight in pushing ahead with the agenda I outlined in the beginning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a medium sized national school in Clondalkin, which was one pupil short on 30 September last year of the 300 pupils which would make the difference. As a result of that, their 11th assistant teacher must leave. Since 30 September <Col N="555" /> last they have gone over the 300 mark. However, as the Minister of State will be aware, &ldquo;Them is the rules&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is totally wrong is that this area is designated as disadvantaged and the pupil-teacher ratio is not supposed to go above 28. If we do not retain the services of this teacher, we bring up the pupil-teacher ratio to 33, which is in complete contradiction to what the people of the area have been promised. There is no point in my waxing on, whether lyrically or otherwise, because if we do not retain this teacher, it will be flagrantly transgressing what has been agreed and what is necessary for the area. The extra teacher will make a great difference and I hope the Minister of State will give me some positive news in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir. This is an issue of concern to her locally and I wish to take the opportunity to outline the current position in relation to the staffing of the school.</P>
      <P>The Senator may be aware that the staffing of a primary school is determined by the enrolment of the previous year on 30 September. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is finalised each year following discussions with the education partners.   <b></b></P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 312 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 299 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and ten mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has one learning support teacher, four special class teachers, one concessionary post due to its disadvantaged status, a home-school liaison teacher, a support teacher and a resource teacher. The school will keep all these posts for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the new disadvantaged programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which was launched by the Minister for Education and Science on 4 January 2001 and will run over a three year period and cost £26 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for the Department last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged back<Col N="556" /> grounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the prograamme.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; from infants through to second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1, not 28:1 as the Senator mentioned, in senior classes &ndash; from third through to sixth classes.</P>
    <P>Talbot senior national school is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. Since the school does not have classes below third class, the new reduced PTR for junior classes does not apply in this case. The school is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme since 1985 and, accordingly, already has sufficient staffing to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in its senior classes. In relation to funding, the school is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £3,444 in the current year towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>Talbot senior national school is in receipt of all entitlements under the new programme to address educational disadvantage in primary schools. I thank the Senator for raising the matter and I hope this information is helpful to her.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment. Once again, I raise the important matter of the reopening of the Stella Maris Nursing Home in Lisdoonvarna which has been an ongoing saga for a considerable time. The scenario to date has been that on 5 March the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, visited the establishment where he had a constructive and detailed meeting with the local voluntary committee which presented a very detailed proposal to him. Subsequent to this the committee continued to make representations and presented the proposal to the Mid-Western Health Board and in more recent times to officials within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official proposal has been presented by the Mid-Western Health Board to the Minister and is on his desk for the past month. The bottom line is that there are 47 beds for the elderly in Stella Maris Nursing Home which were full up to the time it was indicated by the Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Evron that they were going to close. They closed last October and indicated that they were no longer going to run the establishment and were putting it on the market. One of the <Col N="557" /> conditions of sale was that it was to remain as a nursing home to provide care for the elderly in north Clare. The health board at the time refused to take on the responsibility of purchasing the property. It was indicated that if a local committee got together, it would get support from the health board and the Department.</P>
    <P>All that was required both by the Department and the health board has now been complied with and it is a matter for the Minister to make the decision to provide the funding for two elements &ndash; the purchase and refurbishment of the property. During the course of the past couple of months the local committee has met all the various agencies involved &ndash; the fire authority, Clare County Council and the health board. It has also ascertained the regulations required in relation to the reopening. There is also a need for refurbishment. There are two elements to the proposal put before the Minister. I ask him to please go ahead and provide the funding immediately.</P>
    <P>There is a problem locally. I hate to say it but the reality is that there is a certain amount of internal party politics and cross-party politics going on. That is unfortunate and I raise it this evening because it is time to quit the nonsense and get on with providing the beds that are so badly needed. The health board has acknowledged that there is validated research which justifies the need for them. There is a waiting list in County Clare for beds for the elderly. Most importantly, a number of patients were relocated far from their home territory to different areas across county Clare and even County Galway. They have been greatly distressed by this. Unfortunately many of them have since died. Some would say that the hassle and disturbance involved were contributory factors.</P>
    <P>I have the fullest respect for the top class quality of the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who I know is only present to read a statement from the Minister. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health and Children who has responsibility for this matter has not come to the House this evening. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has dealt with it and in fairness to him went as far as he could with it. There is a responsibility on the Minister to produce the goods and quit playing politics with the elderly of north Clare.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue for at least the second time. It was the subject of an Adjournment debate in February 2001 when it was stated that decisions relating to the provision of health services within County Clare were in the first instance a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board. As the Senator said, the Stella Maris Nursing Home is a privately owned facility operated by the Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Evron. Late in 2000 it was decided to dispose of the property on the open market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the earlier debate the health <Col N="558" /> board informed my Department that prior to its closure residents found alternative accommodation and any person who experienced difficulty was assisted by the board. Furthermore the health board advised that some interest had been expressed by prospective purchasers in the Stella Maris Private Nursing Home. The board advised that it would be prepared to discuss options for the contracting of services without any prior commitment on it's part.</P>
    <P>Since that time a local voluntary group, the Stella Maris Nursing Home committee, has been established. The committee has made a detailed proposal in relation to the possible future development of the home which would require the health board to consider purchasing the home and subsequently leasing it to a board of directors operating as a charitable trust on behalf of the local communities. This has happened since the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, visited the centre. He reported on his meeting to the Department and requested that the local committee forward its views and proposal to the Mid-Western Health Board. I understand the committee has done this. However, I understand from the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, that the board has not yet made a submission to the Department on this plan. It was also expected that such a submission would require to be within the board's existing service plan requirements.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some officials from the Department met the committee on 19 June 2001 and a presentation of the proposals was provided. The agreement reached at that meeting was that the Department would contact the Mid-Western Health Board to canvass the views of the board on the proposal in the context of the board's regional requirements. That is where the matter stands. Following the visit and the Senator's representations progress is being made in ascertaining both the board's and local views.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested at the meeting that the committee would continue to liaise with the Mid-Western Health Board and pointed out that the question of acquiring the home would have to be considered in the context of the board's local service requirements and priorities. The Minister would like me to point out that the Mid-Western Health Board has received significant increases in funding for services for older people in recent years. For example, the amount of additional funding has increased from £180,000 in 1997, to £225,000 in 1998, to £500,000 in 1999 and to £1.994 million in 2000. The figure for 2001 is £3.573 million, a substantial increase from the £180,000 in 1997. In the case of the nursing home subvention scheme, the amount made available rose from £1.169 million in 1994, the first full year of the scheme to almost £4 million in 2000. The figure for 2001 is approximately £4.5 million. These figures are just by way of indicating our commitment to the whole area of the elderly and <Col N="559" /> particularly the Mid-Western Health Board. I will personally draw it to the Minister's attention that Senator Taylor-Quinn raised this important issue again tonight.</P>

      <P>May I quickly ask the Minister of State to ensure that the two bureau<Col N="560" /> cratic institutions, the Mid-Western Health Board and the Department of Health and Children, quit their liaison and get on with their business? Funding must be given to those who need it.</P>
