      <P>I have received notice from Senator McDonagh that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make the necessary funding available to the board of management of CallaSanctus College, Oranmore, for its new school building project which caters for 680 students and staff.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make an early decision on the future of the Eastern Regional Health Authority lands at Grangegorman and to confirm that the Dublin Institute of Technology will be provided with a third level educational campus on the site and that the local community will be afforded free access to the sports and recreational facilities on the site.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, Industrial Designs Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; and No. 16, motion No. 20, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, shall resume thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The momentous news from yesterday is the only matter on most people's minds today. There are many things to be said about it and many people to be complimented. Since we <Col N="458" /> are to have a full scale debate on that subject tomorrow, I will postpone until then the many things I want to say, and I am sure others will also want to contribute.</P>
      <P>Since the debate on Aer Lingus last week which the Minister attended, events have moved very rapidly. Will the Leader seek to bring the Minister to the House today or tomorrow to update Members on what is happening in Aer Lingus? There are huge concerns in that regard and there is not a great deal of clarity as to what is actually happening.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Leader for a debate on current problems regarding motor and business insurance. Many people cannot insure their vehicles and businesses may be driven to the wall because of the huge escalation in premiums. Will he facilitate a debate on this issue at the earliest possible time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Manning. The House could learn a lot in hearing from the Minister the precise view of the Government on the issue of Aer Lingus. We need to know what the Government has in mind and how it will move this forward. I do not want to re-open the debate on the strategic nature and importance of Aer Lingus and its fundamental value. It is not an issue on its own, it relates to many aspects of Irish life. What is being considered by the Government? The British Government, in looking at Railtrack, has come up with a very innovative and creative idea to create a private company which has members rather than shareholders. It seems like a half-way house which might allow the Government to intervene in a way which would not create a problem with the European Union. Workers, their families and other industries are dependent on Aer Lingus. They are waiting to see how this is to be handled. It is an issue on which we all want to see progress. People may have different ideas on that but we must come together to deal with the issue. We want the Minister to come here and discuss what the Government is considering.</P>
      <P>I seek a ruling from the Cathaoirleach on a technical matter. The Labour Party motion on the health services is for debate today. The wording begins with: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann condemns . . . &rdquo;. The Government has tabled an amendment which replaces &ldquo;condemns&rdquo; with &ldquo;commends&rdquo;. That has to be seen as a direct negative. My understanding was that in the case of a direct negative, people voted against it and that it was not good practice to accept an amendment which contains a clear, direct negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much more in this amendment than &ldquo;condemns&rdquo;. I do not regard this as a direct negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to establish is that the Cathaoirleach decided that himself. I <Col N="459" /> absolutely accept his ruling but would hate to think that members of the Government parties would take advantage of his good nature. I ask that those on the other side of the House take careful note that we will be watching these matters in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator O'Toole is so clearly indicating that he will support our motion. I was thinking of including a positive in the motion, &ldquo;That we are condemning the present Government for its mismanagement of the health service&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The positive was that we would be calling on the Government to resign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Even Senator Costello knows it is not a resigning matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the most appropriate response considering the past four and a half years of mismanagement of the health services. However, we will leave the issue until later. We should not miss the opportunity to welcome the developments on decommissioning. However, I will not deal in detail with the matter.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus workers are protesting outside the House now. The announcement made in the Dáil yesterday is an astounding development. In her previous announcement the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, said she was withdrawing the Aer Lingus Bill on privatisation. Yesterday, it emerged she plans to privatise 35% of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senator Costello to bear with me for a moment. We debated this matter in detail last week when we had statements on Aer Lingus. The issue is too wide-ranging to deal with on the Order of Business. A further debate or statements has been sought, which I assume Senator Costello supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I go further than that. I am asking for clarification on legislation. Legislation on privatisation passed through this House. I want to know the reason the Minister did not refer, good, <Col N="460" /> bad or indifferent, to the matter. She stated she had a plan, the contents of which she did not reveal. Now we find it is very much akin to the legislation she has already withdrawn. Is the Government at sixes and sevens on the issue? I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to return to the House tomorrow to clarify the reason we were not told about the announcement made in the other House yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Accountability in public life and politics in general has been raised over the years, particularly by the Taoiseach. I want an explanation for the departure of Mr. Barry Galvin, who took over as legal adviser to the Criminal Assets Bureau when it was set up. He is now being lost to the nation because a question was asked by some unaccountable person somewhere. Mr. Galvin is a man of very high calibre, who we should not be losing&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not relevant to the Order of Business. Senator Cregan should find a different way of raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, it is seldom that I question the Cathaoirleach but the issue begs the question of who is accountable. Mr. Galvin deserves better. Questions have been raised in the press in the past three days and no individual or Department is accountable. It is not fair to the nation. This man has done an enormous amount of work over the past four to five years at very little cost. Over £50 million has been recovered plus the assets of criminals, yet nobody is answerable for Mr. Galvin's departure. It is not fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is not taking issue with many of the points Senator Cregan is making, except that this is not the appropriate way to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and do not disagree with the Cathaoirleach. Where will we get an answer? Nobody is accountable. That is all I am saying. We are being told modern day politics is very accountable. Why is no reason given for the decision to let go of this person? It is not a question of Mr. Galvin asking for extra resources, but obviously of petty jealousy somewhere. It is not fair to people who are recruited from the private sector and who are prepared to make sacrifices to be treated in such a way. This man is of such high standing that it is most unfair to him and the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to introduce legislation to deal with so-called Travellers and the protection racket they are running which involves moving on to private and public sites and refusing to move off without payment. They have a system by which a certain sum is demanded for the leader and each caravan. These people are very clever. They have a spy system of which the CIA would be proud. If they had been working for the CIA, they would have found bin Laden years ago. They know exactly when planning permission is granted or where there is a vacant site and they then move in. The only way they can be moved is to pay them.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring in legislation which will make this a criminal offence? There should be a mandatory jail sentence for the offence of breaking and entering. I see this as the only way of dealing with this situation. It is getting completely out of hand at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the summer recess, we brought a Mental Health Bill through this House. This has now been enacted although not one line of it has been brought into force or practice. At the time it was recognised that it dealt mainly with involuntary admissions of patients to hospital. The Minister for Health and Children promised that as soon as the Bill was enacted, he would introduce legislation regarding mentally ill persons before the courts and in custody.</P>
      <P>Other Senators must have noticed an appalling case about a brain damaged man who has been going backwards and forwards between Cloverhill Prison, Garda stations and the custody of his parents &ndash; who are in no position to look after him. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health and Children when he proposes to introduce this legislation which three months ago he said would be brought forward immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request to invite the Minister for Public Enterprise to the House. It would be very helpful. I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on tourism. Now that most airlines have reduced the price of flights, it is most important that we have a debate in this House. Most of those flights facilitate people flying out of Ireland. Our tourism industry is in crisis and we need to get tourists to fly into the country. We need a debate as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Bohan in relation to the law of trespass. That law must be revisited in the context of the illegal encampments throughout the city. Two laws seem to exist, one for the private citizens whereby their vehicles are clamped if they pull in at the side of <Col N="462" /> the road and another law for these illegal encampments. The gardaí do not seem to be able to deal with the problem of these encampments. I ask the Leader to go a bit further and provide time for us to make statements on this matter. It is a very important issue at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader is aware that the Western Development Commission was thrown into chaos during the week by the announcement of the resignation of its chief executive. The reason that the press has given for his resignation is frustration at the lack&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it was for personal reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;of commitment from this Government in relation to the funding of the Western Development Commission and the slow pace of any measures to address the problems which have been identified over the years by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Senator Caffrey is seeking a debate on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he would ask the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development what commitment, if any, he will make to the Western Development Commission in terms of funding and in terms of getting it up and running and how will he address the problems as identified in a major report which the commission issued in the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on insurance. I recently asked for this debate but I was horrified to hear on the radio this morning someone saying that he had found a way to avoid taking out motor insurance. The Government is still taxing car insurance by way of a 2% levy which goes back to the PMPA days and still continues. The cost of insurance is encouraging people to break the law. On top of that is the failure of the independent insurance company in Britain which has left a large number of people and businesses uninsured. Senator Manning's call for a debate on insurance should be supported immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to the House so that she may clarify once and for all the privatisation of Aer Lingus and the sale of 35% of that company that was suggested yesterday. She does not appreciate the devastation that will occur to the mid-west region if anything happens to the Shannon stop-over and to the viability of Shannon Airport whose survival is the cornerstone of economic and social life in the region. She does not appreciate the terror and fear in people's minds in that region. All interest groups are coming together to put press<Col N="463" /> ure on her to listen to the fact that there is an Ireland outside of Dublin. She does not appear to appreciate that people face those problems in the mid-west and the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is supporting the call for a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we have called for that over and over again, as we have for a debate on the high cost of insurance for young drivers and for debates on many other issues. We are beginning to become irrelevant to the political life of the country. I impress on the Minister that she must come to this House tomorrow to alleviate the fears of a great percentage of people in the mid-west and west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Seán Ó Fearghail Seán Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request from Senators Bohan and Ormonde for a debate on issues relating to illegal encampments throughout the country and to emphasise that we need to debate as a matter of some urgency the need for law to deal with the problem of mass trespass.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader of the House to facilitate an urgent debate on the planning process, which has been mentioned here on a number of occasions. There is a need to address the difficulties surrounding the operations of An Bord Pleanála and, in particular, the recent announcements emanating from An Taisce that it intends to embark on some sort of a crusade across the country objecting to the building of once-off houses in the countryside. This is a matter the House needs to address as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow up on a point made by the last speaker and on an issue raised by Senator Bohan. I have spoken out on behalf of Travellers over many years. I pioneered the inclusion of amendments covering Travellers and giving equal rights to them. I think I can speak as someone who does not have a reputation for being in any way negative towards Travellers. It is intolerable that wealthy Travellers come over from England, they refuse to use dumps, they will not buy skips and they simply distribute the detritus of their commercial operations all around the rivers and countryside. Something must be done about that &ndash; not about our own decent Travellers. I commend Dublin County Council for the way it has tried to handle the matter. I feel great sympathy for its excellent and articulate spokesman who was on the radio this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also be happy if the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, were to come into this House. I have great sympathy with Aer Lingus and I have supported it over many years. If we do not get the opportunity to speak to the Minister on this matter, perhaps the Leader would pass on, from those of us who strongly support her in this House, our admiration for the clarity, courage <Col N="464" /> and honesty with which she dealt with an extremely difficult situation in the other House. I listened to it on Oireachtas Report and I thought she did a very good job in extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I also ask for an urgent debate on the situation in the Middle East and I will briefly give the reasons for it. I am afraid the situation may be overlooked because of the massive military intervention in Afghanistan. I am a strong supporter of Israel and will continue to be so, but it is important that those of us in this House who support Israel but take a civilised line should say things that will be interpreted as encouragement for the moderate elements in Israel who are now floundering. A column of tanks has just gone into Beit Rima. I understand that in the last 24 hours 17 Palestinians have been killed. We should not lose sight of this because there is the problem in Afghanistan. As a friend of Israel, I would welcome a debate in which I could make these points in a reasonable and balanced fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Thursday evening the Minister for Public Enterprise spoke in this House and referred in particular to the rescue package for Aer Lingus. Nothing she said last Thursday evening remotely suggested the sale of 35% of the airline. There is an onus on her to come back to this House immediately and to establish clearly whether her plan was accepted by Government or whether the Government changed it during the course of the Cabinet meeting on Aer Lingus. As we speak, thousands of people are at the gates of Leinster House fearful for their jobs and in a state of crisis. The crisis is way beyond anyone's remote predictions. There is an onus on the Minister to come back into this House to discuss this matter. What has happened is despicable. The situation in relation to Shannon Airport is appalling. The Government does not have the remotest clue of the economic impact this will have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These points were made, but obviously they did not register. The attempts made with the European Commission have floundered because of a lack of will and determination on the part of the Government to ensure we are treated equally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we seek clarification from the Leader as to how soon the Minister will come to the House? She said last Thursday evening that she would come here any time she <Col N="465" /> is asked. We are requesting that she come to the House now. This is an urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan raised the issue of Barry Galvin. There is an onus on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to account to this House for the reasons for the departure of Mr. Galvin, who has done very good work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking a debate on the relationship between this country and the European Union. As Members have already pointed out, the Government appears to have rolled over once it encountered an obstacle in the European Commission. We really must look at how we relate to the European Union to avoid this and future Governments capitulating at the first sign of an obstacle from the European Commission. That is the nub of the issue. When the crunch came, we ended up with no Government policy and a situation where this House was told something last Thursday which was not the case by the following Tuesday. That treats the House with disrespect and the Minister should come back to correct the record, which was incorrectly put together four days ago. If that relationship with the European Union continues, we will end up with no relationship with it. If the national airline closes down or is sold off in a car boot sale because the Government cannot stand up for this country, it is both the European Union's and this country's fault.</P>

      <P>On the related issue of the international struggle against terrorism, will the Leader gently remind the other House that both the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill and the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill have been on the Dáil Order Paper for at least a year? Both Bills are related to the struggle <Col N="466" /> against terrorism. I am a great believer in doing simple things well. The things we can do ourselves should be done properly. Those Bills should be enacted and enforced if we are serious about dealing with international terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach was within his rights to be indignant at the issue of the Criminal Assets Bureau being raised. I am a little disappointed that a diatribe against some members of the Traveller community, perhaps they were not even members of that community, was permitted whereas the more fundamental issue of the undermining of the Criminal Assets Bureau was ruled as inappropriate to the Order of Business. I am confused about this.</P>

      <P>A debate on tourism could be timely and helpful. There are major new challenges facing the industry. We have just come through the foot and mouth disease crisis and now we have to deal with the fallout from the events in the United States on 11 September. The debate could strike a positive note as it is important to raise the morale of the industry. We have just a few months to prepare for the next tourism season so it is important that we put forward helpful suggestions. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at an early stage.</P>

It is a national disgrace if the person named by the Senator is leaving the Criminal Assets Bureau because he has been undermined.</P>

    <P>The Leader indicated that he will allow a debate on tourism, but will he indicate when it <Col N="467" /> will be taken? I share the views of Senators who raised the matter today.</P>
    <P>An order has been made for the Second Stage debate on the Industrial Design Bill, 2000, to be held today. The Bill, as we know, centres on an EU directive on the legal protection of industrial design which was approved by the Council of Ministers in September 1998 and published in October of that year. As I understand it, each member state had three years in which to implement the directive. Will the Leader indicate why it has not been arranged to deal with all Stages of the Bill this week. Perhaps I am wrong, but I think it is necessary for this country to comply with the directive and to sign its measures into law by 28 October. I am open to correction and I would like to hear from the Leader.</P>

      <P>I support the remarks of Senator Bohan. Last year, I raised the definition of a Traveller and the issue was also addressed by Senator Farrell a few days ago. Travellers, alias transient traders, transient voluntary homeless, mobile millionaires or whatever one may like to call them, with their loose change, could buy and sell everyone in this Chamber, and there would be plenty of money left over. It is regrettable that when registered numbers and names are taken and checked by the Garda, it is found that the addresses given are fictitious.</P>

I always thought that fireworks were used at Hallowe'en, but in recent months they have been used extensively throughout the country, and County Westmeath, including Mullingar, is no exception. On the day nine volunteers were being interred in Glasnevin, fireworks were set off indiscriminately, which is outrageous. The Garda should take account of the distribution of fireworks among young people. In many cases, people have lost lives and limbs as a result of fireworks.</P>

He was especially disappointed by the response to the commission's proposals. Objections were made to Senator Caffrey when <Col N="468" /> he attempted to raise this matter and it was said that the chief executive resigned for personal reasons. The directors of the Western Development Commission, most of whom have the friendship of the Government, supported the former chief executive's view, which gives it great credibility.

It was one of the better contributions in recent years to the debate on regional development. It is an official document, as the Western Development Commission is an official agency established by the Government by a statute of these Houses. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate soon in Government time on the document called The State of the West. Many of the issues raised by Mr. Scollan on his resignation could be well aired in such a debate.

      <P>I recently put a question to the Leader, but I did not receive a satisfactory response, regarding the European Convention on Human Rights, which Ireland is bound to incorporate under the Good Friday Agreement. It has been signed and ratified and it must now be incorporated into domestic law, as has been done in the United Kingdom.

This is the third such accident and I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to introduce proposals formulated by people involved in the road safety area. This would mean something was done instead of Members only expressing their sympathy. If nothing is done, I guarantee there will be another fatality in six months. In Berlin, cycle ways are on footpaths and there is no mix of cyclists and vehicles. It behoves us to introduce some realistic proposals to try to prevent another dreadful accident.

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Burke, Jackman, Norris, Taylor-Quinn and Coghlan requested an update on the situation in Aer Lingus. I was most impressed by the Mini<Col N="469" /> ster's forthrightness and caution when she addressed the House last Thursday. As Senator Taylor-Quinn noted, the Minister said at the end of the debate that she would make herself available to update the House on a weekly basis. I will make that request to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senators today and I hope they will be present when such a discussion is arranged. All Members do not share the same concern for Shannon Airport but given the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke's close connection with County Clare, we can be sure her heart is in the right place with regard to the long-term future of Shannon Airport and the western region. I have every confidence that this matter will be addressed. The problems in the aviation industry are a global issue. They are difficult problems and Aer Lingus is in a difficult position, but we must all work to ensure the maintenance of the 4,000 jobs in the company.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn, Senator Coghlan and others called for a debate on the insurance industry. I endeavoured to arrange such a debate for tomorrow but because of events in Northern Ireland, I decided in my wisdom that every Member of the House wished to be updated in that regard and express their views on the matter. This is the reason the other debate will not be held tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the concerns expressed by Senator Dino Cregan and others regarding the CAB and its personnel.</P>
      <P>Senators Bohan, Ormonde, Ó Fearghail, Norris and Glynn expressed their shock, horror and disappointment at the lack of legislation to cover business Travellers coming here from outside the State and making a substantial acquisition on land for periods of up to four weeks. I understand there were four major deliveries to one site where they were trading. I will pass on their views to the Minister. There was a strong call for legislation to be introduced as a matter of urgency to deal with the matter. One Senator called for jail sentences to be imposed given that the problem has become a racket. It is not about people who do not have a place to put their caravans overnight. When these people come here for four or five weeks at a time and accept major deliveries they are challenging the authority of the Legislature, the Government and the State. Legislation must be introduced in the near future &ndash; we hope that will be done in this House &ndash; to deal with this urgent problem.</P>
      <P>I will convey Senator Henry's request to the Minister following the passing of the Mental Health Bill. Senators Coghlan, Burke and Ó Murchú called for a debate on tourism and an update on the Government's attempt to attract UK and European tourists.

I hope to have as long a debate as is required on the issue after the Hallowe'en recess. We all want to be able to take up the large amount of money being made available by the Government to our regions. We are mindful that every county and county development board will strive to complete their plans by the end of the year. We must ensure plans are prepared which can be implemented and funds are drawn down. There is a fear that funds will not be drawn down once they have been allocated. I share Senator Connor's view about the importance of debating the issue in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Fearghail called for a full and frank debate on planning, particularly the statement by An Taisce. The House should conduct a review of An Taisce. I will ensure the Minister is present to discuss the issue. An Taisce seems to be challenging rural Ireland. I hope it does not want rural Ireland to become a wilderness, as was stated in the newspapers. I am sure I speak for all political parties here today when I say we will not stand for that. It defies logic and common sense. The long-term positions of the people who make such decisions will be short-lived.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on relationships with the European Union. As you know, a Chathaoirligh, we hope Commissioner Byrne will come before the House in the next two to three weeks. Perhaps we will have, as was proposed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, an opportunity to express our views on our future in the European Union and to outline our achievements which are second to none since we became a member. I will convey the Senator's views on the struggle against terrorism to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn referred to the inappropriate use of fireworks at this time of year. They have always been associated with Hallowe'en night but they are now being used for weeks beforehand.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring the Bill before the House as part of a broader programme of intellectual property law reform which has been ongoing over recent years. Intellectual property rights have become increasingly important to the economy and to society in general in recent times and this has been reflected in the increased activity on the legislative front, both domestically and internationally, in the past decade or so.</P>
      <P>On the domestic front, in continuation of the process that started with the Patents Act, 1992, and the Trade Marks Act, 1996, the Government introduced the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, and the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, both of which significantly advanced the systems of rights and remedies for the creators and owners of intellectual property. This Bill represents the last leg of this initial programme of legislative reform and, as such, marks a significant milestone in the intellectual property arena in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I refer to the economic significance of intellectual property law. Intellectual property rights are a key factor in promoting investment in innovative activity in an economy. Innovation is a critical element in maintaining a competitive edge for an economy in the face of increasing international competition and economic globalisation. Any hopes of sustaining economic growth in the longer term depend significantly on the ability of an economy to adapt and achieve technical progress. Investment in research and development and a high valuation and prioritisation of innovative activity must be encouraged to give this country a chance of sustaining in the longer term our current economic well-being.</P>
      <P>Intellectual property rights are an essential part of the support and promotion framework which can ensure that Irish business continues to invest in and develop innovative and creative activity. In addition to the intellectual property programme, and with a view to driving competitiveness in the longer term, the Government has established, for example, the technology foresight fund, setting aside up to £560 million or &euro;711 million over seven years for the creation of a critical mass of world class research, initially in biotechnology and information and communications technologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role to be played by industrial design in this process should not be underestimated. Design has a crucial role in the process of product <Col N="472" /> development and marketing and, at a broader level, in the continued development and growth of product markets. Prior to the 20th century industrial design endeavour was recognised as protection in law in respect only of textile products.</P>
    <P>However, the growth of society and the growth of mass production techniques across all product markets have seen the scope of industrial design protection widen dramatically to cover countless product lines. The facts are now clear &ndash; if you are in the business of manufacturing, whether by industrial or handicraft means, products for consumption then industrial design is central to your operation, right through manufacture to marketing and end-sale. To succeed in today's highly competitive and globalised markets, you must invest in quality design.</P>
    <P>Many Irish designers have received great recognition and have had remarkable success both at home and abroad for their excellence and individuality. Irish textile fashion designers have been at the cutting edge of international design and have exhibited around the world to great acclaim. Irish crystal and glassware products are household names throughout the world and are the subject of a massive export industry. On the domestic front, Irish design expertise has blossomed and currently boasts sufficient diversity and excellence to compete successfully with the best of imported material. Our success in this area is based on quality and, to no small degree, on our Irish culture, as witnessed by a strong and vibrant craftwork and traditional handicraft industry that continues to thrive in many parts of the country. Ireland has also been at the leading edge of modern design, including the area of graphic design which is so significant in the context of the information society. The excellence and hard work that has gone into these areas must continue to be protected against the potentially devastating effects of plagiarism and this Bill aims to provide the appropriate level of support in the law, by providing strong legal remedies and criminal penalties to ensure that the necessary level of protection is achieved.</P>
    <P>Members will recall the great work on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill in this House. While copyright law is concerned with creativity and, in respect of artistic works at least, the aesthetic expression of intellectual creations, industrial design law is also concerned with conceptual and artistic creativity. There is one significant difference, however, and that is the fact that industrial design is centered on the appearance of products rather than on the creation of individual works of art or individual self-contained expressions of the intellect. In that way, I suppose we could refer to industrial design protection as a form of &lsquo;applied copyright' because it is concerned with practical aspects of physical products. Industrial designs are essentially the appearance <Col N="473" /> of products that are made by industrial or handicraft means. They include such features of appearance as shape, contours, lines and colours. Examples of familiar designs would be the shape of a Coke bottle, the patterns used on wallpaper and carpets and the contours of crystal glassware. If we look around this Chamber we can see many examples of industrial design in the furniture, carpets and other aesthetic features of our surroundings. This Bill will protect these designs against, for example, the illegal copying of the design, the illegal sale of products incorporating the design and the illegal import or export or other use of a product incorporating the design.</P>
    <P>This Bill is in essence modernising legislation. The fact that the landmark 1927 Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, the first comprehensive piece of intellectual property law to be enacted in the State, is still in force in respect of industrial designs is, in itself, sufficient reason to revisit this aspect of the law. The adoption of a European Union directive on the legal protection of designs in 1998 also offers both an opportunity and an obligation to overhaul the current legislation and to bring this aspect of intellectual property law into the new century.</P>
    <P>In relation to the content of the Industrial Designs Bill, 2000, let me point out a few general facts about industrial designs and the law. It is the appearance of products that is the subject of industrial designs protection, as distinct from the function of the product. To use the car tyre as an example, it is the shape of the tyre or the contours of the thread grooves that may be protected under industrial design while the function, which in this case is to enable the car to be driven on a surface &ndash; or with new tyre designs to increase the technical control that the driver has of the car on the road &ndash; is not protected at all by the registration of the industrial design. It may be possible that the function could be patentable as an invention and thus protectable under patent law, but that is not a matter for this legislation. In that sense, it could be said that protection under this Bill is not to be given to products that re-invent the wheel. Rather, it is the aesthetic appeal of an industrial design that is protectable under this Bill. The appearance of many products can be the decisive factor in determining whether a consumer buys that product or opts instead for a competing product. In this way, a poor design might undermine the commercial potential of a very high quality product. As a result, designers will spend a lot of time and effort, and businesses a lot of money, on achieving the best possible design for their products. This investment of time and money must be rewarded to encourage its continuation.</P>
    <P>The most effective and transparent manner in which to protect industrial designs is through a system of registration. This offers legal clarity and certainty and provides a system of accessible and <Col N="474" /> concise information on the existence of rights and on registered rights holders. The production of evidence of registration greatly assists the designer in moving quickly and decisively to obtain legal redress, through an injunction for example, to prevent the infringement of his or her rights and to stop the continuation of such infringement. The existence of a public register also offers the public and businesses important information on pre-existing rights and the expiry dates of such rights. This is very useful information for future planning and expenditure decisions of directly competing industries and of industries and businesses that rely on designs to provide the best possible finish for their own product.</P>
    <P>As part of the update of existing law, this Bill clarifies the legal position regarding authorship and ownership of industrial designs and provides a clear statement of the rights that attach to the registration of the design under the new law. These provisions offer significant support to the designer in prosecuting and defending his or her rights in civil legal cases. The existing system of law is also amended to allow invalidation actions to be taken before the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks on less restricted grounds than in the current law. This should prove useful, practical and cost-efficient in terms of time and expense for users of industrial designs.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes new provisions on the restoration of protection of designs that has lapsed despite due diligence on behalf of the owner in maintaining the registration and provides an exception which permits prior use of a registered design to be continued in specific circumstances, even after the design has been registered under the new law. These provisions will facilitate operation of sensible and reasonable law in practice and will assist the smooth transfer to the new regime of protection, particularly for those who have already committed time and resources in good faith to the exploitation of a design and subsequently find that they have no right to use the design.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates in a clearer, more comprehensive manner the civil and criminal remedies that exist under the current law and improves them. The civil remedies include access to injunctions and damages and delivery up of infringing products. They also contain protection for those who, unaware of the existence of rights to a design, innocently infringe the right. The Bill proposes strong criminal penalties along the lines of those in the recent copyright legislation. This brings consistency across intellectual property law in this respect and a coherent approach to protection of the various forms of intellectual property. The Bill also provides for a system of compulsory licensing, a mechanism to allow the manufacture of a product where demand for that product is <Col N="475" /> not being met or is not being met on reasonable terms.</P>
    <P>One of the principal aims of this Bill is the implementation of the EU directive on the legal protection of designs that was adopted in 1998. It is important that this directive is implemented at the earliest possible date to demonstrate that our recent commitments to bring Irish intellectual property law into line with international commitments are being met. The Bill proposes that many of the legal definitions in the directive be directly transposed into our law. This will eliminate any possibility of incorrect or inconsistent application of the directive. The Bill also introduces new novelty and individual character tests, which are fundamental to the directive. The revised novelty test effectively means that in general, a design must not have been made available to the public within the European Economic Area prior to application for registration in order to qualify for protection. This is a much broader novelty test than exists under current law and is a significant development in terms of the achievement of a single market within the European Union.</P>
    <P>I mention in particular the position under the directive of industrial designs that constitutes spare parts used for the repair of complete products. Existing Irish law does not make specific provision with respect to spare parts. Therefore, if a design of a spare part meets the criteria for protection under the existing Irish law, it shall be protected. The terms of the directive include provisions that deny protection of the design of spare parts that are not visible during normal use of the product and the Bill implements that aspect of EU law. Our current Irish law makes no specific provision preventing the registration of spare parts used for the repair of complex products to restore their original appearance, so the opportunity has been taken in the Bill to regularise this position and to liberalise the market for the production of spare parts in Ireland. This means that while there would be no protection for a spark plug in a car as it is not visible during normal use, there would only be limited protection for, say, a wing mirror. For example, Ford could prevent other manufacturers from using the design of the Ford mirror in their cars but Ford could not prevent a spare part company making mirrors for the purpose of replacing damaged mirrors on Ford models. This is a very good provision in relation to consumers and the economy in general.</P>
    <P>On the international front, the Bill enables the ratification and implementation of the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement on the International Registration of Industrial Designs. This treaty was concluded in 1999 and provides for the establishment of an international registration system for industrial designs that is likely to attract large membership among the member states of <Col N="476" /> the World Intellectual Property Organisation and will offer the possibility of protection for Irish designers in many different countries through a single application. Under current arrangements, Irish designers would have to apply individually to each country, pay each country a separate fee and probably hire local legal expertise to assist in achieving registration in those countries. There are obvious cost and time savings involved in having access to a central, dedicated system that will operate to high standards of performance and will process applications more efficiently than the currently available options offer. The regulations that I will, in time, bring forward to effect ratification of the Geneva Act of the Hague agreement will require the positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill will also ensure that Ireland's industrial design law is fully compliant with the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, colloquially known as TRIPS, annexed to the World Trade Organisation agreement. These developments will permit Irish business to fully participate in the various international systems for protection of industrial designs and Irish society to avail of the undoubted benefits they offer.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that regulations made under this Bill in the future will facilitate e-business, including electronic payments and, eventually, electronic filing of applications. It is critically important that Irish business and the Irish public have quick, secure and cheap access to information on registered intellectual property rights.</P>
    <P>Procedures and enhanced systems to enable the Patents Office to meet that challenge and to bring the industrial designs registration system into the modern era are currently being prepared and will be developed on a structured basis over time. In practice, it is my intention that designers will, in time, be able to apply for registration electronically and access the designs register on-line via the Internet. At present a person seeking information on registered designs must request the relevant information by post or must visit the Patents Office to physically view the paper-based register of designs. This is most impractical and does not permit electronic searching of the designs database or timely access to information for Patents Office users. Indeed, this process will need to be reflected in respect of all areas of intellectual property services, in line with the improved access to public services to be provided in the future. Only then can we say we have truly implemented e-government in this area of public services.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this debate is not the most light-hearted and deals with technical material but it is important, as are the other areas of intellectual property which we have dealt with in previous legislation. I emphasise that while the Industrial Designs Bill is only one element of the overall ongoing programme of reform of intellec<Col N="477" /> tual property law in Ireland it is, in itself, a very significant step forward. It will have a significant beneficial impact on design industries and craft businesses, which rely heavily on the protection of the law to underpin the substantial investments they make in developing designs, but will also impact on virtually every producer and product market. The Bill will also contribute to the modernisation, simplification and user-friendliness of the Irish legal code, as well as enabling Ireland to meet all its EU and international obligations in the industrial designs area. It will serve to promote and encourage innovation and creativity in the development of products and will offer the possibility of appropriate financial reward for those who engage in and invest in the creation of intellectual property. This Bill achieves a fair balance between the need to encourage and protect innovation and ensure that the interests of consumers are respected. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He referred to the time we spent debating the Copyright and Related Rights Bill. How could I ever forget it? The debate, which went on for many days and nights, was not all of my making or that of the Minister of State. I hope the end product justifies our deliberations. I thank the Minister of State for his overview of the Bill and for the information he so kindly made available to me through his office.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael fully supports this measure. It is absolutely necessary and much needed for the modernisation of industrial design law, which is currently governed by an Act of 1927. Fine Gael also fully accepts the requirement to implement the EU designs directive, which is due to be implemented by 28 October. As this is 24 October, I wonder how that deadline can be met. I understand this Bill is needed to allow us ratify and give effect to the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement on the International Registration of Industrial Designs. It is, of course, needed to ensure that the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights is fully implemented in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill properly makes provision for the registration of design and defines a registerable design as the appearance of a product produced by industrial and handicraft means, resulting from features such as shape, line, contour, colour etc. Any design aspect of any product is covered. However, artistic designs and drawings are generally within the scope of copyright law rather than industrial design law. The Bill lays down that a design should be deemed to have individual character if the overall impression it produces on the informed user differs from the overall impression produced on such user by a design which has been made available to the public before the filing date of the application for regis<Col N="478" /> tration or, where priority is claimed, the date of priority.</P>
    <P>Design must be incorporated in a product to qualify for protection. Examples given are the distinctive shape of different bottles or the design thereon, such as the Coca Cola bottle, as the Minister of State mentioned. The same may apply to a Club Orange bottle, but I am not sure about that. It should certainly apply to a Kerry Spring bottle, which has a distinctive light blue colour, although it ought perhaps to be green and gold. Another distinctive bottle which comes to mind and which the Minister of State would appreciate is the Chateau Neuf du Pape bottle, which has a distinctive Papal keys design thereon.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to define industrial property rights as including patents, trade marks and industrial designs which therefore require a registration process, the details of which are incorporated in the Bill. It follows, therefore, that industrial designs to be protected as intellectual property must be registered and the Bill establishes procedures to continue to enable registration and to make registration information available to the public in the most accessible manner possible.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that protection under the Bill relates to the appearance of the product only and does not cover its function, which may be protected as a process under patent law. As well as complying with the legal requirements of the EU directive, it is good that the Bill extends by ten years, from 15 to 25 years, the protection afforded to proprietors of registered designs and extends the protection of copyright to include all registered designs. When enacted it will allow the owners of these design rights better scope to enforce their ownership by referring matters to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks or to the courts.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill which deal with rectification procedures and set out the basis where persons are not entitled to register design rights or to adopt another person's design rights for their own use and benefit are to be welcomed. The Bill enables the ratification of the Geneva Act of the Hague agreement and introduces new novelty and individual character requirements for designs. It establishes power for the Minister to specify procedures for application or registration of designs and for the maintenance of patents of a statutory register of designs by the controller.</P>
    <P>This is a complex and technical Bill and is one of a number in the area of intellectual property necessary to allow Ireland keep pace with international developments and modernisation. Important advances have been made in industrial design. The manner in which many of our designers have kept pace with best international practices is to be commended. The Bill centres on the EU directive on the legal protection of designs adopted by the Council of Ministers in September <Col N="479" /> 1998 and published in October 1998. It came into force on 17 November 1998 and it was announced that member states had three years to implement the directive. When is it intended to have all Stages of the legislation completed in this House? Fine Gael supports the harmonisation of laws in those areas directly affected in the working of the Internal Market. The matters of penalties, remedies, sanctions and enforcement will remain in our hands. I am pleased the Government took this decision following publication of the directive.</P>
    <P>I understand there is an exemption from registration in Britain when dealing with articles of an artistic or literary nature. Design or sculpture works may be accepted for registration in Ireland. Will the Minister comment on the exemption from registration or otherwise in respect of articles of a literary or artistic nature? An application for registration of a new design must be one not previously published in this State. The matter of novelty is considered to be of great importance. In other jurisdictions there have been difficulties in deciding what is new and original. It seems that the test applied to consider novelty is one where an original should be interpreted as referring to a design that no previous designer had created for any purpose. A new article would be in reference to a design which was not in this sense original but was new in so far as it was the first time it was the subject matter of an application.</P>
    <P>The directive sees significant changes in Irish law as far as novelty is concerned. For the first time we have introduced the concept of universal novelty. Under current law only local novelty is required. There is also a subjective test as prior art must be shown to have become known to the relevant industrial sector within the EU. Otherwise the requirement of novelty in individual character does not appear to differ significantly from our local test applied under existing law. The directive does not require examination and it is questionable whether the novelty examination carried out by the Irish Patent Office for prior Irish designs would be worthwhile in the context of this new universal novelty. The European office that will deal with design registration will be based in Spain. Will there be an Irish representative there? What will the relationship be between the European and Irish patent offices? Will Ireland have a representative on the international inspectorate? What will be the changed role and function of the patent office? Fine Gael is happy to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Today we are looking at the modernisation of industrial design laws to meet the demands of the information society. The current Irish law on industrial designs dates primarily from 1927. It is well overdue a comprehensive <Col N="480" /> overhaul. It is possibly the oldest legislation since the foundation of the State to survive on the Statute Book. It has survived a world war and the falling of the Berlin Wall, but it cannot outlast the information technology revolution. The Industrial Designs Bill, 2000, is therefore required to reflect the current state of technological development in society and to provide a modern system of protection for creators of industrial designs. We must be conscious of the need to provide excellence in public services and to facilitate businesses that wish to carry out their transactions electronically in the information society era.</P>
      <P>Legislation is required on many fronts to facilitate e-business and e-government, but none more so than in the area of industrial regulation and where costs to business are involved. I am delighted this Bill will eventually provide Irish business and the Irish public with quick, secure and cheap access to information on registered intellectual property rights. Proposals to meet that challenge and to bring the industrial designs registration system up to date will have to be developed. People should be able to access the designs register on-line via the Internet. They should also be able to conduct their business with the State in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. If it involves electronic transactions, then this should become a reality.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's view that this process will need to be reflected in respect of all areas of intellectual property services. This is in line with the improved access to public services to be provided through the public services broker model recently proposed by the Taoiseach. Businesses should be able to communicate in their preferred manner with the State in respect of obtaining their property rights. The public must also have access to information on publicly registered rights of this nature. Such information must be available on demand in a format that is useful and relevant and in a manner that the public can easily access. I am reassured to hear the Minister's comments on the improvements in this regard that this Bill will herald.</P>
      <P>We have all read the rave reviews of our Celtic tiger economy. We have also read of the possibilities that exist to create a society that is capable of standing on its own and of taking its part fully on the world stage. Senators will be aware of the great achievement and honour attained by Ireland this year when we took our seat on the Security Council of the United Nations. There is no better time than now to increase our international profile and to demonstrate our commitment to co-operation in the international arena. This applies equally in the area of intellectual property rights and security and other forms of international relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that this Bill contains measures to bring Ireland fully into line with our EU commitments <Col N="481" /> and places us at the forefront of international protection for industrial designs. It strengthens the protection for industrial designs by raising the standard of design protection to meet the requirements of the EU directive on the legal protection of designs. It goes beyond the minimum requirements of that directive in the interests of Irish designers, Irish industry and citizens. The broad range of strong civil and criminal remedies and penalties ensures that innovation and creativity in the field of industrial design will be encouraged and well protected. As one of the first member states to bring a measure before our national Parliament, we are setting an example for our partners in the EU and underlining our commitment to making the single market work. In this regard, I congratulate and applaud the Minister.</P>
    <P>I further note that the Bill facilitates access for Irish designers and owners of intellectual property rights in designs to the Geneva Act system under the Hague agreement concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs. This is further evidence of Ireland's commitment to participate fully in the international intellectual property community and in the World Intellectual Property Organisation. When operational, this new Hague system will permit Irish rights holders to access, in a cheap and effective manner, protection for designs in potentially over 150 countries by a single application to an international designs office in Geneva. Once again ratification of the Geneva Act of the Hague Treaty will place Ireland at the forefront on nation states in committing to co-operation and implementation of an international treaty. This is to be commended.</P>
    <P>The most important outcome of this legislation on industrial designs from a business and competitiveness perspective must be the creation of a system that is easy to access, inexpensive to use and as user friendly as possible. This means that the most practical and efficient methods by which businesses can avail of the protection afforded by this Industrial Designs Bill must be provided. I congratulate the Minister on achieving this outcome through the legal clarity provided in the text of the Bill, the facilitation of easy access to registration of designs and the adjudication of disputes on the validity of registered designs before the controller rather than just the courts. These measures will contribute to the reduction of red tape and costs for industry in ensuring that its industrial designs are fully protected.</P>
    <P>The provision to enable Ireland to ratify the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement on the International Registration of Industrial Designs is particularly welcome in this regard. The Hague agreement, as I understand it, operates under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation and offers the possibility of registration in over 150 countries on the basis of a single application to the designs office in Geneva. <Col N="482" /> The Geneva Act will become operational over the next few years and will offer Irish business the prospect of significant cost savings by removing the requirement to lodge separate applications in each of the 150 countries in which protection is sought.</P>
    <P>Given the significant increases in exports over recent years and the development of an increasing number of markets for Irish products, it is vitally important that Irish businesses can access legal protection in a large number of countries through a simple system that is centrally controlled and co-ordinated. The costs in time and money in accessing legal protection for intellectual property in various countries can often be daunting and has frequently resulted in Irish businesses deciding not to enter a market or make their products available in markets where intellectual property protection is not strong. They have, therefore, suffered the losses associated with plagiarism and counterfeiting. The provision in this Bill which enables the ratification and implementation of the Hague system in Ireland cannot be over-estimated and the Minister is to be commended in taking such strident action in this regard.</P>
    <P>The provision of strong legal remedies for infringement of registered industrial designs is also to be welcomed by business interests. The move to provide greater access to the courts for the purposes of injunctions, damages and validation of rights in registered designs places the power to protect designs and to invoke the remedies provided in this Bill in the hands of the registered proprietors of industrial designs. This will release the resources of the State from administrative work in matters such as examination for novelty of designs to focus on providing more efficient and effective systems and procedures for the registration and protection of rights in registered industrial designs. It should also reduce the overall costs to industry in providing a system of protection for industrial designs. It is important, as we move into the era of globalisation, that we continue to be focused on our competitiveness, particularly in terms of the export market.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance of the legal protection and support in the law for registered proprietors of industrial designs against piracy and infringement. We have all been made aware in recent times of the damage such activities can do to the economic interests of businesses which rely on intellectual property protection to continue the research and development activity upon which their products and businesses depend. The recent debate in this House on the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, highlighted, as both the Minister of State and Senator Coghlan noted, the significance of strong intellectual property laws in attracting and retaining foreign investment in areas such as software and information and com<Col N="483" /> munication technologies. The reality is that unless appropriate and effective protection is provided in the law, there will be less incentive for business to invest in research and innovative activity in Ireland. Given the mobility of capital and investment in the move towards globalised markets, we must take every step necessary to retain the country's attractiveness as an investment location. The knowledge that our intellectual property laws are in line with the best international standards is crucial in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill provides a clear and broad set of rights for industrial design proprietors as well as a comprehensive range of civil and criminal remedies for owners of and applicants for registered designs. These measures bring industrial design law into the new millennium and replace the existing provisions, which are completely out of date and fail to properly serve the intellectual property community. The establishment of substantial fines and penalties for offences under the Bill sends a strong message to infringers, pirates and those who rip off the people providing the innovations which drive our highly successful economy that there will be a heavy price to pay for such activity and the State will no longer put up with such fraudulent and harmful activity.</P>
    <P>The combination of all these measures will provide a robust, modern and effective system of protection for the creators of intellectual property in Ireland. It is our aim as a country to be a leader in technological development and we have made and will continue to make huge investments in supporting research and development activity in the economy. It is vital that the supporting laws are in place to further encourage the creativity and development of innovations in Ireland. The intellectual property area is a key element in that regard. I am very pleased this type of legislation is being introduced. I commend the Minister of State for bringing it before the House and look forward to its passage in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Senator Cox, in her excellent contribution, I acknowledge not only the presence of the Minister, but also the context in which he joins us. He has been in the vanguard of advancing very significant copyright legislation, much of which was initiated in this House. This is an acknowledgement of the important role this House plays in developing primary legislation. The House will ensure that when the Bill leaves the House there will be very few loose ends to tie up. I am sure the Minister of State is satisfied that when he enters the bear pit of the Dáil Chamber, most of the hard work will have been completed in this Chamber, leaving just a few elements in the legislation to be teased out and tidied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation marks the continuation of a <Col N="484" /> process commenced several years ago after it finally became apparent that Ireland could no longer rely on existing copyright legislation. The result has been strengthened intellectual copyright law and the introduction of the legislation before us to strengthen industrial design copyright. I could not help reflecting on the position Ireland would be in had we not embarked on this significant legislative review. Although our economy has grown apace in recent years and we punch above our weight internationally, size is irrelevant when the matter on hand is the provision of adequate legislative frameworks in which industry can operate.</P>
    <P>I cite the example of China and Malaysia which were seen as pariah countries for many years due to their failure to introduce a proper legislative framework. So widespread was the problem of piracy that the Americans, in whom a vast amount of original copyright was vested, were on the verge of taking these two countries to international courts. They also imposed economic sanctions until proper legislation was introduced. We were caught in the tail stream of the American initiative when we passed legislation, regarded as unprecedented at the time, relating specifically to computer software under the TRIPS agreement as part of obligations to the World Trade Organisation. I believe I am correct in asserting that that was the context in which that legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>It was introduced because it had been proved by companies operating here in increasing numbers that our legislative framework was not strong enough to prevent wholesale piracy of software. We moved extremely quickly once it became apparent that it would undermine to some degree the investment framework carefully nurtured and developed by the Government since it came to office and by other Administrations since the beginning of the 1990s. It was an indication that the wheels of bureaucracy could move and move fast. Things do not happen by chance in government &ndash; they are made to happen. Deputy Kitt's tenure of office as Minister of State with responsibility for this very significant area leaves an impressive and valuable legacy. As they say in show business, he will be a hard act to follow. I know he can relate to that as he is a great singer.</P>

      <P>It is an interesting point that the general public would never have thought about the reasons for such legislation. They would look at a Coke bottle and say, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  There are unscrupulous people who would attempt to manufacture imitations, although I do not think they would get away with an imitation of the Coke bottle because it is so well known. The Minister of State, however, used it as a good example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this legislation cover the industrial and commercial use of Celtic designs? We have a <Col N="485" /> unique culture dating back many thousands of years. I am sure many Senators have seen images from the Book of Kells and discovered on inspection that the article in question was made in China, for instance. Will this legislation strengthen protection for Celtic designs now used in different ways in industrial design? </P>
    <P>The Aran sweater is unique to Ireland. I presume its unique design will be covered by this legislation, yet it is manufactured in countries other than Ireland with a large textile export industry such as Thailand and other Third World countries such as Malaysia and parts of China. Will this legislation mean that those developing such designs in Ireland will be afforded stronger protection?</P>
    <P>The concept of intellectual property goes over the heads of most people. They do not understand the reasons the creators of songs played on the radio should be paid by the radio station concerned. They will, however, understand the concept of a royalty paid to the author of a book and that the creative element of a book is the property of the person who created it.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult for people to understand the abstract nature of this Bill. I suggest that in the case of uniquely Irish products, Ireland should not tolerate a regime in other countries that would allow the theft of our unique Celtic designs. Perhaps the Minister of State will address this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is not only timely and appropriate, it also sends a very powerful message across the world that Ireland does not tolerate any infringement of intellectual property, particularly in the area of industrial design, in the light of the huge explosion of creativity in this country in the last five to ten years. The Bill creates a safe bedrock for the future of creativity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the work that he and his officials have done in bringing this important legislation to Second Stage. It is clear from the debate both here and in the Lower House that the Bill is not controversial and has met with general welcome and approval, not least from those involved in the design sector. Those whose ideas, innovation and designs have been stolen or plagiarised during the years have had the right to be unhappy with the inadequacies of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927. It is interesting to note that in the intervening period the British Government has three times brought forward modernising legislation: Registered Designs Act, 1949, followed by the Design Copyright Act, 1968, and the Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial design law has been neglected during the years in this country. The Minister of State is rectifying that situation on which he is to be congratulated. The Bill brings us into line with our EU commitments and ahead of many of our EU partners in terms of implementation of the EU directive. It gives effect to the Geneva Act <Col N="486" /> of The Hague Agreement which will ultimately provide protection for Irish designs in more than 150 countries around the world.</P>
    <P>This is of necessity very technical legislation. Given that it deals with the area of intellectual property rights, it is unlikely to generate widespread public debate or many column inches in the national press. Nonetheless, its importance is not to be underestimated. The general public has a good understanding of copyright and all that it involves. The issue of intellectual property rights would be most frequently highlighted by the sometimes controversial work of the Irish Music Rights Organisation. There is not a strong public awareness of the need to foster and protect Irish industrial design, yet, as evidenced by today's debate, there is general consensus that it will be design more than anything else that will contribute to the success of many Irish enterprises in the future. The mere mention of Irish design conjures up images of Waterford Glass, Newbridge Cutlery and, more recently, Newbridge design jewellery, Nicholas Mosse pottery and even Philip Treacy's hats. All are designs that have been firmly established internationally.</P>
    <P>The new young designer, the artist in the garret, will benefit most from the enactment of this legislation and the protection it will provide. Thanks to the work of Enterprise Ireland and, in particular, county enterprise boards and, in some instances, Leader companies, there is a growing network of successful designers in practically every county in the country. In County Kildare I make reference to the outstanding design and craftsmanship that are a feature of Franz Caffrey's &ldquo;Manor Collection&rdquo; and John Forkin's &ldquo;Ironcraft Furniture.&rdquo;  It is vitally important that these new innovators, inventors and designers can readily avail of the protection that this Bill will provide. The Bill will help in the fight against design theft or piracy and, I am quite certain, contribute to additional investment and job creation. It is entirely good that it provides for hefty fines for those who infringe the law by exploiting the ideas and innovations of others. &ldquo;To each his own&rdquo; is the concept enshrined in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to mention the recently launched technology foresight fund to which the Minister of State referred. It involves expenditure of £560 million in research and development. The Tánaiste has described it as an integral part of the Government's new industrial development strategy. This fund seeks to promote Ireland as a dynamic location for innovation, particularly in the technologies of tomorrow. If this laudable objective is to be achieved and it must, manifestly the originators of new ideas and designs must be secure in the knowledge that the product of their endeavours and genius has the protection of Irish and international law.</P>
    <P>Given the highly technical nature of the Bill, I suggest to the Minister of State that following its adoption there is a need to place its contents in the public arena in a more user-friendly format. I thank him for his work and detailed explanation <Col N="487" /> of the provisions of this complex Bill. I congratulate him on all his work in the area of intellectual property rights and commend the Bill to the House. </P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for their involvement in the debate. I was here for a longer period when we dealt with the copyright legislation, an area in which we did some useful work. I recall the lengthy debates we had here and many independent commentators suggested that we did our work well.</P>
      <P>As Senators acknowledged, we are back dealing with less controversial and more straightforward legislation. I wish to dwell on some of the issues raised. Senator Coghlan talked about the EU directive which member states are obliged to transpose into their national laws by 28 October. The up-to-date position is that, among member states, Ireland is to the forefront in implementing the directive. Thanks to the Senators' assistance today, I hope the Bill can be progressed through the Houses as soon as possible to enable us to meet our commitments in this area at the earliest opportunity. Enactment of the Bill by the end of the year is likely. That would avoid legal action by the European Commission against Ireland for late implementation of the directive. Other member states are not as advanced as we are in implementing it.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan also referred to the possible exemption from protection of articles of a primary, literary or an artistic character. There is an exclusion in UK law at section 1(5) of the UK Registered Designs Act, 1949, to which Senator Ó Fearghail referred. However, the EU directive on the legal protection of designs does not permit such an exception to be continued in law. I understand the UK authorities propose to delete their provision in implementing the directive. The directive allows member states to refuse to register a design or, if registered, to invalidate its registration on the grounds that it constitutes an unauthorised use of a copyright work under a copyright law. This is incorporated in section 21 in respect of refusal to register and in section 47 in respect of invalidation.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of Celtic design. The Bill covers designs made by handicraft means. Celtic design, in general, will be covered by it. The accession to the Geneva Act of The Hague Agreement will allow Celtic designs to be registered and protected in many countries for a very small cost. The Bill also prevents the copying of a particularly Irish creative design by domestic or international entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All those who spoke touched on the point that industrial designs essentially cover the appearance of the products made by industrial or handicraft means. They include features such as the shape, contour, line and colour. I gave the <Col N="488" /> examples of the famous Coke bottle, the patterns used in wallpapers, carpets and the contours of crystal glassware. As Senators Coghlan and Ó Fearghail said, this legislation has major implications for Irish companies. I add my voice of praise to those involved in this creative area. It is important to recognise this.</P>
    <P>I will give examples of what this legislation will cover. In the case of clothes, it will affect Irish fashion designers. Senator Ó Fearghail mentioned Philip Treacy's creative work on hats. In sportswear, it will include such companies as Adidas and our own O'Neill's; in crystal glass, it will include Waterford and Galway Crystal; in pottery, it will include Kilkenny Design, Tara and Beleek; and in cutlery, it will include Newbridge Cutlery. I understand the legislation will cover the shape of kettles, and the shape, contours and patterns of toothbrushes. The design of mobile phones is a more up-to-date example. It will relate to the shape, colour and covers of mobile phones that can be removed and replaced by differently designed covers. I mentioned carpet design in which we have interest in respect of Navan Carpets. The shape of and material relating to clocks, the shape, colour and contours of television sets, and the shape, contour and lines of cars will also be covered by the legislation. Its enactment will have many implications for our economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to novelty designs. It is not intended that the Patents Office will examine such designs under this new law given that the definition of &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; is now almost universal. It will fall to designers to protect their designs using the much enhanced civil legal remedies contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan and others referred to the Community design office in Spain, which has not yet been established. It awaits the final approval of the EU Council of Ministers. When established, access to jobs in it will be open to Irish citizens as well as to those of other EU member states.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators present and those who contributed to the debate. I appreciate their involvement in it. I hope we can now move on to the next stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the present Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition Government for its gross mismanagement of the health services, thereby causing untold suf<Col N="489" /> fering to the weakest and most vulnerable of our people.</P>
    <P>Much as I like the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, I am intrigued that the Minister, Deputy Martin, who has found many opportunities to criticise the Labour Party's policies on health care and, in many cases, to make outrageous claims such as that we are going to close hospitals and so forth, declined the invitation to discuss this matter. Instead, he sent a likeable but junior Minister to deal with it. It probably reflects the Minister's view of Seanad Éireann; it clearly reflects his view of the Labour Party and might reflect his continuing despair at his inability to have any significant influence on Government on this issue. No doubt he is otherwise engaged in yet another stunt to secure publicity, perhaps for sponsoring a sporting occasion or the like or making nice rhetorical flourishes about under-age drinking. However, he is not in the Seanad to discuss the health services.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government does not think there is a problem. It is only five months since the Taoiseach was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that there was no crisis in the health services. That is bad, although it is the type of rhetorical phrase one expects from politicians. However, he went on to say that it was an &ldquo;excellent, well resourced health service&rdquo; on which more than £5 billion was spent each year for a population of almost four million. I will wait to hear the Members on the other side of the House make their contributions. I do not expect them to say that little bits have been done on the margins, that bits have been added here and there and that they have a good PR conscious Minister who is forever flagging things that cost buttons by comparison with what the health service needs, but that the health service in each of their constituencies is excellent and well funded. I then expect them to go back to their constituencies and tell the people who work in the health service that the health service is excellent and well funded; &ldquo;the Taoiseach says so and we believe it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the country knows that the health services are a mess. Quoting numbers in absolute money terms does not get away from that fact. I have no wish to recite all the things that are wrong but one item that appeared in the newspapers at the end of last August sums it up. Consultants in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, were told to reduce their workloads because they were overloading the hospital's administrative system. The doctors were working too hard for the bureaucrats. Was the solution to make the bureaucrats work harder or to simplify the system? No, it was to deal with fewer patients.</P>
    <P>That sums up the crisis in the health services, quite apart from the 28,000 people who are waiting for services, the number of people who turn up in hospital accident and emergency departments and wait endless hours for treatment and <Col N="490" /> the large number of people on middle incomes who find the prospect of needing a GP for their children horrendously expensive. There is a degree of detachment among many people in Irish life when they can think that spending £25 on a GP is something nobody need worry about. People should look at the Revenue Commissioners' returns to see the number of couples with children who live on less than £20,000 per year, perhaps less than £15,000. For those people, £25 is an enormous amount of money. If they have two or three children they have to think about whether they should ask the doctor to look at the child because he or she might have meningitis or take the chance that the child is okay and keep the money to pay for something else.</P>
    <P>It is one of the myths of the last five years that this type of thing no longer exists. The reality is that GPs in the private sector can charge what they wish. Demand for their services to a large extent exceeds supply. However, and I must say this before Senator Fitzpatrick jumps down my neck, the GPs' part of the GMS, as far as it goes, is the best part of the service. Nevertheless, it is over-stretched with an ageing population of doctors and increasingly reluctant to get involved in single practices for all sorts of reasons with which nobody could argue.</P>
    <P>Do we need further examples of the crisis? There are 800 hospital beds for planned medical admissions in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, which serves 1.6 million people. That is probably about 50% less than is needed. In fact, the Eastern Regional Health Authority estimates that it needs a further 325 beds in this category but it only has the resources to produce 53. One can go through every health service in the country. Last September the Inspector of Mental Hospitals said there were not enough psychiatric beds to deal with psychiatric admissions, long stay and acute.</P>
    <P>How many more facts need I put forward to convey the message to the governing parties? They will get their answer in the general election; of that I have no doubt. A previous eminent Leader of Fianna Fáil admitted during a general election that he did not realise how bad the health services were. That election exploded in his face. It will become the main issue in the next general election. If Fianna Fáil is to do anything about it &ndash; the Progressive Democrats have effectively ceased to exist as an independent entity &ndash; the fundamental conflict at the core of that party will have to be resolved. That conflict arises from the fact that the problem with our health services is that they are hopelessly under-funded, by any international comparison, to the tune of billions of pounds annually.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who controls the purse strings, wonders aloud why things have not got better after his spending so much money, he is illustrating the nature of the problem, which is that he and some of his colleagues will not listen. The Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children <Col N="491" /> explained to him in Ballymascanlon precisely where the money went. It was used to replace clapped out equipment, to fill some of the major gaps that were created by the disastrous cutbacks of the 1980s, to provide additional services for children and to provide the necessary additional services for those with disabilities. Little of the money needed to deal with acute hospital services and the general medical service was provided. This country was the only member of the OECD to reduce the proportion of GDP devoted to health care between 1980 and 1990. All member states encountered an economic crisis during that time, but Ireland was the only country to make such a reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance does not understand where the money is going because the Government does not want to understand, which brings me back to the fundamental conflict. The conflict does not centre on the way in which my party or Fine Gael believes health services should be run, but it is about whether one believes it is worth spending money to have a good health service. The fundamental problem we face is that the health services are hopelessly under-funded. The Government decided when it took office in 1997 that its priority was not to use our new affluence to provide better public services but to cut taxes time after time, loaded mercilessly in the direction of the well off. In the last budget, 60% of the cash dispersed by welfare increases and tax cuts went to the top 30% of income earners. While the top 30% of income earners may be the natural constituency of the Progressive Democrats, or what is left of that party, they have not always been the natural followers of Fianna Fáil. The fundamental conflict faced by Fianna Fáil is that it does not want to do what its constituency demands.</P>
    <P>This country needs to resolve the conflict between the need to provide funding and the ideologically driven view that tax must be reduced. The issue of quality can be addressed following the resolution of the conflict. It is nonsense to suggest that one can talk about quality systems to those who work in a health service that is close to collapse and who suffer from exhaustion and overwork. If the Government says it will provide the extra billions of pounds needed each year to fund a decent health service, it can say to people &ldquo;in return for this money, we want to negotiate quality care systems&rdquo;. The way the Labour Party proposes is the correct way.</P>
    <P>It would be wonderful to argue about how the resources needed for a health service will be spent, but we are instead faced with a dreadfully frustrating debate. Instead of a good and useful debate, the biggest political party in the State is pretending to be in favour of good health services and pretending that such services can be provided cheaply. The Progressive Democrats are involved in this conspiracy to deceive by claiming that our problems can be solved for £100 million per year. No member of the OECD has provided good <Col N="492" /> health care with the levels of expenditure that have been committed to the health service by the Government and it will not be done in the future. Fianna Fáil, in whatever manifestation it takes after the next election and I hope it will be in opposition for a long period, has to reconcile itself to the fact that in a modern, social democratic Europe, good health care can only be achieved by paying for it. If Fianna Fáil does not accept that fact we are condemned to a succession of further disasters.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has outlined clearly the shambles in the health system. I will listen carefully to what speakers on the other side have to say about the amendment they propose to make to the Labour Party's motion. It is a pathetic amendment, short on specifics. The assertions made in the original motion that the health service has suffered from &ldquo;gross mismanagement&rdquo; during the last four and a half years and that &ldquo;untold suffering&rdquo; has been caused to the most vulnerable in the community should be accepted.  The Government should state what it intends to do about the problem.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that the amendment refers to &ldquo;unprecedented increases in health funding&rdquo;. How have the unprecedented increased funds been spent? The amendment says that additional funding has led to &ldquo;significant improvements in a range of important services&rdquo;. Where are the significant improvements? I look forward to hearing about where they have taken place as I cannot see any evidence of them. It takes the biscuit that this House is called on to endorse &ldquo;the process which has been adopted to facilitate the development of a new health strategy&rdquo;. After four and a half years, the Government is talking about a new health strategy. What has been done with the enormous wealth the Government had when deciding its last four budgets? We have had five surplus budgets in the history of the State and this Government has squandered four of them.</P>
      <P>The health service, the most important service of all, is the most neglected. I can go through the litany of its inadequacies. In the last four and a half years, the Government has recruited 4,000 administrative staff but only 2,000 nurses, which demonstrates an unusual proportion of priority. We need people at the coalface to deal with the problem. During this Government's term of office, wards have closed, waiting lists have grown and there has been a shortage of all health professionals, including general practitioners, consultants, orthodontists and psychiatric care workers. There are acute shortages of people to work at the coalface as there has not been enough recruitment. Administration is the only area in which there has been substantial recruitment. The service has been mismanaged and nothing has been done to improve its efficiency or to reform it. It is the great black mark on the Government's record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Taoiseach to say that there is no crisis and that we have a good health <Col N="493" /> service. He is the only person in the country who thinks so. I bet that no Senator on the other side of this Chamber, or the Minister of State, will say tonight that we have a good health service. The health service is lousy and in a mess.</P>

      <P>Every citizen, including Senator Fitzpatrick, the front bench spokesman with whom I share a constituency, knows as well as I do that the health service is a mess and I am sure the Senator will be forthright and will say so.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are a symbol of the failure. People are suffering everywhere as they do not know when they will be treated, which is a scandal. We must not forget that those on waiting lists are the vulnerable, the ill and the young. The health system has been ignored for four and a half years. What does our wonderful Minister plan to do? He will give us a new health strategy in the Government's last five or six months. It is ridiculous and an insult. The track record on this issue warrants a request for the resignation of the Minister and his Government who have failed to use money properly to provide a decent health service.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, the Rotunda Hospital could not receive capital funding of £1 million for a pre-natal centre. The oldest maternity hospital in the world has been in danger of losing its status for four or five years. It only recently received some indication that it will be fine, but it had to wait until the last moment. Temple Street Children's Hospital is one of the most wonderful hospitals in the country and it has tremendous nurses. However, they and the doctors work in atrocious Third World conditions and there is no sign of the new hospital that was promised at the start of the Government's term in office.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has put forward a comprehensive health policy document. I hope the Minister has read it and that Senators on the Government side will also read it.</P>

However, our proposal is for a free GP service for everybody and a universal insurance service. As my colleague said, the cumulative amount of money spent on health was greater than in any previous year, but it is still proportionately one of the lowest figures in Europe; it is far behind the European average. The Labour Party has also proposed the immediate recruitment of another 5,000 nurses, 1,500 general practitioners, 800 hospital consultants, 660 physiotherapists, 660 speech and language therapists and 510 occupational therapists in addition to the provision of an extra 4,800 acute hospital beds and at least one new hospital in Dublin.</P>

      <P>We are concerned that the effects of historic under-funding of the health service, which only ceased in 1997 when the Government took office, should be rectified. Our concerns and objectives are clear. We require an inclusive health service that provides the best medical care to the poorest citizens without <Col N="495" /> undue delay or inconvenience. We are eager to hear about any policy proposals or constructive points of view the Opposition may have, but so far we have had 16 minutes of talk without any concrete proposals.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party appears unwilling to engage in such a constructive debate. The motion is one of condemnation without productive ideas or policies or any regard to the undoubted improvements that have been achieved since the Government took office. The Labour Party's policies and record in Government in comparison to an outline of the Government's achievements in the area of health is relevant to this debate. The Labour Party's concern for the fate of our health services appears significant on the surface and the policies and alternatives it advanced deserve examination. The Labour Party's health policy is a quick fix approach that is uncosted and non-specific.</P>

      <P>The insurance based system advanced by the Labour Party would increase the percentage of funding that goes to administration, thus reducing the amount spent on patients. Senator Ryan was worried about the administrators in James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>Labour Party policy is clear that public and voluntary hospitals will be required to cover their operating costs through income from health insurers and patients co-payments where applicable. Where a small hospital is unable to win a service contract from an insurer, it may be forced to restrict services or close completely. The party should try that in Bantry; it will run well there. The Labour Party's health policy would shut local hospitals.</P>

      <P>Universal health insurance has failed to deliver an acceptable quality and quantity of care in every country that has tried it. The Fine Gael Party appears completely confused on the issue of health. Just over a year ago Deputy Shatter, when speaking on the subject of an insurance based health service, said: &ldquo;Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is questionable. What is needed is less, not more bureaucracy.&rdquo; The Fine Gael Party now advances an insurance based model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's record in Government is less than auspicious. Between 1995 and 1997, a <Col N="496" /> Labour Party Minister for Finance deigned to raise the health spend by just £400 million. The defence for such a meagre fiscal commitment to health, that the State coffers were in deficit, does not wash. The Labour Party has never had a problem with deficits. Its most recent fiscal policy, New Direction, New Priorities, would turn the budgetary surplus the Government has built up over four years into a 1997 style deficit. Obviously the party has no problem with deficits; it just lacks the commitment.</P>
    <P>Recently Deputy Quinn, the former Minister for Finance in question, made the startling admission that his failure to heed concerns expressed regarding the future of our health services led to many of the difficulties that now face them. He said on 21 March 2001:</P>
    <P>Just over six years ago, when there was a different Government in office, concerns about the future of the medical professions, particularly the nursing profession, were communicated to both the Government and the Opposition. Certain predictions were made about the changes that would occur, especially with regard to the numbers of people coming into the nursing profession and the availability of well motivated and qualified people in Ireland. I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are in part related to that.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Quinn was not alone. Deputy Noonan, the then Minister for Health, at a time of relative fiscal prosperity cut the spending allocated for the reduction of waiting lists in 1997. As the Minister, Deputy Martin, outlined, this decision was taken at a time when waiting lists had already increased by 27%. This bizarre reaction to a 27% increase in waiting lists of cutting spending by 20% says it all.</P>

      <P>In the last year of the Rainbow Administration our health services received just £2.5 billion. However, that sum was doubled this year when £5 billion was allocated to the health services. No amount of spin or hot air can alter that fact. Deputy Noonan's reaction to this year's budget, which included the largest health spend in the history of the State, was to assert that the Government was spending too much money. The Minister for Finance has shown more commitment to the needs of the health services than his predecessors in the Rainbow Coalition. This additional investment is delivering. It has meant that 50,000 more day cases and almost 40,000 more in-patient cases were treated in 2000 compared to 1997. These 90,000 extra cases were dealt with because we have a Government committed to investment, efficiency and excellence in our health services. In addition, there are 400 extra doctors in our health services compared to 1997.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick has totally missed the point. We have heard much analysis of the problems in our health services. However, it is not just a matter of money but the fact there is no strategy. We now hear the Minister will wait to introduce a strategy until it is part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto. That is the difficulty Fianna Fáil faces in the health services. There has also been a failure to properly reform the system. We have been told on many occasions that it does not do any good to throw money at the health services. The Senator referred to Deputy Noonan when he was Minister for Health and to the Labour Party's policies, but he did not address the main issues. I am not sure if he mentioned the patients who are the most important people in this debate.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to the &ldquo;weakest and most vulnerable of our people&rdquo;. The Senator only engaged in mud slinging, particularly when he referred to the fact that both the Labour Party and Fine Gael have policies. It is extremely healthy if there are differences between Deputy Shatter, when he was the spokesperson on Health, and Deputy Gay Mitchell. That shows they are analysing the issues and using their own distinct strengths to assess the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government is in its fifth year in office. Since 1997, when Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health, there have been unprecedented budget surpluses; yet we are still waiting for proper reform and a fairer system for everyone, which was not mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick. The ESRI report and other reports have stressed that we must end the two-tier health system and arrest the deterioration in our health services. Despite the blip in our economic success, we must accept the fact we are one of the wealthiest countries in Europe; yet the Government devotes less of our income to health services compared to other countries. It has not taken the opportunity to address the need for strategic reforms. We need more beds, more manpower in certain areas, more emphasis on primary and preventative care and more accountability for the resources made available through the heavily taxed public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patients, or the &ldquo;weakest and most vulnerable of our people&rdquo;, must come first. We meet them on the doorsteps and they make representations to us. They are the people who are fre<Col N="499" /> quently mentioned in newspaper articles about the health system. We have set out our plan for the reform of the health services. This would help to create a universal health system where patients are considered for admission to public hospitals on the basis of their health, not their wealth. At present, it is based on a person's wealth, not his health.</P>
    <P>There are many problems and obstacles in the system. Almost 60% of people, for example, are still on waiting lists in excess of the target time set by the Department. At our clinics we hear stories about individuals who go to accident and emergency departments with a stroke or heart attack and the place is full. There may be people there as a result of street brawls and this type of incident is not confined only to weekends. They see long suffering nurses and doctors trying to deal with such chaos. It is mind boggling to think about how they do it. Elderly people are the weakest in our society and they are often left for two days on a trolley.</P>
    <P>We were all shocked when we heard that when the Taoiseach made a political visit to the constituency of Tipperary North &ndash; I am sure Senator O'Meara will refer to it in her contribution &ndash; a patient was hurriedly moved from a trolley in a corridor. The officials stated this was done to avoid causing stress and indignity to the female patient. However, we know it was done to avoid causing stress and embarrassment to the Taoiseach. That should not be allowed because it is only a smokescreen. We still see the problems when we visit hospitals. I have seen what happens in accident and emergency departments at weekends, where nurses and doctors are hard pressed throughout the night.</P>
    <P>There is a long waiting list for people with special needs. Many have to wait for 12 months and even when they are seen, they must wait a further two or three years until the relevant procedures are done. Our life expectancy is two years shorter compared to that for people in other European countries. We are at the top of the list in terms of the number of women suffering from cancer and cardiovascular disease and at the bottom of the list in terms of the quality of care they receive for such life threatening diseases.</P>
    <P>What is happening in the community? There are major problems in the community in terms of the provision of decent care. Carers are often left to deal with the problems associated with people in the community. Nursing home care and subventions are grossly inadequate. Families often have to find £14,000 a year to put their relatives in private nursing homes. As regards our primary care system, there is a shortage of capacity in hospitals and convalescent facilities. There is a shortage of capacity in hospitals and convalescent facilities. We could debate this issue for hours during Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has suddenly realised there is a problem. The party has been in Government for the past four and a half years <Col N="500" /> and only now when it realises the state of our health services will be an election issue, has it produced policies.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister not present? Why has he insisted on delaying the health strategy until it becomes part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto? I cannot understand that and I hope the Minister is not putting politics before patients. Other issues in this area include a lack of orthodontic services, referred to by Labour Party Members, and a lack of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. The list goes on and on.</P>
    <P>The health service is a shambles and I have no faith in the Minister to do something in the remaining days of the Government. No Government has ever had almost five years to deal comprehensively with the health service with huge budget surpluses at its disposal. We are as badly off as we were when the Government took office. It has done nothing to arrest the decline of the health services.</P>

      <P>One would think the members of the Labour Party were never Ministers in Government. When Deputy Howlin became Minister for Health he said he would work wonders and, to be fair to him, I have always given him credit for increasing funding to eliminate waiting lists but he did not succeed because he did not attack the problem. Money was buried.</P>
      <P>Health funding has doubled from £2.5 billion to £5 billion while inflation has been running at 4%. It is disingenuous of people to say the health boards are in a shambles. That is a gross insult to the doctors, nurses and other professionals working for them who are doing a good job.</P>

      <P>There is a number of problems. Litigation is crippling health services. If one goes into hospital to get a thorn out of one's finger, one is transferred from one consultant to another because no one will make a decision because consultants are afraid of being dragged before the courts. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospitals never have a difficulty dealing with <Col N="501" /> emergencies, such as major accidents and so on, but there are major problems in the area of elective surgery. Private and public health care must be separated. Consultants should not undertake work in public and private hospitals at the same time. A county engineer cannot take on private work. One cannot serve two masters. Ní féidir dhá thrá a fhreastail or, as they said in my time, one cannot whistle and chew meal. One cannot do two jobs at the same time and radical change is needed in this regard. Sometimes relatives of people on waiting lists come home from America and tell them they will give them the money to go private. When this happens the operations they need can be carried out in the morning using the same staff in the same hospitals. Let us be honest. The value for money audit is the most important initiative that has ever been proposed because we are not getting value.</P>
    <P>Various categories of staff have been mentioned in the context of the health strategy but domestics and nurses aides who relieve nurses of a great deal of work are not mentioned. There is also no point in hiring a consultant if he is not provided with support staff, including clerical staff. Who will look after his appointments? Should the consultant do all his own clerical work? Clerical staff are part of the strategy and the Minister is not over the top in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago the standard for entry into the nursing profession was raised and many young boys and girls did not have sufficient points to take up nursing. Many of them went to England and trained as nurses. They are now back working in Ireland and we are delighted to have them, yet they were not good enough to be trained here. Members of the medical professions set those standards. Organisations representing doctors objected to the employment of foreign doctors in Ireland. They put up barriers to prevent such doctors from entering the country. Medical professionals must accept some responsibility for the problems in the hospital system.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a health board for 20 years and I have a good idea about what goes on. The number of people who suffer from self-inflicted diseases such as alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse has put a significant strain on our health services. Funding has been increased in this area in an effort to try to protect people from themselves. Ambulances are out night after night picking up young people who suffer from abuse of the gargle, as they say in Dublin. They are drunk and disorderly, falling around the streets and getting involved in rows outside discos. Some are taken to hospital and take up beds that are needed by others. This problem must also be remedied.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of investment in the health services during my time and much work has been done. I have spoken to many people who have had operations and so on and they wonder why people are saying our health services are poor because they were well looked after when they were in hospital. Many complaints are made by people who visit patients and <Col N="502" /> who have not been in hospital themselves. They see something wrong and make a mountain out of a molehill.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak highly enough of nurses and doctors but the system must be altered because it should not be the case that a person can be treated in a private hospital before a public hospital when the same medical professionals are employed by both hospitals. A distinction must be made in this regard. I congratulate the Government on the funding it is providing. I have always listened to health professionals. Increased bed capacity and more staff are needed, not money.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is present but Deputy Moffatt and herself are sent into the House to bat on behalf of the health service more frequently than the Minister. While it is always extremely nice to address the Minister of State it would be good if our contributions were passed on to the Minister.</P>
      <P>When one walks past the Government Publications Office on Molesworth Street, Dublin, one will see that one of the window displays is virtually devoted to reports on the health service. Such reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and it has been with the greatest difficulty that I have succeeded in getting any of them debated in my years as a Member. I sometimes wonder why we bother to commission them; they are usually commissioned by the Department of Health and Children but not a blind bit of notice is taken of any of them.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Public Health has been established to examine health issues on an all-island basis and I am delighted that its director and one of her colleagues are present in the Public Gallery. They produce the most superb reports but none has been debated in the Houses. They have a report specifically on equity of access to public health services with some issues relevant to the Irish context. Not one word have I heard about it even though, on page after page, there are points relevant to what we are debating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil congratulates itself on the increases in the money we are spending on the health service. This report concedes that the money has helped those with disability, children and the elderly. However, they point to the gaping holes which lead to inequity of access for people to the health services, even inequity of access to GP services. The proportion of people covered by medical cards has gone down and down under this Government. It is just over 30% now. It has been decreasing consistently. The amount of money has been increased and we do now spend more <Col N="503" /> than Greece, Portugal or Spain <i>per capita</i> but the amount spent as a percentage of gross domestic product puts us at the bottom of the heap. This is extraordinary in view of the fact that we have had years of plenty.</P>
    <P>Money is spent but we are still spending less than everyone else because medicine is so expensive. Senator Fitzpatrick knows that internationally, inflation in medicine is double that of any other commodity. We therefore have to spend more money just to stand still. When plans were made in the early 1990s, there was no account taken of the obsolescence of equipment, so we had to spend an enormous amount ten years later trying to catch up. I know this is irritating for those in power because they would like to see far more return for the money that is being spent but that is life. Report after report indicates that there is a serious problem in relation to access for the less well off. Deputy Moffatt and Senator Fitzpatrick, as general practitioners, know that they and the GP services are holding the dyke because the situation is so severe in general hospitals. I disagree with Senator Fitzpatrick about psychiatric services. We are in dire straits in this area too.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Health and Children is bringing forward his health strategy, I refer to two reports, Inequalities in Health in Ireland: Hard Facts, produced in September by Joe Barry, Hamish Sinclair, Alan Kelly, Ross O'Loughlin, Deirdre Handy and Tom O'Dowd from the department of community health and general practice in Trinity College, Dublin, and Inequalities in Mortality 1989-1998, an all-Ireland report on mortality data from the Institute of Public Health in Ireland. One of the most serious aspects about these reports is that they both point out that the data being used at the moment are in many cases incomplete and frequently out of date. For example, in the Republic of Ireland the data are much less complete than in Northern Ireland. This is astonishing. In the latter report, when deaths from diabetes were studied, the authors found that the people who had died in the Republic of Ireland were ten times more likely than those in Northern Ireland to have been categorised as 'occupation unknown'. Since the 1980s, when the report begins, computerisation has taken place throughout institutions and one would assume the quality of the data to be better. However, as one looks through the report from one year to the next, the number of people categorised as 'occupation unknown' actually expands. This makes it difficult to plan regarding the various socio-economic groups and deciding which ones are not gaining access to health care and which have greater morbidity and greater mortality rates.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one can plan a health strategy when this is the quality of the data available. Regarding breast cancer in women the report states:</P>
    <P>Occupational class differences in mortality <Col N="504" /> from malignant neoplasms of the female breast were not assessed because of general problems associated with occupational coding for women.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of women in the Republic of Ireland are not coded for occupation. They are not even coded when they are single mothers. This coding is important if one is trying to identify which socio-economic groups most need service provision. We know that most of them come from lower socio-economic classes but it is preferable to have the hard facts readily available.</P>
    <P>One of the worst problems was identified in the Trinity College report. It pointed out that the peri-natal mortality rates had not been published in the Republic of Ireland since 1993. The peri-natal mortality figures are a combination of the number of still births and the deaths of new-born babies in the first year of life. This is recognised internationally as an important statistic to indicate the health status of the nation. We have had a huge increase in the number of HIV infections in mothers and problems with late arrivals of mothers in maternity units, particularly by those from abroad. The chief medical officer has said that access to hospitals for low-paid people in Ireland is significantly inferior to that in the rest of the European Union. The experience of poor Irish people must be regarded as intolerable.</P>
    <P>We talk about the waiting list in Dublin but around the country the situation is similar. There are no neurologists in the Mid-Western, Midlands, South-Eastern, North-Eastern or North-Western health board regions. Is there no multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease there? There are no rheumatologists in the Mid-Western, Midlands or North-Eastern health board regions. Is there no arthritis in these areas? There are no urologists in the Midwestern, Midlands, South-Eastern or North-Eastern health board regions. Is there no prostatic cancer in these areas? The Midland Health Board features on all three lists. Important Members of this House are on that health board. This is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children sponsored a major inquiry into psychiatric services in the Eastern Health Board region. The inquiry by the Health Research Board reported in 1999, pointing out that there were insufficient acute beds, no alternative to hospitalisation for those who did not need an acute bed, no rehabilitation programmes, no regional service for very disturbed people when they became ill &ndash; they all had to be sent to St. Brendan's which was already full &ndash; no regional facilities for people with behavioural problems, no day hospitals or clinics for people around the country. Patients in acute beds had to be discharged back to their GPs. That is three years ago and not one of those recommendations has been put into force. I do not know how Senator Fitzpatrick can say that the psychiatric services are good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been precipitated by a crisis in the health sector. Members on the <Col N="505" /> Government benches will tell us that more money than ever is being spent on the health services. In money terms that is true. However, in 1980 we spent over 8% of our GDP on our health services. That declined because of the economic crisis in the 1980s. The most swingeing health cuts carried out in 1987 and 1988 had a serious effect on the health service as thousands of nurses were made redundant and taken out of the system and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hospital beds were closed and some smaller hospitals were closed.</P>
      <P>So fevered was the political debate at the time that in the 1989 general election a Dáil Deputy was elected from Longford-Roscommon on the basis of the health services in that constituency. It was clear in my constituency that the swingeing cuts had decimated the services of the county hospital to such an extent that it was on the verge of closing. It resulted in such public debate that somebody advocating better health services in that constituency was elected to the Dáil. That was the voice of the people speaking.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to take note of these issues. Opinion polls have shown that the health service is the area of primary concern for most citizens. In 1980 we spent 8.1% of GDP on health services. In 1997, when the last Labour-Fine Gael coalition left office, GDP spending was 8%. There has been enormous growth in GDP compared to ten or even five years ago, but today the value of GDP spending on health is under 5.2%. That is almost a 2.75% drop in less than five years. This is the reality and the reason for the crisis. There are thousands of people on waiting lists for bypass operations, for hip replacements and treatment for a whole range of often life-threatening diseases that need simple medical or surgical interventions.</P>
      <P>The increase in length of waiting lists for a range of procedures, some of which had no waiting lists at any hospital five years ago, has been dramatic. There is a total lack of direction in relation to health policy. Deputy Michael Noonan, as Minister for Health, concentrated on the prevalence of cancer, which is a serious cost burden on the health service &ndash; we have one of the highest rates of cancer among all ages. There was a strategy based on the many preventive measures which people can take to save themselves from that dread disease. Today there is no health strategy. We have a high level of cardiovascular disease because of lifestyle changes and so on, yet there is no strategy to deal with that problem. Unlike other diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease is often directly related to lifestyle. It has been proven in other countries that well-targeted education programmes and health strategies, especially for young people, can have a dramatic effect in reducing levels of illness in certain categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the Department of Health and Children and, above all, the Minister to take the lead in these preventive strategies. The Minister has contributed nothing and looks totally bewil<Col N="506" /> dered to see the problems all around him getting larger by the day. He has an overwhelmed look when he tries, on television or here in the House, to defend his policies and the shambles that is the health service.</P>
    <P>The OECD consists of 29 of the wealthiest countries in the world. We rank 22nd on the scale and in the European Union we are at the very bottom of the list. The EU average for GDP spending on health services is 8.6%. This includes countries we regard as poorer than ours, such as Greece and Portugal. Why was the level of health spending dropped so dramatically, by 2.75% of GDP? This amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds nowadays &ndash; 1% of GDP or of the national income is millions of pounds. Why did it become Government policy not to maintain the level of spending in GDP terms? There is no other way of making a realistic comparison. Given what was taking place in all 15 member states of the EU, or the 41 or 42 countries that now call themselves European, with governments of all shades, right, left and centre, why was there a policy decision to reduce our spending on health services so dramatically?</P>
    <P>This is not due to economic problems. We have never had a greater level of economic prosperity than in the last five years. Our national income has grown in that time to an extent that we did not see in the previous 25 years or more. Yet all opinion polls say that this crucial issue is of greatest concern to most people whether there be good times or bad times. We have not even maintained the level of services at any benchmark level such as that of 1990, 1995 or 1997. It has gone down and this is manifested in waiting list increases. People on lower incomes, or who depend on the GMS to get into hospital or to obtain treatment, are suffering the most. These are important points.</P>
    <P>My party is proposing that on return to Government we would, as an immediate priority, restore GDP spending on health in our first year in office to about 7%. This would have a dramatic impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan for tabling this week's motion. As ever it provides a welcome opportunity to set out clearly the Government's record on health and the series of initiatives which are coming together in the context of the most comprehensive and inclusive strategy statement on our health services ever prepared. I welcome debate on our health system and am glad to hear any policy proposals which are broadly constructive and which may point the way towards further improvement and reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party motion is plainly not constructive, nor does it point towards a means to assist with the very real work of reform in the health system. It offers no policy proposals, no alternatives and no reform. It is a disappointing reflection of the thinking of the Opposition on <Col N="507" /> the issue of health reform. In the absence of workable, meaningful policy they chose to focus on the negative, to shout crisis at every opportunity and to offer little in the way of beneficial, practical policy ideas.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that only a fortnight after Labour relaunched its health policy document it chose to make no reference to it in this motion. When it was initially launched in March 2000 the concern arose that it would shut local hospitals. These concerns were justified. The document was clear that public and voluntary hospitals would be required to cover their operating costs through income from health insurers and patient co-payments. What this meant was that smaller rural hospitals which could not win service contracts from private health insurers might be forced to close or at least to reduce services. This is the reality behind Labour's quick-fix approach to health.</P>
    <P>The present party health document, relaunched only a fortnight ago, concedes that hospitals which cannot maintain cheap services could &ldquo;find themselves excluded from insurers' lists of approved facilities.&rdquo;  Again, where a small local hospital cannot compete with the larger urban hospitals it may be forced to cut services. In addition, all major studies of this insurance based system concede that it diverts more funding into administration. Plainly, what the Labour Party advances has yet to be properly thought out and we await its deliberations eagerly. We also await the day when the party is as willing and enthusiastic as the Government, the general public and health professionals to shape a progressive and equitable health service. It is understandable then that it has not sought to draw attention to its own health policies, but rather resorts to condemnation and attack.</P>
    <P>Investment in and reform of the health service take time to show results. Why then in early 1997, in the face of a 27% rise in waiting lists, did the rainbow coalition decide to cut the funding allocated towards the reduction of waiting lists by 20%? Why did the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, sit down and make that particular decision? In the face of an urgent need to provide additional nurse training places they refused to provide additional funding. Why? The Minister for Finance in that coalition, the present Labour Party leader, has gone so far as to admit, &ldquo;I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might.&rdquo; He admits that the problems of the present Minister for Health and Children are, in part, related.</P>
    <P>The Government is willing and able to justify its record. It is about time the Opposition parties moved from the rhetoric of condemnation to offer us a detailed explanation of their decisions, which have had long-term repercussions. Why did they cut funding for waiting lists reduction? Why did they not fund the necessary additional nurse training places? Why did they raise the health <Col N="508" /> spend by a meagre £400 million? Why did they not initiate a value for money audit to ensure that pound for pound we get value for money for our health spend? The Government has no such problems in accounting for its record and present policies.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of the Government's policies, 90,000 more treatments were carried out in 2000 than in 1997. This is a clear and empirical improvement for all to see. During the term of this Government to date there has been a doubling of the health spend to £5 billion. This has helped to deliver an increase in staffing in the public health service by 24% since 1997. This means 15,758 more people are working in the public health service and the investment is delivering. Between 1997 and 2000 we provided £74.5 million of dedicated funding for the reduction of waiting lists. In 2001 a further £34.5 million has been allocated.</P>
    <P>This investment is making a clear difference. The number of patients on waiting lists on 30 June was 26,659, a drop of almost 5,200 on the comparative figure for June 2000, a reduction of 16%. Let me be first to assert that it is not enough. This is clearly not a time for back slapping or self-congratulation, but for a continuation of the clear commitment and resources which we, in the past four years, have allocated to cutting waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Compare our record to the increase of 27%, or 6,600, under the rainbow coalition. Why the cuts in waiting lists under this Government and the increase under the Labour Party and Fine Gael? I return to the decision, which will haunt its protagonists, Deputies Quinn and Noonan, to cut the funding allocated to the reduction of waiting lists by 20% in the face of a 6,600 rise in those lists.</P>
    <P>It was left to this Government to undertake the major review of the underlying causes of the waiting lists back in 1998. The expert group established to undertake this review proposed a series of short, medium and longer-term measures to cut waiting lists and deliver the results we are now achieving. The waiting list for cardiac surgery is down 52% since June 2000. Gynaecology is down 35%; ENT, 30%, and ophthamology, 23%. These are the sort of improvements of which the Government is justly proud, but we do not assert for one moment that all is well or that the work is done.</P>

      <P>Four years of investment and reform has plainly delivered improvement and we know that much remains to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone familiar with the realities of our health system will know that reforms take time to implement. Lengthy run-in times are often as necessary as they are frustrating. It takes time to build hospitals, wards and clinics and to train nurses and health professionals. If the reforms, investment and training had begun six or seven years ago, we would be witnessing the results <Col N="509" /> now. Since 1997, however, right across the health service a similar story is told of increased funding delivering an agenda of reform and improvement.</P>
    <P>For people with intellectual disabilities we have provided 1,600 new residential places and around 375 new respite places. For those with a physical and sensory disability we have provided over 50 long-term residential places and 95 respite places. We have also provided more than 400 new day care places and an enhanced level of home support services, including personal assistants. A capital sum of £150 million will be provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for mental health services. Additional revenue funding of £18.64 million was made available to these services in this year alone.</P>
    <P>Real progress is also being made in cancer services. The establishment of the national cancer forum, the £60 million we have spent to date, BreastCheck and the national cervical screening programme are but a few of the concrete examples of commitment matched by funding delivering action, which is the hallmark of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is also true in relation to the cardiovascular health strategy which was referred to earlier and to which £27 million has been allocated in the last two years.</P>

      <P>This money is being spent on health promotion, nicotine replacement therapy, hospital services and cardiac rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Tackling manpower issues effectively is the key to reforming the health service. There are shortages of key health professionals across the system both in Ireland and abroad, but Government reforms are showing results. Across the board there has been a total staffing increase in the health service since 1997 of 24%, or 81,513 at the end of 2000. Since 1997 there are an additional 321 consultant posts, about 600 more doctors and 1,700 more nurses in the public health sector in Ireland. In the key area of nursing, for example, although there was a net increase of 1,702 nurses in the system last year and the number of vacancies is down by 5%, a considerable number of vacancies remain. To address the continued vacancies in these and other areas we are taking concrete measures which are delivering equally concrete results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nurse training places have been increased by more than one third &ndash; some 500 places. We have invested in marketing campaigns to encourage school leavers and mature persons to enter nursing training. We have introduced flexible working arrangements and agreed to pay fees to nurses undertaking part-time nursing degree courses. We have improved the package of financial supports to nursing students, including a 43% increase in the annual maintenance grant. We have also recruited nurses from abroad, introducing a new working visa-work authorisation <Col N="510" /> scheme to facilitate the recruitment of nurses from non-EU countries. Since June 2000 more than 2,000 visas have been issued to these non-EU nurses.</P>
    <P>In the light of these efforts and the continued vacancies, particularly in the area of nursing, I was astonished to find that the Fine Gael spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Flanagan, has called on FÁS to end its attempts to recruit key health professionals, including nurses, doctors and speech and occupational therapists abroad through the European Employment Network. His leader, Deputy Noonan, and party spokesperson on Health, Deputy Gay Mitchell, only a week before released the very same statement in each of their names which asserted that the recruitment of highly qualified nurses from overseas was the only thing preventing meltdown in our hospitals. This underlines the degree of utter confusion in Fine Gael in the area of health today.</P>
    <P>Plainly, there is still an urgent need to recruit nurses and other key professionals from abroad to fill positions which are simply not being filled by Irish people. Opposition parties should be supportive of Government efforts to attract these health professionals. Throughout the health services, among the health professionals, administrators, patients and the Government, there is an understanding that the health system needs prolonged and continued reform at all levels. The delivery of such profound reforms, the provision of a responsive, equitable and high quality health service, which is responsible for the health needs of all our citizens, is a complex matter. Most of us who deal with the health services are aware of that, although it appears the Opposition is not so aware. It is not just a matter of making superficial reforms. Any meaningful and lasting reform must be thorough and must deal with the whole range of structural issues, including basic manpower deployment, contracts and planning. Shallow solutions cannot reform the deep structural problems of our health services. The quick-fix reforms proffered by the Opposition simply will not work. What will work to deliver a sound, deep foundation upon which to reform the health service and create an equitable health landscape for the decades ahead is the progressive programme of research and negotiation which was utterly absent before the Government took office in June 1997. This is the admittedly slow but necessary process needed for the delivery of an effective health strategy.</P>
    <P>The Opposition claims we should have dealt with this earlier. This would have meant throwing a couple of initiatives together between pretty covers and launching them to great fanfare. We could have speeded up the process by failing to consult the public and the health professionals. We need not have bothered with the medical manpower report and the report on the working practice of junior hospital doctors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have neglected the value for money audit and been content to throw money at the problem. The medical manpower report and the report on junior doctor working practices have shown us the way forward to a radical improvement in the level and quality of hospital care. The Commission on Nursing has shown us what steps are necessary to attract, train, utilise and retain nurses. The value for money audit is dealing with how best to utilise and deploy resources within the health system. Other moves, such as the detailed strategic assessment of hospital capacity, the largest public consultation ever carried out in the health sector, and the establishment of a national consultative forum to represent a large cross section of health stakeholders are also central to the necessary preparations for the health strategy. I have no doubt that, when published, the national health strategy will shape an equitable, world-class and thoroughly reformed health service for the decade ahead.</P>
      <P>The alternative is the quick-fix approach of Fine Gael and Labour. The alternative is to bulldoze the input of the public, the health stakeholders &ndash; doctors, nurses and administrators &ndash; and call for unworkable policies based upon political opportunism. The Labour Party has placed a motion before this House condemning the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition for gross mismanagement of the health services. I reject the original motion and assert that the record of the Government is one of commitment to delivering funding and reform. I urge the House to accept the Government amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the terms of this debate as there is quite a lot of party politics involved. Market research has found that health will be the principal area of conflict in the coming general election. That has been noted by politicians. It is not a coincidence that the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health, Senator Fitzpatrick, and Labour's Senator Costello are from the same Dublin constituency and they are here in the Seanad backing it up. I am not interested in party politics, I am interested in the patients. I will reluctantly vote with the Opposition, but feel that the terms of the motion and the amendment are widely unrealistic. One says that everything in the garden is rosy, the other says that everything is rotten. I do not believe either is correct.</P>
      <P>We have problems and we should use debate in this House to address them. This fact has been highlighted by a very interesting series of comparative articles in <i>The Irish Times.</i> That newspaper, on 23 October, referred to the health system in France. Professor René Caquet described the health care system which he helped to design as &ldquo;a mixture of pride and amusement&rdquo;. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French system is very . . . French. It's very individualistic. People want to choose <Col N="512" /> their own doctor, and the doctor prescribes whatever he wants to. The Gallic attitude towards community is very different from the English-speaking world; the French spend more, and the deficit has to be financed. But at the end of the day, overspending seems unreal to the individual: it's the general public's problem, not his.</P>
    <P>In other words, one has an ailment, wants it cured by having the best possible treatment and is unconcerned about the financial implications. This has problems, as Professor Caquet admitted. He said:</P>
    <P>It is a very good, but expensive system with a lot of wastage. It is blurry, badly organised and costly &ndash; but people are well cared for.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see in this country is a system that is not blurry, costly or badly managed, but still manages to deliver a good health service to the people.</P>
    <P>Germany also has compulsory health insurance. It was the first country to introduce a national social security system under Bismarck in the 19th century. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 October, Pádraig Ó Moráin, reporting from Germany, said it is very difficult to find a Berliner who will complain about the health service. They seem stunned when asked what improvements they want because they get everything they need, although there are some financial problems in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>We return again and again to the problem of funding. Generally speaking, we are below the European Union average in that regard. I am not sure about what is contained in these health figures. Do they include various peripheral social welfare grants? If so, we are even further behind Europe. At Ballymascanlon earlier this year, Mr. Kelly, the Secretary General in the Department of Health and Children, was put on record as saying that our health service has been underfunded for years. That is a sad indictment not just of this Government but of previous Governments also. In the 1980s hospitals were closed with an enthusiasm that would have done Dr. Beatty proud, with his cuts on the railways.</P>
    <P>Even if funding is available, what will it be used for? It has to be specifically, clearly and logically targeted. There cannot be more beds without more staff. If 1,000 additional beds are provided what will be done about staff? It is true there will be a training time lag. Where will these staff come from? One way of handling the health service would be to keep as many people out of hospitals as possible by developing the use of health centres. This already happens in private medicine. A couple of weeks ago I had a problem with a tooth. I had a major job done &ndash; the tooth was extracted and a bone graft was also carried out. I went to a specialist, he sent me to another specialist area for an X-ray. It was very efficient. Could this not be done in the public area? Health centres, equipped with radiographic machines and able to carry out simple procedures such as <Col N="513" /> blood tests, could be developed and doctors would refer people to them. It would make the whole system much more efficient.</P>
    <P>Nurses who have left the profession could be encouraged to return. There has been a flight from nursing but certain things can be done. I am glad the Minister referred to the flexibility of hours. We must really push this. The days of the battle-axe ward sister who set a rota in stone for a month in advance are gone. We must encourage people to come back on a part-time basis. One of the things that would facilitate that is the development of crèches in hospitals. Tax write-offs could be given to provide them, or their provision could be made part of the conditions of employment. The whole system should be made more nurse friendly. Account should be taken of the personality of nurses. It is right that some people should go along an academic route, but there is too much emphasis on the points system, degrees, universities etc. There are wonderful people who have a vocation to nursing and who bring human skills with them. Let us get them back into nursing. Let us not exclude them on a narrow, academic basis.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is a two tier health system. That is perfectly obvious to anybody with even one eye. Which system do the people who object to this want to drop? Do they want to drop the private system where people certainly get a much better service? If one looks at today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> they will find that Muiris Houston has an article where he recalls a paper by Dr. John McManus, delivered to the Royal Academy of Medicine.</P>
    <P>Dr. McManus carried out a survey which was randomly selected and found that only 25% of medical card patients have had a coronary angiogram. The survey showed 77% of private patients had undergone this definitive investigation. Of 30 private patients only one did not undergo an exercise electro-cardiogram, another basic test of cardiac disease, whereas 15 of the 40 medical card patients had not undergone the test. His conclusion was that the poor not only have a much greater chance of getting coronary disease, but they also have a far lower chance of having it investigated and managed adequately. This is a disgrace and reflects badly on the whole provision of health services.</P>
    <P>We need to bring public care up to the level of private care, a secondary wonderful impact of which would be to put manners on the VHI and BUPA. Private patient care in public hospitals should be encouraged. This creates a much better and greater range of expertise on site in the same hospital. What is the point of making doctors travel ten miles to look after their private patients? It is stupid. One thing about public hospitals is the food may not be as good as in private hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy report was published in 1992 when the Tallaght Hospital project was under way. It recommended reducing the capacity of the hospital by one third, which put pressure on the <Col N="514" /> hospital. When the Adelaide and Meath and other hospitals moved to Tallaght, they continued the perfectly reasonable practice of mixing private and public patients. In line with policy, the board then developed a private patient block or ward in a separate building into which all the private patients were moved. The public beds this left free, but empty, were all closed down. That is an exercise in insanity. It is the most expensive form of bed closure I have ever come across. This House should be directing its attention to the welfare of patients and removing the inequalities in the system, not simply scoring party political points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the Minister of State. Following Senator Norris's comments, it is important that a consensus exists on certain areas. It is vitally important that we ensure the system of health care provides the best quality care to the patient, the customer so to speak, in an accessible and equitable manner, at the time and place he or she needs the service. Everybody in the House, both on the Government and Opposition benches, is agreed on those principles.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise we are in the run up to a general election which will take place at some stage next year. For that reason, we will have debates which are political in tone for the rest of the Seanad session. As a novice at this game I regret this, but it has been the way in the past and will be in the future.</P>
      <P>To return to the point, we agree that throwing money at the health service will not solve its problems. We also agree there has been severe under-funding in the health service for many years. Many of the problems we see today, which have not been resolved in the past three or four years, are a result of that under-funding. We cannot build £90 million or £125 million hospitals overnight. That is evident from my experience in Galway. When I entered this House in 1997, a £25 million investment programme was under way in the city, which has since been completed. Another programme, phase two, worth £90 million has been initiated. We are starting the process of planning for phase three. However, phase two will not be physically finished until 2003. Unfortunately, regardless of my view on the matter, those blocks cannot be up in the hospital any faster, not even if I were to throw £180 million at it. Therefore, we must show a measured response which balances our words with our expectations.</P>
      <P>In her speech the Minister of State said, &ldquo;We do not assert for one moment, however, that all is well or that the work is done.&rdquo;  That is the very clear message from the Government and can be seen by anybody who looks at the health service with a clear and constructively critical eye. What we have are four years of investment. A reform and set of clear objectives will be clearly laid out in the health strategy which will set out the way forward for health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot dispute that the Government has <Col N="515" /> delivered improvement. We acknowledge, however, that much remains to be done. We have shifted the focus from the length of waiting lists to waiting times. There is a consensus, I believe, that the number of people waiting, whether ten or 100, is irrelevant provided they all have to wait an acceptable length of time. People will accept that. We are entitled to be told how long we have to wait or if there will be a delay in receiving treatment. We are entitled to be communicated with in a proper manner. If, for example, a hospital cancels an appointment for whatever reason, it must make a new appointment to ensure the patient is not suddenly left in limbo with no idea what will happen next.</P>
    <P>There are a number of simple changes which can be implemented throughout the health boards and hospitals over the next few months. Many have been made already. In the next few years, these simple changes will make a difference to how people perceive the service. They will know what to expect, so if they are told they must wait six months for a service, they know it means exactly that and not six years.</P>
    <P>I recently looked at the waiting list for children's cardiac services. We have made changes in this area. The Government has rightly chosen to send some children waiting for cardiac services abroad because we have been unable to provide the service here within an appropriate time frame. If it were in power the Opposition might have done the same. Nevertheless, we can be proud of that action. I wish we could have provided the services here and that people did not have to travel, but I am certain the parents of children who chose to travel are much happier now their children have benefited from the service abroad.</P>
    <P>Listening to the monitor in my office earlier I heard someone &ndash; Senator Costello I believe &ndash; describe the health service as &ldquo;lousy&rdquo;. I completely reject that on behalf of everyone working in the health service. The one thing on which everyone in Ireland is agreed is that if one is admitted to hospital in need of an emergency procedure, or is very sick and requires the care and support of doctors and nurses, the health service provides that service. It delivers for the people in greatest need. If I were to have a heart attack now, I have no doubt an ambulance would come and take me away and I would be looked after immediately in hospital. The care and attention given under very difficult circumstances by staff, particularly in the hospital service, is second to none. Junior doctors and nurses, the people involved at the coalface of health care provision, deserve to be congratulated. Things are not easy or perfect, but to say the health service is lousy is a terrible indictment of the service these professionals try to provide on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>To return to the idea that reforms take time to implement, I wish to specifically address the construction of infrastructure and the need for expansion of bed capacity. My plea to the Mini<Col N="516" /> ster for Health and Children and his Department is very parochial. We have a severe bed shortage in Galway and the region. Our regional hospital, Merlin Park Regional Hospital, does not have enough beds and has suffered many years of inadequate infrastructure and investment. The Minister for Health and Children has on his desk a proposal for significant investment in the hospital. Without that investment, we will not be able to continue to provide the type of service available in the Western Health Board area in terms of reducing waiting lists or in areas such as cardiac and cancer care. I appeal to the Minister to consider the application and find some way of providing the resources we need to move forward.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has encountered the nurses and doctors who work in the cancer care services will say that they are doing tremendous work. They work in very difficult circumstances, they deal with very sad and terminal cases and they make life just that little bit easier for those patients. I thank everyone involved in the health services at every level. They have a tough job in a tough environment but the new health strategy will deliver a system of health care we can be proud of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know where to start when talking about the current state of the health service. Senator Cox talked about being parochial in her references and I will now be accused of being parochial by talking about the situation in north Tipperary and in Nenagh in particular. The reason I do so is because it represents a small but good example of how things are at the moment in the health service. It illustrates a number of fundamental issues which need to be addressed and a number of examples of the crisis which we now face. I am calling it a crisis and I know I am not the only one to call it a crisis. Despite what the Government might think and say, the health service is in crisis. The Government may seek to blame opinion polls, the proximity of an election and Opposition hyperbole for people's concerns about the health service. People are deeply concerned about the state of the health service because they have first-hand experience of the crisis. They are not concerned because we have told them to be, they are concerned because they have every reason to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I spoke to a recently married young man who has a nine month old child. At three months of age, the child was referred to a consultant in Dublin because of a suspected serious problem. The original appointment was cancelled and that is understandable as these things can happen. The couple are covered by VHI but it is a one income household. The child's mother has chosen not to work because of the serious condition of the baby. She has given up her job and they must now fund a considerable mortgage on one income. The young man took a day's leave <Col N="517" /> from work and the couple took the child to Dublin to meet the consultant. Despite the fact they had a letter confirming the date of the appointment, when they arrived they were told that the appointment had been cancelled. They were then told however, that they could see the consultant immediately if they paid a fee of £90. They were so upset and discommoded and worried about the baby that they paid the £90 which they could hardly afford. They still have not been given a diagnosis of the problem, but that is an ongoing situation.</P>
    <P>This was a classic example of how the two-tier system, which Senator Norris does not seem to object to, has become institutionalised in the provision of health care. I regard the two-tier system as unjust, unfair and inherently wrong. It is causing serious distress to many people and is adding to the high level of public concern about whether one can access the health service without money. Clearly the view abroad is that one cannot.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently visited Nenagh hospital. His visit has been overshadowed by the controversy caused when hospital beds and trolleys were removed from the corridor minutes before he arrived and put back minutes after he left. This was done in order to avoid causing embarrassment to the Taoiseach even though, as Senator Jackman pointed out, the excuse given was that it was done to spare the patients the embarrassment. In fact the staff have informed me that the patients not only encouraged but in some cases tried to insist that they remain in the corridor so that the Taoiseach could see for himself how the situation was in Nenagh hospital, not only on the day he visited but as it obtains week in week out, month in, month out, all year round.</P>
    <P>An application has been made to the Government through the national development programme for a significant increase in beds but we hold out no hope. There was a major capital investment in Nenagh hospital in the last two years but it has produced no additional beds. Further restructuring could reduce the number of beds available to patients using Nenagh hospital. That same refurbishment and extension work had the effect of a hopefully temporary closing of the elderly care unit. When the renovation was complete, the elderly care unit had disappeared and has not reappeared to date.</P>
    <P>My colleagues on the other side of the House seem to be determined to convince us that the state of psychiatric services is very good. We have not one single residential psychiatric care bed in north Tipperary. A patient in need of psychiatric residential care must go to Clonmel, even though that is in the South-Eastern Health Board area. There is an unbelievable lack of decision making on that issue and we are still waiting for a psychiatric unit. We are about to face a crisis in nursing numbers in Nenagh. This year, for the first time, an advertisement for nurses yielded no response.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" />If the Government was to read the Labour Party policy document it would see a very well developed and fully-costed strategy. We are still waiting for the Government's strategy. It seems that, despite its own resources and spin doctors and PR experts, the Government can only, according to the Minister of State, conduct &ldquo;research&rdquo;. Four and a half years on, we are still waiting for a strategy. Why did the Government not have a strategy when it came into office? We have a strategy in preparation for the coming election. We are proud of that strategy and we will happily stand over it. It contains a structure for fundamental and much needed valuable reform of the health service designed to end, once and for all, the crisis at the heart of the Irish health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted to participate in this debate on the health services and to see the investment and improvements that have taken place within the health services. A consultative process is taking place within the health services with a view to producing a health service that will be second to none in a growing economy that has the revenue and the strength to develop and put in the necessary resources for the future.</P>
      <P>The Government must be complimented on its investment in the health services. Some 81,513 people work in the health services. That is a very high employment level and a major responsibility. From my experience of the health boards, I am aware there has been a restructuring of positions. The service provided to people dealing with the health boards is not as good as it was. A great deal of restructuring has taken place throughout the health services, but the quality of the service provided has not improved as a result of that investment.</P>
      <P>I support the Government's approach of auditing the money spent and the revenue collected within the health boards to ensure the public get value from taxpayers' money invested by the Government in the future of the health boards by creating extended services within the system.</P>
      <P>There is a need to change the contractual system of consultants. There is merit in the idea of contracting young consultants who are anxious to take on work and who could perform urgently needed operations to help reduce the numbers on the waiting list. I hope that matter will be considered in the new strategy. I accept there are precedents on consultation with consultants in this process, but this matter should be considered. Young consultants are anxious to do such work. One need only compare the procedures carried out in private clinics. The efficiency and effectiveness of the value for money audit that has been given and the throughput is very credible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that £5 billion has been invested in the health services. The current capi<Col N="519" /> tal programme of investment in hospital services throughout the country is the largest since the foundation of the State. One of the main challenges facing the health services is the delivery of centres of excellence and the provision of services in a modern and professional manner. A consultant gave me a booklet on this matter and said that one of the problems is the number of hospitals that need professional services. We cannot deliver hospital services on every doorstep. The challenge, financial and otherwise, facing us in the future is whether hospital services can be delivered in every county to the excellent standard expected. It may be possible to do so when there is a growing economy. A major challenge for the health services and Governments in the future will be the provision of services in every public hospital to the standard of excellence people expect today.</P>
    <P>We have a growing population and many people are returning to live here, which increases the demand for health services. The Government is approaching this matter in a responsible and consultative manner with all the partners. Its experience of dealing with the nurses in terms of the consultative programme that was put in place, the structuring of an educational programme, the setting out of a career profile for nurses and the requirements within that are a lead for the Government in dealing with that sector. It also has a major responsibility from the point of view of providing necessary funding and facilities to deal with those requirements.</P>
    <P>The Government has increased the number of nurses within the hospital services, which is to be welcomed. I hope the position will improve. Many nurses changed career because they considered there were jobs they would prefer that were more remunerative and suitable than nursing. That pattern might change in the future because of economic trends and the changes currently taking place. Changing that pattern is a major challenge.</P>
    <P>The health Ministry faces the greatest challenge in the State as it affects almost everyone. At this stage of our economic development, the challenge facing the State is to ensure that the health system is equitable. I agree with previous speakers that medical card holders have to stand back while others can afford to gain access to the health services. That must be addressed in the future. The number of medical card holders has fallen on the basis that our economy has strengthened and more people are working, but 30% of people fall into that category and need to be looked after.</P>
    <P>The Government has invested money in the structures and has increased the number of administrative and professional staff in the hospitals. The implementation of the national strategy, involving consultation with the people <Col N="520" /> and the Government taking firm decisions, be it in the insurance or the consultative area, will provide the basis of ensuring a positive health service for the future for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refuse to be excessively provoked by silliness about what the Labour Party did not do five years ago because this issue is much too important. Hindsight is 20:20 vision. I compliment the leader of my party on being, as he always is, honest about his achievements and mistakes, which he accepts. No doubt the diligent Fianna Fáil machine dug through the records to find that out to try to abuse another politician's willingness to be serious about a debate on a serious issue by turning it into political silliness. It is unworthy of the Minister of State who read that script because I regard her as a serious politician who often deals with issues in a serious way and has attempted to address serious issues well in her onerous area of specialist responsibility. Let us leave the silliness aside.</P>
      <P>The Government did nothing and is doing nothing to deal with many of the issues which could be dealt with immediately. The crisis facing working families on average industrial wages, for whom paying for a visit to a GP poses a major cost, could have been dealt with. That did not need capital investment. The crisis in our hospitals existed and it is not helpful to look back and talk about what Labour did not do four or five years ago. Fianna Fáil is admitting it did not notice there was a problem then. I do not take the Progressive Democrats too seriously because they live on a different planet. The people who vote for that party do not need public health services. They are not that kind of people. Fianna Fáil's voters and supporters need public health services the same as my supporters, the Labour Party's supporters and a good section of Fine Gael's supporters. The Progressive Democrats' supporters do not need them. They do not worry about these things. They can produce pie in the sky nonsense from an obscure individual in Limerick, which suggests one can deal with health services and tackle the waiting list with £100 million a year. Nobody else in the world has done that, but the Progressive Democrats in Limerick have worked it all out on their own. I do not take them too seriously.</P>
      <P>What I take seriously is human suffering. I find difficult the retrospective rewriting of history. Fianna Fáil is good at that. It wiped out Jack Lynch for a long time and then rediscovered him. It is now wiping out Charlie Haughey and presumably if his image changes he will be rediscovered.</P>

      <P>The reason for all the developments in nursing, for which the Minister claims credit, is <Col N="521" /> that the nurses went on strike. It was not that the Government discovered an enlightened new view but that the nurses on strike demanded those things. The Government opposed the reduction in the working week for junior hospital doctors and attempted to have it delayed so far into the future that even the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, might be retired, not to mention myself.</P>
      <P>I hate the phrase &ldquo;it will not be solved by throwing money at it&rdquo;. Of course, that is true but it is also a code for &ldquo;let us not spend money on it&rdquo;. The fundamental issue, which the Minister did not address and which the Fianna Fáil-led Government will not address, is that we are not devoting enough national resources to the provision of a health service. I am aware that matters have improved in certain areas but our health expenditure is low by international standards. It is even lower than it appears because we classify as health expenditure things that are classified as social services in other countries. If that element is removed, our expenditure decreases further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an excuse to claim we spend much more now than was spent previously. The Government has had surpluses which, by the end <Col N="522" /> of its term in office, will perhaps amount to £20 billion. It decided not to spend that money on things that could be done immediately in many areas of health care. Long studies and research were not required. Many hospitals had programmes waiting to be developed. Why does it take so long to appoint a new consultant? Why does it take Comhairle na nOspidéal an age to approve a new appointment? Why does it take the Local Appointments Commission an age to make appointments?</P>
    <P>The real issues are will, resources and vision. The little piece in the Minister's speech about delivering a national health strategy is similar to the preface of every aspirational document produced by the OECD and I suspect it was copied from them. It says what we want but does not contain a single reference to what we will get. Tragically, the Government is caught in the dilemma that it has committed itself to the principle of low taxes forever but at the same time it wishes to persuade us that it will produce the type of health service that is only available in the civilised countries of Europe, countries which accept that one cannot have health care on the cheap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. Most of us read with consternation in the national <Col N="523" /> press today that various educational projects are likely to be put on the back burner. I am not pessimistic and I come here tonight with a great deal of confidence to call for certain facilities to be put in place at CallaSanctus College in Oranmore. This is not an ordinary project, but an extraordinary one.</P>
      <P>This is a great school, with wonderful staff, great teachers, supportive parents and 680 precious children. It is a great seat of learning, but conditions are outdated and inadequate. The staff are working under extreme pressure with 680 students in an outdated school that could not possibly meet safety standards in this modern age.</P>
      <P>Great progress has been made. I commend the parents association and all those who have responded so far to the cause. The parents council was advised last October that work would commence in spring or early summer 2001 at the latest. Unfortunately, nothing has happened. The planning process has been gone through and stage 4 has been passed. We now need a commencement date. Money must be included in the internal estimates of the building unit of the Department of Education and Science and provision made in the upcoming budget for finance for the CallaSanctus project in Oranmore.</P>
      <P>I said this is not an ordinary project. It is an educational facility for the fastest growing suburban town in Europe. Oranmore is a mecca for house hunters and is spiralling out of all proportion. All four Galway county councillors for the Oranmore area have worked extremely hard over the past year. I commend my colleagues, councillors Noel Grealish, Mary Hoade and Timmy Rabbitt. We worked on a committee with Galway County Council to devise a development plan for this spiralling town on the hinterland of Galway city. We discussed structures, roads, housing and facilities for the huge number of people who want to live in Oranmore.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect is a state-of-the-art school in such a growing area. I regret that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, is not present, but I have great respect also for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and urge him to respond. The Department of Education and Science and the Government must respond to this issue. The decision on this matter may be given tomorrow when a deputation from the CallaSanctus school comes to Leinster House to meet the Minister for Education and Science. It may be more opportunistic to give a positive response then, given that this is an election year. I do not mind that; I only want action. I make this case not only as a public representative and chairman of the Galway County Council Oranmore electoral area committee, but as a teacher, an educator and a parent of four school going children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to give me a com<Col N="524" /> mencement date and allocate the finance for a school in the fastest growing town in Europe. This is a reasonable request. Parents in Oranmore are waiting for a positive and reasonable answer and I hope the Minister of State can provide it because this is one of the most important matters I have put before the House in my nine and a half years of membership. I appeal to the Minister of State to bring the project to fruition. He should provide the funding and give a commencement date for the educational facilities that are so much needed in the town of Oranmore, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department received an application for additional accommodation from the school authorities. The planning section of my Department agreed a long-term enrolment projection of 625 pupils with the school management authority. On this basis, overall development of the school to provide extra accommodation was planned. Schedules of accommodation, setting out the use of the space to be provided, were agreed between the school management authority and my Department.</P>
      <P>A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The architectural design of post-primary education projects is based on a number of stages, the first of which is site suitability, briefing and site report. Stage 2 consists of the outline sketch scheme. Planning permission is sought at stage 3, the developed sketch scheme, in addition to the fire safety certificate. Stage 4 consists of the detailed design of the proposed project with the bill of quantities being drawn up at stage 5. Tender action is taken at stage 6 with the final tender report being submitted.</P>
      <P>The project at CallaSanctus college is now at stage 4, that is, detailed design. The design team's submission has been received in my Department and is under examination. I expect my Department will issue approval to the school authority shortly to instruct its design team to proceed to stage 5, the preparation of tender documents.</P>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the schools building programme at all levels. The progress to construction of projects, including CallaSanctus college, will be made in the light of allocations for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of when the Dublin Institute of Technology can occupy the lands at Grangegorman and establish its campus there is becoming a hoary chestnut. When the Dublin Institute of Technology was established in 1991, <Col N="525" /> it began to look for a campus to consolidate the existing faculties. As the Minister of State is aware, the Dublin Institute of Technology operates its six faculties on ten acres of land spread across the city, north and south. In 1992, it identified Collins Barracks as a suitable campus. It was due to become available when the last vestiges of the Army located there pulled out. The Dublin Institute of Technology felt it would provide a fine campus, but it went instead to the National Museum which was crying out for accommodation at the time.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the Dublin Institute of Technology searched around and identified St. Brendan's in Grangegorman where the Eastern Health Board was divesting itself of many of the institutional care buildings as some patients were moved into the community. Approximately 70 acres of land were surplus to the needs of the health board and the Dublin Institute of Technology considered acquiring them. It appears an agreement with the health board was reached, in principle, for the transfer of the land for approximately £10 million. Plans and designs were drawn up and the Dublin Institute of Technology presented them to the community on a number of occasions. It explained that it would be a good neighbour in the Grangegorman-Stoneybatter-Oxmantown area. It indicated how it intended to move in to the faculties, starting with the music faculty.</P>
      <P>It planned to build an auditorium, which would be available to the local community for functions. It was also intended that buildings for student accommodation would be among the first to be constructed. The Grangegorman lands are adjacent to Bolton Street college and Linen Hall and could be quickly linked to the faculty. The opening of the Broadstone Luas station would also make it an ideal area for public transport, enabling easy access for students. One of the important selling points for the community was access to the sports and recreational facilities in the Grangegorman area for locals.</P>
      <P>Everything seemed fine. Unfortunately, that is how it has remained ever since. An interdepartmental committee was recently established by the Government to consider the matter, but this is a delaying mechanism. The cost of the land has escalated and everything is in the air in terms of what will happen. We have been assured all along that the Dublin Institute of Technology will get the land and that the campus will be constructed there. Some of the land may be put to other uses by the Department of Health and Children, but at this stage everybody's patience has been exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time is running out for the Government. I am concerned that a decision will not be made or that this area will be taken up by big business for major property development because it is the last open space in the city. It would be great if we <Col N="526" /> could have a decision on the matter which would confirm the situation once and for all. I look forward to hearing about the position and I hope the matter will be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee was established in May 2001 on this matter on foot of a Government decision. The terms of reference of this committee are to examine how the Grangegorman site can best be developed to achieve Government policy priorities in meeting education and social service needs and in tackling construction industry capacity constraints. This will be done in a way which takes into account the overall development of Dublin and leverages the strategic location and commercial potential of the site to attract private involvement on a PPP basis, having particular regard to the following: access by Dublin Institute of Technology at the earliest possible date to facilities needed for apprenticeship training, with site occupation as from the academic year 2001-02; provision on a staged basis over the longer term of modern campus facilities needed by Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of Government policy for third level education as a whole; provision in the short-term, as part of the package, of non-acute units needed by the ERHA, on part of the campus, but also on other sites in the region, taking account of the investment in kind by the authority; arrangements to afford the local community access to playing field facilities on the campus; integration of the proposed campus development with Luas and other relevant public transport provision and an approach to financing that includes leverage of the site's strategic location and commercial potential to lessen the burden on the Exchequer and avoid circular transfer of funds between Votes.</P>
      <P>Membership of the working group includes representatives of the ERHA, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Finance and the Taoiseach. I understand that the group should be able to complete its work and submit a report to the Government in the near future. The working group report will be made available publicly.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman site is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole. My Department is working with the other Departments and agencies represented on the working group to ensure that its strategic location and potential is unlocked to best meet the Government's objectives in the provision of high quality health and education services. I am confident this will be done while, at the same time, facilitating access by the local community to sporting facilities. I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
