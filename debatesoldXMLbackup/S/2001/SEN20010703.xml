      <P>I have received notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider the proposal from a group of parents in Dublin wishing to establish a Cabas unit for autistic children similar to the unit in Cork where children who are suffering from autism attend.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House on the Order of Business, on my own behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of all Members of the House, I extend to our colleague, Tom Hayes, sincere good wishes and congratulations on his election to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government side of the House, I wish to be associated with the Cathaoirleach's good wishes and congratulations to former Senator and new Deputy, Tom Hayes. I hope the experience he gained in the Seanad and the goodwill which he enjoys on all sides of the House will be a benefit to him in his work on behalf of his constituents in Tipperary South over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, referral of the motion regarding the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, to be <Col N="942" /> taken without debate; No. 2, motion re Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Article 3 of the fourth protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to be taken without debate; No. 5, Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001, [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 6, Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time; No. 7, Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Cathaoirleach and the Leader in their generous congratulations to our colleague, Tom Hayes, on his election to the Dáil. All Members will agree he was a splendid candidate who fought a great campaign. He well deserved his victory. He was a good Senator who held the agriculture brief for Fine Gael for the past four years and filled that position with great industry and distinction. As the Leader pointed out, he benefited greatly from his four years in this House and the electorate saw that also. He is now going to a different House; it is a bigger House but not necessarily a better or busier House. It is where he wants to be and I know his stay there will be of lengthy duration and that his contribution will be as distinguished as it was in this House.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the Leader said last week there would be one debate before we break next week on the situation following the Nice treaty referendum. Will the Leader be more specific about that? I notice item 4 is not being dealt with today. Will it be possible, when that item is taken, for the reasons given by the sole member for the increase in membership of the tribunal to be made available to Members of this House? After all, it was the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the Government, which appointed the tribunal. The additional back-up information which the Government is given should also be made available to Senators before we deal with No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to Senator Hayes. I will miss him. I enjoyed giving him my views on the live cattle trade during agriculture debates. I will now have to start torturing a different spokesperson on agriculture.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about two matters, one of which I brought up before. Can he ask the relevant Minister to inform people that the foot and mouth crisis is over and to ask them to remove the dry mats that are still at the doorways of so many premises? They have been removed from the entrances to Leinster House. This is a practical matter because my colleagues in accident and emergency departments have told me they are becoming a serious health hazard due to people tripping over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, can a debate be held on the crisis in nursing as soon as the House returns? I am sure <Col N="943" /> Senator Leonard will support my call. Many important hospital departments, particularly intensive care and oncology units, have only about 70% of the staff they require. Many other units and wards have only 50% staffing. This is intolerable and I am sure the Minister for Health and Children is aware of the problem. However, Members of this House should have the opportunity to bring forward suggestions for ameliorating this crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations to our colleague, Tom Hayes, on his magnificent victory in the Tipperary South by-election. I wish him a long and fruitful period of service in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the amendment I introduced last week to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, will be considered again by the Leader of the House with a view to ensuring that vacancies of this nature are filled by the party from which the vacancy arises, for whatever reason. That would solve the problem of holding another by-election and would restore some balance to the House in terms of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my proposal will not fall on deaf ears on the other side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Henry for a debate on nursing. I want that debate extended to a wider area, that of health. The Leader was to look at two major areas for debate before the recess, one was the aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum and the other was a general debate on the state of the nation, in which health would feature strongly. If there is time, I would like to see that area dealt with by the Leader. Concern was expressed that this debate should be held.</P>
      <P>The resignation of Northern Ireland's First Minister and the subsequent forced resignation of the Deputy First Minister are a cause of concern. A considerable crisis is developing with the marching season upon us and the problems of decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation remaining. I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that the Government expresses its concern and that of the Houses of the Oireachtas that everything that can be done should be done to stop the situation deteriorating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to request the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, to immediately restate Ireland's total opposition to nuclear power, arising from the recent British Government energy review in which the energy chief warned the British Prime Minister that existing facilities would have to be replaced and that <Col N="944" /> immediate approval is needed if energy adequacy is to be maintained. This would be a disaster for Ireland if it were to proceed. While Britain is at the start of its decision-making process, this is the correct time for the Minister to call on Europe and on the resources of Government to oppose the proposed measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Tom Hayes on his election to the Dáil and wish him every success. In light of his contributions in this House, I am sure he will make an excellent Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed there has not been a debate on autism, which was promised to the House since last September. I ask that it take priority in the next session.</P>
      <P>The need to have the NRA before the House is also a pressing matter. A burning issue around the country is the speed with which plans for roads and motorways are being put before people with a limited time of just one or two weeks for their submissions to be made. The country is in uproar due to lack of consultation. There has not been an opportunity to debate the democratic right of people to have the time to look at proposals that will affect their lives. The results of these decisions will be with us for 50 to 100 years while we cannot be sure that they are necessary. I hope that the NRA will come before the House at the beginning of the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has raised with the Leader the issue of the changes to the Order of Business concerning the motion regarding the terms of reference of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Planning Matters. Why was it removed from the paper today? Was it because the Government failed to follow proper procedures? Will the Leader in future ask the Department responsible to circulate the application made by the tribunals of inquiry to every Member of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Henry for a debate on nursing. However, we would be treading on dangerous ground if we mentioned the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; at this stage because, in many instances, the position in relation to nursing shortages has improved. It would, therefore, be extremely inadvisable to refer to a crisis in nursing, particularly if it led to a belief among members of the public that there has been a diminution in the quality of care provided. The debate requested by the Senator should be expanded to include an evaluation of the Commission on Nursing. This would allow us to discover how many of its recommendations have been implemented and also provide an opportunity to discuss the future of the nursing profession in terms of the education of its members and its development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader enlighten the House with regard to the rationale used by the Government in blocking the ESB's plans for <Col N="945" /> expansion into Poland, particularly as the company appears to have obtained approval from the appropriate Minister? Surely this move is damaging, not only to the ESB but also to the country's image abroad. Will the Leader outline the Government's thinking on this matter?</P>
      <P>The Attorney General proposed the concept of establishing a forum on the judicial system when he spoke in County Kerry last Saturday. He advanced some reasonable and fair arguments in favour of the establishment of such a forum. Will the Leader outline the Government's position in respect of this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of calls have been made for a debate on health. That debate should be expanded to include an examination of our relationship with the Third World and the standard of health care available in Third World countries. I have just returned from a trip to a particular Third World country where I discovered, on visits to a number of schools, that one in four of the children I met will die within five years and two in four will be dead within ten years. I also discovered that average life expectancy in the country concerned is 42 years of age and that none of the children to whom I refer will reach it. HIV-AIDS is devastating southern Africa and if we are intent on having a debate on health, we should expand it to include a discussion on how we might assist Third World countries in this regard. We must pressurise international providers of drugs into making available assistance to Third World countries. This will ensure the people in the countries concerned, who live in absolute poverty, can expect to live beyond the age of 42 years in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment on the health situation in Ireland. I merely wish to state that when one enters a school in a Third World country and looks at the beautiful young children there, it is shocking to realise that very few of them will live beyond 12 years of age. There are 12 year olds looking after eight year olds in the countries concerned and eight year olds caring for six year olds. When discussing health care we must expand the debate into a consideration of how we can assist Third World countries and stop the spread of HIV-AIDS, which are decimating the population of the countries to which I refer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the need for an urgent reappraisal of the position of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools? I have received increasing numbers of letters from parents and principals who are unable to obtain the services of special care assistants for children with special educational needs in primary schools. The Department of Education and Science is blocking the wishes of parents, children, teachers and school principals in this regard, which is utterly unacceptable. It is disgraceful that children with special educational needs cannot be educated in <Col N="946" /> mainstream primary schools, which is what they, their parents and the school authorities desire.</P>

      <P Just="Center">Will the Leader consider holding a debate on Northern Ireland before the summer recess? We have reached a sensitive juncture in the peace process and it is time for moderate and constructive voices to be heard. Complacency is the danger as we feel the Good Friday Agreement is safe. That may not be so and, as we were energetic in securing it, we must give leadership now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning and Coogan called for a debate on the Treaty of Nice, to which I have committed time. I am arranging it with the Minister's diary and will return to the matter on the Order of Business soon. </P>
      <P>No. 4 was relayed to the leaders last week but I will circulate the information again. Senators Henry and Leonard called for a debate on nursing, particularly the commission's progress, for which there will be time in the next session. It used to be that we said that if we had the money, we could have the staff. Money is available but there are still staffing difficulties. However, as Senator Leonard stated, there are improvements. This is a worthwhile call from Senators with first hand knowledge of the medical service. </P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Lanigan called for a debate on health. Senator Lanigan also seeks a debate on health care in the Third World for which there will be time in the next session.</P>
      <P>I assure Senator Costello that there will be a Seanad by-election in early October and everyone will have the opportunity to exercise his or her democratic right through the ballot box. I look forward to a new Senator on the Government side. </P>
      <P>I will pass on the comments of Senators Costello and Ó Murchú about Northern Ireland to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, Senator Fitzgerald's concerns about nuclear power. Also in response to Senator Fitzgerald, we will hold a debate on autism. While legislation takes priority over statements and debates, I will set time for the debate in question in the next session. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority and the approximately 25,000 acres of land required for new roads, linking our major cities and the west to improve the prospects of rural areas, were raised. Population is declining in many areas, such as my own, where it fell by 34% in 30 years. These roads will <Col N="947" /> give areas, such as counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo, an equal opportunity to attract industry. A fair price should be given to farmers surrendering land that might have been in the family for generations. We all welcome this progress and there will be time allocated in the next session for a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the matter of the ESB's expansion into Poland which the Minister favoured but the decision was made by the Department of Finance on the basis of a commercial judgment. We can debate the matter later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that the Agriculture Appeals Bill was introduced in this House on 8 February last and was passed by the Seanad on 1 March. The Bill was passed by the Dáil on Friday last, 29 June. Today we are discussing the amendments made by the Dáil. I would like to explain the amendments and the reasons for them.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill deals with interpretation. It was necessary to make some minor changes to section 1 because of changes that were made to other sections of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 1 and 5 are a direct consequence of amendment No. 6. Previously, section 2 was the only section that referred to the Civil Service. There is now a reference to the Civil Service in sections 2 and 3. Therefore, the definition has been moved from section 2 to section 1. Amendment No. 5 deletes the definition from section 2 and amendment No. 1 inserts the definition in section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw Senators' attention to amendment No. 6 on the list. Amendment No. 6 refers to section 3, which deals with the appointment of the director. The Bill as passed by this House last March stated that one of the appeals officers would be designated by the Minister to act as the director. The Bill as passed by the Dáil now reads that the director will be appointed by the Minister following a competition run either by the Top Level Appointments Committee in the Civil Service or the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. The effect of this amendment is that the post of director will be filled by competition and will be open to the whole Civil Service. This is a significant improvement, which will enhance the independence of the Agriculture Appeals Office. The competition will be run <Col N="950" /> either by the Top Level Appointments Committee or the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, depending on the level at which the post of director will be pitched. This matter is currently under discussion between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 cover the interpretation of &ldquo;statutory instrument&rdquo;. These amendments are necessary because a new section 14 has been inserted into the Bill. The text of the new section 14 is shown in amendment No. 9. It contains a reference to a statutory instrument. Therefore, we must define what we mean by a statutory instrument. The amended wording of section 1 now contains the standard interpretation of such an instrument.</P>
    <P>The new section 14 was inserted on foot of a commitment given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in the Dáil on 8 March during the debate on the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which introduced a new registration system for animal and poultry dealers. The Minister committed to providing for an appeals system for dealers in the Agriculture Appeals Bill. Under the registration system for dealers, the Minister is required to notify a person if he or she intends to refuse to authorise that person or his or her premises for dealing in animals or poultry. If a person is notified accordingly and makes representations to the Minister, the matter must be referred to the director of the Agriculture Appeals Office, who must consider the case and advise the Minister within 28 days. The Minister must have regard to the advice of the director on the case before making a final decision to revoke or suspend a registration. The system proposed in amendment No. 9 is similar to that proposed under the national beef assurance scheme. I draw the attention of Senators to section 13 of the Bill as passed by this House on 1 March. Similarities can be seen between the text of amendment No. 9 on today's list and the text of section 13 as passed on 1 March.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the appointment of appeals officers. During the previous debate in this House, section 2 was amended to allow appeals officers to be appointed not just from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but from across the Civil Service. The section has now been further enhanced in the Dáil to allow for competitions to be held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners for the purpose of recruiting appeals officers. This change is covered in amendment No. 4. I think the House will agree that this is a further improvement on the changes already made to this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill has been deleted by the Dáil. It provided that the Minister could, by order, confer additional functions on appeals officers, but it has been agreed the section was not needed. As a consequence of deleting section 7, it is necessary to amend section 16 and this has been provided for in amendments Nos. 10 to 13, <Col N="951" /> inclusive. The original section 16 contained references to the making of orders and regulations, but now that references to &ldquo;order&rdquo; have been removed from this Bill, there is no need to refer to &ldquo;order&rdquo; in section 16. Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, simply tidy up the text as a result of the deletion of section 7.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 refers to section 8, which deals with the right of appeal. The possibility of fixing a time limit within which all appeals must be concluded was discussed both in this House and in the Dáil. It was decided that, as well as giving the Minister the power to issue guidelines to appeals officers regarding the time limits for concluding appeals, the Minister should also have the power to make regulations laying down time limits if necessary. This would allow the Minister to take a flexible approach. There may be a need for very strict time limits for some schemes and less stringent limits for others.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 refers to section 9, which deals with oral hearings and adds two new subsections to the section. The new subsection (3) provides that an appellant has the right to be represented by another person at the oral hearing and subsection (4) states that where an appellant is represented by someone else at an oral hearing, the appeals officer will still have the right to put a direct question to the appellant rather than his or her adviser, if necessary. This is important if the appeals officer is to be allowed to make a full assessment of all the relevant facts and contentions in the case. In practice, it is unlikely that this provision will be needed on a regular basis. As in the case of social welfare and our own experience to date, oral hearings will be held in an informal and friendly environment, which will be helpful to the appellant.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 refers to the Schedule, which lists the schemes under the remit of the agriculture appeals office. In the earlier discussion on the Bill, both in this House and in the Dáil, the Minister indicated he had no difficulty in adding the bovine TB and brucellosis grants to the Schedule. However, he explained that there is already an appeals system in place to deal with disputes over the valuation of animals under the scheme. We are, therefore, adding the non-valuation aspects of the scheme. This will ensure farmers have access to an appeals system in respect of all aspects of the TB and brucellosis schemes.</P>
    <P>All the amendments to the Bill made by the Dáil will enhance the appeals system we are putting in place and I hope the House will have no difficulty accepting them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>From our privileged position as a country which has benefited from generally high standards of behaviour in public life, there can be a tendency to underestimate the value of those standards to society as a whole. However, when we look at the experience of less fortunate countries than our own, the impact of corruption and unethical behaviour becomes clear. Corruption and venality in public life weaken public confidence, drag down economies and undermine the one common idea that characterises and sustains a genuine democracy, that is, the idea that public power should be used for the public good.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate to have a public which demands high standards from its public servants and representatives, but we can maintain its confidence only by ensuring that those high standards prevail and are seen to prevail. That is the heart of the matter we are discussing today. I am, therefore, pleased to be here to introduce the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been much heralded. The genesis of the Standards in Public Office Bill lies in the programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, and the work of the McCracken tribunal. In his report, Judge McCracken recognised the combined value of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Acts and looked forward to these Acts being valuable mechanisms in guarding against the unacceptable elements of the financial transactions which the tribunal had <Col N="953" /> uncovered. Among the key recommendations of the McCracken tribunal were an independent third party to monitor and investigate possible contraventions of the ethics Act and that tax clearance systems, together with requirements for statutory declarations in relation to tax compliance, be put in place.</P>
    <P>In July 1998 the Government published outline proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill in what subsequently became known as the blue book. Between 1998 and 1999 a number of committees, including the Committee on Members' Interests of Seanad Éireann and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, considered the blue book. The suggestions of those committees were taken into account in the drafting of the Bill, which was published about this time last year. On publication, the Bill was remitted to committees again for a further look at what was being proposed. Members of the committees had a number of thoughts about the Bill which we have been able to take on board.</P>
    <P>In producing this Bill, we have started from the standpoint that it is essential that our citizens have confidence and trust in government and public administration. It is clearly important that we have an appropriate legal framework in place to ensure their trust is not abused. There is a particular duty for those of us in political life to set a high standard of conduct as misconduct and corruption at the political level create and appear to excuse an atmosphere and culture of cynicism which invites corruption at lower levels. The Standards in Public Office Bill now before us gives us an opportunity to further reinforce the integrity of our political system.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main features of the Bill. The Standards in Public Office Bill provides for the establishment of a new Standards in Public Office Commission with wide investigative powers in relation to so-called specified acts. Specified acts are acts or omissions of public servants or office holders which are inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the relevant position, or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance. The commission will take and investigate complaints in this regard only where it considers the matter complained of to be of significant public importance, and while it is a matter for the commission to make a judgment on what that means in any given case, the Bill provides that the commission may deem a matter to be of significant public importance if it relates to a benefit or potential benefit allegedly received by a person, where the value of the benefit exceeds £10,000. The commission, or indeed a committee, will not investigate complaints lodged anonymously. However, where the commission or committee, as the case may be, considers that the circumstances warrant it, they can restrict the disclosure of the complainant's identity where it is necessary or expedient for the commission or committee's investigation of the complaint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> It will also be a function of the commission to receive complaints in relation to contraventions of the Ethics Act or the Electoral Act, since the commission is to take on the current functions of the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as amended, provides that the commission will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the Supreme Court or High Court and will have four other <i>ex officio</i> members, that is, the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman. The commission must be seen as clearly independent of the political process. It is essential, however, that the commission should understand and appreciate the context in which the political process operates. For that reason, it has been considered appropriate to ensure that there will also be an appointed member of the commission who will be a former politician, who will be an ordinary member of the commission in addition to the four <i>ex officio</i> members I have just mentioned. This will not in any way undermine the independence of the commission, but will bring to the commission the special perspective and expertise which comes from service as a public representative.</P>
    <P>Persons in public life are in some ways easy targets for &ldquo;crank&rdquo; assertions of wrongdoing. The commission must be in a position to deal effectively with those complaints which are genuine and substantial. It must have, therefore, some sort of filter process to screen out the bad complaints and allow for proper investigation of the genuine ones.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Bill contains provision for the engagement of inquiry officers. This is something of an innovation in this field. The role of the inquiry officer will be to conduct preliminary investigations of complaints on behalf of the commission. Inquiry officers may be drawn from the commission's staff or from outside the commission. An inquiry officer would report to the commission and indicate whether, in his or her opinion, a case existed for further investigation by the commission. This will give the commission a mechanism allowing it to ascertain whether a particular complaint might be frivolous or vexatious, or might refer to a matter which is not of significant public importance. There may be some cases which are so obviously off-kilter that there is no need even to go this far, and these can be dismissed quickly. There will be other complaints, however, where this inquiry officer mechanism will be of great assistance to the commission.</P>
    <P>There will be some cases where a minor matter is complained of, which the commission does not believe justifies the full weight of a commission investigation but which is nonetheless worthy of some level of concern. In such cases, the complaint may be referred to a committee of the relevant House of the Oireachtas or to the Minister or public body concerned, as appropriate. This approach should meet any concerns that a standing commission might constitute an open invi<Col N="955" /> tation for endless investigations of very minor matters.</P>
    <P>The commission will enjoy tribunal-style powers, for example, in respect of such matters as summoning individuals and papers, administering oaths, ordering discovery and preservation of documents and requiring the giving of evidence. The Bill also provides that it shall be an offence to obstruct an investigation of the commission or an inquiry officer. Consistent with Supreme Court rulings in relation to tribunals, evidence given to the commission or an inquiry officer shall not be admissible as evidence against the person, the subject of investigation, in any criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is important at this stage to make one particularly important distinction. While the commission will be in a position to accept complaints in relation to office holders, primarily Ministers, and a wide range of public servants, similar complaints about ordinary Oireachtas Members will be made, via the clerk, to the relevant Oireachtas committee, as happens at present under the Ethics Act. However, if it so decides, a committee will be in a position to enlist the commission to investigate an issue and report back to the House concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the definition of &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; for the purposes of the wider investigative remit of the commission will be the same as that in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. A &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; for the purposes of the ethics Act includes a relative, business partner, company in which the person has a controlling interest, or a person with whom the person enjoys a trustee/beneficiary relationship. I am satisfied that this definition, which is comprehended by the terms of reference of current tribunals, taken with the proposed mandate and powers of the commission, constitutes a sound basis for commission investigations. This should ensure that the commission is not hampered in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as amended, also provides for the development by the Government, the committees or the Minister for Finance of codes of conduct which will apply to Ministers and other office holders, Members of the Oireachtas and employees of public bodies, respectively. These codes of conduct will deal with the standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the persons to whom they relate in the performance of their public duties. The codes will form part of the terms and conditions of public service employees and will provide guidance for them in the performance of their functions. Such codes shall be admissible in proceedings before a court, tribunal, Oireachtas committee or the commission which may take account of the terms of such codes in making determinations.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will be aware that the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests has considered and reported on proposals for a draft <Col N="956" /> code of conduct for the Members of that House on foot of a resolution passed on 7 March 2001, so work on this issue has already commenced in the Dáil. It will be a matter for the Seanad committee to produce a code of conduct for application in the Seanad, and no code of conduct, or any aspect of this Bill, can be imposed on the Seanad without its affirmative decision.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work has also been done regarding codes of conduct for the Civil Service. The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is currently looking at a draft code of conduct for the Civil Service and the Civil Service unions are being consulted. Department of Finance officials have also been looking at frameworks for governance in State bodies. As codes of conduct are being extended into the public service, appropriate consultations with staff representatives will take place and this is provided for in the Bill. Naturally, where an existing code meets the required standard, this will not need to be supplanted.</P>
    <P>In their reports on the Government's original blue book proposals, the committees did not support the creation of offences for breaches of the ethics legislation. While acknowledging the committees' views, the Government is concerned to ensure that the regime to be put in place should command public confidence. The Bill, accordingly, provides that where the commission finds evidence of wrongdoing on the part of a person who is the subject of an investigation, the organisation or public body to whom a person is answerable would receive the commission's report so it would be in a position to consider appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>In respect of a Deputy or Senator, this process would involve the laying of a report before the relevant House which would then decide on what penalty might be applied. The Bill provides that where the select committee is recommending suspension of a Member or office holder, it may also recommend the withholding from him or her of a particular amount of salary payable as a Member of the House. Before recommending such a course, the committee would have to be satisfied that the act or contravention was intentional and of a grave nature, that the withholding of salary was reasonable in all the circumstances, and that the amount to be withheld did not exceed the amount that the Member would earn in the period of suspension.</P>
    <P>In the case of a civil servant, receipt by his or her employing Department of an adverse commission report could trigger disciplinary procedures against the official. The commission and the relevant committees may also, in certain circumstances, make a report to the DPP.</P>
    <P>This Bill also requires that each Member of the Oireachtas must furnish a tax clearance certificate in respect of himself or herself or a partnership in which he or she is a member within a period of nine months either side of an election. In <Col N="957" /> addition, a statutory declaration that the Member's tax affairs are in order would have to be made one month either side of the election. Senior public officials will also be required to produce tax clearance certificates and make declarations.</P>
    <P>The commission will be empowered to investigate breaches of the tax clearance requirements by Members and senior public officials. While there is a temptation to think of the tax clearance certificate as the more obvious way in which tax compliance will be assured, it should be noted that the making of a false statutory declaration is an offence. This Bill increases the penalties for making a false declaration under the Statutory Declarations Act from a fine of £50 to £2,000 and a term of imprisonment from three to six months. It would be a rash person who would make a false declaration lightly and this adds considerable weight to the tax compliance provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for tax clearance for persons to be appointed to positions as judges, and they too will have to make similar statutory declarations. The regime for judges will vary somewhat from that for Members of the Oireachtas. In the case of judges, the tax clearance will be required before a judge is recommended for appointment. This different mechanism reflects differences in the role and constitutional position of the different groups.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism that the Bill does not go further in relation to the Judiciary. The whole area of standards and ethics for the Judiciary, however, is being considered separately from this Bill and I would not even start to claim that this tax clearance system is any more than a first step in that direction, which the Government is taking the opportunity of this Bill to put in place. To the extent that the Bill is deficient in relation to the Judiciary, therefore, it is deficient only in the same way that the first step on a ladder is deficient in not bringing us all the way to the top. That does not make the first step any less important, however.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the existing ethics legislation which has concerned Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas has been in relation to the interaction of the declarations under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and those under the Electoral Act, 1997. At present Members of this House will receive different sets of forms from different sources and on different dates, which will have to be returned by different deadlines. The Bill, therefore, makes provision for considerable streamlining of the current requirements for declarations of interests and donations under the two Acts respectively. In particular, the dates for making statements under the two Acts will be brought into line and the current overlap in reporting requirements which require certain amounts to be declared both as political donations under the Act of 1997 and as gifts <Col N="958" /> under the Act of 1995 will be removed. Moreover, the forms will issue at the same time from a single source and be returned in the same way. This is intended to make compliance with the legislation simpler and less confusing. I hope this will contribute to a reduction in the sales of aspirin to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That summarises the principal intent and purpose of the Bill before us. I am sure that Members of this House will welcome it in the same way as have Members of Dáil Éireann, that is, openly and positively but tinged with a certain regret that circumstances are such that the Bill is necessary. None of us is particularly happy about legislation of this type. We would all wish to live in a world where the personal, moral and ethical standards of public representatives and public servants were beyond question, and known to be so.</P>
    <P>As Members of the Oireachtas we impose on ourselves, and to an extent on other public servants, greater transparency and disclosure of personal and financial interests than applies in just about any other walk of life. This reflects our understanding that in the work we do, we act as trustees on behalf of the population of the State. We impose stringent standards on ourselves because we understand that, in the long run, we must be seen to operate to the highest standards if we are to maintain the public trust. Our overall goal is to ensure that we continue to have a public service and a political system worthy of the esteem of our citizens.</P>
    <P>If Senators will bear with me, I would like to take a little time to put the Bill into its legislative context. There have been major legislative measures in recent years in the general area of governance and accountability, and this Bill slots into that overall framework. The major legislation already on the Statute Book includes the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which is the central accountability framework for governance changes in the Civil Service, setting out the formal structure for assigning authority and accountability within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This change in formal accountability structures is supported by the more informal mechanisms of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, which allows individual citizens to look at Government records in relation to those citizens, or in relation to the more general operations and policies of the public administration. This is subject, of course, to certain exemptions ensuring privacy rights are upheld and encompassing an independent appeals system in the form of the Information Commission.</P>
    <P>Accountability to the Oireachtas has also been supported by way of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, which gives Oireachtas committees increased powers of investigation in areas of public concern. Among these powers are the ability to compel <Col N="959" /> witnesses to attend hearings and to respond to questions.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Acts of 1997 and 1998 seek to achieve fairness in the electoral process by limiting expenditure at elections and providing a system of recoupment, in certain circumstances, of candidates' election expenses. They also provide for a scheme of disclosure of political donations over specified limits. The Electoral Acts serve to reassure the public that there is openness and accountability in the relationship between the political system and those who support it financially or otherwise. The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, provides similar measures for the local authority area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important legislation to bear in mind when considering the Standards in Public Office Bill is the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. The Act provides mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest in the cases of Members of the Houses, Ministers and officials in the wider public service. It was this Act which established the independent Public Offices Commission and provided for a Select Committee on Members' Interests, covering both Houses of the Oireachtas, to oversee its key provisions. It requires Members of the Oireachtas, senior civil servants, public board members and senior executives of State bodies to disclose their personal interests to provide transparency and accountability in decision making. It is on the 1995 Act in particular that much of the Standards in Public Office Bill builds. Rather than start from scratch, the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, is principally concerned with extending and amending the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and many of the mechanisms of the Ethics Act, in relation to complaints and so forth, will continue to apply with appropriate adaptations after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill is one of a range of legislative initiatives currently being taken by the Government in the broad area of standards and conduct in public life. Senators will be aware of the amount of work being done in both Houses and in Departments on this range of initiatives. A glance at the schedule for last week shows three separate Bills, before one or other House, dealing with the general area of standards and ethics. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which represents a considerable strengthening of our anti-corruption laws and awaits the President's signature, is one of the most important legislative elements supporting standards in public life. It provides for a significant widening of the scope of the Prevention of Corruption Acts by bringing within their scope office holders such as Deputies, Senators, MEPs, members and officials of the EU, judges of national, foreign and international courts and <Col N="960" /> certain other foreign public officials where the corrupt act occurs wholly or partly in the State.</P>
    <P>Another important provision of the Bill deals with any office holder or official who acts corruptly, on his or her own initiative, to secure some benefit personally or for another person. Here, there is no offer or receipt of a benefit from a third party but the person's actions are designed to benefit, say, a member of one's own family. This type of corruption in office is being tackled for the first time in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000. In accordance with the Taoiseach's substantial statement in December last, the Bill provides that there will be a presumption that a public official has acted corruptly in certain circumstances where the person has received moneys or benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, has been examining the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999, a Private Members' Bill introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Rabbitte. The Bill was accepted by the Government in principle on Second Stage and the Minister of State will, subject to Government approval, bring forward amendments to the 1999 Bill on Committee Stage. This will help to encourage persons who are aware of wrongdoing, in public or private business, to come forward. The Bill we are considering today, the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, contains provisions for the protection of persons who make bona fide complaints to the Standards in Public Office Commission or the appropriate Oireachtas committees. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, will also be bringing forward proposals for a registration system for lobbyists who lobby officials and politicians at national and local level and he will consult Members of the Houses on his proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Among the main aims of the Local Government Bill, 2000, published by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is the introduction of a comprehensive ethics framework for local authority members and officials. The provisions of this Bill mirror, in many respects, the transparency and accountability arrangements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. In addition to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have published Bills relating to registration of lobbyists, prevention of corruption and tax clearance for candidates for election. I acknowledge, as I have before, the work of the Opposition in these areas, which has served to develop and progress the debate on these matters.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate, in summary form, the main features of this new Standards in Public Office Bill. It will lead to the introduction of powerful investigative mechanisms for serious complaints about persons serving the public with whistleblower protections for persons making such complaints. There will be tax compliance require<Col N="961" /> ments for Members of the Oireachtas, judges and senior public servants and codes of conduct for public servants, office holders and Oireachtas Members. Under the Ethics and Electoral Acts there will be clearer, more streamlined, reporting rules. In addition to these, there are various technical amendments of the existing Ethics in Public Offices Act and Members will have seen, from the explanatory memorandum, that much of the Bill consists of such amendments. In framing this Bill, the Government sought to listen to the views of Members from all parties and was mindful of the need to achieve a balance between the right to privacy and the exigencies of the common good. The Bill acknowledges the independence of each House in the regulation of its own affairs and it can only be applied to the Houses of the Oireachtas by resolution in each House.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the content of the Bill, and of the other legislative proposals I have mentioned, that the Government takes the maintenance of standards in public life very seriously. It is also clear that the issue is one which is complex and requires the achievement of a difficult balance between the rights and sensitivities of individuals working in the service of the public and the public interest in transparency and the maintenance of the highest standards. This Bill strikes that balance and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>I respectfully request that, in accordance with Seanad Standing Order No. 121, the following corrections be made by the Clerk, under the Cathaoirleach's direction, to section 24 of the Bill:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for introducing the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000. Bills which come before the Houses of the Oireachtas usually relate to the functions of different Departments and when passed effect better governance. The Bill before the House this morning is different. It is one of a number of recent measures which endeavour to clean up politics. As my political career draws to an end, after having served 19 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas, I am saddened such measures are necessary, but I realise they are. When I was elected in 1982, politicians were held in high regard. Now, just because of the failings of a few, politics and politicians are held in contempt by a significant proportion of the population. Many feel politicians are irrelevant in their lives, and of course that might be true. In the late 1970s and the 1980s many social <Col N="962" /> issues had to be addressed like high unemployment, poor housing, high taxation and poor social services. These have all been improved and the public do not need the politician to the same extent as in the past. Prosperity makes the public very independent of politicians, to whom little credit is given for making the right decisions many years ago, which have led to that prosperity.</P>
      <P>Politics is not simply about delivering the goods in a material sense, it is also about providing redress for anger and injustice. Ironically, although politicians are often blamed for what goes wrong it is to politics people turn to have things put right. The vast majority of Deputies and Senators elected carry out their duties in an honest and hard-working fashion. They do a difficult job although the public and the media give them little credit for it. It is a time-consuming occupation and often family life suffers. Shortly after I was elected to the Dáil, that was brought home to me when my son, then 12 years of age, said he was delighted I was elected but the sad thing was &ldquo;now we never see you&rdquo;. I never allowed myself to forget that remark.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that for democracy to function well it must have the support and trust of the public. Confidence in all arms of Government is essential, including confidence in politicians, civil servants and members of State bodies. This Bill relates to all in those categories, not only to politicians, and as a result it gives us an opportunity to reinforce the integrity of our political system. The public have the right to demand greater accountability and transparency in how elected representatives conduct their business. As a Member of this House, I want to see such transparency and accountability. Like the majority of Members, I wish to conduct my business in an open fashion and in compliance with all existing legislative measures or regulations.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the result of recommendations made by Mr. Justice McCracken. He was of the view that it was necessary to set up an independent body to investigate possible contraventions of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the tax clearance systems, together with requirements for statutory declarations in relation to tax compliance. The Government put its proposals before the committees on finance and the public service and on Members' interests. While I am now a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I was not a member at that time, which leaves me at a slight disadvantage. However, I am pleased the Government listened to the views of members of all parties and endeavoured to produce balanced legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the composition and terms of reference of the tribunal which will be established under this Bill. The Bill requires Members of both Houses to furnish tax clearance certificates in respect of themselves or a partnership of which they are members, within nine <Col N="963" /> months of being elected. In addition, a statutory declaration must be made that a Member's tax affairs are in order within one month of the Member being elected.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of recent tribunals is the amount of money that appears to be changing hands without a penny in tax being paid. This must be a matter of grave concern to compliant taxpayers, particularly when politicians are involved in such conduct. They must feel extremely angry and have every right to feel that way. I welcome the provision that these tax clearances must be furnished.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about one aspect of the Bill and Members of the other House have expressed the same concern. It relates to complaints that might be made about Members. The Bill provides that the commission may engage an inquiry officer to conduct a preliminary investigation of a complaint. The commission will be able to accept complaints about office holders and a wide range of public servants. When a complaint is made against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas it will be passed to the relevant Oireachtas committee to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Once a complaint is made, however, even though it might be frivolous or vexatious, it will damage the good name of the person concerned. It is almost impossible to rectify that situation. I was once told a story about a person who took the good name of his neighbour in a frivolous manner. He decided to repent and tried to make good the damage he had done. He was told he would have to climb to the rooftop and float a bag of feathers into the wind. Only when he collected the last feather would he be able to make good the damage he had caused. I tell this story to illustrate that if a complaint is made against a Member of the Houses and that complaint is found to be without substance, that Member's good name will still be damaged. The only asset a Member of the Oireachtas has is his or her good name. I will refer again to this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the other measures that have been put in place. I hope they will help to improve the standing not just of politicians but of the political system and will effect a restoration of confidence, particularly among young people, in that system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on bringing forward this important legislation. I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Doyle. I, too, am saddened that this type of legislation is necessary. I have been in the public service for practically all my adult life, first as a public servant, then as a local representative and now as a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have over 22 years service at both local and national level. Practically all the colleagues I met over those years had the highest standards and <Col N="964" /> contributed enormously and sometimes at their own expense to the common good. Unfortunately, however, there are always a few who undermine the system and violate the standards which the public expect of its public servants, politicians and those who serve the common good. This legislation and the other supporting legislation in this area is necessary for that reason.</P>
    <P>It is a cause of great anger and concern to people in public life to discover a colleague has undermined the system to the extent of involving themselves in an area of activity which detracts from the, until now, unwritten code of conduct for public representatives. It was understood that a person went into public life to serve the common good. The personal betterment of that individual was not part of that vocation. Unfortunately, as we read and hear about daily from the tribunals of investigation, a number of people decided to use their positions as elected representatives or in other areas of public service for personal gain. As a result, this legislation is necessary. A number of important provisions in the Bill will preclude people who have such intentions from taking such actions in the future.</P>
    <P>Codes of conduct for public servants, office holders and Members of the Oireachtas are necessary and are the foundation of this legislation. The Bill also outlines tax compliance requirements for Members of the Oireachtas, judges and senior public servants. There has been a change in the public mindset with regard to tax compliance. In the past, it was generally accepted that people should evade tax if possible. It was something people aspired to and professionals who looked after people's accounts did everything in their power to effect that. However, in recent years, probably due to changes in the Finance Acts, there is a greater degree of compliance and a greater interest in being compliant with tax legislation. The provisions in the Bill dealing with tax compliance will find favour across the board because it is something people are willing to do.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for clearer and more streamlined reporting rules under the ethics in public office and electoral legislation. For those of us from humble beginnings, the large finance available to some to fight elections has always been a sore point. There was envy from those of us who did not have the same level of finance. To some extent, a playing pitch which was not level was created.</P>
    <P>It is important that all candidates contest an election on equal terms. There should not be a situation where those with huge finances can advance their case more than those with lesser finances available. If this is the case, more will come forward to take part in public life. There is now a limit on what a candidate can spend in both local and general elections. That is good and will encourage those who would not have thought it possible to run for election to do so. Those who <Col N="965" /> thought they could not finance a campaign will now be able to see how much they need to do so.</P>
    <P>I understand the position in relation to investigations and whistleblowers. However, I am concerned that some may act for the wrong reasons and destroy somebody's good name. A report or complaint in the lead-up to an election could be a strategic blow to a candidate who could be undermined. Apologising after the election, if the candidate's name was damaged in an unwarranted fashion, is useless. The electors may have decided that the candidate is not the person to represent them. Saying &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; then is too late. I encourage the Minister of State to outline the safeguards in place to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on this matter at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and on other occasions. During an investigation by the committee, and in several other countries, it was one of the issues that raised its head. I would like to see safeguards to protect a person's good name where there is an ill intention by an individual or a group to undermine a candidate contesting an election.</P>
    <P>Politicians and political life have taken a bashing in recent times. Those in public life have been responsible for this, to an extent. It is inappropriate that criticism and derogatory remarks have been levelled at an Opposition, whether this was in the public good. This has damaged politics. The media pick up on such statements and follow through. It is no good blaming the media for what politicians have said about one another. The media report what is said. Politicians have undermined one another for political gain and advantage.</P>
    <P>However, that advantage is short-term. In the longer term they are undermining the vocation they have chosen. Politicians who operate on that basis should consider their role. Did they enter politics to damage their profession? If so, they have picked the wrong one. Those who blame the media for the low esteem in which politicians are held should look into their hearts and consider some of the statements made by colleagues during the years. If one throws enough mud, some will stick. Many politicians have paid the price for this. The public is receptive and now has greater access to information on political life. If individual politicians persist in behaving as they have done, their standing with the public will continue to decrease.</P>
    <P>Politicians, more so than those in the public service, must abandon their private life and that of their family when they enter politics. This is a major cross for a family to bear. It is not for the faint-hearted to be involved in public life in these times. Such families have enough pressures on them as it is, particularly if there are children involved. This legislation is good in that it sets out parameters within which politicians must operate, <Col N="966" /> whether in the Houses of the Oireachtas, local government or the public service.</P>
    <P>During my time in public life, whether as a member of Roscommon County Council, the Consultative Council of the European Commission, chairman of the general council or the Oireachtas, I have found that there is a great satisfaction to be had from dealing with matters for the common good. If people are to stay in the business of politics, there must be guidelines by which to work in order that the damage inflicted on the political system in the past ten years cannot happen again. If that infliction of damage is allowed to continue, few will choose to enter political life. We need people from all walks of life &ndash; the professions, the farming community, the self-employed, men and women, young and old &ndash; to consider entering public life if the national view is to be reflected.</P>
    <P>This legislation, and the supporting legislation that has already been passed, is necessary but it should not be perceived by the majority of those involved in public life as a slap on the wrist. As far as I am concerned, a few individuals blackened the reputation of politics in this country. This legislation will prevent them from doing so in the future, but it will also allow those with a genuine interest in politics to become involved in the political system safe in the knowledge that if they adhere to the guidelines and regulations, no one will accuse them of wrongdoing. The cynical view of politics that has developed in recent years will evaporate and eventually disappear when this legislation takes full effect and people will then be willing to devote themselves to the political system.</P>
    <P>An important group of people who are not making themselves available to serve in public life are those who volunteer to serve on State boards. The investigations of activities which took place in the past have encouraged them to move away from the political system. If we are to request that these individuals, who have great experience in many fields, serve on State boards in the future, we must ensure structures and safeguards will be put in place to ensure their reputations will not be undermined while they are <i>in situ</i> or that their standing will not be damaged when they return to their former positions after their period of service. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation which seeks to bring together some of existing provisions contained in the ethics in public office legislation and the Electoral Acts. The Bill also seeks to establish a standards in public office commission, with wide-ranging powers, to deal with complaints in relation to people, not least among whom are Members of this House and the Lower House, involved in the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> I am sure other Senators have provided a litany of the reasons for this legislation and the Minister of State supplied a long list in his contribution. We have reached a critical juncture in public life and it is important now for us to be seen to be taking statutory steps to ensure we put our house in order. An enormous amount of allegations have been made about those involved in the public arena and acts of corruption have been proven to have occurred in many instances. A considerable cloud hangs over a former Taoiseach, a number of Ministers and Members of the Lower House and a large number of local authority members. In such circumstances, it is natural to expect members of the public to believe that all politicians are on the take, corrupt and subject to bribery.</P>
    <P>The profession of politics has been badly tarnished during the past decade. Membership of that profession was formerly regarded as extremely desirable and many citizens would have welcomed the opportunity to hold high public office, whether it be as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a member of the Judiciary or an office holder in the public arena. The majority would have been delighted to serve in these relatively privileged positions, but now they are asking who would want to enter public life, why they would wish to do so and are their reasons for so doing suspect. People now cast a very jaundiced, sceptical and cynical eye on the manner in which we conducted our business in the past. We must show them that we have put our house in order and that the opportunity for corruption is so limited that they can again have confidence in the political system. That is the route we must take and the legislation will allow us to take a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Standards in public office are extremely important. It is vital that we move away from the necessity of having to establish tribunals of inquiry, a number of which &ndash; McCracken, Flood and Moriarty &ndash; are currently sitting and have uncovered an enormous amount of wrongdoing in the public arena. There are tribunals investigating a number of other areas also and we must not forget that ours is not the only profession that is, to some degree, under a cloud.</P>
    <P>It is important that we establish a body, a commission in this instance, which will have powers similar to those of the current tribunals and which can deal with complaints as they arise. We should no longer be obliged to establish tribunals and confer on them certain powers while not knowing how long they will remain in operation, the amount of public money that will need to be expended on them or the extent of the terms of reference they will require. I accept that the operations of the current tribunals are proper and above board, but we must move away from the <i>ad hoc</i> system which gave rise to the tribunals and <Col N="968" /> replace it with a permanent statutory model that can deal with complaints as a matter of course. We must know the precise nature of the body we are putting in place and be aware of how it will operate.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the commission will have the powers of a tribunal and that it will be able to summon witnesses, discover documents and carry out the other necessary actions which will allow it to carry out thorough investigations. However, the position is still not as clear-cut as it might be. It is extremely important that we distance all Members of the House from any possible taint of being connected with big business or that we do not allow any suspicion to arise that they have received gifts or financial recompense. We missed an opportunity of not clearly stating in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, recently passed by the House, that there cannot be corporate donations and that the business sector has no role to play in political life in this country. Once we allow the making of corporate donations, we give people the opportunity to allege that we remain in hock to big business.</P>
    <P>Most of the difficulties that gave rise to the need to establish the tribunals came about because big business sought to influence politicians, either in terms of their reaction to planning or rezoning matters or Government decisions or in terms of how they conducted their public or private lifestyles or the overly close connection with business. While we allow business to make substantial gifts and donations to politicians, we cannot claim to have solved the problem perceived by the public. It has not been addressed. We had the opportunity recently but the Government did not take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>We must end the connection between money and elections. It was a desirable first step that in 1996 we capped the amount that could be spent on them, but it is unsatisfactory that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government seeks to raise it by 50% for the next election. Why is it not raised by the level of inflation or the consumer price index? Why is it by a substantial sum representing a 50% increase? The level of inflation is appropriate. If we allow a lump sum increase or such a percentage increase, we undermine the principle of putting a cap on a politician's electoral spending. If it varies from election to election or from Government to Government, we will be undermined by the taint of corruption.</P>
    <P>Some of the Bill's aspects are welcome, such as the immunity provisions, the so-called whistleblowers' charter. Anyone who makes a complaint should have a degree of immunity, otherwise it will be difficult for a person to do so, as past experience showed. Senator Finneran is also worried that there are sufficient caveats and precautions to prevent frivolous and vexatious complaints. The idea of separate inquiry officers, <Col N="969" /> appointed by the commission, examining complaints before they get a full-scale hearing is a valuable innovation. It will mean that a person's character will not be damaged or that a complaint arising at a critical time, such as during an election, does not cause embarrassment or irrevocable damage to someone's career. I am concerned about the role of the Clerks of the Houses. By the nature of their posts, they are involved with the Members daily and so are put in an invidious position by being <i>ex officio </i>members of the commission. Is it appropriate that they are involved? Will the Minister comment on this?</P>
    <P>The adage attributed to Plato, that only those who have reached the height of wisdom and integrity should aspire to political power, is one that should hold good. People who can show, and are prepared to do so, that in their dealings they are deserving of privilege and position and of making laws are those who should do so. Consequently, I welcome the proposal that Members of the Oireachtas should supply tax clearance certificates prior to entry. It is procedure in many areas and we should show that it is how we conduct our business and want to be seen to conduct it. It is in our interest, as a first step, to draw up a code of conduct legislating best practice for our profession. If that functions properly, there should be no recourse to the commission for disciplinary action. I welcome the functioning of the commission and look forward to its establishment. It was a long while in gestation but it is worthwhile legislation and will create a perception that those who provide a public service are answerable publicly in a creditable way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This was a useful debate on the legislation establishing the commission for office holders, Members and civil servants. The core of the debate is the right of people to make complaints, but there must be guidelines to prevent complaints which are frivolous, which we all experience, and vexatious. There are to be higher standards for public representatives than for civil servants, but unlike civil servants public representatives must periodically stand for re-election. A public representative gets a bigger headline than an official. The standard should not be any different.</P>
      <P>This is topical in the light of recent days where we saw at the weekend that a complaint or proceedings had been instituted. I am not going to speak on the Taoiseach's behalf as I am sure he is well able to paddle his own canoe. Where one sees that legislation exists, or proceedings have been instituted and then collapse, the standard of coverage should not be different. I can recall the headline last July or August and it was even bigger print than the print at the weekend. The standard should apply not just in a case of proceedings being withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> If a Member or a public servant is to face the full rigours of the law then the same standard should apply to someone who brings a potentially damning case against a Member, a public representative or a civil servant. That needs to be looked at. Senator Doyle related a parable concerning a bag of feathers. I have skirmished in that area over the last 12 months. A certain line of inquiry was conducted by a group of people who acted as so-called judge and jury. The same people subsequently, when it came to other actions or omissions where a certain cheque was involved in a game of hide and seek or was sent on a tour like a homing pigeon, were not quite as forthcoming with truthful answers.</P>
    <P>It is important, and the Minister would be the first to recognise it, that if one starts casting stones one should examine one's own cupboard first. That is nothing to do with the Minister. I am sure Senators Finneran and Costello would agree with my comments that when one goes down that road one should be very careful. If there is a case to be answered let it be answered but let due process take its course. Let us not go head-hunting particularly on the basis of impartial and incomplete facts etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation but there are some aspects I have to question. One relates to the commission and its members. I refer in particular to the Clerks of the Dáil and the Seanad. Would they want to be on such a committee? Is it fair on them considering that in their general dealings they deal at very close quarters with Members of both Houses? It is not an ideal situation because if there is a hearing or case there may be a certain acrimony or knock-on effect. Perhaps there should be some distinguished former Members. I hope the commission will have very little work to do and I am sure I speak for all Members on that.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation. It is important in all our actions that we work above reproach and above any question of misdealings etc. That is important in relation to all this ethics legislation and the Electoral Acts. I was very interested to hear what Senator Costello had to say and I agree that there is room for all of us in these Houses to review the way we operate at election times. I hope the commission looking into the question of funding will look equally at a Member with 20 extra posters or an extra couple of rounds of sandwiches and at organisations whose methods of funding etc. should be questioned.</P>
    <P>The other aspect I would like to be considered is Members' interests. Each year we make declarations in relation to our interests. It is unfair on some Members. As one who apart from professing a share in a horse and an interest in&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not go down that road. If the declaration is concerned with one's role as a Member then it is grand, but not otherwise. If <Col N="971" /> someone invests a few thousand in shares, and at times rumours go round these Houses that there is a tip involved, probably worse than some of the horse tips, then it should not be necessary. If it is to do with a decision that could affect the performance either of that share or the company, then so be it. If someone invests it should not necessarily be open to ridicule.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take on board my few words. We certainly support this legislation on this side of the House. We hope by and large it will not be necessary but we recognise that in the light of experience there has got to be a watchdog. I look forward to his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on the Standards in Public Office Bill. A 19th century American president said that public virtue is the vital spirit of republics. I think he was correct. Without public virtue and without an understanding that women and men in public life are committed to service rather than venality, and to the public welfare rather than the profit of themselves and those close to them, the confidence of the public in our democratic institutions is in decay. The old phrase, upright citizen, comes to mind in this context. The public should be entitled to believe that they are governed by upright citizens whose actions are guided, whatever their ideological differences, by a common commitment to serving the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not by itself achieve public virtue. It will not by itself make upright citizens of that minority of public servants who do not adhere to high standards. It is a substantial move in the right direction. By introducing codes of conduct for public servants and Members of the Oireachtas it will make clear the standards to which public servants and public representatives should adhere. By introducing a tax clearance regime for Members of the Oireachtas and senior public servants it will underpin public confidence in the persons they elect to make their laws and who are appointed to the highest posts in the public service. By providing for an expanded complaints investigative mechanism it will provide a disincentive for public servants and representatives to engage in inappropriate behaviours. Together with a range of other standards and ethics related legislation being progressed, which I described earlier, it will provide the State with a very substantial corpus of legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Doyle, Finneran and Cosgrave referred to the potential damage a malicious complaint could do to a Member's good name. The Bill makes considerable provision to protect against frivolous or vexatious complaints. For example, the matter complained of will have to be of significant public importance to be investigated by the commission. An inquiry officer will <Col N="972" /> conduct a preliminary inquiry to see if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case or if the complaint is frivolous or vexatious. The commission can drop an investigation at any time or decide not to investigate if it believes the complaint cannot be sustained. A person making an unsubstantiated case could leave themselves open to an award of substantial costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that neither the commission nor the committees will investigate anonymous complaints. It should also be noted in this context that the immunity for complaints in the Bill applies only to complaints made reasonably and in good faith. Immunity will be denied to someone who makes a complaint knowing it to be false, misleading, frivolous or vexatious or who furnishes misleading information to an inquiry officer, the commission or a clerk of a committee. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides that a person may not disclose information obtained by him or her, under the Act or by being present at a private sitting of the commission, subject to appropriate exceptions. Such protection will be extended to this Bill also.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised the question of the funding of politics, particularly the issue of corporate donations, but I hope he will appreciate that this Bill was never intended to address the matter. It is important but more appropriate to discussion under the Electoral Acts. A number of Senators raised questions regarding the new role of the Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, but those officials are given roles under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, also. The officials are familiar with the Civil Service and the political process. Despite extensive deliberations, committees have not suggested that anybody else is better placed to do the job. The Clerks are honourable people and perform their functions under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, in a positive way. It is obviously a good idea to extend their roles to include those of this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the innovative steps in the Bill is to include in the commission a former politician of good standing, who can bring his or her knowledge of the political process to the deliberations of the commission on which there will be a proper balance, by and large. As Members of both Houses have said, we hope the Bill will not be used very often. It is a strong and positive confidence-building measure and complements the range of ethics and standards legislation that has been put in place. The majority of those involved in both Houses and public life generally have nothing to fear from the legislation. The Bill is important as it will inspire confidence in the public domain and I commend it to the House. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>Section 1(3) states the &ldquo;Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may, by order or orders, appoint either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision.&rdquo; That is a wide interpretation of the Bill in terms of the powers delegated to the Minister for Education and Science and requires clarification. We are talking about vocational education committees and, therefore, local authorities, which means we must consider local authority elections. As members of vocational education committees were appointed for a five year period after the last local authority elections, I wonder when the main sections of the Bill will be implemented. Will we have to wait until after new local authority elections, when a new set of VEC members have been appointed? The structures in the Bill differ from existing structures and VEC membership will change. Without getting into a long debate on this matter, how is the timescale for the implementation of the legislation envisaged by the Minister? It is different from almost any other type of legislation we have had before <Col N="974" /> the House as it deals with the structures of other bodies. A Minister could not simply wake up one morning any say, &ldquo;Everything is in place, so I will sign the order and get this moving.&rdquo; Will the Minister give us some idea of when he envisages the different aspects of the legislation will be implemented?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 7 but in part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>7.&ndash;Where a member of a committee holds office immediately prior to the commencement of this Part in a capacity corresponding to a capacity provided for by a provision of this Part, he or she shall upon such commencement be deemed to have been elected to the said office pursuant to such provision until the date on which, but for this Act, his or her term of office would have expired.</P>
      <P>Is the enactment of the legislation where it relates to vocational education committees consequent on the next local elections? Will the members of the committees, school boards and the companies and sub-committees envisaged under the legislation be appointed after those elections? Certain provisions in the legislation are consequent on the next local authority elections while other provisions are not, such as the establishment of companies, the five year education plans and the service plan. The membership of vocational education committees has a major bearing on local elections. However, the intent of my amendment is to ensure people who have been appointed to vocational education committees and so on are not disadvantaged as various sections of the legislation are enacted over time. I seek a wider explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <P>My thinking on this issue is similar to Senator Costello's. Many members of vocational education committees and boards of management expressed concern that the legislation could impact on their positions and they were unsure where they would stand if the legislation was implemented immediately. However, the Minister has reiterated that there will be continuity. Councillors and members of the public who represent the community on boards of management would like to feel their positions will not be threatened in any way.</P>

      <P>The amendment provides for the continuation in office of serving VEC members until such time as their term of office would have ordinarily expired, which would allow current members to hold office. The amendment is designed to facilitate a smooth transition between existing vocational education committees and those due to take up office under the newly constituted vocational education committees provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, I have already made provision for such a transition. Section 8 provides for the continuation in office of serving VEC members until such time as the Minister commences section 7 and new committees are established and constituted in accordance with its terms. This provision will achieve the same result as the Senator's amendment.</P>
      <P>The Department will enter discussions with the vocational education committees regarding the companies, special sub-committees and service plans, and both groups will work together on when they want to establish them. The power will be available to the vocational education committees to bring them in as they wish.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>I have noted the concerns expressed regarding representation on the VEC for groups of staff which are not represented by staff representatives elected to the committee. This matter was discussed in detail in the other House. Typically, administrative staff comprise 10% of the total VEC staff. Senators will appreciate I have provided a relatively complex formula for appropriate and balanced representation of all the partners on each VEC and I am reluctant to disturb such a formula.</P>
      <P>However, I appreciate the point made by the Senator. Accordingly, when the matter was raised in the other House I made an amendment to the section, which requires that where a group of staff is not represented on the VEC following the staff elections, local authorities must, in appointing the four wider representatives to the committee, consider the appointment of a representative of such staff. There is no guarantee that such a person will be appointed. The overall composition of the VEC derives from a careful formula, which I am reluctant to reopen. However, the section now places a statutory duty on the local authority to consider the claims of these staff should they not be directly elected to the VEC. It provides a reasonable means to ensure all staff will have representation on vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>Clarification is needed regarding whether administrative staff, as well as teaching staff, will be represented. The words &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; and &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; are not used in the legislation. Section 7C states, &ldquo;Two members elected by members of the staff of the Committee&rdquo;, while section 7E(3) states, &ldquo;Members of the staff of the VEC other than members of staff belonging to the same class of members&rdquo;. It is an option but not a requirement. Two members of staff could be elected but they could be from the same stream. The legislation does not provide that the two major categories of staff should be represented on the committee. Clarification is <Col N="977" /> required because it would be worthwhile to know if both administrative and teaching staff will be represented.</P>

      <P>There are two members. The staff as a body will decide on the two members. This comes from the proposals from the steering group and lengthy discussions with the social partners. This is the package that was agreed. I am reluctant to start unravelling the package because that could lead to many other possibilities. I made a provision that the administrative staff must be taken into account and considered. That gives it a status above not being mentioned. It is a matter for each VEC to decide.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the decisions will be made by the staff in total, but this paragraph suggests there will be another category. The presumption is that the first two will be from the same category. Paragraph (<i>e</i>)(iii) states that &ldquo;members of the staff of the vocational education committee (other than members of staff belonging to the same class of members of staff as either of the members elected under paragraph (<i>d</i>))&rdquo;. What categories is the Minister talking about? I thought there were only two categories of staff, teaching and administrative staff. How many categories are we talking about?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two categories, the administrative and teaching staff. The point was expressed here, and it was also expressed in the other House, that since teachers will be in the majority, they might repeatedly appoint teachers. However, that is not necessarily the case. They may appoint an administrative representative and a teacher. It is a matter for the staff and they are all members of the staff. I tabled an amendment because of the points made in that regard. It could be that two administrative people could be appointed by the staff, particularly if administrative staff account for approximately 10% of the staff. The amendment requires that where a group of staff is not represented on the VEC following staff elections, local authorities must, in appointing the four wider representatives to the committee, consider the appointment of a representative of such staff. One cannot make law <Col N="978" /> for how each committee will operate within the country. The steering committee and the social partners spent a long time discussing this issue. That is the formula they came up with and I am sticking to it because I do not want to open it all up again.</P>

      <P>These amendments relate to the role of the local authority in appointing the four additional members to the VEC. This matter was discussed in some detail when the Bill was before the other House. As I said at that time, this goes to the issue of the place of local government in this legislation and in the VEC sector as a whole. In revising the composition of vocational education committees in this Bill, I have provided for a major enhancement of the role of the vocational education committees through, for the first time, the inclusion on a statutory basis of the partners in education on vocational education committees, in addition to a wide range of local interests. The VEC must, however, remain the servant of the local community and not necessarily that of any particular interest group. I am mindful of the long and distinguished contribution local government has made to the VEC sector and believe we have a unique opportunity to give direct expression to the voice of the local community by means of the judgment of the democratically elected representatives. This opportunity will be utilised to the full. Accordingly, it is my view that responsibility for the appointment of the community interests <Col N="979" /> to the VEC should remain with the representatives of the local community, that is, the local authority members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke has a point. Under this structure, 13 of the 17 members will be selected by the council of the county borough. While that is clear-cut and simple in many ways, it ensures that whoever runs the local council in political terms has an enormous say in the membership of the vocational education committee for that five year period. I am concerned about that, particularly in light of the Standards in Public Office Bill we discussed earlier. If parents and teaching staff also have a role, that would provide a better balance and ensure more transparency in how the business is conducted. It would not be seen by the public as a political appointment. That is why there is considerable merit in Senator Burke's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental issue is that the people elect the local representatives to the vocational education committees and it does not matter which mix of representatives they elect. They are democratically elected and the power must rest with them. That is the basis of the democratic involvement and that is why they work, as councillors do, for a long time to become involved and to serve the people locally. That has been a fundamental aspect of the vocational education committees and their operation. There are groups in Dublin, for instance, which come to agreements on what they will do for a number of years. That is democracy in operation, and it is fair. The alternative is to say that some particular interest should decide.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the long and distinguished contribution local government has made to the VEC sector. The position of local authorities was enshrined in the original VEC legislation, and there were sound reasons for so doing. At that time, the local authority sector provided the bedrock for the development of what was then a relatively new and untried experiment in Irish education. Its inclusion provided the VEC sector with a direct link to its local communities, a link constantly reinforced and revitalised by local elections. That direct link in turn created the moral authority of the vocational education committees to continue to undertake their pioneering work in the field of local education, which was ignored to an extent over the years. Much of that work is now coming to fruition, not least the development of adult education as well as the institute of technology structures, which are playing a major part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Costello mentioned the word <Col N="980" />&ldquo;corruption&rdquo;, he retracted it fairly quickly. He meant to say that the power is with certain people. The power will be with the elected people. That is the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 45 to 47.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in response to the problem in section 7(<i>d</i>) with which Senator Burke attempted to deal. We propose that four members would be appointed from five categories. If we appoint four members from five categories, obviously some category will lose out and there is no guarantee that the four members will be appointed from each of four or five categories. I want to eliminate a category which I thought was somewhat redundant, namely, any class of trustees of community colleges, because there will be a variety of educational establishments. Currently we have VEC schools, community colleges, Youthreach centres and various educational establishments and centres in terms of adult and lifelong learning. Why not include one category and have somebody elected from that? Many vocational education committees do not have community colleges. I am trying to simplify the situation in that the four members specified in section 7(<i>e</i>) would be chosen from each of four categories and the fifth category would be deleted. That would ensure that the students have representation.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee in this legislation that the students will have representation. There is no guarantee that the administrative or teaching staff will have representation. One or other category could be omitted, and there will be a great deal of annoyance if that transpires. The other category, voluntary and community organisations, is very important because all our schools are based in the community and the more community involvement and development, the better. The last one refers to persons carrying on a trade or a profession, all of which was part and parcel of membership of the vocational education committees and the boards in the past.</P>
      <P>We have a problem in this section and, from what the Minister said, this legislation is not tight enough in terms of getting the people he wants represented on the VEC. Would it not simplify the position if he accepted my amendment and allowed community colleges to be dealt with, not as a separate category but recognised as one of the multiplicity of institutions that make up the VEC and which reflect the diversity of educational institutions which deliver an education service within the VEC framework?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see where Senator Costello is coming from in relation to this amendment. The hallmark of vocational education committees is that their spread was a reflection of the community at large. Regardless of whether there <Col N="981" /> is a community college, the responsibility lies with the composition of the members of the VEC to reflect that accordingly. If we were to start classifying, we might splinter the vocational education committees in terms of interests representation. It is a global responsibility on the committee rather than a particular trade within the composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Senator Ormonde made is very relevant. It is a question of a national agreement and balance in coming to the terms of the new legislation. If a community group is not involved in a particular instance, there will only be four categories to work to, which is not a problem. In other words, instead of having five categories there would be four.</P>
      <P>The amendment would provide that the religious trustees of community colleges under the remit of a VEC would no longer have a right to nominate a representative to be appointed as one of the four extra appointees to the VEC. I would be reluctant to accept this amendment which seems to counter the spirit of partnership.</P>
      <P>Community colleges under the remit of vocational education committees are schools which have resulted from the amalgamation of a voluntary secondary school with a VEC school. Following such amalgamations, religious trustees of the relevant secondary school are represented on the boards of management of the newly formed community colleges. It is a logical development that they should also have an opportunity to be represented on the committee of the VEC under which their school operates.</P>
      <P>Their inclusion in the provisions of section 7 is a direct expression of the principle of partnership. Not only are these trustees directly affected by VEC policy, they also have a wealth of experience and knowledge in second level education to bring to a VEC. Accordingly, it would not be right to remove this section from the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with a number of colleges throughout the country where we have this exact situation. The vocational education committees are anxious that the religious trustees, who have been there for a long time, would agree to come under the mantle of the VEC. They are doing that in many cases but they have recognition on a national basis and there is representation in this legislation. That is important for vocational education committees in particular areas. The alternative is to go ahead with a different format outside the VEC structure. That is the reason it is so important to the VEC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, line 6, after &ldquo;organisations&rdquo; to <Col N="982" /> insert &ldquo;including those involved in the promotion of the arts and culture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the arts, the Irish language and such activities is very important and experiencing growth. Many local authorities have established sections dealing with the arts, an area in which there is significant growth. Vocational education committees would benefit from representation by organisations which promote the arts and culture. The Minister will recognise that the arts play a significant role. This area is experiencing growth and should be recognised in the composition of vocational education committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the Senator's comments about the mushrooming of interest in the arts. However, if we were to adopt the approach suggested by the amendment, other organisations would also seek representation. Many local authorities have established strategic policy committees dealing with the arts, culture and the Irish language. Members of local authorities will reflect, and be aware of, arts and cultural activities at local level. The phrase &ldquo;voluntary organisations&rdquo; in paragraph 7(<i>e</i>)(iv) would include arts and cultural interests. Members of local authorities appointed to vocational education committees would also be representative of arts and cultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. How long is a piece of string in terms of organisations and bodies which can be represented? I do not understand the reason the Minister increased the categories of organisations which can be represented from four to five. Why should there be five categories if only four members are to be selected? If one has five categories, then why not six, seven or eight?</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 6 was specific to a community college which, for a particular reason, decides to come under the ambit of a VEC. Such a course of action is often due to declining numbers or some other reason which would benefit the college. Once this has happened, the community college is part of the VEC and should be treated equally.</P>
      <P>If a member of the trustees of one community college is appointed to a VEC while no one is appointed from a second such college, both community colleges will have a different level of involvement with the relevant VEC. I do not accept the Minister's argument in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is every reason arts and cultural organisations should be represented as a category on the board of vocational education committees. I would also like to see other areas represented. Much of the work done at community level is carried out by partnerships or task forces and such organisations should be involved. The statutory organisations have also become involved at community level. There is considerable arts and cultural activity in all communities. This is a vibrant <Col N="983" /> area. I do not see the reason the Minister cannot accept this amendment. He is suggesting that we will choose four members from six, as opposed to five, categories. He should reduce the number of categories to four or increase the choice of categories stipulated.</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;voluntary organisations&rdquo; covers a wide range of activities and would include organisations involved in the promotion of the arts and culture. If such organisations are community organisations, they are also included. Commercial organisations involved in this area are also included separately. I appreciate the objective of the amendment. It is important that, through their membership, vocational education committees are able to draw on the full breadth of talent and expertise in their local communities.</P>
      <P>However, the provisions of the amendment are covered in the open and flexible wording of the section. Local authorities must have regard to the nominees of voluntary and community organisations in making their four additional appointments to vocational education committees. This gives the authority concerned sufficient scope to select from among all voluntary groups in the community, including those involved in the arts and culture. On balance, I am satisfied that the provisions of section 7, as drafted, accommodate the inclusion of these interests.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello raised a good point regarding the five categories. Would it not be preferable to amalgamate these categories under one heading rather than five? The four appointees might come from one category as the onus will be on local authority members to come up with four names from the five categories. Students will not be represented as their representatives will be cast aside. I would be concerned that the four members may come from the other four categories.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity to specify arts and cultural organisations as a separate category. By accepting this amendment he would make it easier for elected members of local authorities as they would know they have to appoint a representative from this category.

      <P>The Minister and I are at variance as regards the manner in which the composition of vocational education committees will be determined. There will be problems regarding staff as it is unclear how the two major categories of staff will be represented. I understand it is the Minister's intention that both the administrative and teaching staff will be represented, but that may not be the case because clear provision is not made for it. Any effort on our part to clarify the matter has failed.</P>
      <P>Section 7(4) states:</P>
      <P>Regulations under subsection (3) may provide that both sexes shall be represented on a vocational education committee in such proportions as are specified in the regulations and, for that purpose, may include provisions for the establishment, in respect of elections to which this section applies, panels of candidates comprising women only and panels of candidates comprising men only from which persons shall be elected in accordance with those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I have some idea of the Minister's thinking on this matter? Subsection (3) states: &ldquo;Elections held pursuant to this section, shall be conducted in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, after [various levels of] consultation with.&rdquo; No gender quota is specified, although there is a suggestion that there may be panels of both sexes for some of the elections. Subsection (5) states: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations providing that members of both sexes shall be appointed to.&rdquo; The Minister, however, might never go back to any of these bodies for consultative purposes. The Bill states that the Minister may or may not do such a thing. There is, therefore, no compul<Col N="985" /> sion on him to provide for any element of gender equality.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators may be aware that the same matter was raised in the Lower House. I considered the issues raised at that time regarding the inclusion of references to the Irish language and Irish language policy in the Bill. I have made provision in section 7 for Irish language interests to be consulted by local authorities when deciding their appointments to vocational education committees. While I am concerned that vocational education committees should be guided by Government policy in relation to the maintenance and promotion of the Irish language, on balance, it is not appropriate to include such references in the Bill. All vocational education committees are, and will continue to be, bound by national policy decisions in relation to the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides a clear framework for the formulation of national policy in respect of the place of the Irish language in schools and education generally. That Act explicitly provides, in section 9(<i>d</i>), that each school must ensure the education provided by it meets the requirements of education policy as determined from time to time by the Minister. Section 9(<i>f</i>) provides that each school must also promote the development of the Irish language and traditions, Irish literature, the arts and other cultural matters. VEC schools are bound by these provisions in the same way as all other schools are bound by them.</P>
      <P>The Education Act also provides for a specific body to consider and investigate all issues relating to the teaching and learning of the Irish language. This body, which is being established under section 31 of the Act, has a duty to report directly to me on the best means of promoting the use of Irish in all recognised schools. It is my intention that it should provide the basis for the informed development of strategies to maintain, develop and promote the use of the Irish language in a structured way. It will be my role as Minister, following consideration of the advice of that body, to direct the implementation of its advice and strategy in each school. Repetition of the provisions in the Education Act in relation to the Irish language in this Bill is, therefore, not necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 47 to 48, to delete subparagraph (<i>e</i>)(i).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the concerns which I have with this legislation is that the whole area of boards of management is not covered. It is referred to in terms of <Col N="988" /> the Education Act, 1998. As we all know, the vocational education committees and other primary and post-primary schools operate in a different manner. Primary and post-primary schools are very much individual, stand-alone schools, whereas the VEC schools are part of a scheme and are linked to the parent VEC.</P>
    <P>Section 9(1)(<i>e</i>) is very weak in how it deals with boards of management. I have tabled a further amendment with the intention of strengthening the amendment. Section 9(1)(<i>e</i>) reads:</P>
    <P>where it considers appropriate, make all reasonable efforts to consult, in relation to the performance by it of its functions, with&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i) boards of management of schools established or maintained by that vocational education committee,</P>
    <P>It should be much more proactive than that and should be put in the strongest manner so that it is not just a question that it may &ldquo;make all reasonable efforts to consult&rdquo; with boards of management. There must be a strong link and good communications and accountability between boards of management and vocational education committees. We need to spell out the relationship between the boards and the vocational education committees. We know the relationship between the sub-committees and the parent VEC, yet there seems to be a total lack of clarity as to how the new boards of management will operate in the new structure.</P>
    <P>Having been a member of a board of management, I know how boards of management operate in post-primary schools. The functions of the board of management relate solely to the individual school. How will a school, whether it is a community college with trustees and entitlement to a representative on the vocational education committee or a vocational education school, link to the VEC in conducting its business? How will it operate in terms of accountability to the VEC itself when it holds its meetings? We have a report from the sub-committees of each school. Will there now be a report to the parent body? Will there be accountability between the board and the main body?</P>
    <P>It is extraordinarily weak for the Bill to provide that one of the functions of the VEC will be, &ldquo;where it considers appropriate, make all reasonable efforts to consult, in relation to the performance by it of its functions with boards of management of schools&rdquo;. That is not good enough. We need to spell out what the relationship will be. There is incredible confusion about how boards of management will work <i>vis-à-vis </i>the parent body. I am not satisfied the Minister has made even the slightest attempt to elaborate on or clarify the matter. Something stronger than that single reference is needed. I think that is the only reference to boards of management in the Bill. It is not good enough. It is not clear and will leave <Col N="989" /> everybody confused as to how it operates in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that an educationalist like Senator Costello is so inflexible in his thinking. He is suggesting that there should be a straitjacket syndrome within the board of management in that it must have accountability to such an extent that it would not function. The section stands up very well. From experience in dealing with boards of management I have found that there are no difficulties. The principal and chairman have clear terms of reference which set out the precise links and operations between the VEC and the board of management.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand what would be more appropriate than to have a policy of consulting if necessary. It allows the flexibility for them to develop their policies and vision for the future and to work closely with the VEC. That has always been there and it stands perfectly well. I do not see how it would be changed unless a regime which demanded that every breath taken by the board of management had to be reported to the VEC was put in place. I am totally against that. It would rule against the broad vision and the educational plan of a principal for his school. If, as Senator Costello is suggesting, a strait-jacket is put in place, thinking will be stultified and everyone will be looking over their shoulders as to how they run their schools. It would be inappropriate to suggest such an inflexible approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello has raised a very important point. Some boards of management have worked extremely well while some are extremely poor. One can see how good or bad a school is by how a board of management conducts its business. The link between the boards and the vocational education committee is not spelled out strongly enough. There should be a mechanism where boards of management report to the VEC. That does not seem to be in the Bill and that may be the point that Senator Costello is making. If some boards of management are not carrying out their functions well, this may not be communicated to the VEC because it did not consult that board.</P>
      <P>The board of management is a very important element of the VEC and I would like the Minister to spell out the link between the board and the committee and how they interact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 provides for the removal of the obligation on vocational education committees to consult boards of management of schools under their remit in relation to the performance by the VEC of its functions. Section 9(1)(<i>e</i>) provides for an extensive consultation process whereby each VEC will endeavour to consider the views of all those who have an interest in, or are affected by, its work. It is vital that when framing policy each VEC draws on the experience of boards of management. After all, <Col N="990" /> these boards are in the front line in dealing with pupils, parents and teachers.</P>
      <P>It is not advisable to weaken this provision by excluding boards of management. Neither does it seem appropriate to require a VEC to consult with all interested parties except school management. It is not my intention to support the amendment. There is a related section in amendment No. 16. The current position is that the question of boards of management for schools has been addressed by the Education Act, 1998. That Act provided for a model for the establishment of such boards in all first and second level schools, subject to the agreement of the relevant partners, parents, teachers, patrons and school managers. At first level such agreement has been reached. My Department is currently considering the question of developing a similar model, or models, for second level schools. Any such model will only be implemented with the agreement of the partners concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to the direct link Senator Burke asked about, there is of course direct membership of the VEC as a continuing link with the board of management. They are concerned with changes and new procedures, not with everything that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest there should be a straitjacket and I do not know what Senator Ormonde is talking about. What I refer to is the existing procedure in the vocational education committees. I am disappointed with Senator Ormonde because she has been a VEC teacher and should have realised the great importance of the sub-committee connection with the parent body. Reports of all the meetings of the sub-committees taking place in each school have to be made on a regular basis. The VEC then inspects these reports and recommendations can come from the schools on matters which need to be dealt with. The vocational education committees remain in place and unless the umbilical cord between the boards of management and the school is re-established &ndash; it exists at present through the sub-committees &ndash; what is the sense of having a scheme at all? You might as well have stand-alone schools. There has to be a relationship and communication. We are not talking about a straitjacket, we are talking about the requirement to have a reporting mechanism work both ways, whereby vocational education committees can give directions to the schools because they are VEC schools. There are policy matters and all sorts of other things involved. The schools, in the carrying out of their functions, must make regular reports to the vocational education committees and that is not provided for in this legislation. Until it is provided for we are getting a model for school boards that is pertinent to the primary and secondary schools but not to the vocational education committees because it is a <Col N="991" /> different structure. That is the reason I put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister has wandered to a discussion of amendment No. 16. I thought the two amendments would be taken together as they are related. I want to strengthen the connection between the parent body and the boards of management, as I propose in amendment No. 16.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>

      <P>Now that we have a six year secondary cycle, consisting of five years and a transition year, there is no need to include these words.

That might seem reasonable when considering the case of a 19 year old leaving certificate student; however, a student over 18 years of age is an adult by law. It seems inappropriate to ask young adults to accept that their right of representation should remain with their parents. Instead, Senators will note that I have made separate provision under section 7 for the local authority to directly consider the position of student representatives when appointing the extra four members representing the wider community to the VEC. Accordingly, the amendment will not be of benefit to parents or students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to spell out the range of consultation and co-operation that should take place. One of the flaws at present is that there is very little co-operation among the various educational establishments. The primary school does not know what the secondary school is doing, and <Col N="992" /><i>vice versa</i>, and within second level the secondary school does not know what the vocational school is up to. None of them has much to do with third level other than through the exam system.</P>
    <P>There is a plethora of schools and educational bodies that need to co-operate with each other, some on a tiered system &ndash; from primary to second level &ndash; and on a diverse system if it is adult education or life-long learning. There is a need to have an educational link and in the absence of structures we should provide for it in the legislation. It is little more than an aspiration that vocational education committees would co-operate with other vocational education committees and the whole range of educational bodies, but it is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the thrust of what Senator Costello talks about. From my own experience I know it is important to reinforce this consultation and co-ordination process within the schools in a given area. Very often you find you have wasted resources where there is a duplication of subjects or not enough pupils in one school. There should be more consultation and co-ordination in all services within a locality, including education, because of the potential for duplication of resources and I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur.

      <P>The amendment is not necessary as the organisations outlined by Senators are already comprehended by the terms of section 9. Furthermore, the restriction provided by the Senators might have unwelcome implications. I am aware that most, if not all, vocational education committees have extensive collaboration with local sports groups, youth work groups and other services which, while not directly educational services, have some bearing on education provision. It is appropriate that the vocational education committees be able to co-operate with such groups where such co-operation can be of benefit to their students.</P>

      <P>The Minister needs to spell out co-operation at grassroots level because it is not happening in education. It is as if every educational unit thinks it is a law unto itself. It does its own thing and does not have the slightest consideration for any other school system. Every primary, secondary and vocational school is like a little independent republic. The Minister says they are encompassed by the provision he outlined but this issue is one of the big failures in the system. It is the reason so many youngsters fall out of education. There is no pick up because there is no liaison network, co-operation or consultation worth talking about. I feel obliged to put this amendment to a vote unless the Minister can do something more.</P>

      <P>The Minister can, where he or she considers it necessary, issue a direction under section 14. He or she, therefore, has the power to intervene where necessary. With regard to the general questions raised by the Senator, it is important that schools should be in contact and communication with each other. There should be understandings among them. From my Department's point of view, the inspectors are important in this regard. The Senator must look at where we have come from. The schools have come from different positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must also be careful about too much rationalisation. One is looking for a balance where there is freedom to innovate and work with the students in the school while at the same time providing a good range of services within an area or district. The Department can help through the regional organisations for which I now have Government approval. We are beginning the negotiations and consultations for that. There is an extensive consultation process in these types <Col N="994" /> of arrangements, although preliminary consultations were conducted by Cromien. The more definitive consultations are now under way. That will help to bring people together within a region and to secure better understanding.</P>

In the performance of its functions the VEC, in so far as it is practicable, shall co-operate with other vocational education committees. We are extending the list and pinpointing areas where co-operation should take place. It does not cut across anything the Minister might have power to do but is asserting, in a strong fashion, that there has been a lacuna or lapse in the past. It is time to get co-operation moving in terms of the other schools operating in the area and to point it out so the vocational education committees can get working on it.</P>

It would be preferable to ensure that the Minister is made aware of where it is not happening rather than integrate it into the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Each school established or maintained by a committee shall have a board of management in accordance with the Education Act, 1998, which notwithstanding that Act shall be accountable to the committee in respect of such functions of the board as are determined by the committee.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important amendments I have tabled in connection with the Bill. It relates to an area which has been neglected in the legislation, namely, the establishment of a link between parent vocational education committees and schools. The Education Act, 1998, makes provision for the composition of school boards and the amendment states that, notwithstanding anything in that Act, the school boards &ldquo;shall be accountable to the committee in respect of such functions of the board as are determined by the committee&rdquo;. The amendment is designed to put in place a level of accountability, establish the link between the committees and the schools and allow the committees to decide the levels of monitoring and supervision they wish to impose on school boards.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not intended as a straitjacket and I do not want to hear that word used again. We have a democratic system that incorporates a body of schools which come under the umbrella of vocational education committees. For the most part, local authorities and locally elected individuals will be involved with the boards which will make them the only democratic institutions within the educational system. I want to ensure that, where they are established, school boards retain their link and remain accountable to the parent body and that said body can decide the functions it may wish, from time to time, boards to carry out. In other words, boards will have to conduct school operations in a manner which is accountable to their members. That is reasonable and correct because it will help create cohesion in the system.</P>
      <P>We do not want a stand-alone school system. There are between 3,000 and 4,000 primary schools and 800 secondary schools operating on a stand-alone basis at present, which are only linked to the Department of Education and Science in terms of the need for co-operation with State-sponsored examinations or in respect of their need for building improvements, maintenance etc. It is important that the units of the VEC structure should be properly accountable and linked to the parent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's suggestion that I cannot use the word &ldquo;straitjacket&rdquo; will only encourage me to use it again. In using the term, <Col N="995" /><Col N="996" /> I meant that the workings of the boards of management are inflexible. Such boards are already accountable, particularly in terms of the requirement that they submit reports, oversee financial budgets, cater for the upkeep of schools and co-operate with vocational education committees in dealing with major disciplinary problems. In addition, parents are granted access to vocational education committees without having to deal with boards of management. I cannot understand how Senator Costello can state that we must tighten the procedures to ensure there is a greater level of accountability. In my opinion, his amendment would destroy the boards of management and lead to members of vocational education committees looking over their shoulders. I could not stand over a position where boards would not be able to operate without first consulting their parent committees.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated, this matter is already dealt with in the legislation. In that context, power is granted to the Minister and any VEC to intervene, if necessary, where they are of the opinion that a particular board of management is not doing its job. Principals will also have a major responsibility in this area. I do not believe amendment is necessary and it would inhibit the way we want the boards of management to work. As already stated, it would essentially act as a straitjacket and I could not agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt briefly with this matter on section 8 and I concur with Senator Costello in respect of it. If the amendment was accepted, it would firmly place boards of management in a legislative context. There must be a link between vocational education committees and boards of management, and Senator Costello's amendment facilitates this. As already stated, some boards of management have worked extremely well while others have not. We can judge the performance of some schools in terms of how their boards of management function. I support Senator Costello in relation to this matter because a link between any good board of management and its parent vocational committee is a must. If a school is not performing well, there is an onus on the relevant vocational education committee to request that either the board of management or one of its own units ensures that matters are put right. Senator Costello's amendment will allow this to happen.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment and the Minister should give it careful consideration because the Bill does not appear to contain a framework for the creation of strong links between vocational education committees and the schools in their jurisdictions. The amendment provides such a framework and should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue in the context of amendment No. 13. The question of providing boards of management for schools was addressed in the Education Act, 1998. That Act provides for a model for the establishment of such boards in all first and second level schools, <Col N="997" /> subject to the agreement of the relevant partners, namely, parents, teachers, patrons and school managers. At first level, such agreement has been reached. The Department is currently considering the question of the development of a similar model or models for the second level sector. Any such model that may arise will only be implemented with the agreement of the partners concerned.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns that have been raised. However, the model for vocational education committees will be developed in conjunction with the vocational education committees and will be agreed with them before being introduced. In that context, I do not believe the amendment is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is saying, but it is not provided for in the legislation. Section 14 of the Education Act makes provision for the establishment of boards of management and outlines the composition thereof. It does not say that it will happen in consultation with the vocational education committees, which is why the relationship should be in this Bill. How can a vocational education Bill, which updates the 1930 Act, make only a passing reference to school boards of management? There should be an explicit assertion of the relationship. It is neither in the 1998 Act nor here. The section in the 1998 Act dealing with boards of management does not make the relationship clear and it is not referred to in this Bill. It ought to state clearly that there shall be a communication line and accountability to the parent committee in respect of the board's functions determined by the committee.</P>
      <P>The Act provides that this should be so regarding what might be determined by the Minister, but this is a school board under the committee's umbrella and it should have a say in how the school operates. If it has no role, then the schools should be released from the VEC. He says it will take place in consultation with the Minister, but that is not stated in either piece of legislation. We rely on the Minister's goodwill that the boards of management will be established in consultation with the vocational education committees. That means that these boards will be different from the other boards, which should be made clear in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The 1998 Act explicitly stresses that it be done in agreement with the patrons of schools. The VEC is a patron of the schools. The partners repeatedly stated clearly that this was not prescriptive but by agreement and in consultation with them. That issue came out repeatedly, as the Senator may remember. The provision is in the 1998 Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister gives authority to the committee to establish companies. I am not concerned if that is good or bad, but with the circumstances in which a VEC can form a company. Can it form one in conjunction with another body to carry out its functions? Local authorities were given the power to form private companies and others with outside bodies to conduct business. What type of business would a company formed by a VEC conduct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke raises an important matter. This is a straitjacket stating that a private company shall be wholly owned by the VEC. This is provision only for establishing private companies as if that is the way a committee would conduct its business. Most work will be co-operative involving partnerships, such as the local area partnership, drugs taskforce or even the new sports structures proposed by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. These are excluded by this legislation. They are not encompassed in its terms. We may have to amend this legislation sooner rather than later.</P>

    <P>This amendment provides that the performance of the chief executive officer of the functions in this section may be the subject of an appeal to the <Col N="999" /> vocational education committee by an interested party or their representative.

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Senator says. I have had difficulty with chief executive officers, their role and relationship to the committee. Indeed, some of them overstepped it and monopolised and dictated to it. That has been well established. The power must rest with the committee and the chief executive officer must be answerable to it and not the other way round. That point should be clear &ndash; the chief executive officer is accountable to the committee and he carries out the decisions made by it. We have had many cases in the past where it has not been so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the points raised by the Senators in relation to the role of the VEC in staffing matters. As the Senators are aware, I have provided in this Bill that the management of staff will henceforth be an executive function. As such it will be the responsibility of the chief executive officer of each VEC to ensure that all staff functions are carried out in an efficient, effective and fair manner. I would also like to clarify that those existing protections for staff already contained in the body of VEC legislation, in particular those in the 1944 Act, remain and will be unaffected by this legislation.</P>
      <P>Teachers in VEC schools are in the main represented by the TUI, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, which is a party to the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme through which national agreements in relation to the terms and conditions of employment of teachers are negotiated. Well-established protections are therefore already in place in most instances for staff. Where strict provisions do not exist, or need to be reviewed, this Bill creates an obligation on chief executive officers to develop and implement appropriate appeals procedures. When considering the need for local appeals procedures, chief executive officers must have regard to their duty to ensure that the staff are treated in an equitable and fair manner at all times.</P>
      <P>It would not be helpful to prescribe a particular form of process in this legislation. It is my view that such procedures should emerge after consultation and, ideally, agreement with all the partners concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek a point of clarification. Will it be mandatory on all vocational education committees to have an appeals mechanism or procedure in place? When a VEC is set up, will an appeals mechanism be put in place before an issue arises so that if anybody has a problem the mechanism will kick in and the appellant will not be isolated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the concept of a local appeals procedure that will prescribe a formula <Col N="1000" /> as to how to handle problems as they arise. Speaking from experience I wish to add something in relation to interview boards. Chief executive officers have in the past influenced, not so much the composition of the VEC, but interview boards as to whom they want to be appointed. I hope regulations will be incorporated in the legislation in such a way that the chief executive officer's job will not have anything to do with appointments, other than as part of his role. They should not dictate to vocational education committees as has been the case. I hope this will not happen in the future. Local appeals procedures would be able to deal with any incidences of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happier if it was mandatory on each committee to set it up from the start. More than likely there will be situations where somebody will have a problem and the mechanism the Minister talks of will then have to be put in place. The appellant will then stand out as the bad person creating the problem. It may only be something small but he or she will be seen as an outcast within the system. It would be much better if a system was in place and then people could use the system if they wished.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are related and will be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In exercising its functions pursuant to <i>subsection (1)</i> a vocational education committee shall have regard to the desirability of including members nominated from the various constituent groups of the committee on any sub-committee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of sub-committees takes on a certain amount of importance in the legislation because a VEC can now establish sub-committees to perform one or more of its functions. If a sub-com<Col N="1001" /> mittee is to carry out the function that would normally be carried out by the main committee itself then it is important that it should be done by a representative composition that would reflect the representation on the committee. My amendment seeks to ensure that in exercising the functions herein, that is the sub-committee established, we should look at including members nominated from the various constituent groups of the committee on any sub-committee. I ask that it should have regard to the desirability &ndash; it is not an absolute compellability. It is desirable and should be brought to the attention of all the vocational education committees. In the composition of sub-committees that will carry out functions that are functions of the VEC itself, it is desirable that there be a full representation of the VEC on the new committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully considered the question of composition of sub-committees of vocational education committees. The establishment of a sub-committee has been and will principally be a means to assist the vocational education committees to carry out their business in a more effective manner. I have made a number of changes to the existing structures for sub-committees in this Bill to provide more flexibility for vocational education committees in establishing such sub-committees. Generally, therefore, the establishment of a sub-committee will be at the discretion of the VEC and in response to perceived needs. Such needs will be of their nature diverse. There may well be occasions when it will not only be desirable but also effective to limit the number of members of a sub-committee to two or three &ndash; for instance, a sub-committee exploring a proposal and reporting back to the VEC.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances this amendment, though well intentioned, might actually hinder the work of the VEC by requiring unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing a sub-committee, perhaps resulting in its being overly large for the task it faces. I appreciate that in amendment No. 19 Senator Burke has provided that VEC members may waive their right to be included on a sub-committee. However, I consider the alternative of simply leaving it to the discretion of the VEC itself to be preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined the possibility of including a reference in this section to the need for vocational education committees to have regard to the principle of partnership in the formation of sub-committees. The key focus of the Bill should remain the statutory establishment of the principle of partnership in vocational education committees, the first time this principle has been made explicit. It will be a matter for a VEC, taking account of the principle, to decide how to conduct its own affairs. I strongly support the principle of partnership that now underpins the educational sector and it has been and remains <Col N="1002" /> my view that the VEC should organise its own business. Rather than restricting the capacity of vocational education committees to manage their affairs, this legislation should accommodate them to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite right when he says that a spirit of partnership underpins this legislation and the educational sector. It depends to what degree vocational education committees decide to establish sub-committees and how much of the work of vocational education committees will be conducted by sub-committees. Parents or staff may feel left out if they are not represented on sub-committees. There is no requirement that membership of sub-committees be decided by proportional representation. While everything will be quite satisfactory in the vast majority of cases, under this legislation a VEC can exclude from representation any category it wishes. The amendment tries to obviate the potential problems I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the point made by the Senator, but concerns that there may be an imbalance, favouring the Minister, between the role of the VEC and that of the Minister are misplaced. This provision was originally contained in the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and has therefore successfully stood the test of time. This is also an opportunity for vocational education committees to decide how to structure their own affairs. If it decides that a particular function could be more effectively carried out by a sub-committee, the VEC can use this provision to make such a case to the Minister. There may be <Col N="1003" /> occasions when it will be necessary to provide that certain sub-committees, such as those established by the VEC on the direction of the Minister, should be accountable to the Minister or another body specified by the Minister rather than to the VEC.</P>
      <P>These matters are especially relevant in the context of the implementation of the recent White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, which recommended the establishment of adult learning boards. Regional boards will form part of an integrated national structure and report annually to a national adult learning council, also provided for in the White Paper, on the delivery of adult education services in the regions. The White Paper provides that boards will be established as autonomous sub-committees of vocational education committees, thereby linking them into a well-established regional structure. This Bill is designed to facilitate both their establishment and the granting to them of necessary autonomy once established. The boards form an integral part of a comprehensive strategy for the development of adult education and will play a vital role in helping to ensure a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the implementation of the White Paper's proposals. The provisions of the Bill are vital if the vision of the White Paper is to be given full expression.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for this Bill which updates the 1930 Vocational Education Act. I compliment his staff on their co-operation on all Stages of the Bill. It is a great Bill and if it stands the test of time as the 1930 Act has done, we will have done very well and feel we have made a significant contribution to the history of our education system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The matter I am raising has been raised by colleagues in the other House. It relates to the establishment of a CABAS unit for autistic children in Dublin. I know the Minister is aware of the ongoing situation, but I ask him to update the House regarding the reviews carried out and the ongoing monitoring of the comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling, CABAS, project.</P>
      <P>A significant number of people suffer from autism and I hope, following a review of the projects run up to now, the Minister will be able to provide extra facilities. I have been contacted by a number of people, including a close friend whose three and a half year old child is autistic, in this regard. The Minister has had other problems to deal with this year but the case for those who suffer from autism is meritorious and I hope there is support and sympathy in general to ensure appropriate resources are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to my colleague, Deputy Creed, our party spokesperson on education, regarding the provision of extra resources. The Minister is well aware more resources should, and I hope will, be made available. Apart from the need for <Col N="1005" /> resources, the case for further projects and schools is meritorious and I understand a location has been identified in Dublin. Unfortunately, autism sufferers do not comprise the biggest lobby group.</P>
    <P>In the context of the review of the Cork project and ongoing research it is important to recognise various characteristics among autism sufferers. Some of the most common include avoiding eye contact; disinterest in people or play; unusual fears such as a fear of colour; inappropriate use of toys; resistance to learning; obsessive spinning of objects; lack of awareness of dangers; and ability to ignore loud sounds. There is positive evidence that a child with autism responds often dramatically to the stimulus of special education and training and in a suitable environment children and young adults can learn basic living skills which compensate, at least in part, for the problems they experience.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown to date that such an environment is best provided by way of family-like community settings; special schools for children with autism; skill based training centres; organising staff to assist in the development of people with autism; and residential homes in family sized units. There is no simplistic solution to the problem such as throwing money at it but I am sure the Minister, given his wide experience, has met various groups and will respond positively to further representations.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline progress on this issue? Will he give a commitment in principle to make the necessary resources available? There needs to be a follow-up to the Cork project. Given the large population in Dublin, is the Kilbarrack venture a definite runner? I hope the Minister will give a positive response despite the many applications he receives for resources in other areas. He could do with more resources similar to other Ministers but the case for autism sufferers is self-made. If he is unable to answer all the questions I have put, perhaps he will come back to me later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal put forward by a group of parents who wish to establish a CABAS unit in Dublin and have had a number of meetings with representatives of the group. The CABAS facility in Cork, to which the Senator referred, was established in 1999 to cater for up to 12 children with autism. This facility was established on a five year pilot basis to test the appropriateness and effectiveness of addressing the educational needs of children with autism through a model based on the comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my Department's agreement to fund the operation of the Cork CABAS facility, it was agreed by all concerned that the project was being established on a pilot basis and that further expansion in the use of the CABAS model would <Col N="1006" /> be considered at the end of the pilot period and following an evaluation of the pilot programme. This process is now moving faster. In May this year my Department commissioned the UK based National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out an independent evaluation of all current State funded models of response to children with autism, including the CABAS facility in Cork. The foundation has already been in touch with the CABAS facility as part of the evaluation process. The outcome of this evaluation is due to be presented to my Department in October.</P>
    <P>I established a special task force on autism to review the adequacy of my Department's current range of responses to the educational needs of children with autism and make recommendations on the future development of services in this area. The task force comprises people with a wide range of expertise and experience in the field of autism. It has also had the benefit of presentations from experts in the field from the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the task force has considered a substantial number of submissions from interested parties.</P>
    <P>The future role of the CABAS model and other models of applied behavioural analysis in the education of children with autism is among the issues addressed by the task force. I expect to receive the report of the task force in the near future. The House will appreciate that, as Minster, I have a particular responsibility to ensure any models of educational provision made available to children with autism are appropriate and beneficial to the children in question. It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that I should await the outcome of the evaluation referred to before funding the further expansion of the CABAS model.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with representatives of the Dublin parents group on Friday last, officials of my Department put forward proposals for the development of special dedicated provision for their children. These proposals envisage the establishment of two special dedicated classes for the children in question. Each class will have the support of a qualified teacher and two special needs assistants and cater for a maximum of six children. My Department has indicated that further special needs assistant support will be provided if judged necessary on the basis of professional assessments.</P>
    <P>My Department has also indicated its willingness to fund the delivery of special dedicated training for the teachers of the classes in question to enable them to better meet the needs of the children in question. The question of providing supplementary home based tuition for the children in question will also be considered on the basis of professionally assessed needs. The representatives of the parents group have undertaken to consider these proposals and respond to my Department as soon as possible. The arrange<Col N="1007" /> ments proposed by my Department will result in the delivery of a satisfactory response to the educational needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for special care and attention for children with autism and the need for special educational training. However, when I began work on this issue, there was only a handful of classes attached to the mainstream system. There are 80 classes now and that has not been widely appreciated. We are moving rapidly in that area, but it does not mean we have all the answers. The task force is looking at the various issues to help us in that regard. Some parents prefer to have a mix of systems, but it is important to provide the supports that are needed.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about the best way to <Col N="1008" /> spend the money to ensure the necessary resources are provided. I assure him that based on the professional assessment, we will meet those needs. The Government has given an undertaking to do that. Things are moving so fast in that direction we must ensure we work within the mainstream to the greatest extent possible and in the best interests of those children. That is being developed at present. As regards Kilbarrack, school facilities are available there and there is an opportunity to work within that area. I hope that can be concluded shortly.</P>
