      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give a commitment that, as chairman of the UN Security Council, he will prioritise the introduction of a verification protocol to the UN Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons Convention.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that the crews on ships visiting our ports, flying the flag of convenience, have fair and reasonable pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review his Department's decision to provide an extension to St. Joseph's secondary school, Tulla, County Clare, with a view to sanctioning a new school on a greenfield site as recommended by two feasibility studies carried out by his Department in November 2000 and March 2001.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, motion re time limit for the Order of Business, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re referral of Freedom of Information Act, 1997, (Prescribed Bodies) (No. 4) Regulations, 2001, to the Joint Committee on Finance <Col N="26" /> and the Public Service, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re referral of Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Eligible Customer) Order, 2001, to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, to be taken without debate; No. 4, Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time; No. 19, motion 26, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business to be resumed thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as far as I am concerned. On No. 2, perhaps the Leader will at some stage organise a fuller discussion on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. I believe it is being applied in a manner that in many ways was not necessarily intended when it was discussed in these Houses. A review and debate would be timely.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate the legislation he hopes to bring to the House this session? Will he arrange for an urgent debate on the political developments in Northern Ireland? Anybody familiar with the developments there knows we are slipping dangerously close to a set of circumstances that may bring about the collapse of the entire edifice created by the Good Friday Agreement. Time is running out and it seems almost inevitable that we will face a restoration of direct rule by the end of the year unless something dramatic happens in the meantime. It is apparent that all sides have talked themselves into positions in which nothing dramatic can happen. It is urgent that this House has the opportunity to debate the matter, next week at the latest.</P>
      <P>In the context of the North, I condemn the murder of the <i>Sunday World</i> journalist Martin O'Hagan last weekend. Politicians and journalists should not be close &ndash; they come from different positions but both serve the public interest and both are essential parts of the democratic system. The murder of a journalist is as serious an affront to democracy as would be the murder of an elected politician. It is imperative that the fascists and thugs who murdered this man, a good and decent journalist, are brought to justice. It is important that we express our abhorrence of this foul deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the words of Senator Manning. In a sense, the murder and callous assassination of a journalist going about his business brings to our attention all that is wrong and evil in society. It was, in a small way, as much an attack on democracy as was the atrocity in the United States. It undermines the openness and accountability of a democratic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has happened since we adjourned for the summer recess. There is a grave danger that, with <Col N="27" /> the Government completely and understandably tied up with issues such as Northern Ireland, the attack on America, the possibility of a war and the European enlargement problems, we will lose track of what is happening to our own economy. Will the Leader of the House urgently organise a debate on how we will manage this problem?</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of the downturn in the economy because time and again when other groups deal with it, people in this House say it is an undermining of democracy and that they have not had a part in it. There should be a consensus approach to the difficulties in the economy. It should not be a case of the trade unions being on one side, businesses on the other side and the Government somewhere else, with every party involved guarding its own corner. We have a common set of objectives, whatever our differences, and they need to be addressed properly.</P>
    <P>Can we have a debate, over the next week possibly, based on the ESRI report? It would be a sensible way to analyse the future of our economy. We should also look at how the partnership process, which has worked so well in the economy, might serve as a model for working together in concert to achieve objectives that are essential to everybody's future. I do not want us to be dragged down by long debates on abortion and other things while this matter requires attention. It should be dealt with now in a co-ordinated fashion with the involvement of political representatives. Now is our opportunity to do that. Can we have a debate on it to see how the Government might respond to an agreed partnership approach to the problems in the economy?</P>

      <P>I do not agree to the first motion that the time for the Order of Business be limited to 30 minutes from now until Christmas. I have often said that this is an important time in the day for the House which gives Senators an opportunity to refer to important issues that are either on the Order of Business&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to discuss the merits of the motion. Senator Costello is well aware that the motion is on the Order Paper with the full support of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. It does not have my support and has never had my support any time it has been placed on the Order Paper. I have articulated this every time it has been placed on the Order Paper and I intend to continue to articulate it. It is an important period&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>All other members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges support the placing of the motion on the Order Paper. It is a matter for the House to accept or reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that I am entitled to refer to every motion to be put us today for adoption. The Labour Party does not support the time limit of 30 minutes because we believe there are many important issues relevant to the Order of Business which can be raised and that it is an opportunity for Senators on all sides of the House to have their voices heard. It is a part of democracy we expect.</P>
      <P>I thank the Whip for giving me a briefing memorandum on motions Nos. 2 and 3 on the Order Paper. It is a waste of the time of the House and the committees to have a motion every few weeks relating to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, regulations whereby new bodies, in this case higher education bodies, come within the ambit of the Act. We refer the regulations to a committee which discusses them and refers them back to the House. We should have an enabling process to allow everything to come within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act unless we specifically exclude it. That was the original intention of the Act. I oppose the motion on the Order Paper relating to the Act. We must get our act together on this. However, should the motion be agreed to, we should have a debate on the regulations when they are referred back to the House.</P>
      <P>We reconvened recently to offer our sympathy and condolences to the American people on the atrocity on their soil a few short weeks ago. It is imperative that we broaden that debate and have a full scale debate on the issues arising from the event and the implications in terms of war, peace, trade and our Government giving <i>carte blanche</i> access to our airports to the American Government without reference to the House and to the fact Ireland has become chair of the Security Council of the United Nations. Serious matters need to be addressed, tourism being an obvious one as well as industrial and economic matters to which Senator O'Toole referred and which will be of considerable concern in coming weeks and months. There should be a full scale debate on these issues as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland. The situation in terms of the peace process in Northern Ireland has deteriorated in recent months. Serious issues have arisen. There is a major question mark over the institutions. There has been an increase in the number of sectarian attacks, the latest being the tragic death of Martin O'Hagan which must be condemned on all sides. Many other atrocities have been committed as well. The peace process is at a critical stage and it would be appropriate for us to give our views on the position. Can we have a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Government side of the House, I join Senators Manning and Costello in condemning the murder of Martin O'Hagan. Senator Manning is correct to say that it is an <Col N="29" /> attack on democracy and on freedom of speech. It is an attack carried out by people without any democratic mandate whatsoever. The murder of a journalist or anybody else is to be regretted.</P>
      <P>I agree with the call for a debate on Northern Ireland but it must also be realised that sensitive issues are involved. Members know that the House has a very good record in dealing with these sensitive matters. We have made a positive contribution over the years and I am sure we can do so again. However, it is curious that while an international coalition is being assembled against terrorism, there seems to be a measure of tolerance for terrorism on our own island. This does not add up. There is still terrorism at work on this island and that must be condemned. One would not wish to over-simplify the debate, but it seems that decommissioning and the adoption of the Patten report are at the heart of the issue. We can deal with these matters in greater detail when we come to the debate itself.</P>
      <P>I agree that it would be appropriate to discuss and review the economy because fundamental changes have taken place since the House rose for the summer recess. I am sure the Minister for Finance would welcome the opportunity to address the House on that issue.</P>
      <P>As to the taking of No. 1 on the Order of Business without debate, the Cathaoirleach is correct in stating that we have in successive sessions taken this issue without debate. It has been carried on each occasion and it is rare that the Chair has had to invoke the order. In other words, the House has, by and large, stayed within the time limit of the order. To do otherwise would invite a succession of statements on the Adjournment on the Order of Business rather than having them where they belong, which is on the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support Senator Manning in his remarks concerning the brutal, cold blooded murder of the decent northern journalist, Martin O'Hagan. I support also the Senator's remarks concerning the imminent danger to both the Northern Executive and the Assembly.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader what plans, if any, has the Government for the rescue of the tourism industry in the wake of the appalling atrocities in the United States on 11 September last. What is happening is absolutely frightening. Kerry and the entire country have been very heavily hit. I say to the Leader and the Government that what we need now is an immediate, dramatic and innovative initiative such as a $99 return fare between Ireland and the United States. That would&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot debate the matter now. I take it the Senator is seeking a debate on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that Members will be pedantic enough to ask me to declare an interest as a director of Independent Newspapers, a subsidiary of which Martin O'Hagan worked for. I associate myself with the remarks made by Senators and I am grateful to them. Martin O'Hagan was the first journalist murdered in Northern Ireland, but I am sure there was also a first judge who was murdered, a first policeman, a first politician and a first prison officer. Senators struck the right note in describing this act as a blow against democracy because an investigative press is an important element in any democracy. To coin a phrase which got some currency last weekend, this act was ethically indefensible &ndash; as all such deaths in Northern Ireland have been ethically indefensible.</P>
      <P>For those who wish to pursue the casuistry further, it is interesting to note that those who murdered Martin O'Hagan from time to time sail under the flag of convenience of &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo;. We need to be very careful that we do not use euphemisms to cover up what is really murder. Behind it all there is a deep human tragedy. I visited that house on Sunday and it does not become any easier no matter how many times you do it. A family is shattered, a lovely wife and three lovely daughters who will be encouraged and comforted by the expressions of sympathy in this House.</P>
      <P>In regard to the broader issues of Northern Ireland, I agree with Senator Manning that we are teetering on the edge and a dramatic act is needed. The one dramatic act that will fundamentally change the nature of the situation up there is for some of the people who have arms to cough them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month a group in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform produced a most useful report &ndash; a review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. There is a particularly good section on the lack of services for psychiatric patients, an area which was not dealt with in the Mental Health Bill which went through this House just before the end of the session. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Health and Children, even the Minister for Finance who seems to be in charge of health matters at the moment, to come to the House to discuss this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to be associated with the remarks regarding the awful murder of the journalist, Martin O'Hagan. It speaks for itself and I would certainly like to be linked with my colleagues on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole regarding a discussion on the economy. There is a downturn, but up to now we have done very well on a consensus <Col N="31" /> basis. I would like to think that would continue rather than this freelancing attitude that is creeping in. It is very important that we have a debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps down the scale of importance, but very important to me, is the role of An Bord Pleanála, on which some time in the near future we should have the debate which I have sought many times. I ask the Leader to find time over the next two months to discuss the issue of its accountability and generally how it works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have done, I condemn the murder of Martin O'Hagan. Any attempt to still the voice of democracy must be met with great resistance by all of us who believe in democracy.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, if he will come before us and explain exactly what he intends to do with the waste management fund? The importance of this lies in the amount that this fund can actually raise. I am not sure if the Cathaoirleach or the House is aware that the Minister intends, in February, to impose a levy on all plastic bags and also on landfill sites. I believe the number of plastic bags produced in one year is over one billion &ndash; that is nearly one per day per person in this country. To gauge the funds raised from that all one has to do is divide this sum by eight to find exactly how much will be raised. I would like to know what the Minister intends to do with those funds, how they are to be distributed, what equitable system he intends to impose and if he would not be better to consider a ban in a year's time on all non-degradable plastic bags. Perhaps that is the direction we should go if we really believe in environmental cleanliness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to No. 27 on the Order of Business about the decision of the Department of Education and Science to dock the pay of part-time teachers who answered the Government's call to undertake a day of mourning. I understand the Minister for Education and Science has stated this will not be done, and if the Leader is able to reassure me that this is the case then I will remove it from the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the banking structure. We have had this before on a number of occasions, but the banks, just to mention one issue, are deliberately driving customers out of the banking halls into areas where they are exposed to danger, inclement weather and all the rest of it, even though the taxpayers provide security for their transmissions of money. There are an enormous number of arguments and there is huge customer dissatisfaction with all the principal banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sympathy also to the family of Martin O'Hagan, particularly since I am a mem<Col N="32" /> ber of the National Union of Journalists. It was an atrocious crime. All these murders are wrong. This one has the added dimension that it is perfectly obvious that he was not killed as a political act but because he was stirring up the mud. He was deliberately, clearly and with extraordinary courage exposing the links between the paramilitaries and criminal activity, particularly drugs. That makes his murder even worse and more cynical. I unreservedly condemn it and express my sympathy to his family.</P>
    <P>I concur with the call by Senator Costello for a debate on Afghanistan and the situation that may occur there, for one particular reason that relates to Ireland. I think it unwise, although it might be understandable in the climate of heightened emotions at times. If we give a blank cheque to any third country to engage in military activity using our facilities, we certainly should know the purpose and the scope of any military activity.  It is also quite wrong for the Taoiseach to bypass the democratic process without putting something like this through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join with Senator Manning and others in his impassioned condemnation of that atrocious act. Sadly each time we resume a session in the Seanad we seem to have a new atrocity. It is not going away. We must use the time available to us to debate the issues and to put pressure on the men of violence to put aside their arms.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House as soon as possible to deal with an issue that has been raised on all sides of the House relating to children with special needs, behavioural difficulties and educational difficulties. A huge number of children are waiting for assessment, not to mention treatment, in our primary schools. Nothing is being done. I hope too that the Minister will adopt a conciliatory tone to the teachers to offset any further industrial unrest in relation to the money due to them for supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member of this House and a member of the National Union of Journalists I wish to add my voice of condemnation on the events of last Friday when journalist Martin O'Hagan was shot down in cold blood. He was murdered for doing his job, in effect for revealing the truth, telling it as it was and exposing crime. I extend my sympathy to his family at this very sad time.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate in this House on the role of this country and decisions made by the Government in relation to supporting US-led activity in Afghanistan and elsewhere, if that so happens. As democratically elected Members we are entitled to know what the Government is doing in our name. I call on the Taoiseach to come into this House and debate the issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" />I ask the Leader for a debate on the national development plan, particularly in light of newspaper reports this week that because of the economic downturn the targets set out in the plan are not likely to be met. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance, in particular, to come before the House and to set out what changes will be made to the national development plan and specifically in relation to the ambitious road building programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the passport for sale issue. I am not sure if that is the correct way to handle the issue. About three years ago I used the opportunity of the Private Members' motion to wrest from the Government that it would no longer continue with passports for sale. We learned the other day that a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden obtained an Irish passport in the late 1980s. I am not happy that the response we got from the Government in 1998 is sufficient. It agreed it would not issue any more passports for sale. It also agreed it would set up, if I remember correctly, a committee to investigate how best to put this into legislation. We have heard nothing more in three years.</P>
      <P>We must ensure a total ban on anything such as that happening again. We must ensure that in future there will be no way that Irish citizenship can be granted by Government, bypassing the normal regulations which we should establish. I ask the Leader to either have a debate here to give us a chance to investigate that or to bring back a response from the Government as to its intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Manning and others have said regarding Northern Ireland. I was appalled by the events which led to the death of Martin O'Hagan but I was also appalled every morning over breakfast in the last week of August and the first week of September by the news of what was happening to the children going up the Ardoyne Road to school. When I think of the psychological effect those events will have on those children, I wonder how we will cope with such events over the next 20 or 30 years. Therefore, I fully support Senator Manning in his call for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to raise the issue which will be raised outside the gates shortly. The postmasters' union is on the march. I would like to see the Minister for Public Enterprise tackle not only the issue of the wage increase which they have been granted but also the question of rural post offices. In my area one of the local post offices closed last year and the two petrol stations and one of the shops closed this year. Where are the people in the area to go? There is no other supermarket close by. This issue is important in the context of <Col N="34" /> rural development and the regeneration of this country.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on banking. While the profits of the banks are increasing all the time, the service to customers provided by the banks is deteriorating by the month. It is an important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of Martin O'Hagan. There is a book of condolences in Liberty Hall if anybody wants to go and sign it. I do not know how long it will be open, but I imagine it will be there for a little while.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dardis, Senator O'Toole and others have said, it is important that we debate the economy because the state of the national economy is obviously very different from what it was six or eight months ago. Indeed, it will provide an opportunity where the extraordinary consensus which has existed about the economy may be broken. Senator O'Toole spoke about a model and he has spoken about it for a very long time. Irrespective of the good that model does us in good times, it is questionable &ndash; I say no more than that at this time &ndash; whether it is suitable for the difficult times that face us. I would welcome a debate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to elicit some information for me. There is, I understand, a decision by the EU to have in place by 7 December new structures for dealing with people who are suspected of terrorism, including, according to my reading of it, a rather broadly based definition of terrorism which would have rendered the ANC illegal in every European country. Perhaps the Leader will find out a little about it. Before the Government agrees to such an important fundamental change, it should be debated not just in a committee but in both Houses of the Oireachtas so that we know what we are doing. It may be necessary to put this in place &ndash; I do not know yet &ndash; but I ask the Leader to ensure that it is debated properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise an issue here and I ask Members to talk about it. There has been a considerable amount of talk about the horrors of terrorism and of course I associate myself with all the expressions of sympathy on the death of Martin O'Hagan. As somebody who is not a member of the NUJ but who writes on a regular basis for a newspaper, I think the idea of an assault on somebody because of what he or she writes is an extraordinarily brutal act. However, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a political party in this State which effectively supports terrorism is now the largest party in most of our third level institutions. We must consider that matter including the need to clarify the morality and moral position that leaders and people in politics take in terms of encouraging our young people to think through the morality of the political positions they are adopting for reasons that have more to do with romance and <Col N="35" /> protest than with an understanding of what precisely they are supporting. This is very important.</P>
    <P>I support my colleagues in calling for a debate on the economy. Given that the Government has talked a lot recently about inequality &ndash; this remark might be as much directed over my shoulder as it is towards the Government &ndash; it would be tragic if having distributed the good times unevenly those who benefited least from the good times were now to suffer as much as everyone else from the less good times. There is a particular need to ensure that whatever entrenchment is necessary is carried by those who have done best out of the last glorious years of apparently unbridled affluence.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that a considerable number of people have reached the position of my party, that is, one should not write a blank cheque when offering to support people who are involved in military activity. I do not believe that the horrors of 11 September should suspend anyone's moral judgment about anyone's activities anywhere.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise with the Leader the question of important promised legislation. This relates to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law. As Members will be aware, this was agreed under the Good Friday Agreement. I understand that Great Britain has completed the process but the process here has badly bogged down. I understand that the Attorney General who advises the Government in these matters wants to take the minimalist approach to the issue. In other words, he does not want the full incorporation of the convention in Irish law whereby a person who wishes to vindicate a human rights case could do so in the Irish courts rather than having to join the long queue for the court in Strasbourg. Will the Leader let me know the position in regard to this legislation as far as this House is concerned? Perhaps he will advise us as to the difficulties faced by those in Government who are on the side of the Attorney General who takes the minimalist view and those who want the maximalist application of the convention, including most people in this House.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning sought information regarding forthcoming legislation. I will let the House have the information possibly next Wednesday. We are initiating a Bill today, another Bill tomorrow and a further Bill next Wednesday. There are three new Bills before the House for consideration on the first three days of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Coghlan, Hayes, Ormonde, Coogan, Norris, Jackman, O'Meara, Bonner and Ross expressed their condemnation of those who murdered Martin <Col N="36" /> O'Hagan. I join the previous speakers in saying how shocked and horrified people were, North and South, at this brutal murder. The editor of the <i>Sunday World</i> who comes from Castlepollard and worked very closely with Martin over recent years wrote a very striking piece last Sunday. I listened attentively to Senators who are members of the journalistic fraternity. No cause justifies taking the life of a particular person. One's democratic right to freedom of speech must be observed. I hope these people are caught, brought to justice and pay the penalty for this crime. However, that will not be of much comfort to Martin's wife and three children.</P>
    <P>I wish to say to Senator Manning and other Senators who have called for a debate on Northern Ireland that I will consider the matter and discuss it with the leaders and Whips in the coming days. I have no difficulty with such a debate, but the timing will depend on the availability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will return to the leaders and Whips on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis, Ormonde and Ross called for statements and a debate on the future of the economy. Everyone at one time or other in the House since 1987 has spoken about the wonderful work done by all Governments in their handling of the economy and the fact that we were the envy of most countries in the western world. Everyone involved in the partnership process will now sit down in light of what happened in America on 11 September and address the challenges before us. While the figures are not what were anticipated, there is still an increase in percentage terms in profits and tax take on last year. Nobody could have envisaged the fall-out from 11 September, and I welcome Senator O'Toole's contribution. He is one of the most senior and experienced people available to Government, unions, workers and the nation, and he advocated working in partnership. The partnership approach since 1987 has been a successful formula and I hope and know that this approach will continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on tourism and I will leave time at the earliest opportunity within the coming ten days for such a debate. It seems to be the industry which will suffer most as a result of the atrocity on 11 September. This must be addressed as the industry is one of the three planks of income and success in terms of the Celtic tiger. I will return to the spokespersons and leaders on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Dardis expressed their views on No. 1. Senator Costello will agree that he and his party have a privileged position in the House given their numbers. He has been given courtesy and co-operation from me in relation to facilitating the contributions of him and his two colleagues, and that will always be the case as long as I am Leader.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on prison health care services and the associated report, and I will certainly allow time for that. Senator <Col N="37" /> Ormonde called for a debate on An Bord Pleanála, and I will also leave time for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a debate on waste management funds and the use to which they will be put. I will allow time for that.</P>
    <P>I will return to Senator Norris in relation to motion 27, No. 19, and will leave time for a debate. Senator Bonner also called for a debate on banking. There have been massive changes and I know many Senators will want to contribute to such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris, O'Meara, Costello and many others called for statements on Afghanistan and the difficulties in the USA. Before the Order of Business I was in touch with the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, providing everything stays as it is, the Minister will be present from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on this day two weeks to debate and discuss the difficulties. On behalf of the House, I offer congratulations to the Minister on the excellent way in which he is conducting our affairs and wish him and his officials well in the challenges posed in the chairmanship of the Security Council. It is wonderful and I know he has the good wishes of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on child care and special education needs, and I will certainly leave time for that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara called for a debate on the national development plan. The national development plan and finance can be debated together with the Minister for Finance present.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn, in uttering his displeasure once again, is expressing the views of Members on all sides of the House regarding passports for sale. Although I cannot confirm it totally, to my knowledge none has been issued and I know it is the wish of Members of both Dáil and Seanad that this should be the case.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senator Bonner regarding rural post offices and rural development to the Minister, my constituency colleague. His sentiments also reflect those on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I will try to ascertain the information Senator Brendan Ryan sought regarding the deadline of 7 December. I will try to find out the present position on the matter raised by Senator Connor.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, to the Seanad. The purpose of the Bill is to transfer certain powers and functions of the Minister for Public Enterprise to the Commission for Electricity Regulation to provide for the independent regulation of the natural gas sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In using the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, I mean that regulation of the sector is undertaken by a body that is unconnected with any of the operators in the sector. It is inappropriate that the Minister, as shareholder of Bord Gáis Éireann, should, at the same time, regulate the competitive gas market on a day to day basis. The Bill is designed to regularise this situation and represents the minimum set of provisions to establish independent regulation within the shortest possible timescale. As stated in its Title, the Bill is an interim measure. It is my intention that once these initial arrangements have been put in place, work will begin in my Department on a comprehensive review of the way in which the gas sector in Ireland is regulated.</P>
      <P>As with all the utility sectors, the gas sector in Europe is one that is now emerging from a situation in which national markets were dominated by State owned monopoly operators. The pace and manner of change in each sector in virtually all member states is dictated by rules set out in various EU directives. In the case of the gas sector, the relevant measure is Directive 98/30, which sets out the basic rules for initial market opening. It includes provisions dealing with access to networks and pipeline, unbundling of integrated gas undertakings and a liberalisation timetable. In regard to the last issue, from 2000 member states must open at least 20% of national gas markets to competition, with further incremental increases up to 33% taking effect by the year 2008.</P>
      <P>In Ireland this process was begun in 1995 through the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. That Act obliged Bord Gáis Éireann to offer access to its network to customers consuming 25 million standard cubic metres of gas per annum. The term normally used for this arrangement is third party access and it allows consumers to source their own gas from any supplier and arrange to have it delivered through the BGE network on non-discriminatory terms and at a fair price. The threshold of 25 million gives a level of market opening in Ireland which is the fifth highest in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main consumers benefiting from this are operators of gas-fired electricity generating stations and a number of large industrial users. <Col N="40" /> An analysis of the Irish market shows that these eligible customers are taking advantage of the arrangement and, over the past nine months, over half of the gas in the BGE network was transported on their behalf.</P>
    <P>When enacted, the Bill will open up the market further by reducing the annual rate of gas consumption whereby customers acquire third party access rights. Initially, the annual consumption threshold for eligible customers will drop from 25 million to two million standard cubic metres, resulting in the market opening rising from 75% to over 80%. It is my intention to achieve full market opening by 2005, in line with the timetable proposed for the electricity sector. Full market opening will include the domestic market and the proposals fully complement the latest liberalisation proposals from the European Commission. It is my intention to adopt an orderly phased approach to full market opening in 2005 by introducing at least one intermediate step before then. I will be discussing the timing of this with the Commission for Electricity Regulation immediately upon enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As with the electricity sector, the introduction of competition into the natural gas market has raised questions as to where responsibility for day to day regulation of the sector should lie. At present, the Minister is both market regulator and shareholder of BGE, and it has been argued that this dual role leads to an unavoidable conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The job being done by my Department in terms of the regulation of Ireland's gas sector is first class. The current arrangements in the Department provide a clear separation of responsibility between the regulatory and the shareholder functions. However, while every effort is taken to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise in practice, increasingly decisions need to be taken on a range of issues where the potential for conflict arises. These issues include pipeline consents and charges for third party access to the BGE network. It is because of the number and importance of such issues now arising that I am proposing that the transfer of functions to the CER should happen in the shortest possible timescale. For competition to flourish, the market, especially new and prospective entrants and investors, needs to be assured that regulation of the sector is based on the principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main developments taking place in the Irish natural gas sector. Gas demand is growing rapidly in Ireland, mirroring trends across Europe. It is now the fuel of choice in electricity generation and its share of the domestic and industrial energy markets is also increasing. This reflects a number of factors, including competitive gas prices, the relatively high conversion efficiency of gas and the fact that gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. <Col N="41" /> Market growth is set to continue and, in a report produced last December, the ESRI estimates that over 70% of Ireland's power generation will be fuelled by natural gas by 2010 and that demand for gas may grow by approximately 7% per annum over this decade.</P>
    <P>This scenario has a number of consequences. First, rising demand is driving increased investment in gas infrastructure. Second, gas has an important role to play in Ireland meeting its Kyoto targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A modern gas fired power station produces less than half as much carbon dioxide as an older coal fire station per unit of electricity generated. Gas stations also produce much lower emissions than oil stations. Hence a switch in electricity generation away from coal and oil towards gas can give rise to very large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>One of the major outcomes of the ESRI report on energy demand was the realisation that there was a very high likelihood of a supply capacity shortfall in the winter of 2001-03 if no further supply capacity was added to the system before then. An independent assessment of possible new supply options concluded that BGE's proposal for a second interconnector with Scotland was the only project capable of being completed within the required timeframe. On this basis the Government gave approval for BGE to proceed with its proposal. BGE is now doing that and, subject to the various necessary permissions being granted, is on schedule to have the interconnector completed in time for the winter of 2002. As part of its approval, the Government has required BGE to seek private sector investment in the project and I am awaiting proposals from the company on how it intends to progress this issue.</P>
    <P>Senators are no doubt aware that at the start of this year the Corrib partners indicated they were proposing to land gas from the Corrib field off the Mayo coast. I understand this is expected to come to market in the second half of 2003 and further pipeline construction work is to be undertaken by BGE to allow for the delivery of this gas to the national gas grid. In addition, BGE is proceeding with its proposals for the construction of a new pipeline between Dublin, Galway and Limerick that will bring gas to thousands of new customers. This pipeline will link with the existing Limerick-Cork-Dublin pipeline to create a national transmission ring and enhance the security of the national system.</P>
    <P>The completion of all these projects is, of course, subject to the company complying with the various statutory requirements and obtaining the necessary consents from the Minister. I will now provide an update of the progress of each of these projects.</P>
    <P>BGE has submitted an environmental impact statement for the second interconnector. I have engaged consultants to carry out a full appraisal <Col N="42" /> of that and can confirm that it meets with all statutory environmental requirements. The proposed pipeline will not significantly or adversely affect the environment in the long term. The public consultation process for the second interconnector application has also concluded and I am currently considering submissions received in this regard.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that an environmental impact statement for the gas pipeline to the west has been submitted and appraised by my consultants. It meets all statutory requirements and the pipeline will not have significant long-term environmental effects. I convened an oral hearing to inquire into BGE's application to construct this pipeline, and its associated applications for acquisition orders, on 24 September 2001. This hearing has concluded and I await the inspector's report and recommendations. My consultants have also concluded their evaluation of the EIS for the Mayo-Galway pipeline and have indicated that it too meets all statutory requirements. It will have no significant effect on the environment in the long term. The public consultation process in relation to this application commenced on 28 September 2001 and will conclude towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that early this year the Government decided, in principle, to extend the natural gas network to the north-west. In June my Department received a copy of a report commissioned by BGE on the route options for this network extension. The report made it clear that none of the options would be commercial in its own right and that some form of assistance would be required. Following further consideration of the issue, the Government has decided the preferred option is to proceed by extending the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline. Work is now beginning on a detailed economic evaluation of this preferred option. The Government's decision takes account of the benefits that will accrue from proposed developments in the natural gas infrastructure in Northern Ireland. The Government has also decided to support the development of cross-Border gas pipelines and I take this opportunity to explain the reasoning behind that to the House.</P>
    <P>BGE and Questar, an American pipeline company, have applied to the Northern Ireland regulator to build two pipelines. One, linking Belfast to Derry, would supply the planned new Coolkeeragh Power Station and the city of Derry. The other, comprising a South-North interconnector from Gormanston to Antrim, would tie into the proposed Belfast to Derry line. The Government's decision to make a £10 million grant available toward the development of the Northern Ireland gas network recognises the wider benefits associated with it. For example, the BGE-Questar Belfast to Derry pipeline and the provision of <Col N="43" /> gas to Derry would facilitate the provision of gas to Letterkenny. The development of a 400 MW power station at Coolkeeragh offers the prospect of further facilitating improved energy supplies to County Donegal. As a first step in moving forward with gas to the north-west, BGE will be asked to proceed with detailed engineering and planning for extending gas to Sligo from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry.</P>
    <P>With my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, I have pledged my commitment and support to working towards the development of an all-island energy market. The Government decision recognises that the development of cross-Border gas supply infrastructure is an essential ingredient in achieving this goal. In particular, the planned network developments in Northern Ireland and in the north-west will improve the overall level and quality of energy infrastructure on the island and enhance the prospect for market integration.</P>
    <P>Given the developments I have outlined today, I believe it is timely to provide for independent regulation of the gas sector to ensure investor confidence. This will also act as a catalyst in the development of a natural gas market. My proposal in the Bill is to adapt the role of the Commission for Electricity Regulation so that it encompasses responsibility for the regulation of the natural gas sector. This adaptation will include changing its name to the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main reasons for choosing the CER to carry out this task. There are similarities between the electricity and natural gas sectors that make the CER suited to the purpose. The electricity and natural gas industries, for example, are in direct competition with each other in the domestic market through the supply of alternative means for cooking and heating. The two markets are also becoming more closely associated in the UK where all the regional electricity companies have their own gas supply arms. A similar convergence is expected throughout Europe. There are also commonalities in regard to regulatory activities in these sectors such as price setting, the establishment of performance standards and monitoring quality of service.</P>
    <P>Given the growing demand for electricity and increasing dependency on natural gas by electricity generators, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient gas capacity to meet the demand of the electricity market. The commission's regulation of both markets will help to meet this objective and to provide a sound basis upon which Ireland's future energy requirements can be anticipated and met. That the CER is already established, functioning effectively as <Col N="44" /> regulator and liaising with regulators in Northern Ireland, Britain and the rest of Europe will assist in the speedy implementation of the proposed regulatory framework for the natural gas sector. The proposal to have one regulatory body also means that economies of scale can be availed of in regard to its administration. A further practical reason for choosing the CER as gas regulator is that the present legislative framework, established by the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, lends itself to the purposes at hand. The Schedule to the Act allows for the appointment to the commission of up to a further two members in addition to the present member.</P>
    <P>As is the case with the CER at present, the newly-named Commission for Energy Regulation is to be independent in the performance of its functions. The commission will, however, continue to be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding its accounts and to a joint committee of the Oireachtas in regard to the performance of its functions. The Bill's provisions have been designed to mirror to the greatest extent possible those set out in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, which established the CER in the first place. This will facilitate its implementation and will mean that the market will already be familiar with the principles behind the legislation.</P>
    <P>Some of the more important provisions in the Bill are as follows. Section 5 changes the name of the Commission for Electricity Regulation to the Commission for Energy Regulation to reflect its new functions. Sections 6 and 7 and the Schedule provide for the transfer of functions from the Minister to the CER as well as expanding the current duties of the CER in the light of its role regarding the natural gas sector. These duties include advising the Minister on the gas industry, promoting competition in gas supply and protecting the interest of final customers. The Schedule identifies a number of the Minister's functions that are to be transferred to the CER in relation to the construction of gas pipelines such as compulsory acquisition orders and the extinguishment of rights of way. Sections 8 and 9 amend the existing provisions in the Gas Act, 1976, dealing with pipeline consents. A new section is to be inserted into the 1976 Act so that BGE and all other prospective builders of pipelines will in future make their applications for consent to build pipelines under this one section.</P>
    <P>There is also a separate provision dealing with consent to the construction of so-called &lsquo;upstream' pipelines. These run from gas fields to on-shore terminals and require the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Section 10 provides that the commission may direct pipeline operators to publish a code of operations for their pipelines. This facilitates the inter-operability of the gas transmission network and pipelines owned by different operators. <Col N="45" /> Section 11 provides for the increased market opening by reducing the consumption threshold above which consumers can source their own gas supplies from any supplier. As mentioned earlier, it is my intention to introduce full market opening by 2005. The Bill will allow the Minister to reduce, by way of statutory instrument, the annual consumption threshold that defines the level of market opening.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for a new licensing framework for the supply of natural gas, the operation of distribution or transmission pipelines and the storage of natural gas. No such framework has existed until now.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires gas undertakings to keep separate accounts for their different gas activities such as supply or transmission and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts for other non-gas activities. This is to avoid discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the Minister may introduce public service obligations or PSOs on natural gas undertakings, for instance, with regard to security of supply, technical safety, or environmental protection. This section specifically excludes using PSOs for non-commercial extensions of the natural gas network.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill I am introducing to this House today will be a major step forward in the liberalisation of the natural gas market. I look forward very much to hearing the contributions of the Members of this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important legislation.</P>
      <P>I have some background data. Before the discovery of the Corrib gas field off the Achill coast, this Bill would have had very little relevance for people in the west and the north-west specifically because, as the Minister of State is aware, we had no natural gas in the area and did not expect to have it. As An Bord Gáis said on many occasions, it would not have found it economically viable to extend the network to the west and north-west.</P>
      <P>However, the discovery by Enterprise Energy Ireland of gas off the Achill coast has changed everything. It was a major breakthrough and an exciting development. Some time ago when this announcement was made, there was a public outcry in many parts of Mayo that the benefits would not extend fully to the county. In this House, in November I think, I tabled a motion which was answered by the present Minister. I referred to the need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to outline whether any consideration had been given to the question of providing spur lines from the main transmission lines of An Bord Gáis from Pollatomish in Mayo to Galway and the major towns in Mayo that were within a reasonable distance of the main line from the Corrib field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time, the Minister answered that it was <Col N="46" /> the responsibility of An Bord Gáis and that if it decided, in its wisdom, that such a spur line would be made, then it would be. In the meantime, the Government has decided to extend the pipeline to Ballina and to Sligo. I publicly thank the Minister and the Government for this courageous decision which was welcomed throughout County Mayo and the west in general. However, I advocate that the smaller towns be connected as well. In this game, we never stop making demands and we will continue to do so for these smaller towns. Nevertheless, the Government decision to extend the main transmission line into Ballina and on to Sligo was, as I said, a very welcome development. It will add immeasurably to economic progress in the region. Now that the Celtic tiger has developed some signs of dysentery, this will provide a much needed boost for the area. There was great anticipation of the prospects for the Corrib gas field and its implications for economic development in the region.</P>
    <P>We have reactionary forces within Mayo who would like to preserve the fauna and flora in the county as they were 1,000 years ago and would like to leave our natural resources under the sea where they have been for millions of years. However, wiser counsel has prevailed and I hope that it will continue to prevail, even though the final arbiter on the issue is An Bord Pleanála. We are awaiting its response to the appeal at the moment. Everything that is stated both in public Government policy and county council policy is dependent on the decision of An Bord Pleanála. I want An Bord Pleanála to expedite the decision and not sit on it for months and years. In some cases, it has been doing this. Bearing in mind that background information, I thank the Minister for responding to our call in the area to extend the pipeline to the regions that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Returning to the legislation, as the Minister of State said, it is a result of EU directive and part of the liberalisation process that has been taking place for the past few years. There are certain reservations about this liberalisation process, especially in rural Ireland where economic viability and the criteria that have to be put in place to further it do not always apply. When we have commercial operations involved in these types of enterprises, commercial viability is often the sole factor that determines what they do in many circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, we must proceed with liberalisation. I welcome the Bill, but it has some grey areas as it is currently framed. Maybe the Minister of State will clarify some of the issues.</P>
    <P>Section 6 states that it shall be the duty of the commission to promote the efficient use of both electrical and gas transmission systems. I do not think the commission is asked in any section to promote efficiency in its operations. That should be embodied in the legislation. Energy efficiency will be a very important issue in the coming years, <Col N="47" /> and there is not enough emphasis on its promotion in section 6.</P>
    <P>The use of language in section 6(e) is ambiguous. The commission for energy regulation, on the one hand, is promoting the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity and, on the other, it is responsible for securing the continuity and quality of supplies of electricity. It should concentrate on both at once and not differentiate between promoting and securing the supplies.</P>
    <P>Also, section 8(1)(a) requires clarification. It states:</P>
    <P>The Board shall, in relation to customers other than persons of the type mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 10A of this Act, develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas to such customers being a system which is both economical and efficient and which appears to the Board to be requisite for the time being.</P>
    <P>We need some clarification of what is meant by &ldquo;requisite for the time being&rdquo; and what will occur at a later stage. The Minister referred to that in his speech but it does not clarify this section sufficiently in terms of what will happen in 2005 or later. Clarification is needed in many areas and I am sure the Minister will examine seriously any amendments to this effect tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is ambiguity in section 8 about the owner of a pipeline. It should be made clearer in the Bill whether only an owner can operate and maintain his or her own pipeline or whether he or she can decide who he or she wishes to operate and maintain his or her pipeline. There is need for clarification in that section. The Commission for Energy Regulation should have a statutory input in determining some of these issues.</P>
    <P>Some parts of section 8 should be rewritten to clarify what input the CER can take on board, especially where those whose facilities are gas turbines and other such power stations are concerned, how they will be subject to gas quality criteria, how the quality will be determined and what role the CER will have in determining gas quality.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with pipelines and, in the context of the promotion of competition in the sector, how construction and tender guidelines will be determined. There have been instances of Bord Gáis and its contractors creating a great deal of undue mess throughout the country when laying pipelines. Bord Gáis should be subject to stricter controls in this regard and these should be included in the legislation. There are instances of streets in towns being dug up without the best guidelines being adhered to. Given the traffic congestion in major towns, this is an issue which must be examined because further inconvenience <Col N="48" /> for the public cannot be caused by pipe-laying companies making undue demands in this area. More clarification is needed in section 9 in terms of pipelines if competition is to be promoted in this area.</P>
    <P>There is some ambiguity in section 10 as to how the code of operations will work. Clarification is needed on whether the section applies to the Bord Gáis Éireann code of operations. That is not clear. Clarification is also needed in section 11 so that we know whether Bord Gáis will be regarded as a pipeline operator for the purposes of the Bill. It is not clear what the CER's powers will be to ensure equitable treatment of all pipeline constructors and operators. There is a need for some clarification in this area. There is also need for clarification on whether there is a mechanism to regulate monopoly use of independent pipelines.</P>
    <P>There is ambiguity in the legislation regarding natural gas licences where licences for storage are concerned. It is understood that a storage project will need the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the CER. There would need to be some mechanism to resolve any conflict which could arise between those groups. Perhaps there could be a licensing operation or activity for which the CER could be given responsibility.</P>
    <P>Clarification is needed on those issues and amendments will be tabled on them on Committee Stage. I am sure there will be others I have overlooked in my preliminary reading of the Bill. We will go into greater detail later. I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make orders providing for the method of calculation and collection of the levy and the establishment of a fund to be used for the collection and disbursement of payments. The section specifically excludes the imposition of a public service obligation for the purpose of extending the natural gas network to new areas of supply on a non-commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this issue in his speech and said that the public service obligation will not apply to non-commercial operations. That exclusion could seriously disadvantage rural Ireland, especially areas of sparse population because it does not allow for any public service obligation for these areas. If we in the region I referred to previously were to seek extensions to the transmission line when the commission is in place, we would not qualify on simple commercial criteria. That is an area that needs attention in the liberalisation process and is a cause of widespread concern in many rural areas, especially in areas that are becoming depopulated due to the decline <Col N="49" /> in mainstream farming and the movement of people to major cities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and for his commitment to extend the pipeline to Ballina and Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the fact that the Minister has initiated it in the Seanad. This is one of three Bills relating to the gas market that the Minister has brought forward over the past two years. Despite misconceptions, the Minister has been busy over that short period. It is a great honour for this House to initiate a Bill of such importance and I concur with Senator Caffrey that the Bill has serious implications for the global and national scene as well as for isolated communities.</P>
      <P>There is an inevitable conflict between what one has to do to anticipate and work consistently with the general thrust of the marketplace, where markets are moving and the global village is fast becoming a reality, and the needs of isolated communities. There are many tensions, as Senator Caffrey has forcefully articulated. While I would not be as <i>au fait</i> with these issues as the Senator, I know that they are a reality and that the Minister will take such serious concerns on board as the process moves forward.</P>
      <P>This is one of three Bills relating to the liberalisation of the gas market and liberalisation of the energy market generally. The first Bill which the Minister kindly initiated in the House, the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [Seanad] was the first Bill the Minister published in this area. That Bill, which subsequently became an Act, repealed section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976. As we know, the Gas Act, 1976, was anti-competitive and incompatible with the competition requirements of the Energy Charter Treaty. It was also deemed to be in conflict with the competition rules of the EU.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us will, when implemented, accelerate the liberalisation of the gas market, resulting in more than 80% of the market being subjected to the rules of competition. It is important that this proceeds because today's energy markets are opening up and gas is forming an increasingly vital component of our overall energy needs. It is extremely important that we manage this sector in the most professional manner and that we cope with the current dramatic growth as this will have a major bearing on our future prosperity and development. Proper management, accountability and regulation are of vital importance at this early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken with the two previous Bills brought in by the Minister in recent years, this third Bill marks a further step in the Government's commitment to fully open up the gas market by 2005 at the latest. The Minister has made important strategic choices. This deserves emphasis because there are disillusioned people who might not agree. I agree and I have heard nothing from my <Col N="50" /> colleague, Senator Caffrey, to suggest that he does not concur also.</P>
    <P>Strategic choices have been made concerning the future of our most important energy source. Gas is Ireland's most important fuel and our major indigenous energy source. That is recognised in this Bill. The appropriate planning and implementation are being carried forward and this additional legislation is part of that process. The Corrib find off the west coast, referred to by Senator Caffrey, will augment the diminishing Kinsale Head field. The necessary infrastructure for nationwide transmission is being rapidly planned and put in place.</P>
    <P>It was not long ago that some of our media-based economic gurus berated the Minister and his Department for alleged prevarication. One guru went so far as to state &ndash; he should have known better &ndash; that the Minister and his Department did not have a clue what the future would hold and they were therefore unable to agree what to do in the present. This was a dangerous statement for a so-called expert to make. This Bill and the many decisions and plans that have preceded it and which will succeed it give the unambiguous and unequivocal lie to these frenzied and unfounded allegations. Of course, those allegations are not the only recent example when elements within the media have gone over the top in their unseemly search for a Minister's head. Indeed, in the case I am referring to, it was the head of the Minister, Deputy Jacob, they were looking for. I am certain the Minister will demonstrate the folly of their frenzy in his own inimitable way and in his own good time. Today marks a significant step towards putting that to bed.</P>
    <P>Over the past two decades, gas has rapidly become the fuel of choice for electricity generation and as a fuel for home consumption. One of the undoubted consequences of the discovery of natural gas in Ireland is the way in which it has transformed the way we live and work. Low-carbon natural gas has clear environmental benefits due to its low emissions. Bord Gáis's state-of-the-art transmission network transports gas at high pressures, reaching customers instantly and safely. Both of these characteristics &ndash; instant and safe delivery &ndash; are vital. That cannot be over-stressed.</P>
    <P>From my experience and that of constituents and businesses, I know that the back-up service in terms of expertise, assessment, analysis and reappraisal is of the highest professional standard. Nearly all new housing developments in Ireland as in Europe opt for gas. It is the norm. As far back as 1994 &ndash; we have progressed a long way since then &ndash; 42% of gas went to the ESB for power generation. Ireland has five gas-fired generating stations using advanced thermal technology. In the same year, natural gas contributed 26% of the fuel required for electricity generation. Some 23% was sold to NET and 24% to other industrial and commercial customers. Some 90% of industry with access to the natural gas transmission grid switched to natural gas. Many <Col N="51" /> other sectors have also tapped into the grid such as the hotel and catering industry, hospitals and leisure centres.</P>
    <P>The title of the Bill before the House refers to &ldquo;interim&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulation.&rdquo;  Where we have a market with demand increasing significantly each year &ndash; we have been told by the experts that demand is increasing by about 7.5% annually &ndash; and liberalisation is opening up that market to competition, strong, independent, accountable regulation is very important. We need a stable regulatory regime for the future development of this increasingly economically-vital sector.</P>
    <P>The introduction of competition to the natural gas market raises questions as to where responsibility for the day-to-day regulation of the sector should lie. The Minister's roles are that of shareholder in Bord Gáis Éireann and regulator of the sector. It is also the Minister's responsibility to devise policy for the gas sector. With the opening up of the market, the Minister will be increasingly required to take decisions, such as granting consent for the construction of pipelines, where the potential for conflict exists between the Minister's roles as shareholder and regulator. Members are aware of the current arrangements that exist within the Department of Public Enterprise to separate responsibilities between regulatory and shareholder functions. However, the frequency and importance of such issues now arising warrants the establishment of an independent regulatory body as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation established under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 has shown what can be done for the electricity sector. It has provided for a regulatory framework to oversee and manage competition in that sector. The commission focuses on the interests of final customers and ensures non-discrimination between electricity undertakings. It promotes competition, ensures that all reasonable demands for electricity are met, promotes safety, efficiency and economy by electricity undertakings and takes serious account of protection of the environment. It promotes also the increased use of renewable, sustainable and alternative energy sources. It is given the power to license the generation and supply of electricity and to authorise the construction of electricity generating stations.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill the Minister has brought before us today is to transfer certain powers and functions from the Minister to the Commission for Electricity Regulation and rename the commission as the Commission for Energy Regulation. This commission will provide for the independent regulation of the natural gas sector. While provisions in the Bill are only of an interim nature, and the Minister has stated that quite clearly, and represent the minimum base requirements for regulation in the gas market at the earliest possible date, nevertheless, they are very important because the commission will have responsibility &ndash; despite the limitations of the <Col N="52" /> interim measures which are being brought in &ndash; for regulating access to the natural gas transmission network. The commission will give consent to the construction of pipelines and will licence natural gas undertakings.</P>
    <P>I am aware that prior to the publication of the Bill, fears were expressed about the proposal that the electricity regulator would also be the gas regulator. One expert put forward some strong views. The point was made that since most of the growth in the gas business would come from electricity generation, as new power stations are built the plan might increase the danger of what he referred to as regulatory capture where the regulator becomes more a defender of the industry than of the customers. Having looked at this view in the context of the Bill, it appears to be theoretical postulation and certainly does not stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is correct in extending the role of the present commission to include the energy sector generally, that is, gas, electricity and the renewables. Under the Bill the expertise of the existing commission is utilised to ensure that both the electricity and gas sectors are independently regulated, not only effectively but in a consistent manner. It is very wise, and I believe the Minister is extremely wise in taking advantage of the experience, the expertise and the strengths that the commission has already acquired since its establishment. It has had the opportunity to develop and deliver effective regulation, which is to the benefit of both market players and consumers alike. One regulator, in my view, and in the view of many others that I have heard, is a good way of ensuring competition and fair pricing between supplier and customer.</P>
    <P>The opening up of competition was to deliberately bring about a reduction in prices, inevitably a development that will be welcomed by domestic, industrial and commercial consumers. After all, competition is a very healthy thing. Even in our youth we heard that competition is the life of trade. It is especially healthy for the consumer. We know and have experienced it from the many other fields of semi-State and private sector activities that this is so. I am satisfied that Bord Gáis Éireann is very well placed to take on the opening up of competition and the associated market forces. As one of Europe's youngest natural gas companies, its short history of over 20 years has been marked by ever growing success. Perhaps it could be said that its youthfulness is proving to be one of its greatest assets. The birth of the company came about as a result of two contemporaneous developments &ndash; there was the energy crisis of the early 1970s, particularly 1973, and the discovery of deposits of natural gas which were declared to be commercially exploitable around the same time. Those of us who went through it and had cars &ndash; or bangers of some description &ndash; will recall that it was a time of tremendous volatility in the energy market. The advent of natural gas was a welcome relief in <Col N="53" /> reducing our exposure during a time of great uncertainties in that market, particularly in relation to oil supplies. Mile long queues outside petrol service stations were a common feature, not alone in cities and towns but in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The absence of a natural gas industry which would absorb sufficient quantities to justify the huge capital investment in it was a major obstacle. There was no natural gas industry. The decision by the then Minister &ndash; I believe it was a Fine Gael Minister in 1974 &ndash; to allocate a significant amount of gas to the new plant, Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta, and for additional ESB generating capacity must be applauded. It justified the launch of an industry which has been a growing success ever since. Bord Gáis Éireann was established two years later in 1976 and it took over responsibility for gas purchasing arrangements with Marathon. These two decisions taken by that Government have stood the test of time. They have proved to be wise and forward thinking, even though they did arise, in a sense, out of a crisis. Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention.</P>
    <P>The natural gas grid has developed rapidly over the past 18 years or so. At first gas was piped from the Kinsale Head gas field, which was located about 50 kilometres offshore to Cork city. The 240 kilometre line to Dublin was built in 1982 and represented a mammoth advance. It took in a number of towns <i>en route,</i> including Limerick, my own native place, and the mid-west. The expansion of the grid has continued to other parts in the north-east, north central areas and the midlands. Many other areas must be reached as the momentum must be maintained until all towns have equal access to this environmentally friendly, clean and efficient energy source.</P>
    <P>I concur fully with Senator Caffrey that no isolated rural communities must be excluded. Given the movement of populations and the denudation of certain rural communities, there is a risk factor there. I know the Minister will take that fully on board when he responds and, if he wishes, I will share with him my experience of growing up in an isolated country area. It can very often be the case that rural communities are forgotten and if that were to happen it would be a most unfortunate fall-out from what is a spectacular development of a national gas grid.</P>
    <P>The most spectacular development of all in the expansion of the grid was undoubtedly the construction of the natural gas interconnector from north County Dublin to Scotland. It was heralded as a landmark project for late 20th century Ireland, the benefits of which will be felt for many decades to come. Apart from that, it is a magnificent inheritance to pass on to the generations that succeed us. There were a number of compelling reasons the company and the Government of the day sought the construction of a sub-sea pipeline as a necessity. With our energy needs doubling over the past 20 years and a consistently increasing demand in all market sectors, additional pressure was being put on existing resources. <Col N="54" /> There was certainly a realisation that the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton reserves would be exhausted for commercial purposes by the year 2003 and this, no doubt, helped to concentrate minds at the time. The task force of Government officials and board members established to examine the feasibility of an interconnector realised how vulnerable our gas market was as it depended on a single source of supply. If further indigenous supplies were found off the coast, surplus quantities could be exported via the interconnector. The interconnector will eventually be linked to the European grid and to the world grid.</P>
    <P>The construction of the pipeline ensures Ireland is assured of natural gas supplies for the next 50 to 60 years and the project is no doubt an economically and environmentally sound investment in the future. One of the most impressive features of the construction of the interconnector and, to a great extent, the national grid is the absence of a negative environmental impact on the preservation of heritage, flora and fauna and, indeed, their reinstatement where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Caffrey have referred in detail to recent developments. I am very heartened by the manner in which a decision has been taken by the Minister and approved by the Government to build a second interconnector. There were one or two gurus who berated the Minister. He consulted widely, and for such a major project it was vital that he did so. He got independent assessment of feasibility studies and, arising from that, he sought the approval of Government for his decision to commence the second interconnector. It was a very wise decision and work is currently proceeding on it. Another decision was to proceed with a ring main that would link Dublin, Galway and Limerick, which would be created by linking up with the Dublin-Cork-Limerick line. That is a very significant development and is very commendable. I commend the Minister for proceeding with that.</P>
    <P>The third one is the huge demand for the availability of such a national vital resource in the north-west and decisions have been taken there also. That has been done in the case of Sligo, as mentioned by Senator Caffrey and the Minister of State. The link up there will be with the Galway-Mayo line. In the case of Donegal, following extensive consultations by the Government and having obtained an independent assessment, the Government rightly came down on the side of providing a grant of £2 million to the northern authorities for the development of the pipeline there which would have a cross-Border interconnector. The Minister has expounded on the benefit of that. There is no doubt that apart from providing a pipeline from Derry to Letterkenny, there are much wider implications. Once the Derry-Letterkenny line is linked up there is an all-Ireland grid and, therefore, one is creating an all-Ireland market. The creation of an all-Ireland market promotes the potential for competition which in turn promotes a reduction in prices.</P>
    <P>Many important strategic decisions have been <Col N="55" /> taken by the Minister of State and his Department. Instead of not knowing where they are going, I am convinced the Minister of State clearly knows where he is going and has planned accordingly. I regard the Bill as a milestone on the road to eventually arriving at full liberalisation of the market by 2005 at the latest and ensuring that Ireland's gas supplies will be available to future generations. He will pass on an inheritance for which he will be lauded. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill and thank him for introducing it in the Seanad. I congratulate the Minister of State on his grasp of the intricacies of the Bill and on his well thought out concepts. As Senator Fitzgerald said, the Minister of State clearly knows where he is going.</P>
      <P>When I repeated myself too often my children used to say I sounded like a broken gramophone record. I am in danger of repeating myself because I have a fundamental problem with the Bill, as with similar Bills in the past. I made the point before and I will make it again because it remains as valid as ever that the only reason to hive off the regulation of utility sectors from Departments is that the State itself is an operator in the particular market concerned. We have heard this from Senators Caffrey and Fitzgerald. A much better strategy would be for the State to divest itself of the ownership while holding on to the regulatory powers. In the fullness of time I expect that eventually the State will completely divest itself of ownership of all those State enterprises. That seems to be the Government's thinking and, broadly speaking, I am in favour of that. It is a trend on which the Government should be congratulated.</P>
      <P>What will happen then is that we will be left with a situation in which the Government has neither ownership nor regulatory control. If that happens it may not be in the national interest because there is much more to the regulation of utilities than simply striking a fair deal between competitive forces in the marketplace. I am a great champion of competition and of allowing market forces to have their full play, but not even I would argue that market forces will always act in the broader national interest. It would be foolish to expect them to do so. That is not their job but the job of the Government. Let me give an example from the telecommunications sector. I am sure the Minister would be the first to agree it is very much in the national interest to extend broadband capability, and inexpensive access to it, to the whole country as soon as possible. It has become clear that it is not in the immediate interest of any one telecommunications company to do that however much it might be in their collective long-term interest. Commercial companies, especially public companies, tend to be driven by short-term considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has lost all the leverage it <Col N="56" /> once had. It does not own the telecommunications company any more. The days when the Minister could simply order Eircom to do her bidding have long gone. Neither has the Minister the powers, through regulation, to impose investment in broadband as a condition on telecommunications companies operating in the marketplace because the regulatory powers have been hived off to an independent regulator. However, the powers of the regulator are much less limited than those the Minister once exercised. It is not part of the remit of the regulator to run the industry in the national interest. That is not part of the regulator's duties nor would it be right to devolve such a power.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for deciding what is in the national interest is and should remain strictly a responsibility for Government. That is a responsibility from which the Government seems to have abdicated over the past four years. I sometimes wonder if it realises what it is actually doing. Let us assume that it is desirable to hive off gas regulation in this way. It is extraordinary that at this late stage we should be legislating for what is, on its own declaration, an interim arrangement. It is not part of the Bill but the Minister of State referred to it as an interim arrangement. The telecommunications regulator has been in place for about five years and the legislation setting up regulation in the electricity sector was passed in 1999. The European directive relevant to the Bill dates back to June 1998. Yet in the dying days of 2001, the best we can offer is a stop-gap arrangement.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Government has had more than enough time to make up its mind and to do all the necessary consultation about a definitive permanent mechanism for regulating the gas industry. There is definitely a case to answer about this delay. The declared objective of the Bill is to facilitate the development of competition in the supply of gas to customers. Are the Bill's provisions adequate to achieve this purpose? I honestly do not know. In looking over the provisions I see no sign that lessons have been learned from what has happened in the telecommunications sector. Whether it is telecommunications, electricity or gas, the background scenario remains the same. We are going through a process of dismantling what was once a State monopoly and at the same time we are divesting ourselves of State ownership in the sector either partly or completely. What was previously the State monopoly has to live with competitors in its own marketplace. One of the main tasks of the regulator is to hold the ring between the various parties.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that our legislative framework for regulation fully recognises the marketplace reality. That reality is that you can end the monopoly with the stroke of a pen but the former monopoly will, by definition, enter the competitive arena as the dominant player, as we saw in Eircom. The monopoly has been yielded. There was no choice but that. We have seen many signs that the former monopolies are not slow to hang <Col N="57" /> on to the privileges of the dominant position they once had. Many would argue that in Eircom they consistently abuse their dominant position. I am sorry for taking the example of Eircom, but it is a perfect example.</P>
    <P>In Eircom what happened to the unbundling of the local loop, a critical issue in properly opening up the sector to marketplace competition? The answer is that Eircom is still hanging on to what it holds, like a mad dog with a rag in its mouth. The powers of the regulator are not sufficient to stop Eircom abusing its dominant position in that way. As a result the process of making that sector genuinely competitive has been delayed again and again. That is definitely not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Have difficulties of this kind been taken into account in drawing up this much delayed legislation? I would like to believe they have, but one reason which leads me to doubt that is the case is that at the Oireachtas inquiry into the mini-CTC signalling project, a top management witness from the Department of Public Enterprise claimed that there was nothing wrong with the early warning system despite the fact that it had blatantly failed to give any early warning. I fervently hope and trust that such thinking has not been extended to this legislation.</P>
    <P>If I have learnt anything from my years in business, it is the importance of learning from your own mistakes. Is our system of regulation as faulty as that early warning system which failed to deliver any early warning? Have the difficulties which have arisen in the regulation of other utility sectors been taken into account in formulating the regulatory scheme for the gas industry set out in this Bill? I look forward to hearing the Minister's reassurances on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim buíochas leis as ucht teacht anseo chun an Bille tábhachtach seo a phlé. It is fair to say that during his few years in the Department the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has brought quite a few innovative Bills to the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I hope it will open up the market and generate competition within the industry. The thrust of much of our legislation, which I presume mirrors what is happening in the EU, is that fair and keen competition is the best regulator in any sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill transfers the powers of the Minister for Public Enterprise to a commission for energy regulation. I thought Senator Quinn made an interesting point which had crossed my mind, that is, whether divesting the State of the shareholding and retaining the power to regulate the industry would be a preferred route to take. Having thought about it, given the current state of play in the industry where Bord Gáis has a very significant monopoly, if there is anything worse than a public monopoly it must be a private sector monopoly. It is one of the concerns regarding the telecommunications sector which I would share. While it is not relevant to the debate on this Bill, <Col N="58" /> perhaps it might be useful for the Minister to look at the legislation underpinning the telecommunications regulator to ensure that in the new scenario in which we find ourselves, where such a large player is in private ownership, there are sufficient powers to guarantee absolutely, protect and safeguard the interests of the State and of business generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves to be complimented for ensuring in this Bill that the provisions required to regulate the gas industry should be introduced within the shortest possible timescale. That is a worthwhile provision and I commend the Minister on including it.</P>
    <P>I note that an in-depth re-examination of the gas industry is due to be undertaken shortly. This will result in a much more comprehensive approach to the industry. In his speech the Minister identified the reasons for the transfer of regulation and I noted that part of the regulator's function will be to advise the Minister on the gas industry in general and, in particular, on the promotion of competition in the supply of natural gas.</P>
    <P>It is evident that inefficiencies are generated in many industries or public utilities where there is a monopoly and therefore it is important that real and effective competition is introduced to this industry as soon as possible. The electricity sector has been liberalised already. There is a view that while the legislation and the regulatory mechanism may be put in place, the objective we are setting out to achieve is not likely to be attained unless the Government succeeds in getting players into the market &ndash; that does not appear to be happening in the case of the electricity sector as quickly as one would have liked. While the framework is being put in place in these sectors, ongoing monitoring will be required to ensure that the primary objective is achieved. Consumer protection forms part of the regulator's responsibilities and it is obviously in the interests of the consumer that there is real and effective competition as soon as possible. By their nature, commercially focused and driven companies try to protect their privileged position within the market and therefore it is incumbent on the State, and in this instance the regulator as the instrument of the State, to ensure that anything done in that area complies fully with the best practices under competition regulations.</P>
    <P>I note that the construction of the gas pipelines will also be the function of the regulator, who will have power to compulsorily acquire lands. It is interesting to note that there is a debate in that regard in connection with the National Roads Authority, which is in some difficulty regarding the acquisition of land. When we set up bodies such as this, it is important that while they are given powers they do not lose sight of the need for sensitivity, which is necessary to achieve some of their stated objectives. That presupposes that they would be able to undertake the necessary consultations and negotiations to satisfy the public's concerns. Often the approach one takes is as <Col N="59" /> important as the offer one is making. In this regard, it is important that people with the skills necessary to achieve that are included on the staff of the office of the regulator concerned.</P>
    <P>I note that Bord Gáis will continue to supply medium and small enterprises and also commercial and domestic users, but that third parties will have access to the pipeline. Similarly we have heard a great deal about access to the telecommunications lines in the past. We should learn from experience in that area to ensure that the aims and objectives of the Bill are met so that people who want to compete in the sector are not thwarted in any way.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his decision to invest in the Belfast to Derry gas pipeline. It was an enlightened move to provide £10 million for that project and to look to the future in that Letterkenny and Donegal may well be beneficiaries of it. Apart from that aspect of it, I welcome an all-Ireland approach in the new political climate which prevails, North and South, despite all the difficulties. In the interests not only of the peace process but of business generally, it behoves us to take an all-Ireland approach at every opportunity. That seemed like a very good innovative idea. As there is a very significant operator in the North, perhaps it also opens up the opportunity of introducing competition to the industry on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn stated that the Minister, in transferring the powers to a regulator, has in some way lost the powers forever. When the State inevitably privatises or sells Bord Gáis, which is generally the thrust of public policy, I cannot see why if it is deemed desirable at that stage the powers of the regulator cannot again be assumed by an arm of the State through the Department. In the interim the regulator will be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General. In this regard one must applaud that office for its scrutiny and policing of many instruments of the State through its annual reports. In an independent and impartial way it is very frank in its assessment of faults and failings. This has assisted the Houses of the Oireachtas in deliberating and making recommendations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the State will be able to provide natural gas. This is a primary fuel which is used throughout the country and I hope it will ultimately be used in the 32 counties. I am sure the Minister of State will forgive me for being a little parochial. He has given us some advice in Wexford as to what we might do. All our neighbouring counties have natural gas. Wexford should have this facility given that it exists in Waterford, Kilkenny and Wicklow. Given all the economic indicators, Wexford fares very badly. Unemployment figures there are the third highest in the country, it has an exceptionally low industrial base, the highest or second highest percentage of early school leavers and the second lowest <i>per capita</i> income. The need for <Col N="60" /> gas to enhance the attractiveness of Wexford as a location for industry and give it an economic injection is absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>There was an argument in the past that the use of natural gas to generate electricity is not the best use of what is a natural resource, that is, the use of one fuel to generate another. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider including this aspect in the regulator's brief. Obviously there is a finite supply of natural gas and it would be a pity if our generation or the next generation consumed what could exist for many generations in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to popular mythology, my party does not have and never had a problem with competition <i>per se.</i> Most of us were elected here in competitive elections and work in trade unions where every position is competed for. Many of our supporters and members work in industries which must be and have been competitive. One of the forces for profound modernisation in the economy has been the trade union movement. It has been a leader in identifying the need for innovation and change and has led its own members. No part of the labour movement has a problem with competition. What I have always had a problem with &ndash; this is the engineer in me &ndash; is any position which is adopted either because it is fashionable, appeals to the fashionable ideology of the time or perhaps because it can be used to transfer the heat from those who are physically accountable to bodies which are at best somewhat murky and at worst profoundly untransparent and which lack accountability.</P>
      <P>Bringing a regulator before an Oireachtas committee once every two years does not create accountability. People in this House who are members of local authorities are well aware of how difficult it is to make county or city managers accountable, even if there is a meeting each week, because of the degree to which they can use various procedural methods to delay the supply of or withhold information and use a sleight of hand to achieve things without getting the clear views of members of local authorities. When great swathes of power are transferred to a regulator in the nominal interest of fairness and competition one must first look at each experience of that and then look at whether it is achieving the objectives we wish it to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about a fascinating, extremely important and potentially very damaging example, that is, whether setting up vigorous competition in some areas of national economic activity will in the longer term serve the national interest. He mentioned telecommunications, in particular, broadband and so on. For a country which has attracted such a huge proportion of mobile international investment in the area of information technology and related issues, we are far down the international league table in terms of the provision of the infrastructure which should go with that. There are regions of the country to which IDA Ireland cannot attempt to <Col N="61" /> attract many kinds of industry because the electricity infrastructure is limited. I have not seen a scrap of evidence to suggest that increased competition in the electricity market will make that one bit more likely. Quite the opposite will be the case because there will be pressure on people to meet short-term objectives.</P>
    <P>No one is talking about wasting money but the problem with the prioritisation of shareholder interests over everything else, which is the legal obligation of a plc., is that it is by definition short-term. There is no room in that sort of vigorous market position for any sense of medium or long-term interests. It is obvious watching the movement of the stock markets in the United States, in particular, that notwithstanding the huge patriotic sentiment which is now manifest there, people involved in the buying and selling of shares in the US stock market are putting the interests of shareholders firmly ahead of the interests of the United States economy and society. Whether this should be the case and how to deal with the issue is another day's work. The truth is that it is often the case in general that shareholder interests and national interests do not coincide.</P>
    <P>If one reads modern or even less modern economic textbooks &ndash; I read them mostly for their entertainment value and because they are fascinating in their blind spots about humanity &ndash; one will see they are resistant to the idea that there should be ethical obligations, for instance, or any kind of national interest obligations. Perhaps if one is to run in the areas of a competitive market one cannot expect this. One cannot, therefore, expect the competitive market to meet national interests which is why we are slipping behind in the area of broadband provision.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic to put all the blame for that on Eircom, even though some of it must rest with that company. It rests with Eircom's need to maximise profitability in the short-term, if for nothing else then to entice people to buy it so the poor misfortunate directors could get it off their hands, which seems to have been the number one objective of the board of directors of Eircom virtually since the day it was privatised. In each case we must examine what has happened and see if at every level it is reconcilable with or optimising the national interest.</P>
    <P>Another issue, leaving out the national interest, is whether competition is, in the words of Senator Walsh, the best way to provide for consumers. That theory or conviction comes not from a model of competition but from the model of perfect competition talked about in economic textbooks. I am grateful to John Kenneth Galbraith for pointing out in one of his earlier writings that perfect competition means the departure of any one player from the market should not affect the market and that it is only then one has perfect competition. If there is a duopoly, or even three companies, in the gas, electricity or telecoms market one does not have anything near perfect competition but a regime in which, <i>de facto,</i> people <Col N="62" /> do not get too close to each other in terms of vigorous competition &ndash; I am not talking about people sitting huddled in a corner conspiring to prevent things being provided to the consumer. The problem for the regulator is that each will assert that the levels of charges or quality of consumer service is the minimum they can do in order to provide the service. We saw this being done very successfully in recent years when the banks persuaded the Director of Consumer Affairs that if she did not agree at a very minimum to the extraordinarily exorbitant rates they charged since the introduction of the euro for currency exchange between the IR£ and euro currencies they would not be able to provide currency exchange facilities. In other words she was persuaded by the effective duopoly, or oligopoly as they call it though there are really only four or five major players in banking, that if she did not agree to their levels of charges there would be no currency exchange available other than in large branches in a few big cities. It took the intervention of the European Commission, which raided the various banks, to draw a different conclusion, namely, that they were effectively ripping off Irish consumers, and in the past few months they have dramatically dropped and in some cases eliminated those charges. Because of their position in the Irish market, and the fact they are too big, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the effective regulator, was not in a position to enforce what was in the best interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>This issue arises in terms of regulation in general. In a host of areas the reliance is on the belief that competition of itself is the best thing. Where there is sufficient competition which is real and vigorous, then the major beneficiary is the consumer, and the only caveat I would ever enter is that competition should not be based on exploitation of labour. In other words, there must be proper labour law to protect individual workers from exploitative practices by employers in the interests of competition. That said, competition can be a good thing. The trouble is that there are doubtful practices even where there is a genuine, functioning and close to perfect market with multiple service providers in competition with each other on a continuous basis. There is hardly a small town in Ireland in which one will find any variation in the basic price of alcoholic drink in the pubs. It is one of these wonderfully remarkable Irish coincidences that every pub in a given town charges effectively the same price. This is true throughout the country and nobody has ever managed to prove there was a conspiracy. Individual publicans will say they cannot reduce prices because the Licensed Vintners' Association or whatever the organisation is in country areas would be down their neck. It is not that all publicans pick up the telephone and agree to fix a price, but they know the agreed rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" />To a degree business is a conspiracy against the consumer, and unless there is real, vigorous and actual competition that is how it will remain. We now have a glorious example. The experiment of having a Director of Telecommunications Regulation has been an unmitigated disaster and I have often said she should resign and that if she does not then the legislation should be rewritten. The reason I say this is that the office believes that encouraging competition between the service providers, be it in telecommunications or cable television, is the best way to protect the consumer. That means they provide the minimum services and do not provoke her wrath. In return for that minimum service extraordinarily high charges are allowed. NTL will get a 33% increase, which is quite extraordinary. Imagine if these cable operators were directly accountable to a Minister, and the Minister announced that one of them was going to introduce an increase of 33% in their basic rate of service provision. We can imagine the uproar there would be in the Dáil. The Minister would be hauled before an Oireachtas committee and would have to go through it in fine and precise detail.</P>
    <P>From endless and frustrating correspondence with the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation I know the director has no interest in dealing with the misuse of consumers by these quasi monopolies, which is what they are in their areas of operation. They are monopolies and are allowed abuse and presume on their consumers. The city in which I live is a classic example. It has the highest charges in the country for cable television and the company is looking for a 35% increase for an abysmal service which is poor in quality and choice, unreliable and mostly unavailable when anything goes wrong. The horrendous idea that the company might become a major player in the telecommunications industry is the sort of nightmare that would keep anybody worried about our economic prospects awake at night. That is why I have a problem with this silly emphasis on detached regulation without political accountability where there is no real vigorous competition in the market. One ends up with the worst of both worlds, namely, quasi monopolies which can bluff the regulator, such as the Director of Consumer Affairs in the context of banks. The regulator either ends up giving in to them, or in the case of the air transport regulator, making decisions which superficially seem manifestly daft, as was the idea that the major airports in Ireland do not need massive investment.</P>
    <P>Those who pass through Dublin Airport know it is overcrowded and poorly run and organised. It is manifestly clear that somewhere along the way somebody forgot the consumers, and this is the issue which arises time and again. As I recall, when the legis<Col N="64" /> lation dealing with the air traffic regulator was being debated in the House I, Senator Fitzgerald and others argued with the Minister that the consumer of the air traffic service was not central to it. All sorts of people were mentioned, but the passenger was not mentioned. One of the problems is getting carried away in high powered corporate strategies and technological shifts and forgetting about the fact that none of it is any good if it does not make the consumer better off.</P>
    <P>Let us remember what happened in the case of the ESB. A month ago, we had the extraordinary case of the ESB's potential competitors queueing up to go on radio to demand that the electricity regulator allow the ESB to increase its charges because they could not compete at the prices the ESB was charging. The ESB does not get public subsidies or use public money. It is a viable and vibrant company which has adjusted to change dramatically well. It competed with private and public companies in the international marketplace very successfully until the Government decided to sabotage it recently. However, it is now being told it is getting a subsidy that nobody can find and therefore its charges must increase so that competition can enter the market. What good is that for consumers of electricity? It is no good, but it is good for people who want to compete with the ESB. I worry about the same thing happening in the gas market.</P>
    <P>Irish consumers are bemused by the things that do not happen. For instance, if they go abroad with their mobile phones, they can pick up whatever service is available and strongest in an individual area. However, at home people can use only one service and if there are areas where one service is weak and another is strong, it is not possible to switch to the other service. This is because the companies have persuaded the regulator this would be bad for them. It is not a problem to do it; it can be done all around the world. The billing and the referral back, etc., must be much more complicated. A phone user can do it manually; it does not happen automatically. However in Ireland an Eircell customer in an area where the Eircell signal is weak and the Esat one is strong is not allowed to use the other service. This may suit the companies and suit some grand strategy on the part of the regulator, but it most assuredly does not do what all this is supposed to do, which is to make it cheaper and to make the quality of the system better for consumers.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the principle here, but we need to put together a structure which makes each of these regulators accountable to consumers on a regular and vigorous basis. First, there should be a statutory and powerful consumer council in each case to which the regulator is accountable on a daily basis and confidentiality clauses, commercial sensitivity clauses, etc., can only be invoked under the most serious circumstances. Second, there should be a committee of the Oireachtas to deal exclusively with regulators <Col N="65" /> so that they are accountable to the Oireachtas on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>I am continually reminded of something that a colleague of mine quoted about the behaviour of the National Roads Authority at a meeting in County Meath. Somebody said that if they wanted to, they could put a road through the Hill of Tara and nobody could stop them. That sort of institutional arrogance is not the way we want our institutions to work.</P>
    <P>Competition works if it is better for consumers. That should not need to be emphasised, but it does. If it is better for business or the State, that comes second, but it has to be, first, better for consumers and, second, it has to operate in a way which deals with the long-term national strategic interest. I worry that many regulators lose vision of those two essential requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for the valuable contributions made here today. I am heartened by the interest shown during the debate.</P>
      <P>This is very technical legislation. The Bill represents a significant step in the process of liberalising our natural gas market and the development of an appropriate regulatory regime is a vital tool in achieving this objective. The first and most pressing issue is the removal of the anomaly whereby the Minister is both regulator of the sector and shareholder of BGE. The Bill deals with this through the transfer to an independent regulator of the relevant statutory functions.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for an increase in competition in the gas supply market as well as a mechanism whereby the level of competition can be further increased in the future. A new licensing framework for existing and new natural gas undertakings is also provided for in the Bill. There were no previous legislative provisions dealing with the licensing of gas undertakings. The new licensing framework will give the regulator the opportunity to impose terms and conditions on operators to ensure the development of effective competition on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Bill, my Department has received a number of comments on the Bill's provisions from interested parties and along with the helpful comments made here today, I shall be considering these with a view to bringing forward relevant amendments to the Bill as appropriate on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey mentioned the extension of gas to the north-west and I thank him for his kind comments. The Government's decision in relation to Ballina, Sligo and Letterkenny is a clear indication that, in this era of liberalisation, the needs of the regions are not being overlooked. The fact that the Bill envisages no public service obligations for extensions of the network to areas where it would not be commercial does not affect the Government's decision. It simply means that Exchequer funding will be needed for <Col N="66" /> the non-commercial costs rather than have gas consumers pay the piper.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also mentioned the need for clarity in section 8 relating to a number of issues including gas quality. This section relates specifically to the functions of the Minister as shareholder of BGE and the CER has no role to play in this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also mentioned the need for operators of storage facilities to acquire the approval of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. This approval is required under the terms of the operators development plan for the gas field under the Petroleum Development Acts, which is clearly a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Storage licences required under this Bill will cover the operations of such a facility in the context of the competitive gas supply market. This is a matter for the regulator of the gas market. There is no overlap between these issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey also mentioned other issues requiring clarification. I shall be looking carefully at these on Committee Stage. Senators Caffrey and Fitzgerald alluded to the commission's existing role in promoting efficiency in the electricity sector. I take the points made and I shall ask my officials to examine this issue to ensure there is consistency between the commission's duties with regard to both the electricity and the gas sectors.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to the extension of the network to smaller towns, a point that was also addressed by Senator Caffrey. When the pipeline projects being developed by Bord Gáis Éireann, the ring main and the Mayo-Galway line, are completed and the network is extended to the north-west, we will have extensive coverage throughout the country. These transmission pipelines create many opportunities to connect towns along the routes. BGE keeps under ongoing review the options for connecting towns.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also mentioned the Government's decision to contribute to the development of the gas network in Northern Ireland. This is a significant decision that will bring benefits North and South. It is an integral part of an all-Ireland energy market to which we all aspire. I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his other incisive comments and I look forward to his contribution on the remaining Stages of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the interim nature of the Bill. I assure Senator Quinn that this does not diminish the value of the Bill. This is an extremely technical and complex area and I am anxious not to delay the introduction of independent regulation. We will be taking a comprehensive look at regulation of the gas sector and consulting widely with interested parties. This will allow us to have regard to the further developments on gas liberalisation being discussed in Brussels and to include developments relating to all-Ireland energy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that there is a great deal more to regulation than just balancing competitive forces. That is the reason I have specifi<Col N="67" /> cally included in the Bill a provision giving the power to the Minister to introduce public service obligations that in broad terms will address the general economic interest and which take account of general, social, economic and environmental factors. This mechanism should introduce the additional balance required and suggested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also raised the question of whether the Government should retain responsibility for regulation. Potential investment, which is so important for our economic development, is best served by independent regulation. That is something that has been made very clear by investors.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh pointed out that the regulator is not a free agent. He is bound by the legislation the Oireachtas will enact and he is answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh queried the wisdom of using gas to generate electricity. Gas is the fuel of choice of electricity generators but I am very much aware of the need to ensure that an increase in the use of gas for power generation does not jeopardise our security of supply. Securing the continuity and security of natural gas supply will be a duty of the Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the accountability of the regulator. The Schedule to the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, which established the Commission for Electricity Regulation, provides that the commission shall submit on an annual basis its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The audited accounts, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, must be submitted to the Minister within six months of the end of the relevant financial year and the Minister is required to lay copies of these documents before each House of the Oireachtas. Furthermore, the commission is also required, under the provisions of the Schedule, to account for the performance of its functions before a joint committee of the Oireachtas, not just every two years but whenever the joint committee requests it. These obligations will continue to apply to the commission in regard to both its electricity and natural gas functions following enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the ability of the joint committees to ensure that regulators carry out their functions properly. I do not share Senator Ryan's views on this particular issue. Senator Ryan spoke about competition and whether it is best for consumers. I listened carefully to Senator Ryan and I remain convinced that competition is the best way forward. As the gas network is extended and the number of consumers grow, more and more suppliers will enter the market. This will lead to improved and cheaper services for consumers. Under the provisions of the Bill, both the Minister and the Commission for Electricity Regulation have <Col N="68" /> responsibility to act in a way that protects the interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators who made valuable contributions to the debate this afternoon. I look forward to being here again to deal with Committee Stage. I thank Members for their assistance and their courtesy. I would also like to warmly thank my officials who put a great deal of work into putting together this important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting the well documented case to provide proper support structures to assist women experiencing pregnancy crisis, calls for a comprehensive and compassionate approach to the issue including the immediate implementation of such support structures as proposed in the Care of Persons Board Bill, 2001, presented by Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The proposal to provide a proper support structure to assist women in crisis pregnancies was made by Fine Gael following its input to the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution. Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill provides for a legal basis for such support. The Government's proposal, contained in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, published yesterday, contains three strands. My party has made it clear that the first strand, covering constitutional and legal aspects, will be discussed thoroughly by its parliamentary party and that legal advice will be taken to enable it scrutinise in detail the legislation presented to the Houses. Deputy Mitchell's Bill addresses issues raised in the second strand while the third strand deals with co-operation between Departments, health boards, non-governmental organisations and women's groups, especially those dealing with education and the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. Deputy Mitchell's Bill does not exclude the third strand, rather it would be part of a more comprehensive approach to dealing with the reduction of the abortion rate by helping women in crisis pregnancies and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's proposed amendment to the motion refers to endorsing &ldquo;the establishment by the Minister for Health and Children of a Crisis Pregnancy Agency under the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961&rdquo;. The agency will be allocated a budget of &euro;6.5 million, <Col N="69" /> which approximates to what my party proposes. However, the Minister should accept the need to establish the agency on a statutory basis to ensure that adequate support is provided to women in crisis pregnancies and their children. The purpose of Deputy Mitchell's Bill is to provide for this. It is not too much to ask. The decision by my party not to call a vote on this aspect indicates our wish for the Government to accept our proposals.</P>
    <P>The outcry from many agencies and people indicates the need to provide State support to women in crisis pregnancies. It is not sufficient that voluntary bodies should be expected to do everything. While they do excellent work they are under-resourced and are over-stretched. Senator Keogh will speak about the need for funding for such bodies, much of whose work is unacknowledged. In the context of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, my party recommended that there be such State support.</P>
    <P>We do not have accurate figures on the numbers of women who seek abortion outside the State but it is clear that a significant number do so. The all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution indicated that according to national statistics from England and Wales, in 1971, 578 women normally resident in this country had abortions while in 1999 this had increased to 6,226. The figures may be even higher and they are not surprising given the concerns women have cited. These have been well documented in the book, <i>Women in Crisis Pregnancy,</i> by Evelyn Mahon, whom I knew when she was a researcher in the University of Limerick, Catherine Connell and Lucy Dillon. They are now part of a team at Trinity College, Dublin. The book was published in 1998 and is essential reading. It outlines the results of tremendous qualitative research and will help people to understand and support the need for proper structures to help those involved. There can be no doubt in any woman's mind that if these were put in place and properly organised and funded there would be a substantial reduction in the numbers of women having abortions.</P>
    <P>The book outlines the practical reasons women had abortions. They were not only socio-economic, although some related to career and job concerns. The stigma of lone parenthood, which sometimes does not get the attention it deserves, stood out. Other concerns included the needs of the child, inability to cope, being too young and already having a child. Some women referred to &ldquo;my body, my right&rdquo; while others referred to the lack of education and training, the fact that they never wanted a child, the stigma attaching to parents or that they were too old to have a child. One third of those surveyed referred to the stigma of having a child, inability to cope or being financially unready. These are the stark concerns given by respondents to very open and specific interviews.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" />The bottom line is that women may choose abortion because they find themselves in a crisis or feel helpless without support. In many cases they feel they may have nowhere to turn, which is an outrageous reflection on a country that claims to be so family friendly. That aspect can be debated on another occasion but I do not see much sign of a family friendly approach when single parents contact me on the basis that they want to keep their children and ensure their education only to find they are ineligible for grants. There always appears to be stop-gaps, as is also the case in terms of medical help. It is no wonder they feel so threatened.</P>
    <P>The all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution agreed on three definite aspects to this issue. The first was the large number of crisis pregnancies which result in recourse to abortion facilities in Great Britain. The second was an urgent need to take measures to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and the third was the need to ensure that women in crisis pregnancies must be offered a real and positive alternative to abortion to help ensure a reduction in the rate of abortion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell's Private Member's Bill is thoughtful and proactive. It needs to be taken on board by the Government if the Government parties are serious about support for women in crisis pregnancies and about reducing the number of abortions taking place abroad. The care of persons board is stressed so much because of its autonomy, because it will report to the Oireachtas and because it has a strong statutory base. A three-year term of office is specified. There will be 12 members appointed by the Minister for Health and Children, subject to the approval of the Dáil, from the membership of which the Minister will appoint a chairman. The chairman shall, at least annually and when required by the Oireachtas committee appointed by both Houses for the purpose, appear before that committee and account for the discharge of the board's responsibilities. There is accountability.</P>
    <P>The role of the board is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any expectant mother shall receive every necessary support. That help may take the form of advice, finance, accommodation and health care, all of which help will be available during crisis pregnancy. It should be there to support, encourage and facilitate any expectant mother to bring her pregnancy to full term. That is not asking too much. The assurance should also be provided that this help will be available not only up to the birth of the child, but thereafter too. Support should also be provided to family members of the expecting mother, or other persons concerned, at the discretion of the board. The support or assistance given by the board shall require the consent of the expectant mother.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides that the board <Col N="71" /> may, by itself or with such representatives of particular groups or organisations as it considers appropriate, establish schemes. In regard to NGOs and other groups, such as health boards and the Department of Health and Children, there would be schemes, the objectives of which would be to protect and support the expectant mother and her unborn child or children. There should be a chief executive who should report to the Public Accounts Committee the need for generous funding. Fine Gael proposes that funding to the board should be £50 million over a ten year period, but if the £5 million per year does not meet the requirements, this could be reviewed by the relevant Oireachtas committees to which the board will report.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is a party committed to social justice. We want to look at root causes and support a practical contribution to addressing a serious problem which is of public concern. I ask that the Minister accept this Bill as a positive way of dealing with crisis pregnancies and of ensuring that the agency suggested by the Minister should be part of the proposed body.</P>
    <P>This has been suggested by other members of Fine Gael and me, co-operatively and altruistically, to ensure that an issue which has been swept under the carpet for so long can be looked at positively. It should be approached through education and with the support of all sectors of the community, such as the health boards, the Department of Health and Children, non-governmental organisations and women's groups. Collectively we will do something worthwhile in a supportive, humanitarian and community-based way by putting this on a statutory footing. That is my plea to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take pleasure in seconding the motion put forward by my colleague, Senator Jackman.</P>
      <P>Discussing this in splendid isolation, by pretending there was not another aspect to what the Government put forward yesterday, would be quite unreal. I wish that we were just discussing the motion as put forward in relation to the Bill produced by Deputy Gay Mitchell. There are so many issues we should discuss that are pertinent and we have to look at the entire picture while examining this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, this is part of an effort to support women who are in crisis pregnancies, but we have to put that in context. It is a disturbing reality that despite our growing affluence the number of crisis pregnancies among young women which end in abortion has increased. The number of teenage pregnancies has risen steadily over the years. The latest research we have from the Midland Health Board shows that 44% of sexually active women, between the ages of 18 and 45, do not use contraception. Were they all hoping to <Col N="72" /> become pregnant, did they assume that pregnancy would not happen or did they have the opportunity to access family planning information and services? Unfortunately, not all of these women have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I wear another hat as chairman of the Well Woman Centres. Our centres, which have a predominantly Dublin-based clientele, have noticed disturbing trends with a 65% increase in demand for emergency morning-after contraception between 1998 and 1999. What we would like to see is more comprehensive long-term contraception which is more reliable and preferable from the perspective of women's health. It is a sad fact that in the United Kingdom one in every five pregnancies ends in abortion. Here that figure is one in every ten and this is a country where abortion does not exist. There are many issues and it is very important to understand that our education system is failing to equip young women and young men. Women do not have these children by themselves. Young people have insufficient information and, to some extent, they do not have a sense of personal responsibility regarding family planning. The number of pregnancies ending in termination represents a huge failure to educate our young people and, unfortunately, it shows a huge failure to support women in crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>We are trying to deal with this issue, initially through the Bill presented by Deputy Gay Mitchell to support women in crisis pregnancy, but we also must remember that we have to continue with education. I contend that the relationships and sexuality programme in schools is absolutely insufficient and does not deliver the type of information our young people need. It must be rolled out in a systematic way, rather than in the <i>ad hoc</i> fashion in which it is being done at the moment. Our young people need clear, unambiguous and consistent information so they have the skills to enable them to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; if they find themselves in circumstances where they feel they have to have sexual relations. That is something we are very remiss about in this society. It is part and parcel of the type of thing we should be doing and I hope any agency established will ensure that the proper education of our young people is a high priority. Information campaigns and out-reach programmes should also form an important part of this.</P>
    <P>The argument is often put forward that greater access to information on contraception and a reliance on contraception leads to more unwanted pregnancies and to an increase in the number of abortions. All we have to do is look at programmes elsewhere. I spoke to some American politicians late last year who were involved in sex education programmes. There were 12 such programmes in one state &ndash; they are divided into districts &ndash; and in the one district where they did not have a programme of information on contra<Col N="73" /> ception teenage pregnancies and, unfortunately, abortions increased. That is a very important issue.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that we are discussing this in the context of what was announced yesterday. Unfortunately, regarding the proposals put forward by the Government, there was no consultation of which I am aware with any of the groups working in the field of reproductive health. There was no consultation with any of the agencies. That should have been done in advance of the announcement.</P>
    <P>Many questions that have been asked need to be answered. That is why I believe any proposed agency should, as we are suggesting, be on a statutory basis so that it can be held accountable. Openness is very important in this regard.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state how is one going to reach the women facing crisis pregnancies? From the point of view of agencies to which women go for help, it is very difficult to do that. If it is difficult to do that beforehand, it is a hundred times more difficult to do it afterwards.</P>
    <P>Much discussion must take place before we find a model that truly works. From that perspective, to support anything that provides help and resources for women is fine, but it is not good enough to do it on a back-of-the-cigarette-packet basis. The way the matter should have been handled was by presenting, as we have suggested, a Bill standing on its own without reference to other issues such as constitutional amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution in its Fifth Progress Report that an agency be established to prepare and oversee the implementation of a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy, endorses the establishment by the Minister for Health and Children of a Crisis Pregnancy Agency under the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, and the provision of a budget of &euro;6.5 million for this agency in 2002.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator O'Donovan.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to say there was no consultation before the Crisis Pregnancy Agency was announced. In fact, it was discussed over many months by the all-party committee on the Constitution and a report was produced in November 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It proposed that there should be a national strategy to reduce the number of pregnancies and therefore reduce the rate of abortion. The all-party committee identified a range of issues to be addressed in a strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It also pointed out that several Government Departments, State bodies and voluntary <Col N="74" /> organisations have responsibilities for aspects of these issues. The complexity of the programmes needed and the co-ordination necessary for their success requires a single planning focus. It proposed the establishment of an agency to draw up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies, promote options other than abortion when crisis pregnancy occurs, and provide for post-abortion services. The agency would also have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report of the all-party committee, the Government is establishing a new statutory agency to combat crisis pregnancies. The agency, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, will, in consultation with the Government and other statutory and non-statutory bodies, draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and then oversee the implementation of that strategy. It will work with a wide range of organisations, not just in the health sector but also, for example, in education, employment and housing. The Government, as I said, is supplying &euro;6.5 million to fund this new agency in 2002.</P>
    <P>The agency and the strategy will encompass three major elements. The agency will work through education and other programmes to seek to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies that occur. It will work with women who are experiencing crisis pregnancies to offer them meaningful options within Ireland. This will include working with society as a whole in promoting a more supportive attitude. It will work to develop supports for women who have had an abortion to provide for their emotional and physical needs. Preventative issues concerning the education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed.</P>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed to make women more aware of their options should they have a crisis pregnancy and to enable them to consider these carefully and assist them before making decisions about the course of action they may want to take. This is another major area to be addressed by the agency.</P>
    <P>Women who have had an abortion also have real needs. They must be treated with compassion and understanding and both their emotional and physical health needs must be attended to. Post-abortion counselling is already available from a number of agencies but is not widely availed of. Similarly, although medical check-ups are advisable for women who have had abortions, many Irish women do not avail of them. This is another matter the agency will be asked to address in order to ensure women receive all the care and attention they need.</P>
    <P>Women with crisis pregnancies should not be abandoned. All necessary health care should be given to them. The broadest public support should be given to the new agency to allow it to <Col N="75" /> deal, in a helpful manner, with the problems faced by women undergoing crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment outlined by my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick. The proposal recently announced by the Minister for Health and Children to set up a crisis pregnancy agency is along the lines of what was suggested by the all-party committee on the Constitution, of which I was a member for almost four years.</P>
      <P>Regarding a point touched upon by Senator Jackman, the committee had different views on how to approach the issue of abortion. There was a three-way split. One faction wanted the <i>status quo</i> to remain. Another group wanted the Constitution to be amended and the third had a more liberal approach. This is the manner is which the recommendations came from the committee in our report.</P>
      <P>It is important to note, as did Senator Jackman, that all the parties to the committee, from both sides of the House, agreed unanimously with the idea of setting up an agency to deal with the difficulties associated with unwanted pregnancies. I would love be of the utopian opinion that we will not have any abortions and that we will totally eradicate the need for it, abroad or at home. Unfortunately, this is not likely to occur, but what can be done &ndash; in line with the idea of setting up a crisis pregnancy agency &ndash; is to tackle some of the real issues that arise.</P>
      <P>It is mind-boggling in this age of modern technology, and given our young, educated population, that there are so many unwanted pregnancies in this country. The problem must be tackled, but we will not be able to eliminate it. What one can do is create by way of education, particularly in young people, an awareness and an understanding of how to deal with crisis pregnancies.</P>
      <P>The figures mentioned by Senator Keogh are startling. The substantial increase over two years of 65% in the demand for the morning-after pill indicates that there are a lot of people &ndash; primarily the young &ndash; who are still prepared to take risks such as having unprotected sex etc. We must encourage a more realistic and mature approach in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the agency was what everyone on the committee wanted and the Minister has acted in this regard. If certain people say they were not consulted, it should be borne in mind that we were given the task less than two years ago of dealing specifically with the Green Paper and we produced a report of almost 600 pages within a year. We held oral hearings, accepted written submissions, heard from every association dealing with matters such as unwanted pregnancies and heard different views from different religious groups. Different organisations throughout the length and breadth of Ireland were <Col N="76" /> invited to make submissions, which they did. There was a detailed trawl of the submissions with lengthy oral hearings in this Chamber which lasted several weeks. Resulting from that, this report was then sent to Government which, within 11 months, decided to hold a referendum and to publish legislation to deal with the issue of abortion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to establish an agency to deal with crisis pregnancies and that it will be provided with funding of &euro;6.5 million. The plan of the committee was to provide £50 million over ten years. The amount provided by the Government is in line with that strategy. This is what was envisaged by the committee chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan. I am delighted as a member of that committee to see the agency being established and funding for it being put in place. I wish the agency well. It is the right road to take. Having regard to the committee's recommendations and the fresh approach of the Minister for Health and Children, the Senator who moved the motion might reconsider her position. There are many positive aspects to Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill, but the establishment of the agency was what everyone wanted. It is now being put in place and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome the establishment of the agency and I welcome Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill, especially the former were it not for the fact that it appears to have been added on to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, to make it appear more acceptable. It is most regrettable that in light of the excellent work done by the committee chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, we had to wait a year before this uncontroversial proposal was brought forward. In the meantime, a considerable number of women have gone to the United Kingdom for abortions who might not have had them had better arrangements been in place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of women going to the UK for abortions have increased since abortion was legalised in Great Britain in 1967, but it is important to remember that in the past ten years there has been a large increase in the number of women in the age group from 20 to 30 travelling there for abortions. This is by far the commonest age group that goes to England for abortions. In 1990, 255,070 women in that age group travelled, in 1995, the number was 265,900 and in 2000, it was 311,600. The increase in abortion has been in the same proportion to the increase in the number of women in the 20 to 30 age group, allowing for the fact that women are more likely now to give their Irish address rather than a fictitious one. I do not want to be as despondent as some people are about this because there are people working in this field, such as myself and the people involved in Cherish, about which I am <Col N="77" /> about to speak, who believe some progress is being made.</P>
    <P>In talking about the various agencies to be established, I feel like asking if this is not a bit like re-inventing the wheel. If agencies such as Cherish and CURA had been given the funding they required over the years, what might we have been able to do? Cherish was established about 30 years ago by single mothers to assist single mothers. As most people will remember, it was unacceptable then for a single mother to keep her child. The work done by Evelyn Mahon in producing the report in Trinity College showed that social and economic pressures are still the main reasons a woman would consider going to England to have an abortion. Some young women will consider adoption, but everyone has a unique reason for deciding to terminate a pregnancy. The vast majority make the decision because they feel they cannot continue with the pregnancy and are not in a position to support either themselves or a child.</P>
    <P>Some people tell me I encourage women to become single mothers. I do not do that, but I believe that if a woman has a crisis pregnancy, the least I can do is try to help her so that if she wants to consider keeping her child, the facilities exist to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been extraordinarily difficult over the years to get funding for Cherish and I applaud the Eastern Health Board, as it was then, and the Northern Area Health Board for funding us. We will shortly be funded by the South-Western Area Health Board. The Eastern Health Board was good over the years. However, between 1995 and today, we did not receive any increase in funding. We do not even receive £150,000 nowadays. We received an increase of £40,000 recently for which we are grateful, but imagine trying to run an agency such as ours on that amount of finance. We are working from hand to mouth. One year I was obliged to ask consultant colleagues who were obstetricians and who would know the difficulties of these women to give me £100 each. The vast majority of them gave me funding.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that any time we appeal for funds there is not much of a response. It is not considered worthy of great support. Everyone is against abortion, but when one tries to help single mothers, it is difficult. At one stage we were located in premises in Pembroke Road which I was terrified to enter because I was concerned the place would fall down around me, and people were living there. This country's answer to abortion is that suitable accommodation cannot be provided to house people while their various problems are dealt with.</P>
    <P>What would Cherish do if it had more money? If we received some of the money &ndash; a couple of million pounds would do and not the whole £50 million &ndash; the organisation, which has a strong history of assisting single mothers with crisis preg<Col N="78" /> nancies would put in place a five year strategic plan. At present we cannot even plan six months ahead. The money would enable us to establish a network so that we could liaise with individuals and groups throughout the country. We would try to establish regional offices in Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Galway, Athlone, Donegal, Clonmel and Dundalk, to name but a few places where we could be useful.</P>
    <P>We would try to give single mothers better access to the services and information we have on offer. We would also try to expand directly in the Dublin area where there is a large population of single mothers and where family support workers are needed. These areas are frequently socially and economically disadvantaged and they could badly do with our assistance. If we had more money, we would be able to do more in terms of supplying accommodation. We would also be able to do more to try to help young women become economically independent. I praise the vocational education committee for the funding it has given us and the practical help by way of teachers running classes for single mothers to become computer literate because that was an area where it was good to get jobs.</P>
    <P>I would also like to be able to obtain better crèche accommodation because it is very difficult for these young women to continue with their education or to be involved in work because child care is extraordinarily dear. Will Senators help me obtain funding for Cherish so that we can do more in this area? I would be very obliged if they would because everyone present is against abortion.</P>
    <P>Our opening hours are not as long as we would like. Many people work for the organisation in a voluntary capacity. I would be very grateful for some money which would allow us have longer hours so that we could have better counselling, better teaching facilities and better crèche facilities for all the various people who come to us. In view of the money now available, I will be extremely angry if Cherish does not get some of this funding because while the Government are setting up the agencies, women will be going to England. We could be talking to those women and offering them the services which have been available for nearly 30 years. The Minister should ask his Department at least to give Cherish some of the money so that we can attempt some of the measures I have outlined. I was very sorry to see this money thrown in as an addendum to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of putting anything like this legislation into the Constitution. The same legal experts who say that this legislation is right were wrong the last time. I objected to the 1983 amendment because I thought it could be construed in several different ways. I feel the same about this legislation. I strongly object to the definition of abortion and I do not know how the pro-life groups, who have said that human life <Col N="79" /> begins at conception, have accepted it. I agree that implantation is a better description, but abortion is described in the legislation as meaning the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman. There is no definition of an end-point.</P>
    <P>We could at least have taken on the medical terminology which says, &ldquo;until the child is viable.&rdquo;  It will not matter with this legislation, but internationally it is this sort of sloppy legislation which has allowed for what are described as partial birth abortions in the United States. I would describe these operations as &ldquo;foetuscide,&rdquo; as third trimester abortions &ndash; which the Minister will know of, being a doctor &ndash; which are done on a two-stage basis in the United Kingdom to ensure that the child is dead before the abortion takes place. There is no end-point in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also astonished that under the heading &ldquo;conscientious objections,&rdquo; the legislation states, &ldquo;Nothing in this Act should be construed as obliging any person to carry out any medical procedure referred to in section 1 of this Act.&rdquo;  However subsection (2) of part 1 states, &ldquo;A medical procedure is not an abortion if it is to save the life of the mother.&rdquo;  Surely, the person should at least be obliged to let the mother know in advance that they are a conscientious objector. It would have been wise to include that.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is not the subject of tonight's debate but I feel angry about this. I urge the Minister to provide money for Cherish up front. We will be working. We have the facilities in place, we are ready to go and to expand while the Minister and Fine Gael are setting up the various agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I could debate with Senator Henry some of the issues that she has raised but, as she said herself, they are for another day. I will leave them aside despite being tempted to engage with her. I disagree fundamentally with some, not all, of what she had to say regarding the substantive question. I am sure we will come back to using the term &ldquo;substantive question&rdquo; again.</P>
      <P>I fail to see the need for the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Senators, or the need to vote on the issue. My failure to see such a need is based on yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Health, confirmed by the Taoiseach, that an agency to combat crisis pregnancies is to be established and that it will receive funding of &euro;6.5 million in 2002. This precisely mirrors the approach of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, and in particular, it reflects what I, as a member of the committee, understood the Fine Gael position to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before yesterday's announcement, I failed to see the need for the motion because <Col N="80" /> each of the three approaches put forward by the committee to deal with the abortion question supported the plan to reduce crisis pregnancies. All members of the all-party committee agreed on this; it was not just the view of the Fine Gael Party. The report of the committee states that the first approach is to concentrate on the plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and the rate of abortion, and to leave the legal position unchanged. The second approach is to support the plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, accompanied by legislation which will protect medical intervention to safeguard the life of the mother within the existing constitutional framework. The third approach is to support the plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, to legislate to protect best medical practice by providing for a prohibition on abortion, and consequently to accommodate such legislation by referendum to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There were three different approaches, none of which commanded the unanimous support of the committee. However, in each of the three approaches, the need to have a plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies is mentioned. The Fine Gael proposition, if it was such, was supported by all members of the committee.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael suggested that £50 million would be required to implement the plan over a 10-year period. If my euro to punt mathematics are correct, the &euro;6.5 million provision for the agency in 2002 is as near as makes no difference to the 10-year £50 million target established by Fine Gael. Even those members of the committee who disagreed with the Fine Gael proposal to leave the legal position unchanged, which is the first approach, and who preferred what has now broadly been included in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, supported the plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <P>The fifth progress report of the all-party committee states that some members support the legislation to protect best medical practice while providing for a prohibition on abortion and consequently to accommodate such legislation by a referendum to amend the Constitution. Those who support this approach are in full agreement with the action plan which offers women in crisis pregnancy real and positive alternatives to abortion and contains measures to reduce the rate of abortion. I fail to see the need for a division on the motion.</P>
    <P>It was a racing certainty that whatever the nature of the legislative proposals, or whether there would be a referendum on a constitutional amendment, a crisis pregnancy agency would be established. That was announced yesterday by the Government and the Minister for Health and Children. I am surprised by Fine Gael's attempt to politicise the issue and to seek to secure a form <Col N="81" /> of moral superiority for their party on an issue which was not politicised at all within the committee, and was an issue on which there was universal agreement.</P>
    <P>In the wider debate, we will need calm, compassionate and steady words. I hope that is where the debate will bring us. There is no dispute about the figures. They are known to all. They are in the report and were put to the committee by those who gave evidence to it. The depth of human suffering and misery is not in dispute. The question concerns what should be done about it. That is what the committee addressed and the analysis in each case was that this agency should be set up to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Keogh that it would be unreal to discuss the agency or support for women in crisis pregnancies in isolation from the larger question. That larger question was addressed effectively yesterday by the Government in the proposals made. The committee itself did not treat the issue of abortion in isolation from the question of support for crisis pregnancies. The proposals brought forward yesterday are balanced and reasonable. At one extreme of the argument, there is a complete disregard for the health of the mother. At the other extreme, there is a demand for abortion to be made available almost for social reasons. Most reasonable people reject both of those positions and the Government approach will be widely accepted.</P>
    <P>Most of all, I hope that the debate will be conducted in a civilised and calm manner and that when the question is put, it will be carried by the people. It was dealt with in that way by the vast majority of the large number of people who came to the committee to give evidence. The degree of consultation and involvement which Senator Keogh seems to believe is necessary was there. Anybody who wanted to, any group or interest who had something to say, came and made their views known to the committee.</P>
    <P>That was done in a very reasonable and calm way and the hearings helped to advance matters considerably in terms of our understanding of the issues involved and of grappling with extremely difficult and complex matters. I would prefer legislation, but I know that if we are to deal with the consequences of the X case, legislation alone is insufficient. There is, of necessity, a need for a referendum on a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>If one allows the threat of suicide to be used as grounds for securing an abortion, that will lead to the point where somebody will present themselves to their general practitioner, claim to be suicidal and will be able to secure an abortion in this jurisdiction. That is not something that I would want to see and neither would many in this country. It is no harm for us to state our position on each of these issues. It is the position of my party that on matters of conscience, on matters as complex as this, each person is guided by their <Col N="82" /> conscience and can make their own decisions as to how to vote on these issues. I hope the 25th amendment will be adopted by the people and I wish the agency, which will be established as an adjunct to the legislation and the referendum, well. I hope it will be successful and that it will achieve what all of us want to achieve, that there will be genuine support, compassion and advice available for women in crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <P>I could go into the question of the definition of abortion, which was raised by Senator&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was about to conclude by saying that I was going to get into the question of the definition of abortion that was raised by Senator Henry, but realising that some of the best medical and ecclesiastical brains in the country had considerable difficulty in enunciating a definition when they attended the committee, what has emerged under the Government's proposal is very reasonable and balanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and announce my very strong support for the amendment and indeed for the proposal as outlined by the Minister for Health and Children on behalf of the Government. I am sure I am one of the many public representatives, national and local, who have been lobbied over recent years in regard to bringing forward a constitutional amendment to ensure that abortion is outlawed once and for all. That would be my position also, and I am sure it reflects the views of many Members of both Houses. Yesterday's announcement is a clear indication of the determination of the Government to resolve this matter. It is clear that when the Government and the Taoiseach make promises they deliver on them, which is very important.</P>
      <P>Abortion is an option which should not be considered except where crisis pregnancies occur as in the cases outlined by Senator Fitzpatrick and others. It is my firm and long-held view that when women find themselves with a crisis pregnancy they need all the support they can get. The concept of Christianity should have a practical meaning in that regard. I believe that every possible support should be given through the various agencies that exist in this area. I am delighted that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been set up and I see this as having a co-ordinating role. I acknowledge the great work that is being done by Cherish and CURA and, indeed, other support groups for women who find themselves with a crisis pregnancy. The proposal by the all-party committee, which is now brought forward as a definitive proposal by the Government, should be supported because it will bring together all the various elements of support that is necessary for women with a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" />I wish to address the issue of teen pregnancies and in that regard I refer to the long crusade that has been pursued by my colleague, Senator Farrell, in relation to underage drinking. There is no doubt that drink and unwanted pregnancies have a definite relationship. Arising from the declarations by him and other Members of all parties in this House pertaining to the evils that can emanate from underage drinking, I am delighted that the publicans in my town of Mullingar are taking a very proactive role in ensuring that the people drinking on their premises have at least reached the legal age. The Garda in Mullingar is also taking a very proactive approach in this regard. I will let other Members speak for their own areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh made an important point which I wish to support, although it was made by a member of the Opposition. Pregnancy, whether wanted or unwanted, is not a single person issue, it involves two people. Over the past 22 years I have been inundated with expectant mothers coming into my office relating that they have nowhere to go, no income and so on. I could count on two hands the number of times that the partner or spouse accompanied them. When people have a crisis pregnancy, especially in the case of teen pregnancies, every effort should be made to establish the paternity of the child and this could be facilitated by the use of DNA testing. They should be made stand by their responsibilities. To borrow the old phrase, it is always the woman who is left holding the baby.</P>
    <P>A very important point was made with regard to the educational requirements pertaining to this area. Parents have a huge responsibility in this regard. What is the use of pointing the finger at the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, the Ministers of State or the teachers of any given teaching institution and asking what they are doing to help. What are the parents doing? Where does parental responsibility begin or end? </P>
    <P>From my experience over many years in psychiatric services, people who tell you they are going to commit suicide invariably do not do so. This would be one of the most puerile reasons for granting an abortion that I can think of. It is an established fact that the person who commits suicide is the most calculating and scheming individual who will ensure that nothing stops them from taking their own life, and one would not need to be a rocket scientist to work that one out.</P>
    <P>What can be done to help in this situation? I repeat, if only to underline the matter, that what has been suggested is the best way forward. I believe that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will have a co-ordinating and supporting function that will bring everyone together. The most important point of all, which was made here by Senator Henry, is that nothing can be done without money. The Government has put its money where its mouth <Col N="84" /> is and I am delighted that &euro;6.5 million has been made available to deal with this problem. As pointed out by Senator Fitzpatrick, we are not talking about the area of health alone, it is a multi-faceted problem. One needs to address the issue in the context of education, employment, housing and so on.</P>
    <P>This is a deep and complex problem. Abortion should never be considered as an option. It is a heinous crime against humanity. As one who is totally anti-abortion, I believe what has been brought forward here and is supported by the pro-life groups is the best way forward. I strongly support the amendment and the approach that has been adopted by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to come into the House to discuss the very important issue of crisis pregnancy, which is a subject of concern not only to the Oireachtas but also to society generally.</P>
      <P>I apologise for being somewhat late but I had to clear some material in advance for Adjournment debates that I have to attend in the other House later this evening. It is important that whatever I say on the record is correct.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with the broader issues covered in the legislation published yesterday and the constitutional amendment. The House will have an opportunity at a further date to discuss that in a calm, reflective and constructive manner. The only comment I would make is that to date, both on the airwaves and in the other media, we have had a very measured debate with people of divergent views communicating those views in a calm and constructive manner. Those people have set the tone and tenor of this debate and I hope that will continue right through the discussion of the various issues both in the House and outside.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts that the proposals announced yesterday to address the constitutional and legal issues surrounding the protection of human life in pregnancy will have little, if any, impact on the situation of those Irish women who choose to travel abroad for abortions. Many of those who have participated in the consultation and discussion process which preceded the production of the Green Paper on abortion and, later, the report of the all-party committee on the Constitution have recognised this also. It is fair to say that one outcome of the process on which the Government embarked in 1997 has been to move much of the debate onwards, from focusing primarily on situations where a pregnant woman's life is at risk to considering also the position of women for whom pregnancy represents a crisis in their life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided to establish the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and oversee its implementation. Before setting out the detail <Col N="85" /> of what we are doing, I would like to outline part of the process which has brought us to this point.</P>
    <P>In 1995 the Department of Health, as it then was, commissioned a study by the department of sociology in Trinity College into the factors which contribute to the incidence of unwanted pregnancies and the issues which resulted in women choosing the option of abortion. In 1998 my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, published the outcome of this research. The study, <i>Women and Crisis Pregnancy,</i> was widely welcomed and helped us to gain valuable insights into the factors leading to crisis pregnancy and the experiences of women who find themselves in this situation. The key findings of the study included the following: a significant number of women lacked information on the availability of counselling services and, in the study, one third of women who had abortions abroad did so without receiving any counselling; there was considerable ignorance about the human reproduction process and effective contraception methods; there was a failure of men to take responsibility for contraception; the combination of alcohol consumption and risk-taking sexual behaviour was a factor in many crisis pregnancies; a wide range of factors influenced a woman's decision to have an abortion, including perceived education, career and child care difficulties if she proceeded with her pregnancy; women who had abortions felt that single motherhood would prove to be a very difficult, unsupported alternative; there was a lack of information available to women about adoption and the availability of services which facilitate adoption.</P>
    <P>In the deliberations of the all-party committee on the Constitution, crisis pregnancy was a recurring issue. The committee was concerned about how the number of crisis pregnancies, and the number of those ending in abortion, might be reduced.</P>
    <P>In its very comprehensive report, published in November last, the committee identified a range of issues which it considered needs to be addressed in a strategy to combat crisis pregnancy. It also pointed out that different Government Departments, State bodies and voluntary organisations had responsibilities for aspects of these issues. It believed that the complexity of the programmes needed and the cohesion necessary for their success required a single planning focus.</P>
    <P>The committee proposed the establishment of an agency which would have responsibility for drawing up a strategy to combat crisis pregnancies to promote options other than abortion where a crisis pregnancy occurs and to provide for post-abortion services. It envisaged that the agency would also have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government has carefully considered the recommendations of the committee on this issue and has decided to establish a new statutory agency to combat crisis pregnancies. I have signed the statutory instrument, under the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, to <Col N="86" /> establish the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, this has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a copy has been circulated to each Oireachtas Member. Ms Olive Braiden has agreed to be the chairperson of the agency and the board of the agency and initial staff to enable it to begin to function will be appointed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency will have the task, in consultation with Government and other statutory and non-statutory agencies, of drawing up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and overseeing its implementation as I have described. It will work with a wide range of organisations not just in the health sector but also, for example, in the education, welfare, employment and housing fields. The Government is providing funding of &euro;6.5 million, or £5.19 million, in 2002. That is exactly what was recommended by the all-party committee on the Constitution, £5 million per annum over ten years leading to £50 million by the end of the ten year period. We have adhered strictly to that. That is additional to current funding being provided for such services which amounts to approximately £5.72 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance will be a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. Much concern has been expressed about the need to make women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to enable them to consider these carefully and to assist them in making decisions about the course of action they wish to take. This is another major area to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also. We need to ensure that women are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to. Post-abortion counselling is, I know, already available from a number of agencies, but is not widely availed of. Similarly, although medical check-ups are advisable for women who have had an abortion, the sad fact is that many Irish women do not avail of these. This is another area which the agency will be asked to address in order to ensure that women receive all the care and attention they require.</P>
    <P>The Care of Persons Board Bill, which has been published by Fine Gael, while undoubtedly motivated by genuine concern for women who find themselves with a crisis pregnancy, does not, in my view, go far enough in addressing the issues. It approaches them from the relatively narrow focus of supporting expectant mothers in bringing their pregnancies to term, and possibly providing assistance after the birth also. The objectives spelled out in the Bill are ones which can be easily encompassed within the remit of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which will be much <Col N="87" /> more wide-ranging. The proposed Bill completely ignores the vital question of preventing crisis pregnancies in the first place and the need for sympathetic, caring counselling and medical services for women who, for whatever reason, have gone abroad for an abortion.</P>
    <P>The agency we have established will draw up a strategy to address the different aspects of crisis pregnancy, as I have already outlined. It will work in partnership with different Departments and agencies to promote and co-ordinate the attainment of these objectives by means of an operational plan. It will have the very important task of monitoring and reviewing progress on the achievement of these objectives and will propose remedial action where this is necessary. The agency will also be empowered to take measures or initiatives and to commission research into issues coming within its remit.</P>
    <P>Research is a particularly important dimension of the agency's work. It may also draw up codes of best practice for service providers and promote their adoption, as the particular needs of women with a crisis pregnancy or those at risk of such a pregnancy may not always be acknowledged in the way that services are organised and delivered. It will also act as a source of advice to the Minister for Health and Children and other Ministers on issues relating to crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The agency will have a board of nine members and in addition there will be a committee of up to 20 persons which will advise the agency on issues coming within its remit. In this way the agency will be governed by a small and effective board while at the same time there will be an opportunity for a wide range of interests to be involved in the agency's work through the committee I have described. The agency itself will not be a large administrative body as its role will be primarily one of planning and co-ordination, with services being delivered by a wide range of other organisations. The agency is required to make an annual report of its activities to the Minister, who must arrange for copies of this report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The agency and its senior officials will be available to appear before committees of the Oireachtas in the normal way.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge that there are already many agencies, both in the public and the voluntary sectors, which have for many years been doing excellent work in addressing the problem of crisis pregnancy. I express the Government's appreciation of this work, involving many committed individuals and organisations throughout the country. In terms of funding, since coming to office the Government has provided an additional £3.79 million to health boards for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services, bringing the total amount in the current year to £5.7 million. In addition, a range of pregnancy counselling organisations are assisted at national level, with £700,000 being provided to them annually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />However, I acknowledge that there is much more which can and should be done to ensure that support services are expanded and are accessible countrywide, and that there is co-ordination of activities and services. Among the agency's tasks will be to assess the services that are already available, to identify where deficiencies exist and, working with service providers, to devise strategies to address these.</P>
    <P>I stress again that the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that, over time, it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them to deal with their situation. By putting these measures in place we hope to ensure that the numbers of Irish women seeking abortion abroad are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I commend the new Crisis Pregnancy Agency to the House. I understand that there is an alternative Bill before the House but the new agency which we are establishing under the necessary primary legislation meets the concerns of all Members of the House in respect of the issue of crisis pregnancy, follows very closely the recommendations of the all-party committee on the Constitution and in many ways endorses its approach to this issue. Therefore it should not be an issue which should divide the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the legislation which will be coming before us and on the crisis pregnancy strategy. This is an important strategy because there has been a problem for a long time. As others have said, 50% of problems are alcohol and drug related. We in this country are a little hypocritical. We are very benevolent and yet we do not seem to worry about the abuse of alcohol which results in deaths on our roads, in people being stabbed during rows and in unwanted pregnancies. We all must make a greater effort to address that problem. I have been preaching about this for over 30 years and I will continue to do so. If we could address that problem or at least get a grip on it, we would solve many related problems.</P>
      <P>Abortion is terrible. Of course many people who are in favour of it do not like to refer to it as abortion but as termination of pregnancy. It is, however, the same thing. I would say to all the girls who have had abortions that they are as innocent as the child who was aborted because at the time they were being advised and encouraged to go for an abortion they were not really fit to make a decision. I hope this Crisis Pregnancy Agency, with CURA, will encourage more people who have a problem to get advice and to realise there is a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that adoption has become a dirty word, and this should not be tolerated. There have been <Col N="89" /> several television programmes castigating nuns and people who sent children to America for adoption in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. While that is the history of unwanted pregnancies, it is sad that the history of the more educated and enlightened society of the 1990s will be that of the abortion clinics to which we sent our unwanted pregnancies. I hope we will change that.</P>
    <P>As I have said time and again, I am disappointed that doctors who studied to save lives and promote good health are involved in abortion clinics. That is sad. They should think about what they are doing.</P>
    <P>We are told that many unwanted pregnancies are the result of one night stands. People say that young people are now more sexually active and we should tell them to use contraceptives etc., but that is wrong. Should we say to all the criminals of Ireland that they have a weakness and to save them trouble we will leave the doors open and let them all come in? Contraception is not the answer. We should ask them whether they think they should have more respect for themselves and their bodies. When boys talk about how great they are with women, we should ask them the question an old man asked me and a few other young fellows over half a century ago when, as boys do, we talked about how great we were at getting women, that is, &ldquo;Would you talk like that about your own sister?&rdquo;  Would those boys, who talk like that and get girls pregnant, like their own sisters to be made pregnant? They would not.</P>
    <P>We should teach people to have respect for themselves. I said this when we introduced legislation regarding contraceptives. I always opposed that legislation. I said it would open the floodgates. What has it done? It has liberalised sex. People were in favour of the use of contraceptives because they said there would be no more unwanted pregnancies. However, there are more unwanted pregnancies than ever and there is a greater incidence of sexually transmitted disease. It is not just a matter of preventing unwanted pregnancies, it is also a matter of trying to prevent disease.</P>
    <P>We should educate people. These days everybody is concerned about their rights, but with every right there is a responsibility. Young people have responsibility for respecting one another. Good marriages and happy lives are not built on sex alone. They are built on personality, the way the couple gel together and the way they can work together and communicate. There is much more to a happy relationship than sex.</P>
    <P>One must not forget that many boys today are happy to get girls drunk just to have sex with them. They are happy to spike a girl's drink and that is a big problem. Many girls say that when they go out to a disco they cannot put their drink in a glass but must keep it in the bottle and bring it with them when they go out to dance because if they leave it, it may be spiked when they come back. This is a sad reflection on society and it will only be cured by teaching people to have a little more respect for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" />We must make a determined effort to prevent people opting for abortion. I recently saw a television programme about a man who was hoping to contact his mother. The interviewer asked what he would like to say to his mother if he met her. He answered that he would say, &ldquo;Thank you very, very sincerely for giving me an opportunity to live.&rdquo;  That says an awful lot. I wonder if some of the aborted babies could speak to defend themselves whether they would prefer to live with an adopted parent or be aborted. I would safely say they would prefer to be given up for adoption.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people to give up their babies for adoption rather than opt to have them aborted. There are many people with good homes and I have not yet met a child reared in an adoptive home who had anything other than the height of praise and respect for their adoptive parents. Many of them got a better education, including secondary and third level education. Adoption should not be regarded as a dirty word. Girls with unwanted pregnancies should be encouraged to give up their babies to a good comfortable home and in future years they could meet and talk with them and explain why they had to give them up for adoption.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government is investing so much money in the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and I hope and pray that people will avail of this service. I congratulate CURA on the work it has been doing. The Government is investing almost &euro;6 million which will prevent many of these people from going abroad to have abortions.</P>
    <P>Abortion clinics are a big money business. They are not operating for the love of anyone, just for the love of their own bank accounts. It costs £300 to £500 to have an abortion which takes less than ten minutes. These clinics say they provide counselling but we know that many of these girls get no counselling.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suicide aspect, if a girl is suicidal the State should take her into care and provide medical treatment. The answer is not to put her on the boat to an abortion clinic. She should be put into a caring institution which would look after her welfare and ensure her depression is cured.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on facing up to their responsibilities. I congratulate all those who worked in agencies and on the various committees on the wonderful job they have done in bringing this motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Ms Hanafin, to the House. This is a timely debate given the introduction of the Human Life and Pregnancy Bill, 2001, published yesterday and the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency about which the Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Bill which will be coming before us in a number of months, more than 6,000 women are recorded as choosing to go down the route of having an abortion. I am sure another couple of thousand could be added to that figure. These <Col N="91" /> people feel they have no other option. While we would like to think they choose that route due to being raped or a medical condition, unfortunately they choose that option mainly for social and economic reasons. We like to think we are a more liberal and open society, but the stigma of being a lone parent or having an unwanted child at a particular time in one's life weighs very heavily on the minds of many of these women.</P>
    <P>We often tend to think that it is young women who are choosing abortion. However, given my background in midwifery, I would say that quite a number of older women choose that route, mainly because of financial circumstances but also due to being involved in second relationships and not wishing to start all over again with a young family.</P>
    <P>Very often we have great sympathy for people who find themselves pregnant because they have been raped and who feel they have no option other than abortion. However, we are not quite as compassionate and are probably more judgmental as a society of people who choose the route of termination of pregnancy, which is extremely unfortunate. One of the objectives of the agency which is being established must be to support those women who feel they have no other option. Regardless of what support structures are in place there will be women who feel they have no option but to choose that route. We must respect the right of these people to do what is necessary for them.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the agency must be to support women who choose to have an abortion and come back to this country. A large number of women suffer from gynaecological problems post termination of pregnancy as a result of the procedures which have been carried out. They suffer not just from physical problems but, more importantly, emotional problems, in particular guilt if and when they become pregnant again. Great emphasis must be placed on looking after women who feel they have no option but abortion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, one of the main aims of which will be to offer meaningful options to women within Ireland rather than choosing abortion. I wholeheartedly welcome that aspect. However, I believe that objective will create difficulties because it is easier to assist and look after an individual who comes to attention through the Crisis Pregnancy Agency for the nine months they are pregnant and for the six or eight weeks post delivery. Unfortunately, while the supports may be in place during that period, the problems will occur in the following 20 years when that mother is trying to rear her child. No one will be available at 12 midnight when the child is screaming with colic.</P>
    <P>There must be a concerted effort to try to bring together not just the statutory agencies but the non-statutory and voluntary bodies who support young mothers in many communities. These are <Col N="92" /> the people who will make this work. It is easy when people are brought to one's attention. The aim is to deliver a healthy baby, have a healthy mother at the end of a pregnancy, help her get over the initial panic and shock of being pregnant and help her through the physical and psychological stage of pregnancy. I do not know how this can be done because it can be very difficult to co-ordinate various Departments. The difficulty will be in trying to have a proper all round approach to help these mothers for the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has invested huge amounts of money in encouraging lone parents in particular to go back to education and work. However, before this kicks into place support will be needed for women who will choose to keep their babies or at least deliver them.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell mentioned adoption. Unfortunately that is almost considered a dirty word and women almost prefer abortion. This is unfortunate and it is particularly heartbreaking, especially for those who have worked in the field of maternity and midwifery, when one sees the numbers attending infertility clinics. They would literally give their right arm for the opportunity to raise a child.</P>
    <P>There must be supports so that women can see there is another option. Adoption must be examined and promoted in a much more progressive manner. To date it has been pushed to one side. From past experience in maternity hospitals, I know that mothers who delivered their babies were embarrassed to say they were going to give them up for adoption. Some chose not to see their child as they did not want to have to break the bond at a later stage. It is particularly sad for me as a midwife. I accompanied a mother to a front door as she was carrying her new born baby out of the hospital to hand it over to the adoption agency. She wanted everybody to feel she was the same as the rest and was going home like the other mothers. I remember that lady, who is probably the most courageous person I have ever known. I often wonder how she got on. It was heartbreaking for me as an objective individual and I do not know how she coped. In fairness to her, she chose the route of adoption and I hope she was happy as I have no doubt her child was happy.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest role the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will have to play will be in education. At one time we considered the age of sexual activity to begin from 16 years, but unfortunately statistics show it can commence in the very early teens. While there is a relationships and sexuality programme in schools we may have to educate boys and girls, perhaps prior to leaving primary school, albeit in a very general way at that stage, in terms of their responsibilities. Transition year is an ideal opportunity to discuss all these values and for young people to learn more about life. Greater emphasis must be placed on relationships and sexuality programmes in schools.</P>
    <P>I concur with what was said about the high per<Col N="93" /> centage of people not using contraceptive methods. As a midwife it is amazing the number of women, even those having a second and third child, who wonder how they are pregnant and who say they were not using a contraceptive. Many of these people have been dealing with, for example, GPs and public health nurses, and there are opportunities for education, but unfortunately for whatever reason they are missing those opportunities. I agree that a huge number are not aware and are not using any form of contraception. Restarting the awareness campaign would have a dual purpose of preventing the increase in sexually transmitted diseases &ndash; unfortunately we have become a little complacent in this regard &ndash; and unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. The emphasis could very easily be placed on the nine months of pregnancy and the two months post pregnancy, but the emphasis must be on co-ordinating the approach of the various statutory, non-statutory and voluntary bodies. Emphasis must also be put on education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is an opportunity to congratulate and commend the Government on bringing forward this proposal which is aimed at protecting human life. For once and for all I hope we will resolve the situation in relation to abortion.</P>
      <P>In 1995 Trinity College carried out a study of the reasons for crisis pregnancies and the associated fallout. There were no props to deal with the situation and it is time a pregnancy agency was established. That study raised the lack of information, counselling services and services in general, the role of alcoholism and the spiking of drinks in the context of young girls who are sexually active. Another issue is the lack of information on adoption, adoption procedures and the perception of adoption. I know the Minister of State is doing much work in trying to make it easy to facilitate adoption procedures and it is appropriate that we should compliment her on the work she is doing in this area.</P>
      <P>I looked at the Bill put forward by Senator Jackman and saw many good points in it. However, there is no reason its provisions cannot be incorporated into this agency. The study and all the work has been done and the Green Paper has been published. There were a number of submissions from the medical profession, the churches and all walks of life. The question of how to combat crisis pregnancy was raised time and again. The strategy which will oversee implementation of the agency will be crucial in terms of education, health, housing and the options available to those who may want to see through a pregnancy. It must also focus on those who have had abortions and resultant post traumatic stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of education, the counselling techniques we use are very important, as are the people. We all know it is possible for the wrong people to give one-to-one counselling, who do nothing to improve the situation. When we are <Col N="94" /> dealing with the matter through State and non-State bodies we must make sure we have the right people in the job. It is all about empathy and sensitivity, and if we do not get that right it will not work.</P>
    <P>I absolutely agree with the concept of and see great merit in co-ordinating the different areas. We have a great chance of success in this context. The idea is great and I have been a long time waiting for it. It has been thrashed out very much in the Green Paper and the all-party committee. Our party agrees totally with the proposal and I ask others to come with us. We must have a consensus and should not be divided in our opinions. The proposal is worthwhile and has all the ingredients necessary to make it a success. I compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Who could disagree with this recommendation? Senator Dardis asked why this motion is being debated or why we should have a division on it. I cannot see us having one, because nobody could disagree with the recommendation from the all-party committee on the Constitution that an agency be established to prepare and oversee the implementation of a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy. I welcome the decision of the Minister of Health and Children to set up this agency and to provide it with a budget of &euro;6.5 million in 2002. We can argue about the size of the budget, the speed of setting it up, the personnel etc., but none of us can disagree with this decision and we should welcome it.</P>
      <P>I have listened to this debate and the measured way that Members spoke about this problem. I was wondering what a crisis pregnancy was. It is a subjective decision on the part of a woman who finds herself pregnant and for some reason does not want to be pregnant.</P>
      <P>In my work I have seen many such women over the years. They fall broadly into two categories. The first category comprises middle-aged women between 30 and 50 and mostly around 40. These are women who have not taken any contraceptive, have taken a chance, forgotten to take the pill, had an affair or have some other reason. The other broad category is made up of young people aged around 20 and sometimes much younger.</P>
      <P>Both of these groups fall into the categories of women who want to have an abortion and get rid of the growing child and other women who want to carry it to full term. Of the many women I saw afterwards who carried the child to full term and delivered the baby, approximately 90% of them were happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also seen many women after they have had an abortion, including some who had not just one but up to five abortions. They were not unhappy; it seemed to roll off them. It made me very sad, not that they had such disregard for human life, but that they had such little grasp of <Col N="95" /> the sanctity of human life. I am totally opposed to abortion; I always have been and always will be. Once we lose respect for the sanctity of human life we fall into a regime of evil.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke of the important educational and co-ordinating role this agency could fill. It includes not just the provision of information, guidance or help during or after the pregnancy, but also the information that can be promulgated by such an agency before pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Most of the women I have seen with crisis pregnancies did not plan it. The older women took a chance, but the younger girls were mostly drunk when it happened. I have seen some very sad cases of rape, but that is very different.</P>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned the problem of teenage drinking. I spoke to some parents recently and asked them how much money their children spent on alcohol. I met one young girl who works part time in a supermarket for £70 per week. She gives nothing to her parents and spends £40 on drink on a Friday night. When I asked her how she could spend so much she explained that she has ten drinks costing about £3.50. They do not go out to get merry, but to get transmogrified. They lose all control and at that stage sex occurs and pregnancy comes afterwards. It is normally very sad. No agency set up in recent times performs a function more necessary than will be carried out by this one.</P>
    <P>In his announcement yesterday, the Taoiseach tackled a large problem and, after a measured debate, I hope we will reach consensus. Nobody will be pleased with everything, but in large it will address a question that has been hanging over us for a long time.  </P>
    <P>We always have to remember the person. I have seen people who were in tears. The greatest reason for women not carrying a child to full term was that they felt they could not face the consequences. It was not that they could not mind the child or get help to mind the child, but they could not face their parents, husband or lover. They felt they would in some way become an outcast.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to teach not just women but also men that human life is sacred. All our laws are predicated on the sanctity of human life. If we do not drive through red lights, we do not kill people. We talk about the destruction of human life in New York and how terrible it would be to bomb people in Afghanistan, but when I face somebody who has a child growing in her womb and does not want to have that child because she feels she cannot get support, then I realise that an agency of this sort has to perform a useful function and I commend the Minister for setting it up.</P>

      <P>At the risk of sounding like a teacher, some speakers must not have been listen<Col N="96" /> ing. I made it very clear at the beginning that there would not be a vote. I heard particularly Senator John Dardis, who unfortunately is not here, say that there would be. There is no question of that.</P>
      <P>One might also think that this was a Fine Gael amendment to a substantive Government motion. However, our motion was put on the Order Paper on 26 September. Yesterday, the 25th Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, was announced.</P>
      <P>Our spokesperson on health, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on consultation with our front bench, decided to go ahead with this Bill because it was a response to the all-party committee on the Constitution and also a response to the excellent publication <i>Women in Crisis Pregnancy</i> by Evelyn Mahon and the sociological group in Trinity, which the Minister, Deputy Martin, mentioned was commissioned in 1995. He did not say that it was commissioned by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.</P>
      <P>Our party is being conciliatory. We are enveloping the Government party in terms of consensus and we are not making an issue out of it. The suggestion that we, as an Opposition party, did nothing about the findings in this book or the findings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution is extraordinary. In case people do not believe that, in 1995 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, commissioned a study on women and crisis pregnancy in Ireland. The study was commissioned to identify the factors which contributed to the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and those which resulted in abortion. To give him his due, in 1998 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Cowen, published the outcome of that research. We must look at this issue from the point of view of co-operation and not simply dismiss it as something on which the Opposition cannot have a voice.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked why Fine Gael does not take the agency approach rather than the board approach. I would state the opposite. I started my contribution by saying that the agency should come under the remit of the board because the board would be set up under the care of persons board Bill and would be required by an Oireachtas committee, appointed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, to appear before it and account for the discharge of its responsibilities. That would give it actual responsibility and accountability, and that is set out clearly in the Bill. That was a much stronger approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, stated that the Bill did not go far enough but he is forgetting that the agency could be part of it. Senator Henry made an impassioned plea, because she is actively involved in Cherish, that moneys be made available instantly because that organisation is working on a shoestring. I could say the same for CURA and, to a degree, the Well Woman <Col N="97" /> Centres, which were mentioned by Senator Keogh, who is chairperson of that organisation. The Bill was specifically drawn up to bring NGOs, health boards, statutory organisations outside health boards, the Department and Members of the Oireachtas, both Senators and Deputies, together to resolve this extremely traumatic situation. Listening to Senator Ormonde, as a practitioner in the field, we have all had the harrowing experience of meeting girls who have had abortions, who returned here without counselling and who did not get counselling before they travelled to have the abortion. We do not know how they cope with that. I am sure they survive &ndash; I hope they do.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Minister had to leave but I hoped he would have seen fit to say that he will put the agency method within the remit of the Bill. That is all we were asking for and there was no intention of having a division. It is seldom I criticise Senator Dardis, but where the lady doth protest too much, the gentleman did protest much too much. He must have some problem with the whole issue of the amendment. He castigated Deputy Mitchell, talked about Fine Gael taking the moral high ground and said this was a political response. I am saddened that he responded so negatively and so divisively, and he was the only Senator who did so. He must not have listened to me because I said at the outset that even in relation to the amendment, there would not be a division because the issue is so important and traumatic.</P>
    <P>As Oireachtas Members, we are supposed to be giving the lead in terms of consensus. I feel very strongly about the divisive note from Senator Dardis in relation to Deputy Mitchell, who believes in the need for a board and set about drawing up a Private Members' Bill to assist women with crisis pregnancies. The results of this crisis pregnancy research was published in 1998. We are now almost into 2002. Deputy Mitchell's priority was to move the issue forward.</P>
    <P>I hope this will be the last time we will hear such a divisive note in this Chamber when we debate the issue. Fine Gael stated that we will discuss this Bill in great detail, but in the interim we will need legal advice, in the same way that the Government had legal advice available to it, and advice from the Attorney General. We would be extremely flippant if we did not take this matter seriously. I say that not because I am a woman but because of the pain and suffering of more than 6,000 people, some of whom are middle aged women, traumatised for having a pregnancy in their older years, or very young girls. As a teacher I am very much aware of the pressures on young people today.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that everybody familiarise themselves with the findings in this report which include the lack of information and ignorance about the human reproduction process. In <Col N="98" /> that regard, there should be some method of evaluating the sex education programmes in schools. We cannot simply introduce something, as was done six years ago. There has to be an annual evaluation. Other findings include the failure of men to take responsibility; the combination, as mentioned by Senators, of alcohol consumption and risk-taking sexual behaviour; the factors influencing a woman's decision to have an abortion; and perceived education-career-child care difficulties. These are comments from women who were interviewed. Another finding was that women who had abortions &ndash; this is the sad part &ndash; felt that single motherhood would prove to be a very difficult unsupported alternative. That is what they found and that is what we all find in speaking to young women. The lack of information available about adoption and the availability of services which facilitate adoption were also mentioned. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, has done a lot about that during her short period with responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the last time we will have a divisive comment and I hope the Minister will reconsider and perhaps put the agency under the remit of the Private Members' Bill brought forward by Deputy Gay Mitchell, which I have raised here in the form of a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House this evening. The Minister will be well aware of the United Nations Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, of which we were early signatories. Many countries were enthusiastic about signing it and the convention was ratified in 1975. This convention was designed to curtail and eliminate the proliferation of bacteriological weapons.</P>
      <P>One problem with the original convention was the absence of a verification protocol. In other words, there was no method to ensure that the countries who said they had no such weapons were telling the truth. Ireland has been an enthusiastic supporter of an <i>ad hoc</i> group established in the early 1990s to introduce a verification protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I addressed the House on an Adjournment debate matter regarding this issue. The fifth <Col N="99" /> review of the convention is due in November and December and I expressed the hope that we could use our pressure within the group to have a verification protocol introduced. Matters appeared to be progressing well but unfortunately, on 25 July, the US pulled out of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, for reasons that can only be described as bizarre. In his address to the group Ambassador Donald Mahley said that the US had decided it was not in its interest to continue with the negotiations. This was an extraordinary development after six and a half years of negotiations. It is even more extraordinary when the US Government must have known that without unanimity the group could not proceed. In view of Ambassador Mahley's speech one would have to conclude that pressure had been put on the US Government by the pharmaceutical and biotechnological drug companies because they are very much involved in the production of these products.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> group collapsed and the US said it would consider matters but it made no concrete proposals. Ambassador Mahley's speech was extraordinary in a number of respects. One of the most bizarre was the proposal that we should work towards better protection against disease, for example, better vaccines and so on. That is very well for the sophisticated nations but how can it be applied to the developing countries?</P>
    <P>We know that the US and Russia are working on genetically modified bacteria so that while we may have vaccines for common bacteria we will not have them for, say, genetically modified anthrax. It takes approximately 18 months to vaccinate people against anthrax, yet in one night enough anthrax could be sprinkled over a city from a glider &ndash; not even an airplane would be necessary &ndash; to kill hundreds of thousands of people within a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>Ireland leads the UN Security Council at present. At least three members &ndash; the US, Russia and China &ndash; have biological weapons and between 12 and 20 countries are reckoned to have them. Unfortunately, some have been acquired by their erstwhile allies in the US, Russia or China. Perhaps the tragedy on 11 September will have modified the US view on this because everybody now appears to be terrified of biological weapons. They have the potential to do terrible damage.</P>
    <P>I wish people would stop talking about rogue states because the stealing of these weapons from the major states is far more likely to get us into trouble. In 1996, Larry Wayne Harris, a microbiologist, stole bubonic plague from one of the laboratories in the US to show how easily this could happen. He produced his evidence to the CIA and got an 18 months suspended sentence for his troubles. We know there are considerable problems in Russia regarding the payment of state employees and the possibility of theft from such institutions would have to be considered likely. We know that nuclear weapons, including warheads, have been stolen and acquired by the Bur<Col N="100" /> mese military junta. They have been sold by the Russian Mafia in exchange for drugs. It is much easier to steal and sell something like bubonic plague, anthrax and smallpox.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use our position to request the US to return to this <i>ad hoc</i> group and to try to push forward the protocol verification. It is essential because this issue concerns genocide and human rights. The Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons Convention is not a trade agreement; it is not for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies to interfere in it. This is a human rights issue and I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a commitment to promote it within the UN Security Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that the 1972 Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons Convention, BTWC, prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological and toxin weapons and provides for their destruction. The ultimate objective is to achieve a total ban on these weapons. Ireland signed and ratified the convention soon after negotiation concluded in 1972. The convention is a laudable and necessary instrument of international law, but its effectiveness is impaired by the fact that, at the time of negotiation, no provisions were included to ensure verification of compliance by states parties. In the intervening time it has been generally acknowledged that the absence of a means of enforcing the convention's provisions was a serious omission which should be made good.</P>
      <P>To that end, in September 1994, a special conference of BTWC states parties established an <i>ad hoc</i> group to address the matter of devising a verification protocol, such as exists in the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Ireland was extensively engaged in the work of this group, working with EU partners to establish agreed positions. In particular, Ireland has supported efforts to devise an effective verification mechanism including random visits to possible sites of manufacture of biological weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> group was mandated to devise a draft verification protocol for presentation to the fifth BTWC review conference which is scheduled to meet in November and December this year. However, in July this year certain difficulties emerged in this complex negotiating process and it became clear that the <i>ad hoc</i> group would not be able to fulfil its mandate of concluding a protocol. Ireland, along with our EU partners and many other countries, has not hidden our disappointment that the group failed to reach agreement on a verification protocol. It was a most regrettable development but we remain strongly wedded to the idea that a protocol is indispensable. We will persist in our commitment to the <i>ad hoc</i> group protocol process and to multilateral efforts towards finding a common understanding on the matter. Along with a group of like-minded countries, we have urged the <i>ad hoc</i> group to continue its work. By the time the review conference <Col N="101" /> meets in November and December we hope that the intervening period will have allowed countries to reflect on their positions, and we would hope for a constructive approach to sustaining the possibility of an inclusive multilateral negotiating process.</P>
    <P>The process of negotiating a verification protocol is in a state of some uncertainty at this point. Following widespread media coverage, many will be aware that the US was unable to accept the text of the draft protocol. However, we are encouraged by the US statements that it will not be withdrawing from multilateral endeavours to strengthen the BTWC in all its aspects. The US said that it will develop other ideas and different approaches that could help to achieve the common objective of effectively strengthening the BTWC. We look forward to hearing these ideas in a timely fashion and to assessing whether they will strengthen the BTWC in a complementary manner.</P>
    <P>The question can arise as to whether the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention could be an effective instrument against terrorists and their use of such weapons. Such conventions primarily address weapons held by states and as such are not immediately effective against individuals or groups. However, an adequate multilateral verification system for chemical and biological weapons promises in the longer term to reduce and eliminate the danger of their falling into the hands of terrorists. We should not lose sight of such a multilateral avenue even in the current crisis. More immediately, those countries who participate in export control regimes must consider what steps might be possible to improve and strengthen co-operation in this field, to prevent acquisition of the means of producing such weapons by terrorists or those who support them.</P>
    <P>For its part, Ireland will continue to advocate energetically in all relevant fora the necessity for devising and implementing an effective means of verification with the objective of ensuring compliance with, and strengthening of, the convention. The Senator may be aware that within the United Nations system the Security Council does not have primary responsibility for this and other disarmament issues but we are convinced that most states are seized of the importance and urgency of resolving this matter. The forthcoming review conference will be an appropriate forum to pursue this objective as will the United Nation's First Committee, which considers disarmament matters. While the presidency of the Security Council does not in itself offer a direct opportunity to pursue the matter expressly, we will continue to be vocal and active wherever it may assist in advancing efforts to negotiate a verification protocol between member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in this evening. I appreciate it. I hope, as Minister, he will take up the matter I raise. It is not an <Col N="102" /> attempt to have a go at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>I am not sure people are aware of the massive value of the goods which go through our ports, which is worth about £100 billion. These goods are largely the basis of our economic growth and the foundation on which our wealth is based. They are a significant factor in our having become an exporter over the past ten years. The ports play a vital role. Ordinary people are probably not aware that approximately one in three of the ships entering our ports is registered under a flag of convenience. This means that instead of the ship being registered in the country in which the beneficial owners live, it is registered in a country where there are no legislative requirements to fulfil as regards health and safety, marine regulations or worker protection. It gives <i>carte blanche</i> to unscrupulous owners. In many cases it is done for tax purposes, though that is probably the least of the reasons. The reality is that ships are registered in countries, Liberia being a favourite, where they are not required to observe stringent conditions to operate.</P>
      <P>These ships employ as crew the very cheapest labour. Crew members are treated extremely badly and are exploited unmercifully. This is not simple polemic and these are not just my words on it. The evidence is there for all to see. They generally come from under-developed countries and their families at home are dependent on the pittance of a wage they get. For that reason they are always afraid to complain about their conditions. When docked in our ports &ndash; this is something people will not be aware of &ndash; a crew member of a foreign ship is answerable to the courts for any breach of the law committed, but is not subject to any other Irish law. In other words, they are not subject to health and safety regulations, worker protection regulations or marine regulations. They are only covered by the law in the country of the flag of convenience. The flag of the ship determines the laws by which it is covered.</P>
      <P>We saw a ship in the port of Cork on the news last year. The crew were there for over a year without a penny, without protection, without resources and without wages. The goodwill of dock workers and other people in Cork kept them alive. The incidence of foreign crews marooned here is growing more common. They are often there for weeks at a time, but we now have a state of affairs where they are here for over a year and are completely dependent on the charity of local workers or unions, which tend to look after them. They cannot even get home as many of them are from the far side of the world and do not have the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the owners of ships sailing under flags of convenience are unscrupulous and treat their crews appallingly in terms of pay and the conditions under which they work. I do not say that lightly. I have spoken to the inspectors who have visited ships on behalf of the International Transport Workers Federation. They <Col N="103" /> have offered to bring Members of the Oireachtas on board some of these ships to show them the conditions under which these foreign workers are living. The International Transport Workers Federation reckons that at any one time there are more than a dozen of these ships-of-shame docked in Irish ports. This amounts to Third World forced labour and sweat-shop conditions operating on this island. We oppose it in the far east and we should do the same at home. Ships flying flags of convenience must be examined and their unscrupulous owners exposed and shamed. We have a duty to seek protective rights for these unfortunate seafarers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to convince the international community that all ships be registered in the country of the beneficial owners so that Europeans do not register their ships in Liberia and treat workers worse than animals. I ask that legislation be passed giving the State the right to send inspectors aboard all ships brought to their attention by the Irish representatives of the International Transport Workers Federation. The current circumstance is an embarrassment to us as a country which protects its workers and its neighbours and which has a long-standing international reputation of concern for exploited workers in other countries. I want those who book on fancy cruises to make sure that the workers below decks looking after them are paid decent wages and have proper and safe working conditions.</P>
    <P>There is an innovative anti-competitiveness about these ships sharing ports and harbours with other ships whose workers are paid a decent wage and where health and safety regulations and maritime regulations are observed, obviously at a cost to their owners. It is anti-competitive and I ask the Minister to take that on board. We would not allow people to come here and work without protecting them. We have had cases recently where we have been embarrassed at the treatment of foreign workers in meat factories in different parts of the country. The Government rightly took action on that and the appropriate Department was clear that it would not put up with it. This is something which all seafaring people would support. What is happening on some of these ships is tragic. The conditions in which some of these seafaring workers operate are not much better than those in the coffin ships we sent abroad 160 years ago. I ask the Minister to give a positive response to that demand and to ensure that Ireland leads the way in protecting seafarers in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>To have the Senator concerned with flags of convenience is of great significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" />All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation worldwide. Ship registers impose obligations on owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state. I am advised that the practice of using flags of convenience involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements is still permissible under international law. Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by surveyors from the marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port-state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring, <i>inter alia</i>, that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation. Identified deficiencies are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues on its journey. At present, seafarers' social conditions come under the rubric of various international labour organisation maritime conventions.</P>
    <P>During port state control inspections ship-board working and living conditions are examined. Ships can be detained where matters requiring immediate remedy are found. At any given time a large number of ships operating within the Union area have undergone an inspection by an EU port state in the previous six months. Under the port-state control regime aspects of working and living conditions on board merchant vessels are inspected. They are storage and sufficiency of food; cleanliness of galley and storage spaces; arrangements for holding, making and storing water; catering department equipment; cleanliness and habitability of accommodation spaces; adequacy of ventilation, heating and lighting in accommodation; adequacy and cleanliness of sanitary facilities; and adequacy of hospital accommodation, if required.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department's surveyors inspected 194 non-Irish registered vessels which had not been inspected in the previous six months under port state control &ndash; 21 vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions. My Department has no inspection or regulatory function in relation to the pay of crews on ships visiting Irish ports &ndash; their pay is a matter for negotiation between the crew and their employer.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the member states increasingly concern themselves with maritime transport issues. In that context, the framing of a maritime social policy and the consolidation of EU seafarer training systems may feature. The Senator's motion reflects concerns given force by the wreck of the <i>Erika </i>which, <i>inter alia</i>, focused attention on sub-standard ships and the spread of open shipping registers or &ldquo;flags of convenience&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At Union level, there is growing appreciation that the social conditions of operating ships are essential components of maritime transport <Col N="105" /> safety. In that regard, the Commission has published two directives of relevance to the Senator's motion. One is on the Organisation of Working Time for Seafarers, which is the EU formalisation of an agreement reached between the Federation of Transport Workers Union and the European Community Shipowners Association in a Council directive. The second directive concerns the enforcement, by means of inspections, of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board ships calling at Union ports. Both directives will be effective from 30 June 2002. Officials in my Department are engaged in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the modalities for implementing the directives. The matter is receiving priority attention.</P>
    <P>The framing of a maritime social policy and the consolidation of EU seafarer training systems could well be of value to this country. The Government is developing a state-of-the-art national maritime college in Ringaskiddy, which will, naturally, graduate only highly qualified seafarers. Any proposals which mandate higher standards of training for seafarers operating on ships in European trade will certainly benefit Ireland's well qualified seafarers.</P>
    <P>I have outlined for the Senator the limits of my power with respect to the pay of seafarers on visiting ships &ndash; flag is not an issue in that regard. My Department's role in conducting port state control inspections has also been spelt out. Those inspections are rigorously conducted and Ireland is most certainly fulfilling its international obligations under applicable relevant maritime conventions and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and I accept the point he made about pay. I should not have raised it. I accept it is not a matter for the Department &ndash; it can be dealt with in another way. In respect of the Minister's comment that he is advised that the practice of using flags of convenience involving what are perceived as lenient regulatory requirements is still permissible under international law, I agree, but in his international engagements, will the Minister bring to bear his power, which he outlined in his response, to ensure it cannot be a way of exploiting workers or becoming anti-competitive with other people in the industry?</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I am particularly pleased the Minister, Deputy Fahey, is here to address the issue. In 1997 he opened the new secondary school in Tulla. I remind Senator O'Toole that the school was built when Gemma Hussey was Minister. The education process in Tulla has developed and has gone from strength to strength. The school's educational acumen is <Col N="106" /> widely recognised throughout County Clare. There are 510 students enrolled and 37 teachers.</P>
      <P>Tulla, as the Minister knows, is adjacent to Ennis. It is developing rapidly and will continue to do so in the future. There is a need for a new school. The current school sits on two acres, which is very small given that it accommodates 500 students. The plans are to accommodate at least 700 students. Given the history of the area in the past decade, this figure is likely to reach 1,000. Therefore, a new school on a greenfield site is required, with adequate space for expansion and the provision of proper sporting facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department has sanctioned an extension to the existing school, which is not considered satisfactory by the parents or the teachers associated with it. They are concerned that it will not meet future requirements. Currently, there are 510 students, but there is much congestion in the school &ndash; freedom of movement in the school, both for students and teachers, is restricted. The school does not meet health and safety requirements at present, nor does it meet wheelchair accessibility requirements. There is a huge deficit in this regard.</P>
      <P>The parents and teachers have examined the issue of a new school. I understand there is a site of almost nine or ten acres available adjacent to the village. The Minister will meet the parents' and teachers' representatives next Thursday. I ask the Minister, Deputy Fahey, to convey to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, the need to urgently review the matter with regard to building a new school on this site. An issue of cost will arise, but the difference in cost between extending the old school and building a new school may be only in excess of £500,000. It would be wise to investigate this because it would be money very well invested. The site is available and the matter has only to be cleared with the Department.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister examine the matter urgently? Currently the circumstances that obtain are totally unsatisfactory, both for teachers and pupils. The matter pertaining to the extension is an urban response to a rural problem &ndash; Tulla is a rural area. The children that attend the school there are from a rural background. I suggest to the Minister that the proposed extension &ndash; a three-storey building &ndash; is not suitable and there is no guarantee that Clare County Council will issue planning permission for that type of structure because it would not be in keeping with structures in the environs of the Tulla area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to problems that may arise concerning planning permission, there is a real need to examine what is in store for the area in the future. There are predictions that Clare and the triangular area of Shannon, Ennis and Limerick will advance dramatically. Ennis is the fastest growing town in Ireland, if not in Europe. There is a spill-over into Tulla from that development. The number of new residents in the Tulla area is significant. I forecast optimistically that in ten years' <Col N="107" /> time there will be at least 1,000 students availing of secondary education in Tulla. It is important that the right decision is taken now. If the decision is taken to proceed with the extension, as proposed, I can assure the Minister that it will not be adequate in ten years. If this occurs, a greenfield site will have to be found then. To use the money to build an extension now would be a misuse of money. It would be much more prudent and a wise financial investment to spend it on developing a school on a greenfield site. It would afford the children better educational opportunities and enhance the attractiveness of Tulla as an area for people settling in Clare.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister the proposal to erect a new school on a greenfield site. I hope, before he meets the deputation next Thursday, he will revisit the issue in the Department with a view to accepting the proposal.</P>

      <P>The Department received an application for additional accommodation from the trustees of the school. A senior inspector from the Department of Education and Science visited the school and, following an inspection, drew up the schedule of overall accommodation based on a long-term projected enrolment figure of 500 pupils. Schedules of residual accommodation and suggested future use of existing accommodation were also drawn up. The schedule of suggested future use showed most room could be stetted. The schedules were forwarded to the school for agreement and were agreed by the school authorities.</P>

      <Col N="108" />Nominations for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning on an extension of 990 m² to cater for the residual accommodation were then forwarded to the school authorities. They requested that the Department of Education and Science look at the possibility of providing a new school on a greenfield site before commencement of the process with the extension project.</P>
    <P>A consultant architect was appointed to carry out a feasibility study on the school to look at all options. An initial feasibility study with four options was received in the Department with a recommendation that a site capable of catering for the school and its recreational needs be purchased. The report was examined by officials in the Department of Education and Science and, in consultation with the school authorities and the consultant architect, it was agreed that the preferred option was an extension on the existing site. The consultant architect was then requested to carry out a further feasibility study to examine this option.</P>
    <P>The second study was recently examined from an architectural, educational and value for money point of view by officials in the building unit of the Department and approval was given for an extension on the existing site as originally deemed necessary. Officials in the building unit of the Department of Education and Science will be in contact with the school authorities shortly with regard to the commencement of architectural planning for the extension in question.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 October 2001.</P>
