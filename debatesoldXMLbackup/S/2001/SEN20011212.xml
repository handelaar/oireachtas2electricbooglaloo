      <P>I have received notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the reasons for the reduction in Garda personnel at Newport Garda station, County Mayo, and the reason the sergeant who retired there some years ago has not been replaced.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason the Minister's list of chiropodists has been closed with the result that GMS patients, some with serious systemic conditions, have problems getting treatment.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ó Fearghail of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide funding for a new sewage treatment plant to service the Curragh Camp and its environs together with the villages of Brownstown, Suncroft and Cutbush, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the operation of community policing, which is causing serious concern in rural areas due to the low number of Garda personnel available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Chambers, Henry and Ó Fearghail and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator <Col N="1402" /> O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2, motions re Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee Stage; No. 5, Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; Nos. 6 and 7, motions re adoption of the draft EU framework decisions on combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant which will each be debated for one hour with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 22, motion No. 18 re school attendance, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter. Business shall be interrupted between 1 p.m. and 2.15 p.m.</P>

      <P>I am a little concerned that there is an overload of business today having spent a large part of the session often with only two or three hours business in the course of a day. It looks as if we will be going halfway through the night on the business being prescribed. Is it necessary to take Nos. 6 and 7 today, as they will only take one hour each and we could end up taking them at 2 a.m.? It is not a particularly good way to do business, a point I made to the Leader earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>Approximately four weeks ago I mentioned to the Leader that the Dáil will shortly publish a major series of reforms to the way in which it does its business. The Leader informed me that he would establish a high powered committee to examine matters in this House. Has it been established? Who are its members? How often has it met? Will it make an interim report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday there were expressions of condolence to the family of Detective Sergeant Eiffe who was killed last week. We were not associated with them at the time because I was not clear on the protocol. Protocol should be established in these situations regarding when, where and how. I pass on our condolences and wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Detective Sergeant Eiffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree completely with the point made by Senator Manning. Business was completed yesterday at a time which could have been antici<Col N="1403" /> pated and we could have ensured that some of today's business would have been dealt with yesterday. We are overloaded with business today. I do not know why we cannot defer some of this business, try to plan our business according to a diary with starting times for issues and then come back to them. It is not acceptable that Members should have to deal with this amount of business in a day. The sheer amount of reading involved in keeping up with that amount of business makes it nearly impossible.</P>
    <P>We have raised on a number of occasions recently the need for a debate on Northern Ireland. Some weeks ago we in this House welcomed the establishment of the new police service in Northern Ireland. We wished it well and spoke about the need to maintain trust and confidence in it. This morning's news about the murder-assassination of William Stobie, probably by the UDA, raises huge questions about the Pat Finucane issue. It is something that we have dealt with and referred to here on many occasions. I raise it on this occasion because I believe that we should request a member of Government to come in here and discuss this matter with us with a view to us demanding an independent inquiry. This is important, not to satisfy the needs of any particular side but to ensure that there is not a continued erosion of trust and confidence in the new police service. Measures should be taken immediately and we should move forward.</P>
    <P>There is a nest of vipers within this whole Finucane affair. The truth has not emerged and there is a huge need for it to emerge before it becomes a political football. It is in the interests of all right thinking people that the facts are put before us, that people can reach their own conclusions and that those who are guilty of offences are brought to justice. This is no way to handle these affairs. This man goes into the dock, threatens to expose the police and a couple of weeks later he is murdered. It raises questions which must be answered. Thank you for your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh. This is a matter of huge concern and we do not need to feed into it. I do not want to be seen to be taking the side of anybody on this issue. I speak as a citizen who voted on the Good Friday Agreement and who is committed to making the police service work. All of us who feel strongly about it should be insisting on this matter. I ask the Government to make clear its position on it and to seek an independent inquiry on the Pat Finucane assassination.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter you raised, Senator O'Toole, there is a Standing Order which sets out how expressions of sympathy should be dealt with in the House. The matter was not dealt with yesterday in accordance with that Standing Order but when it was raised <Col N="1404" /> I felt that it would not be appropriate for me to interrupt the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the previous two speakers in relation to today's Order of Business. The Leader is overwhelming us with business today. This is unnecessary considering we are sitting four days this week, and we sat four days last week. I would have preferred an opportunity of discussing item 1, which deals with third country nationals, the matter I raised on the Order of Business yesterday in terms of economic refugees. Yesterday all sides of the House expressed a desire to have a debate on the question of immigration.</P>
      <P>The last three items on today's Order of Business, Nos. 5, 6 and 7, are part of an anti-terrorism package. They have to do with extradition, European arrest warrants and the Council framework decision on combating terrorism. In the context of all the discussions we have had and all that has happened since the terrible New York tragedy, which happened virtually three months ago, all this deserves to be debated on its own rather than be taken after what will be a very lengthy debate on No. 3, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill. The Order of Business, as presented, is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole, I call for a debate on Northern Ireland. What is happening there is extremely alarming. We dealt with the bigger picture in dealing with decommissioning and the institutions, but the smaller picture of what is happening within communities is being neglected. It is not just the assassination of William Stobie, but also the recent fatal shootings in south Armagh. There is a sense of isolation and frustration in different communities, particularly loyalist ones. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should come to the House in order that we can have a full debate. The Good Friday Agreement is up and running in the broad framework, but at micro level nothing is happening. This is one of the most serious matters facing us today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the Pat Finucane case on several occasions and again ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the appropriate Minister. This morning's statement from the Finucane family was magnanimous in every sense. They do not want anyone killed or prosecuted in Pat Finucane's name.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Ed Moloney on the radio this morning it is evident that unless clarification is given, the revelations, now coming to the fore, will be misrepresented, not help peace and, certainly, the development of harmony on this island. A debate on the matter in a positive and responsible manner would be well worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I go from one extreme to the other because I am worried about problems in <Col N="1405" /> Cork. A commitment was given last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that money would be allocated for the upgrading of Cork inner city. Sources on the Government side now tell us that the £5 million given for Patrick Street is being withdrawn. This is a £14 million project over an 18 month period. It is disturbing that the Minister states no money is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Cork inner city is rapidly deteriorating and it is sad that other places have had money committed to them, such as £300 million to O'Connell Street in Dublin. Are we again leaving inner cities and towns to deteriorate because of the Minister's lack of commitment? May we have an explanation of the reason the £5 million was withdrawn this year from the country's second city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland. Senator Costello put his finger on one difficult point. It would be helpful if we could understand the disaffection in loyalist areas and the real danger that the people living there will lose faith in the democratic process. It is important that they are on side.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Ó Murchú's request for a focused debate on the necessity of holding an inquiry into the whole Finucane affair. I held this off for a long time in the hope someone would be brought to justice by the ordinary process, but that now appears impossible as a result of this morning's events. It is time to investigate the matter as it is something to which the Finucane family are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Senator Hayes I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. Previously, when such a call was made, we sometimes said it was not the right time. I was in Belfast last Thursday and, clearly, there are trends that put at risk the great hopes we had so recently. Senators Hayes, who is so close to matters in the North, and Ó Murchú spoke of the need for a debate, which would be useful.</P>
      <P>Shopkeepers are sometimes accused of reminding us of how few days there are left to Christmas, but the are 19 days to the euro changeover. The news yesterday that the EU Commission fined five German banks over &euro;100 million for collusion in a cartel operation reminds us that with the coming of the euro not all steps such as the charges for inter-country cheques seem to be happening. This is not due to the EU but to collusion among the banks. The Central Bank and the Minister for Finance should ensure that Irish banks are aware of the steps that can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Ms Quill Ms Quill">
      <NameTxt>Ms Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support all those who asked for an early debate on Northern Ireland. The situation is very brittle at the moment in relation to the future of the Police Authority. We are full of hope and we are making real progress on certain <Col N="1406" /> fronts but, as Senator Costello said, at the level of community relationships and eradication of old sectarian practices we do not seem to be making much progress. It should be a subject for rational debate in this House in the hope that at this remove we can come up with some kind of wisdom that will enable the agenda to move forward.</P>
      <P>I support the call made by Senator Cregan for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to be invited to this House so that we can raise with him the issue of the promised funding for the refurbishment of Patrick Street. There was a clear understanding that funding would be forthcoming for that project. The planning is in place and now we find at the last minute that the money does not seem to be available. It is a very urgent issue and does merit an early debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader what the Government intends to do about the provision of accessible transport for the very many students with disabilities who are totally reliant on a service which has been starved of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has consistently raised the Pat Finucane case in this House, I welcome Senator O'Toole's call this morning for an independent public inquiry. I would like that to be extended to include the cases of Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and my wife's cousin, Patrick Shanahan, who was murdered. There has always been grave suspicions in relation to involvement by the security forces in that murder. Now is also the time for release of information to the Relatives for Justice. I wonder why William Stobie was murdered today. I have grave suspicions that it is to divert attention from the ombudsman's report which will be released this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the serious and solemn things said from the other side that there is a great deal of misgiving about the situation in the North. It would be wise for us to have a debate at this juncture. The case against Mr. Stobie collapsed because of psychological pressure on a witness. That seems to be a very sinister development. One always listens with great respect to what Senator Maurice Hayes has to say because of his wide experience in this area. He mentions the possibility that the loyalists may lose faith in the democratic process, particularly with regard to the policing issue, and I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Members of this Parliament who can do something about it. Thankfully they are not yet Members of this House but they are in the other House. I speak of members of Sinn Féin. How can anybody have confidence when Sinn Féin buses a collection of louts into Crossmaglen who attack the police station and leave at least one member of the re-named police force <Col N="1407" /> seriously ill with third-degree burns? What kind of Christmas will that man have? What kind of signal does it send out when a democratic party organises this kind of insurrection? It is simply intolerable and this House should include this incident in the debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland. I support Senator Bonner's request for an inquiry into the Rosemary Nelson and Hamill cases. In deference to Senator Hayes I agree it is vital for the Unionist community to be kept on side in the matter. We must be seen to be even-handed. There are also serious questions to be answered on this side of the Border in relation to murders involving members of the Northern Ireland Judiciary and the RUC in transit across the Border. We would do a service to the entire process if these matters were investigated further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate what is happening with the Education Disabilities Bill? There was a long discussion on a radio programme this morning about a Bill that I certainly have not seen and I believe has not been published. When will we see it? In relation to disability legislation in general, it is appalling to see that people have to protest at the gates of Leinster House in support of the vantastic scheme, which is totally under-funded. It is vital that we address the issues of mobility and access to transportation for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>In ordering business for the House will the Leader affirm to the relevant Ministers how important it is for them to attend in dealing with their legislation? I have the greatest respect for Ministers who are good enough to come to the House and participate in our debates. However, it is very disconcerting for the Opposition to put time and effort into preparing to discuss legislation and then find the relevant Minister is not present. There is no continuity in the arguments presented, which are answered by a different Minister. This does not result in good legislation. To coin a phrase, it handicaps the whole system and leads me to believe that what I say will not be listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those of other Senators who have asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. Given that we will be here next week, it could take place then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House in order that we can ask for an extension of operating licences to other radio stations, many of which have been closed down in recent weeks. One station is not sufficient to cover the demands of listeners in a region. We have had local radio for some time and it is extraordinary that we are limited to just one station in <Col N="1408" /> some regions. I hope the Minister will direct the Independent Radio and Television Commission to be more open to new licences being sought in order to encourage rural and regional broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to what Senator Keogh said, Ministers do not have a right, but an obligation to be present in the House. I agree that occasionally the relevant Ministers have not come and been replaced by others. However, during the last two Seanads, Ministers have attended on an exceptionally regular basis and done a very good job. There were also times when Ministers failed to attend and the House had to adjourn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about progress on Dáil reform. I understand the matter will come before the Dáil in the next session. We are reviewing our own processes. I have consulted Senator Manning and will consult the other leaders in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Ó Murchú, Hayes, Quinn, Bonner, Norris, Glennon and Jackman called for a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly the tragic death this morning. I have no difficulty in arranging that before the Christmas recess. We will have statements on asylum seekers on Friday and on the tragedy which unfolded in Wexford.</P>
      <P>Senators Denis Cregan and Quill called on the Minister for the Environment ad Local Government to invest money in Cork, particularly in Patrick Street. I will pass their views to the Minister. Two Ministers who can be relied on to deliver to Cork are the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn sought clarification on the additional charges for euro cheques. I listened with great interest to a programme this morning which partly dealt with that issue. It seems that all future transactions in Europe, which financial institutions are encouraging, will be electronic. The banks will charge for cheques used between countries. I will pass Senator Quinn's views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators Coghlan and Keogh asked about the Disabilities Bill. I understand it will come before the House in the next session. Senator Keogh also asked about Ministers being present in the House. Ministers and Ministers of State have certain responsibilities in Departments. We have endeavoured to have Ministers present and we have been successful. If a Minister is not available to take Second Stage because another Bill for which he or she is responsible is in the other House, we endeavour to have him or her here on Committee and Remaining Stages. I accept the reason the request was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass Senator Jackman's views on local <Col N="1409" /> radio to the Minister for Public Enterprise. The local radios which are not licensed are the obvious choice of the listener. We should have more local choice radios.</P>

      <P>All three speakers on this side of the House asked about the overloading of today's Order of Business, which needs to be changed. <Col N="1410" /> Will the Leader consider taking two or three items on Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with the Opposition yesterday to take only Committee Stage of No. 25 because, in its opinion, it was an overloaded agenda. I envisage the House sitting until midnight tonight and tomorrow night because it is close to Christmas.</P>

      <P>As the substance of the debate on Committee Stage will relate to the First and Second Schedules to the Bill, it would be appropriate to have those Schedules decided upon before deciding on section 1 of the Bill which actually provides for the insertion of the text in the Constitution. I suggest the House postpone consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill until after the First and Second Schedules have been disposed of. This is a procedure adopted on Committee Stage in the Seanad in the case of previous Bills to amend the Constitution and which, I suggest, would lend itself to a more logically ordered debate. I formally ask the Leader of the House, therefore, to move, in accordance with Standing Order 107, that consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the First and Second Schedules have been disposed of.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; from the beginning of the proposed Article 40.3.4º and substitute the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection 3º.&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; when used in the proposed Article 40.3.4º makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amendment, if enacted, is not intended to be a restatement of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as used in Article 40.3.3º. The Supreme Court when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution must follow the well established principle of harmonious interpretation laid down by the courts. In other words, constitutional provisions should not be construed in isolation from all other parts of the Constitution among which they are imbed<Col N="1412" /> ded, but should be so construed as to harmonise with other parts of the Constitution. Therefore, neither of these Articles can be regarded as taking precedence over the other, they must be construed together. If the term &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; was used, it would change the nature of the relationship between Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º and suggest that the latter Article was to be construed independently of Article 40.3.3º rather in harmony with it. It is also worth repeating that Article 40.3.3º always envisaged that the Legislature would make laws and that it has been criticised in the past by the Judiciary for not having enacted such legislation. The legislation envisaged in these proposals will address this particular criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister subscribe to the principle of harmonious interpretation of the Constitution. The legislative part of this amendment to the Constitution, which my party believes is in breach of the Constitution, suggests that we will specifically say that people will not be prosecuted in this State for travelling outside it to do something that would be an offence in the State. If something was ever out of harmony with the Constitution it is the establishment of this principle. Section 4(2) of the Second Schedule states: &ldquo;This Act does not operate to restrict any person from travelling to another state on the ground that his or her intended conduct there would, if it occurred in the State, constitute an offence. . . &rdquo;  This is the classical Irish mix-up on the issue of abortion. To pretend that we are superior to the rest of the world, we make something illegal here but then we export it to somewhere else in the world and say that under no circumstances will we use our law or Constitution to stop people travelling there.</P>
      <P>If there was ever anything which brought the whole sense of constitutional order into disharmony it is the establishment of this principle in our Constitution. Essentially, for the sake of making a political statement about what the Government wants to do, we are writing into our Constitution the right to commit an offence as long as it is not committed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an exercise in monumental hypocrisy and a left-over from the X case. It is an issue we should have had the political courage to deal with but instead we are inserting further assertions of the fact that we will not prosecute a person who tries to get around it outside the State. Although we regard this issue as so fundamental and important that we propose to amend the Constitution, we are putting in a provision, via this Bill, to get around it. In terms of the Constitution, how can that be? There is a procedure for dealing with the law and breaches of it. We essentially propose to write into the Constitution, via this Bill, a statement which says we will make it a constitutional offence to do something but we also propose to write into it that if the person goes over the border to do so she will not be punished. That is fundamental conflict. It is proposed to be put into <Col N="1413" /> the Constitution because it is considered very important, but what we are saying to everybody is that we really do not mean it and we will not prosecute if the person goes outside the State.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the political, ethical and other complications that hang around this issue. My lack of sympathy is with the idea that this Bill as drafted will somehow get around those issues. It introduces explicitly a contradiction between what our Constitution should be and its implementation through law in this State. We say that the offence will carry a 12 year sentence if committed here but if committed outside the State, even though we regard it as a horrendous offence, it will not carry any punishment. If we ever wanted to introduce disharmony into the Constitution that is how to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make an issue out of the amendment although I have obviously confused the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has not confused me. He has made general comments about the wider issues in the Bill which are not specific to this amendment. The Senator's amendment wants to replace the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; with &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;. It is a technical legal point and is the same amendment that was tabled by the Labour Party on Committee Stage in the Dáil. The arguments made there were in a constitutional context and related to the appropriateness or otherwise of the words &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;. The argument made then was that the new Article 40.3.4º would somehow take precedence over Article 40.3.3º. We argued that this is not the case and that both Articles had to be read together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the wider points which we will deal with later in other amendments and sections of the Bill, the right to travel is an issue which has clearly been decided on by the people in previous referenda. The proposal we are making refers to this jurisdiction, but it also takes cognisance of decisions the people have taken in relation to the right to travel and the right to information. Talking about harmony, we will go back to the people who will ultimately decide on this. It is in that context that the Supreme Court, if ultimately faced with any issues arising from these Articles in the Constitution, would adjudicate, but it would be on the basis that the people would have decided, one way or the other, on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether these two subsections of the Article can be seen to be in harmony because there seems to be a great deal of concern among constitutional lawyers about how they will be interpreted. I wonder if a particular point has been put to the Minister. He said several times that he does not want them to affect the use of the morning after pill, which is used as an important form of emergency contraception. He also said he does not want them to affect the use of the post-coital intrauterine device. It has been put to me, not by members of the medical <Col N="1414" /> profession, who had thought that with the announcement of this legislation the legality of the morning after pill and post-coital intrauterine device were ensured, that this is not the case and that these two subsections of Article 40 will be read one after the other.</P>
      <P>Subsection 4º uses the words &ldquo;in particular,&rdquo; which is of importance. It leaves in place the existing constitutional provision, which is in place to protect the unborn. It is important to remember that the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; has not been defined. Article 40.3.3º states, &ldquo;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; has never been defined in legislation or any of the constitutional amendments brought forward, but we have said that the State is obliged to defend and vindicate the rights of the unborn.</P>
      <P>Subsection 4º of the First Schedule states, &ldquo;In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.&rdquo; The legal advice I am getting &ndash; I would like the Minister to be able to tell me that he has not heard it &ndash; is that this leaves Article 40.3.3º as still covering the unborn from the time of conception and as the Minister is obliged to vindicate and protect the life of the unborn, that would mean protecting it from the use of the morning after pill and intrauterine device.</P>
      <P>These are most serious issues from the medical profession's point of view &ndash; nothing could be more serious. Initially, the Minister's interpretation was that there would be no challenge, following the introduction of this amendment to the Constitution, to the use of the morning after pill or the intrauterine device inserted post-coitally. We know both issues are extremely important in trying to reduce the incidence of abortion here, which, as Senator Ryan said, is perfectly acceptable once it is exported to England. This is a most important issue which we need to have clarifed at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be awkward, but the Minister sent me off on a tangent about the harmonious interpretation of the Constitution and, on this one, I blame him for my slight aberration. Although I would never give them the exclusive right to be heard on these issues, it is helpful to hear members of the profession talk about them. The point made by Senator Henry is extremely valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were down this road before when assurances were given to us about what a particular phrase in Article 40.3.3º meant. Serious questions were raised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the then Attorney General about it. That advice was ignored and we ended up in a mess from which we are still trying to extricate ourselves. Some eminent individuals hold the <Col N="1415" /> view that the phraseology proposed could well mean that there could be a successful legal challenge to the use of IUDs and the morning after pill because of the implications of what Senator Henry said, if Article 40.3.3º is more broad ranging than Article 40.3.4º. The broader range of Article 40.3.3º would encapsulate unborn life from the moment of conception, if we do not define it otherwise. While Article 40.3.4º would deal with specific practices and circumstances, the scope of Article 40.3.3º would stretch beyond it. That is a perfectly reasonable interpretation put by a practising medical practitioner, much better than I could put it. It deserves a precise technical answer, not a bland assurance that this is not what it means. This is a very serious question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues. An important point has been unearthed and drawn to the Minister's attention. It underlines the point made by many of us on this side of the House, that the Constitution is not the appropriate place for the articulation of this kind of material. I have been convinced by what I have heard from my colleagues on this side of the House. If this subsection is left unattended, it will affect the use of the intrauterine device and morning after pill in which there is an irony. The Minister is shaking his head, but legal opinion has been put on the record and we have to take it seriously. This seems ironic when Levonelle, one of the main morning after pills, has been licensed. It seems there is a clear contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill that in any way legally prohibits the use of the morning after pill or IUD. The key point was made by Senator's Henry, that we do not define the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;. The Bill is about defining the crime of abortion. It does not define when human life begins.</P>
      <P>One of the major criticisms of the Oireachtas during the years in the aftermath of the 1983 amendment, which states that the State may, through its legislation, protect and vindicate those rights as between mother and child, is that the Legislature did not legislate for this. That brings us back to Senator Ryan's point. In many respects it was an absence of fleshing out Article 40.3.3º in the form of legislation that left the matter to the Supreme Court to decide and the Oireachtas never bothered endeavouring to legislate. Even after 1992 when there was a series of three referenda on travel, information and the substantive issue, the Legislature for one reason or another did not legislate on the matter. Why did it not legislate for the judgment in the X case, which it had the option to do? Different parties forming different Governments have been in power since 1992, but none took up the complex issue of whether we should legislate for the judgment in the X case and not go back to the people by way of a referendum on a constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, it could be strongly argued that there <Col N="1416" /> are many inside and outside the Oireachtas who are strongly of the view that we should not bypass the people on this issue because it can be articulated that they have a strong desire to have a say and that the Oireachtas, on its own, because of what has happened since 1983, should not arrogantly decide on it. It is for that reason we have decided upon this constitutional legal framework to introduce legislation &ndash; the first legislative response to the issue &ndash; which will have the protection of the Constitution. The mechanism devised is one which will facilitate us to go the people while also setting out in some detail the practicalities of legislating on the issue.</P>
    <P>The point must be made, therefore, that one could not establish a criminal law prohibiting abortion. The point of conception is indefinable. It is a process that can take up to ten days, or even 14 as Senator Henry remarked on Second Stage. Article 40.3.3º includes the phrase &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. It is not practicable to enact a law with a view to establishing whether a crime has taken place, in terms of abortion, or a case to be prosecuted within 14 days. That is impracticable. Clearly the morning after pill and IUD are not abortifacients. It has been argued that they prevent&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been cogently argued that they prevent pregnancy from occurring. The purpose of the Bill is to define abortion and the crime of abortion. Its function is to update and modernise the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861. We are reliant on regulation in this area from an Act enacted over 140 years ago. The 25th Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, is the first modern statute attempted by the Oireachtas in this field. The Bill states, &ldquo;In this Act, &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman.&rdquo;  The use of the word &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the people have expressed the desire to have their say but I am not sure he will like what they have to say. I do not believe this referendum will be carried. That may suit the Government very well because it will have satisfied the demands of the Independent Members in the other House and by putting this to referendum they will have put it outside the range of future referendums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I listened to the Minister it worried me more and more that the unborn is not defined. The Bill defines what is an abortion. It also defines what are approved places, medical practitioners and reasonable opinions. It even defines what a woman is, and even I have a general idea of what a woman is. The one thing the Bill does not define is that which the Act is supposed to protect. I do not understand how this can be done. How can it be that legislation designed to <Col N="1417" /> protect something defines everything else but does not define that which it is supposed to protect &ndash; the unborn? It seems that by using a vague phrase like that it would be possible to include IUD and the morning after pill. I am worried about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly reject that. We are defining abortion&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not protecting the abortion, we are protecting the unborn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the strongest protection in legislation yet for the unborn. It is being defined from the perspective of the practicable application of the law. It is being done as and from or after implantation.</P>
      <P>The issue of defining human life is one on which Thomas Aquinas and many others, going back thousands of years, have had different views. Tortuous intellectual debate has taken place on that issue. We would be here for a long time if we were to enter into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed we may be. The Minister has not answered my question. I am not saying the post-coital intra-uterine device or the morning after pill are abortifacients. I do not think either of them is. Both act by making the lining of the uterus inhospitable to the implantation of the fertilised egg. Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º will be read one after the other. They cannot be looked at separately. Article 40.3.3º will still mean that in protecting and vindicating the rights of the unborn, the morning after pill and the intra-uterine device, used post-coitally, are not legal. Both of those methods make it impossible for the fertilised egg to be implanted.</P>
      <P>No one would be happier than me to see implantation being taken as the beginning of a pregnancy. I spent a great deal of time during the referendum debate in 1983 saying that it was impractical to try to continue to protect the life of the fertilised egg. About 50% of eggs are naturally lost after fertilisation, they cannot be protected. Another 10% to 15% probably begin to implant but do not do so properly and are also lost. Only about 30% can implant and continue for some weeks towards a pregnancy. At 12 weeks, between 20% and 25% of them are lost and further losses occur as the pregnancy continues. It is a continuum or, if it is preferred, it can be looked at in stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister keeps talking about the two sections being taken in harmony but I think they will be taken in sequence. Has the Minister received advice to clarify the use of &ldquo;in particular&rdquo;? It makes a difference between the two sections. This is very important. A very large number in the medical profession feel that the morning after pill and the intra-uterine device, used post-coitally, are protected by this legislation but I do not think they are. The Minister did not mention that in his reply to me. I wrote in <Col N="1418" /> an article that they were protected and received a lot of responses which said I was wrong. Other people are thinking this as well. There must be some cause for concern. One cannot go to the people and say that methods of contraception which have been acceptable here for years will no longer be acceptable if the Articles are read one after the other. I am obviously not making myself clear as the Minister is looking very puzzled. This is a most serious issue.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, these methods of contraception are not approved by substantial numbers of people who hold that human life begins at conception. I will not argue with that, people are entitled to hold that view. Philosophies differ as to when human life begins. St. Thomas Aquinas said it started at 40 days for a male foetus and 90 days for a female. This is an issue which is based on philosophy. The public and medical profession have got to know clearly if the morning after pill will be legal or illegal if this legislation is enacted. If the referendum is carried it will be put into law and cannot be referred to the Supreme Court by the President.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting criminal cases can be taken regarding this, or that people will be described as having procured abortions for women because they prescribed the morning after pill or intra-uterine device. Nor am I suggesting that women could have criminal cases taken against them. I am seeking clarity on this issue. Based on the legal advice I have received, the Attorney General could take civil cases. Members will remember that SPUC took legal action against students who provided information about abortion. This is a legal nightmare. It will be members of my profession who will prescribe the morning after pill or the IUD, or members of my gender who can be prosecuted &ndash; in civil cases, not criminal &ndash; because they used such methods.</P>

      <P>Nobody could be as clear as Senator Henry about the matters she has raised and we will continue to raise them throughout the debate. The Minister repeatedly referred to the principle of harmonious interpretation of the Constitution in the Dáil. This is where the issue begins and ends. The Minister has stated we are in agreement with the Supreme Court if it interprets Article 40.3.3º in conjunction with Article 40.3.4º.</P>

      <P>If that is the premise, there must be definitions and there is no point in saying otherwise. I will raise the need for a definition of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; time and again in later amendments. The Minister may say it is not relevant to the legislation and that he is dealing with abortion, although there is also no specific definition of that term. Let us go back to the definition of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;. An unfertilised ovum is unborn, but does it enjoy the protection of the Constitution? Every issue we will debate today <Col N="1419" /> and tomorrow depends on the interpretation of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and if we cannot satisfy ourselves in the House that we know exactly when life begins, which, in turn, leads to what Senator Henry said regarding the morning after pill, conception, etc., we will not get anywhere. We will only make a complicated issue much more complicated when it comes to explaining what is to be put before the people in a referendum. It is not too late for the Minister to provide a definition in order that we can work on specifics when we address other aspects of the Bill in later amendments.</P>

      <P>During the hearings of the all-party committee on the Constitution I asked a number of witnesses, including a number of senior obstetricians and gynaecologists, when life begins and nobody could give me an answer. Whether we follow the St. Thomas Aquinas doctrine or any other, it is impossible for any Government to define when life begins. The legislation defines &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; clearly under the interpretation of statute using the long-standing maxim,<i> inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,</i> which means that if one thing is included, others are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a lay person and far be it from me to argue with Senator Henry. However, the IUD and the morning after pill are widely used, despite Article 40.3.3º being in place for some years, and there has never been an attempt to prosecute any woman who took that course of action in a criminal or civil case. We must not divert the thrust of the legislation, which is clear regarding abortion and implantation. Trying to introduce the vague notion that someone who might use the IUD or the morning after pill could be guilty in a criminal or civil sense is wide of the <Col N="1420" /> mark. The Bill is clear in regard to what it proposes to define. If anything, by stating what is abortion and the penalties involved, we are clearing the way for the use of the IUD and the morning after pill. Perhaps I am wrong, but it would be impractical, if not impossible, to prosecute any woman for using these products on a civil or criminal basis as it would be virtually impossible for the Director of Public Prosecutions to gather any evidence.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, those who supported that amendment never believed that it would be interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean effectively the opposite of what they sought. Let us not pretend there is certainty about the meanings of words in the Constitution. We are trying to eliminate uncertainty where we know that in terms of how legal people examine these sections there is clear uncertainty. Where there is such uncertainty, we have no guarantee regarding how it will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator O'Donovan's contribution, a considerable number of those who lobbied the Government successfully to hold a further referendum on abortion are firmly on the record as believing that both the IUD and morning after pill are abortifacients. That is their clearly held position, which they have made public on many occasions during the past 20 years. This legislation is part of their agenda. Some of them, as the Minister knows better than I, do not agree with his approach because they think it is not conservative enough. His approach is too liberal and they do not like it, but if the legislation is passed, they will turn their attention to questions about the morning after pill and IUD because they have a singular obsession with keeping this country different. It does not matter what happens to Irish people abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, the next two stages will be to try to get Article 40.3.3º used to provide a constitutional basis for a prohibition on each of these, particularly if increasing scientific evidence shows that both act in a way which prevents implantation, which is what most people think they do <Col N="1421" /> anyway, although nobody seems to be quite certain. Once they come to that stage, that will be the target and it will be a consistent campaign. If people listen politically to them on this issue, they will listen to them again and we will have further constraints imposed.</P>
    <P>That is what this is about. It is not about the niceties of language. It is about the political response to a campaign that has been unswerving in this country for 30 years and it is quite clear what will be next. The immediate issue was a referendum. That, they see, may be out of the way. The next issue will be devices which they regard as abortifacients. I do not regard them as abortifacients and the Minister does not regard them as abortifacients, but they will use the language of the Constitution in exactly the same way as the X case arose. They did not envisage that 15 year old children or younger children would be injuncted by the Attorney General but that is what happened. I am certain that they will not go away and they will begin on the next stage of the campaign to have what they regard as abortifacients included because they will see that brief period between the fertilisation of an ovum and implantation as the area where the unborn is vulnerable. They will see IUDs and morning after pills as the techniques that are used to exploit that vulnerability and that is where they will go to next.</P>
    <P>If that is what the Minister wants, so be it. If it is not what he wants, then he cannot just wave away the genuine concerns which have been articulated by Senator Henry and have obviously been articulated to her by people who understand constitutional law well.</P>

      <P>The House can rest assured that I have had available to me the strongest constitutional advice on these issues, and particularly on the utilisation of the term &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; in the relevant section which is subject to the amendment.

      <P>What we are bringing in actually strengthens or clarifies the position and makes it <Col N="1422" /> far more certain than it was. Article 40.3.3º makes it very clear in terms of what it leaves open for the State to do. It states:</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>It is clear there that the right to life of the unborn, and that the obligation of the State to defend and vindicate the right by its laws, is acknowledged to be subject to legal and factual practicality. That is clear for any law one brings in, and it says that in Article 40.3.3º. We are bringing legal and factual practicality to the situation in terms of defining what is abortion for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>Clearly if we were to take some of the amendments which have been tabled, particularly by the Fine Gael Party in the other House and here today, in other words, if people want us to define, for the purposes of this Act, unborn human life back to conception, for example, one would then be banning and prohibiting the morning after pill and the IUD. Is that what the House wants? There are people advancing amendments which would have that effect. You cannot, on the one hand, criticise the definition of abortion here as meaning the intentional destruction of the unborn after implantation and on the other hand condemn the fact that we do not define unborn human life itself. There is some duplicity going on there too and it has been going on throughout the debate &ndash; I am not saying here but in different quarters &ndash; where people are playing both sides of the argument to try to appease different sections or different perspectives on the debate itself.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his response to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Noonan, made it very clear in terms of what this Act was about and in terms of the definition of abortion meaning the intentional destruction of the unborn after implantation. In particular, he dealt with the use of the morning after pill and the post-coital IUD. He stated that the use of both the morning after pill and the post-coital IUD must, as a matter of practicable law, either lie within or without the criminal prohibition on abortion. It is simply not possible to have a statutory criminal offence carrying a serious penalty for an infringement where its ordinary meaning for ordinary people in ordinary situations is left obscure or unknown.</P>
      <P>There were options facing the Government on this issue in terms of the drafting of the legislation. We could have legislated both of those out of the equation if we so desired but we did not. I would have to reject any notion that this somehow dilutes the position in respect of the morning after pill or the IUD. It does not. It makes it far more certain in terms of the legislation we are putting in place, in terms of the definition of abortion as a crime &ndash; the intentional destruction of the unborn after implantation. It is far clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, I mentioned that SPUC is taking a <Col N="1423" /> case in Britain to prohibit the use of the morning after pill and the IUD under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. This legislation is far clearer and far more certain than the <i>status quo,</i> that is, either Article 40.3.3º or the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, by definition, anything one puts into the Constitution is clearly subject to challenge. Nobody can say there are absolutes in this and from the outset we have never said that there are absolutes. The very nature of a written constitution is that it is subject to challenges and interpretation, as we know from what happened with Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>There were one or two other points. Senator Keogh made the point about Levonelle. The IMB has stated that there is no legal impediment to the licensing of Levonelle and has made a decision on that, but of course it is up to the company to apply. Every company seeking a licence to manufacture, sell or distribute a medicine in Ireland is subject to the normal licensing processes, and it will go through that if the company decides to apply. My understanding is that an application is expected and obviously we would have to go through the various regulations and legislation which oversee the sale and distribution of medicines in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan in what he said about the morning after pills. The term &ldquo;abortifacient&rdquo; was one with which I was completely familiar until the letter campaign in the media, particularly in the newspapers, by these anti-abortion groups. The kernel of what they were saying was that the morning after pill was an abortifacient. That was the first time I came across the word and it was repeatedly used by these people in this campaign. Therefore there is no doubt whatever that that is a principal target of these people.</P>
      <P>I do think the lack of a definition is damaging to the Bill. It seems to me, for example, that if you decide that you want to outlaw the use of a hammer on a nail, you do not just define &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; and leave the nail undefined. That would be absurd. Therefore I really do not understand why there is no definition. Surely unborn human life is susceptible of definition which would obviate all these difficulties and problems.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister clarified the Levonelle issue. I felt a little guilty in this matter because I did mention Levonelle, in particular. I did so because of the useful briefing document from the Well Woman Centre which welcomed the licensing of Levonelle for use as a morning after pill, which indicates that it is licensed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were legislation being considered only by the Houses, I would not object as we are accustomed to examining words and understanding how they are defined for legislation. However, <Col N="1425" /> this will go to the people. Both the Minister and Senator O'Donovan argue that it will clarify the position regarding the morning after pill and the post-coital interuterine device. I cannot see how it will and it is not fair to tell the public that it will.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that this is just about abortion. However, people believe that they can look the definition up, but no one will read the Bill. I would be sanguine about an ordinary piece of legislation because I know that if we made an error, we could correct it, but this will go into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to play Cassandra, but in 1983 when I was nervous about opposing that referendum, I was advised by lawyers &ndash; one now sits on the Supreme Court and the other is earning too much to be interested in that court &ndash; who told me that it would be construed the other way, which is what happened. At that time, we were told, by largely the same people who are pushing this referendum, that this would settle the matter. I do not number the Minister among them. I do not blame him for what is happening as he has picked up the poisoned chalice and must fight the case as best he can. I would rather discuss the health strategy with him. The people who were wrong in 1983 will be wrong again as the legislation contains many problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the current situation is unclear but this legislation will not clarify it. Of course, neither he nor I nor regard them as abortifacients; nor does Senator Fitzpatrick. However, I am concerned about this being put to the public who rely on us to make legislation as clear as possible.</P>
    <P>I should apologise to the House because I commented last week that I was not surprised the Minister was not here to debate the Second Stage since he had no support from his colleagues on Committee Stage in the other House. I stated that neither the Progressive Democrats nor the Independents had taken part although they were allowed to. I named Deputies McGennis, Roche and Cooper-Flynn &ndash; who did not say much &ndash; as coming in to support the Minister but I was wrong as Deputy O'Dea, the Minister of State, and Deputy Kenneally also attended. I apologise to both of them and to the House.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is wrong, it will be challenged, as Senators Ryan and Norris stated, and I can envisage that because of the correspondence I receive. The pro-life campaigners have written me two letters thanking me for protecting the fertilised egg. If they are reduced to communicating with me, then the matter is out of hand. The legislation is not making things any better because Article 40.3.3º still remains. There is a similar challenge before the courts in Northern Ireland. As I said last week, it is not the devil but the danger which is in the detail. We are setting ourselves up for further re-interpretation by the courts. I do not understand why we want to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not make a clear, definite statement. It will add a serious dimension to the Constitution. Rather than clarifying the position, it convolutes it. The Minister has not made a convincing case today.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry stated that the Progressive Democrats were not involved, but they were involved in the person of Michael McDowell, the Attorney General, who put his credibility on the line by presenting this Bill. Both he and the Minister know that it is full of flaws and open on a variety of fronts to litigation and clarification in the courts. There will be subsequent legislation through this House if parties are foolish enough to allow themselves to be subjected to pressure which could lead to a further amendment to the Constitution in the future. This Bill is open to challenge.</P>
      <P>The case the Minister makes is not convincing. There is no clear definition about one fundamental issue, no definition of the unborn. The Minister tells us there is definition of abortion. That is a separate issue and that is not clear either. As Senator Henry said, there is no clear definition in the medical dictionary. There is a definition included in the Bill and it is a political concoction of convenience to suit a particular political agenda and political circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Government has deliberately chosen not to put any definition of &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; into this Bill. That obviously is done for a specific purpose. I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to consider some definition of &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; even at this late stage. The Bill does not give any clear guideline or definition as far as the practical implementation of the legislation is concerned. We as legislators have a responsibility to ensure that the legislation we pass is clear, is fairly specific and is practicable in its application. This Bill will be subject to further constitutional cases about interpretation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the views that have been expressed in this House today and to present clarification. The Medical Council already has difficulties in relation to the application of the rules and regulations. Medical practitioners are scared; they are not sure. Senator Fitzpatrick knows this. This proposed Bill will not clarify matters any further nor will it improve matters from a practical point of view. If we do not have something practical before the House then there is no point in proceeding.</P>

      <P>I wish to return to the subject of Levonelle which is particularly apt in relation to Senator Henry's point about Article 40.3.3º. It is my understanding that when Levonelle was not permitted one of the reasons given was that it was an abortifacient. We never accepted that, but that was the reason given. We are now told that it is not an abortifacient, something we all knew anyway, and is therefore permitted. This is based on the opinion of the Irish Medicines Board. None of this has anything to do with us as legislators. It underlines the lack of clarity and the openness to <Col N="1427" /> challenge inherent in this Bill. Instead of our being able to amend legislation in the Oireachtas, the whole thing will have to go to the people all over again. Everything that we have talked about here so far underpins the fact that this is completely wrong. We should not be here debating this; we are wasting everybody's time.</P>
      <P>There is no consensus among the people and this has been admitted by the partners in Government in this House. The Minister was asked to reflect on whether it is wise to go ahead with a referendum that many people believe will be defeated. Something that was not permitted one week is permitted the next week because somebody has had a change of mind or because of legal advice. Where was the legal advice before that? Who gave the Irish Medicines Board the legal advice that Levonelle was an abortifacient? Doctors differ and patients die. We have seen in the appalling X case that lawyers differ and in some circumstances women will die if we have differences of opinion as we had in that case.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to theory but none of us is talking about theory; we are all talking about practice. We are talking about things that happen and that have happened. It is not theory but fact. This is not a theorethical and philosophical discussion in the main but rather we are talking about actual facts. The question of Levonelle illustrates how open to challenge this proposal will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I said the opposite. I said I assumed that since the Bill which we will come to in the Second Schedule talks about the implantation in the womb of unborn human life, one has to accept from that that the official position is that unborn human life exists before implantation. If Article 40.3.3º is meant to defend unborn human life then quite clearly it does not begin to defend it at the moment of implantation unless that is specifically written into the Constitution. Our amendment says that notwithstanding what is in Article 40.3.3º, the following applies. <Col N="1428" /> This at least makes clear what we are dealing with. We are dealing with the prohibition of abortion. The way it stands, people will be able to go back. Incidentally, I do not think our amendment deals with Senator Henry's issue.</P>

It is not so much a constitutional issue as an understanding of the political process that is at work, that the campaign group which has persuaded the Minister and his Government to do this has an agenda and the next stage on that agenda is the issue of what it regards as abortifacients.</P>
      <P>There is a solution to this, which would be to define unborn life as commencing at the moment of implantation. Then the State's obligation to defend unborn life would clearly be coterminous with the application of the Bill that the Minister is using here. That would mean that instead of defining abortion in terms of the intentional destruction of unborn human life from the moment of implantation, unborn human life would be defined as human life from the moment of implantation in the womb of a woman. That could be done now and it would copperfasten the position of both the morning after pill and the IUD, if one accepts one interpretation of how they operate. It would clarify the position. The Minister could still do this now. He could agree to look at this on Report Stage and to define unborn life in terms of the moment of implantation. One of the members of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, tried to get that done on the previous disastrous amendment and it was refused. However, it could be done now.</P>

We are clear where we stand regarding Article 40.3.3º. Why will the Minister not tell us the legal advice he got on the definition of unborn? It appears the Attorney General has taken it upon himself to say that it is after implantation. The Minister is shaking his head, but that is the general impression the public will get. This raised many questions during the Dáil debate, which was guillotined. I ask the Minister to give us a specific definition of unborn so that we may be able to deal with the Bill more specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with defining abortion. That is the core issue. We are protecting the unborn after implantation and I gave the reason. Is Senator Jackman seriously suggesting that it would be practical to introduce abortion law that would go right back to the beginning of human life? Would it be possible to say that from conception onwards, abortion would be prohibited? How would it be possible to find out? Let us consider the practical application of law.</P>
      <P>When enacting law, we can consider when fertilisation begins or anything up to 14 days later, based on what Senator Henry said &ndash; I was told it was between three and ten days. In the natural process up to half of the fertilised ova may never implant in the womb. How could we bring in a law or update the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, to deal with abortion prior to implantation? It could not be done. That is the purpose of defining abortion as the intentional destruction of the unborn human life in the womb after implantation.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.3º states: &ldquo;in so far as is practicable by its laws defend and vindicate&rdquo;. In other words Article 40.3.3º makes it very clear there is a test of both practicality and factuality in terms of how that is to be done. Article 40.3.4º does not come in the aftermath of Article 40.3.3º, the two should be read together. The strong constitutional advice I have is that Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º should be read together in harmony. The Supreme Court adjudicates these matters in accordance with the doctrine of harmonious interpretation.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan and others said this is a political concoction, but it is not. The definition of abortion emanated from a consideration of the legal practicalities of the issue and addressed the issue of the morning after pill and the IUD as requested by the Oireachtas committee. We have given much greater certainty and clarity to these issues now than existed prior to these proposals under the 1861 Act and Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a Green Paper followed by the All-<Col N="1430" /> Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, which, although not unanimous, came up with three options. This Bill came as a result of the third of those options. The other options were to do nothing other than establish the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and legislate for the X case. Since 1992, no political party has produced any template or legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <P>In answer to Senator Ryan's point about one political group, this emanated from the process initiated by the Taoiseach when we came to power in 1997. He made a promise and a commitment.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper considered many views and the committee was another important stage. All concerned agreed this was a very good process. The committee did a considerable amount of good and clarified a whole range of issues. Having read its report, the evidence from the medical practitioners was particularly useful. This Bill is the result of a long process of consideration by the Oireachtas and groups outside.</P>

      <P>It is not being rushed through in the end. The Levonelle issue emerged prior to any of this being in the public arena because the company applied to the IMD. As a statutory independent body for the licensing of medicines, the IMD sought legal advice on receipt of the application based on Article 40.3.3º. The test concerns practicality and factuality.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to the Attorney General in the course of the debate. Senator Quinn is wrong in saying he knows it is full of flaws. In all the public commentary, nobody has said this is legally wrong. Some have argued it might be suspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this is a unique process because we want to provide both a legislative and constitutional response. The committee made it clear that no single paragraph in the Constitution would resolve all the issues. This is legislation that will provide constitutional protection because, as the Taoiseach stated, we also wanted to consult the people. Some people in other political parties do not agree with that and feel this should be done through legislation alone. I believe we should go back to the people because they have voted on this matter on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>On the one hand much concern has been expressed about the morning after pill and the IUD and on the other hand I am getting requests to define the unborn for the purposes of this Bill. This is a criminal statute to prohibit abortion. If one wanted to define the term &ldquo;unborn,&rdquo; one would, by definition, outlaw the use of the morning after pill. That would be the net effect of some of the amendments.</P>

      <P>I will try to avoid repetition, but this is one of the most important parts of the Bill. The Government has decided to consult the people. That is its prerogative. The consultation process was excellent. I was present for a considerable amount of the time that Deputy Brian Lenihan chaired the committee which did good work and of which Senator O'Donovan was a most constructive member. There is, however, a great lack of clarity in the information given to the public and medical profession. There is <Col N="1432" /> nothing in the legislation which makes the situation more clear regarding the legality of either the morning after pill or post-coital intrauterine device. Both are still open to challenge. That is the reason it is worthwhile looking at Senator Ryan's amendment which seeks to insert the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding <i>subsection 3º.</i>&rdquo;  It is unfair to say to the public that something is the case when it is not and when we in the House know it is not. It is still possible to take challenges against both methods of what I and most Members here would describe as contraception on the grounds they are abortifacients. We know such challenges are being taken in other places. I do not like the impression being given that this improves the situation. The Minister talked about protecting and vindicating rights as far as is practicable. Many could say it was practicable to ban the post-coital IUD and the use of the morning after pill, but that is not an argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I came in at the end of the debate and do not want to raise issues which have already been addressed. My colleague told me the Minister clarified the reason he is not prepared to delete the words &ldquo;In particular.&rdquo;  I thought what would be known as the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, was to specifically protect life in the womb and that it would not require any type of caveat or qualifying expression, such as &ldquo;In particular&rdquo; or &ldquo;in general.&rdquo;  That takes from its thrust. If one talks about the life of the unborn, in particular, one is saying that something else loses out. Does that mean we are balancing the protection of the life of the unborn in the womb against the protection of the life of the mother? I thought our amendment to the Schedule as distinct from the definition of when an abortion can take place or the decision on whether life begins at implantation or conception, which will be difficult to define, would have been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must agree to disagree or try to resolve the issue one way or the other. I reiterate the point about the use of the words &ldquo;In particular.&rdquo;  It is fundamental and correct because it clearly indicates that it is linked with Article 40.3.3º. Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º must be read together in accordance with the doctrine of harmonious interpretation of the Constitution. Articles in the Constitution are not decided upon in isolation by the Supreme Court. They are dealt with as part of the package construed together. The words &ldquo;In particular&rdquo; are significant in that Article 40.3.3º sets out the obligations of the State, while Article 40.3.4º uses the words &ldquo;In particular&rdquo; and refers to what would be known as the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act.</P>

      <P>Nothing as dramatic as that. I am delighted the Minister is more relaxed here than he was at the Dáil select committee. We are a pleasant group.</P>
      <P>As regards <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, it has been brought to my attention that the Government is stating the legislation ensures challenges will not be taken against the freezing of embryos or zygotes. Perhaps the Minister did not say it, but it has been brought to my attention that an impression has been given that if this constitutional amendment is passed, there will not be any trouble in the future with freezing embryos or zygotes. I would like to hear him discuss what influence, if any, he thinks the legislation will have on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is silent on those issues. It does not deal with the issue of <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation or embryo research. I have indicated time after time that it does not deal with such issues. I established a commission on assisted human reproduction because of their complexity. It was probably after some reflection that Deputy Gay Mitchell felt I was right to establish that commission. He has been critical of the fact that we have 51 such agencies in the health area. The <Col N="1434" /> commission was established almost 12 months ago under Dervilla Donnelly. It is both complex and evolving. The Bill is specific. It does not deal with those issues.</P>

I am not saying that Professor Dervilla Donnelly's committee is doing anything but great work. However, a committee can proceed more slowly than we would have been obliged to proceed in the House if we had been made to tackle the issue. I am glad the Minister said what he said because the impression is being given to both the medical profession and the public that all will be well in terms of problems with <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation if the legislation is passed. However, as he said, the Bill does not address that issue.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 8, after &ldquo;protected&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment follows the line I expressed earlier in the debate. I am concerned because the Minister has said that Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º must be taken together. My party, Fine Gael, is not happy about the fact that the wording in Article 40.3.3º is much stronger. It contains a guarantee, &ldquo;to defend and vindicate&rdquo;, which is much stronger than &ldquo;undertaking to protect.&rdquo;  We are not sure whether the Bill is a secondary provision or whether it will be a full and equal provision in the Constitution. We would have preferred if the language of 40.3.4º was stronger by the insertion of the words &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo;. If the Minister responded I could develop the argument further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to change the text of the proposed Article 40.3.4º of the Constitution by adding the words &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;vindicate&rdquo; is already used in Article 40.3.3º where the terminology is &ldquo;to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&rdquo;. No additional benefit would be conferred by the insertion of the term &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo;. We cannot see any benefit that it would bring. It could cause confusion between Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º if the word was common to both and one would be asked about all the other language in Article 40.3.3º. The term &ldquo;protected&rdquo; is sufficient and comprehends the terms &ldquo;respect&rdquo;, &ldquo;defend, and &ldquo;vindicate&rdquo; which appear in Article 40.3.3º. My strong constitutional advice is that it is not necessary to insert the term in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; which was dealt with in the previous amendment deals with the linkage of Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º. This amendment does not do that but proposes to add the words &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo; to Article 40.3.4º. My argument is that no additional benefit would be conferred by doing that. It is not necessary and it does not make sense to us. In terms of harmonious interpretation, which belongs to the previous amendment, that is not my opinion but the manner in which the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution. It interprets it by a process known as &ldquo;harmonious interpretation&rdquo;, in other words, it does not deal with each clause independently of the other.</P>

      <P>No, he did not. Surely the Articles would be more harmonious if they were the same. We keep hearing about the harmony of the two Articles. One uses the word &ldquo;protected&rdquo; while the other seeks to be protected &ldquo;and vindicated&rdquo;. The Minister is aware of my views on what was inserted in the Constitution in 1983. It was extraordinarily foolish. I knew of nobody who was doing abortions on socio-economic grounds, and I know I would have known prior to that amendment being brought forward. Indeed, they are not being done now. If the Articles were to be harmonious I would have thought a little consistency would be no harm between the two of them.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 9, after &ldquo;Life&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and Other Provisions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> This amendment is simple and I think the Minister will respond accordingly because they are all provisions in the Bill. There is the provision to create the criminal offence of abortion, which was discussed this morning. There is provision to legalise abortion but it is called &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; in certain circumstances. There are no provisions to define what a &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; is in the definitions section. I believe the Minister responded somewhat to that question in the other House but I would like to hear his response in regard to &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo;. That is important given that there are specific provisions in the Bill. There is a definition of a &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo;. There are provisions to provide for a &ldquo;reasonable opinion&rdquo; and for records to be kept as to what is or was a reasonable opinion before the so-called &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; takes place. There is a definition, which some people may not accept, of &ldquo;woman&rdquo;. Why was that not included in the definition of &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>&mdash;governing the proposed referendum to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Other Provisions in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, by inserting &ldquo;and Other Provisions&rdquo;. That is one amendment. Another amendment seeks to change the Long Title of the legislation envisaged by the Government and contained in the Second Schedule. The change would be as follows: &ldquo;An Act to protect human life and other provisions in pregnancy to repeal sections 58 and 59 of the <Col N="1438" /> Offences against the Person Act, 1861, and to provide for related matters.&rdquo; The third amendment seeks to change the title of the legislation envisaged by the Government and contained in the Second Schedule to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy and Other Provisions Bill, 2001.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot accept those amendments because the Bill to amend the Constitution contains only one proposal. There are no related matters. The Deputies amendments cannot, therefore, be accepted. It is a constitutional provision that only one proposal can be put to the people.</P>
      <P>The standard approach to the title of a Bill to amend the Constitution is that it is simply entitled, with the number, for example, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth or Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. That is what would normally be done in a case like this. In this case a Private Members' Bill had already been drafted&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;which proposed to make other amendments to the Constitution. This was entitled the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001. The Government's Bill could not, therefore, also use this title. That is the reason for the use of the title chosen which adequately covers the general purpose of the Bill and the envisaged legislation contained in the Second Schedule. Were it not for the existence of the Private Members' Bill, the Government's Bill would have followed the standard format and no issue would have been raised about the title of the Bill. The suggested title does not appear grammatically correct in any case as it appears to suggest that the Bill is concerned with the protection not only of human life but also of other provisions in pregnancy. That would not make grammatical sense. In relation to the Long Title, if the relevant amendment were accepted the title would include both &ldquo;and other provisions&rdquo; and &ldquo;to provide for related matters&rdquo;, which would involve a degree of duplication.</P>

      <P>There is only one proposal before the people. In regard to what they will be voting on, there is nothing to inform them about the travel and information section. I presume this is what Senator Jackman is concerned about. People may think this is just about abortion. I approve of what the Minister is doing in section 4 but many people who might vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the <Col N="1439" /> referendum will not understand that it is reinforcing the situation regarding travel and information. I am not concerned about that because the Government was wise to do this before there was a fresh case before the courts. I take Senator Jackman's point that this is not simply about the protection of human life. This could be said to be averse to the protection of human life. It still allows people to travel and to have information regarding abortion, admittedly in other states. No matter what way one looks at it, whether one wants people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, it is an important section of the Bill and is not referred to in the title. I am sure that is not the Minister's fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not put every section of a Bill into the title. I take the Senator's point about information for the public. We will not rely on the title to provide that information as there will be a comprehensive information campaign in the course of the debate and referendum campaign. No matter what referendum was being brought forward we would not depend on the title to provide the information. It is normal to have the ordinal number in the title and what we have done is include in brackets Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy. We did that to distinguish from the other Twenty-fifth amendment that is in the House at present as a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's assurance that the Government's campaign for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on this will ensure that information will be put before the people that the right to travel and information will be retained. That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer again to the point made by Senator Henry. I intended raising the issue of travel and information. The Minister says he wants to put this as succinctly as possible for the people. They will have a short time to address this extraordinarily complex, sensitive issue. I do not want to go back over the Nice treaty referendum which created concern among the public because people did not know on what they were voting. The response I am getting is that people do not know what this is about and do not want to hear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the words &lsquo;and Other Provisions' are not included how will people know about the provisions and how will they access the information on the detail of the provisions made in the Bill? The motto seems to be &ldquo;If in doubt, leave it out.&rdquo;  That is what will happen and people will not know there are other provisions. If we knew what kind of campaign the Government would run in relation to providing information to the people it might be a different story, but we do not. All we know is that after the passing of this Bill the people will know that there will be a referendum two months later. I do not expect them to go into the complicated detail that we have gone into in <Col N="1440" /> the short time available but they need to know about it if they are to vote on such a complex issue.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Henry will agree with me that this is the most complicated amendment to the Constitution ever put before the people. Does the Minister think that they will go through the Bill line by line and know the provisions made, be able to differentiate between Article 40.3.3º and Article 40.3.4º and know that they are supposed to be taken together as a harmonious interpretation? We are doing the people a disservice by not including &lsquo;and Other Provisions'. They may wonder if they are entitled to travel or information anymore. They will ask whether there is a proper balance between the life of the mother and the life of the child. They will also ask about medical practitioners and about the suicide issue. I cannot answer those questions.</P>
    <P>The reason for wanting to include &lsquo;and Other Provisions' is to show that there is a lot to be learnt, studied and understood before the people vote on it. We must remember that once the people have spoken we will have our response and after two months the Act can come into operation. If it is not carried we will have to go back to the people again. In deference to their understanding of this complicated issue we should include &lsquo;and Other Provisions' as a signpost to the fact that they should read the Bill and know what they are voting on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator looks at a copy of the Constitution of Ireland she will see that all the titles of amendments have the ordinal number in the title. Every section is not included in the title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only three words &lsquo;and Other Provisions' which the Minister said was innocuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not include sections. The rights to travel and information which were the subject of previous referenda were not in the title. Our position is that we put in &ldquo;Twenty-fifth Amendment&rdquo;, and to distinguish it from another amendment we put in &ldquo;Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy&rdquo;. It is the 25th amendment. There is another 25th amendment, a Private Members' Bill, that was in the House before ours. It was not the view that any amendment would include a range of different sections in the title nor was it ever considered that the title was the basis on which people decided how to vote. Democracy is about debate, argument, intention and perspective. We will have that in this case, just as in all other cases, and issues can be clarified there. Democracy is not a perfect system and we can not say with certainty that 100% of a group has understood every issue. People have different perspectives and views and some will focus more on one aspect of a Bill rather than another. We must leave it up to the people and ensure through debate that they will have a full understanding of <Col N="1441" /> it. It seems we will have to agree to disagree on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to agree to disagree. What I have suggested including is not another section. It is just three words &lsquo;and Other Provisions'. We are not suggesting a huge number of subordinate clauses to be added but just those three words. I hope the Minister is correct in saying that there will be a long debate on this issue and that people will get information. The reality is that people do not know what the 25th amendment is about. We are not asking for a detailed insertion. The words we want included draw attention to the fact that people need to look beyond the actual title and to ask what are the other provisions. These are the issues on which people will be looking for information and guidance. They will ask questions such as those asked on Second Stage in relation to a medical procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry made an interesting point con<Col N="1442" /> cerning the designation of specific hospitals. What, for example, happens some mother at risk who lives hundreds of miles from a specific hospital? These are human elements of the Bill and I believe that if people see the words 'and Other Provisions' they will ask what are those provisions. I am worried because I do not think the public will be as informed as the Minister seems to think it will be. I do not know where the people will debate it or whether they will have enough time to do so. Has the Government put enough thought into communicating the complications of the Bill to the people so that they can make a reasoned decision when they come to vote on it.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 37 and 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amazing disappearing constitutional amendment. What is in the First Schedule, with the exception of the amendment to Article 40, disappears never to be seen again if certain things happen. This is not without precedent; something similar happened in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement. The provisions of Article 27, to the best of my knowledge, have never been applied in the history of the Oireachtas. I do not understand why that is the case. I am a self-proclaimed admirer of Éamon de Valera but he <Col N="1443" /> made sure that when he included this in the Constitution it would never be used. He did this by requiring a majority of Members of the Seanad to support any such petition. He also ensured that the Government of the day would have a majority in the House. That is apart from the peculiarities of the second period in the lifetime of the last Government. It is a pity they did not exercise their rights and I am surprised Fianna Fáil did not exercise it at least once as they had the possibility of attracting some of my erstwhile colleagues.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why Articles 26 and 27 have to be specifically excluded. If one were to trawl through the provisions of the Constitution one would find many other anomalous provisions. I do not use this as a negative term, but this is an anomalous constitutional amendment. If all its implications are carried through, the consequence will be that the amendment &ldquo;shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution published thereafter, but notwithstanding such omission this section shall continue to have the force of law.&rdquo;  I am not persuaded that there are not a dozen other issues in the Constitution that could impact on that. Therefore, I cannot see why the provisions of Articles 26 and 27 of Constitution shall not apply to the Bill for such a law. It is entirely superfluous and I propose that lines 37 and 38 should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone to whom I have spoken about the legislation has been extraordinarily surprised by this provision. People do not understand that the referral of the Bill by the President to the Supreme Court will be impossible. The President has expressed her interest in this area in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am sure other Senators, the Minister and the Leas-Chathaoirleach were present when she addressed both Houses of the Oireachtas. I remember her speech well and, in particular, her reference to the life of the unborn because a photograph appeared on the front of <i>Time</i> at the time featuring surgery on a baby <i>in utero</i> at 18 to 20 weeks. The diagnosis of spina bifida had been made <i>in utero</i> and, as the Minister will be aware, operations on infants before they are viable is an extraordinarily important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the chief medical officer has joined the Minister. However, the President expressed delight about progress in this area and pointed out that when one looked at the photograph on the front of <i>Time</i> there was little difference in size between the forefinger of the surgeon and the developing foetus. This is an experimental area, as the chief medical officer will inform the Minister, but it is an area in which most progress has been made. It is a little high-handed of the Government to say that the President cannot refer the Bill to the Supreme Court given that she expressed an opinion in the Houses of the Oireachtas in this area. It would be fair enough if the Minister was to delete the right of referral of <Col N="1444" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas to the Supreme Court from Article 27, but I am shocked the Minister is deleting the right of referral of our President, particularly since she has shown interest in this area in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>How frequently does the Government do this? We are constantly given early bird warnings to sign legislation rapidly. Many members of the public might rely on the President for her considered opinion on the legislation in this area, yet she is being denied that opportunity and that is deplorable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this provision on Second Stage. This is one of the most fundamental affronts to our Constitution. Technically another constitutional amendment is provided for, which will impair the powers of the President to refer Bills to the Supreme Court. She is empowered to do so under Article 26 and the Government proposes to remove that power from her in regard to the Bill. It is an underhand way of undermining the constitutional powers of the President. The Minister would be wise to reflect on and agree to the amendment.</P>
      <P>He intends to roll two Bills into one and in this provision we are dealing with the legislation that should be introduced following the adoption of the First Schedule in the Constitution. This is a smart way around addressing this issue. The subsection specifically precludes the President from referring the Bill. Article 27 &ldquo;applies to any Bill other than a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of this Constitution, which shall have been deemed, by virtue of Article 23. . . &rdquo;, which deals with money Bills in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>This issue should be addressed in a separate referendum to amend the Constitution to change the powers of the President. The proposal, which has been slipped in at the end of the First Schedule, diminishes the role and powers of the President. It states: &ldquo;The provisions of Articles 26 and 27 of this Constitution shall not apply to the Bill for such a law&rdquo;. This provision will be the subject of major litigation on a variety of constitutional grounds. We have outlined one and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 relates to the section dealing with orders. I agree with previous speakers. The Bill states clearly: &ldquo;The provisions of Articles 26 and 27 of this Constitution shall not apply to the Bill for such a law.&rdquo;  This is an extraordinarily dramatic issue that will catch the imagination of the public and people will ask why the Minister considers that these articles shall not apply. The President probably cannot make a statement but it is unprecedented that he or she would not have the right to consult the Council of State to refer legislation to the Supreme Court for consideration. I would like the Minister to outline whether there is a precedent for denying referral. I have not come across this and under the provision two Articles <Col N="1445" /> cannot be referred. I will deal with the issue in greater detail under amendment No. 26.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman has touched on one of the principal points I wanted to make. Has the exclusion of the presidential role been effected in legislation previously? I cannot remember, and it seems very curious. It also has a strongly undemocratic flavour. I said on Second Stage that it looked as if the mentality behind the Bill is not to trust the Oireachtas, the courts and now the President. Why should she not have the power to refer legislation to the courts for a constitutional test? I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Article 26 ordinarily enables the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court for decision on the question as to whether such a Bill or any specified provision or provisions in such a Bill is or are repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof. The nature of those Bills is specified in the article. Under the current proposal if the constitutional amendment is passed, it will have taken place with the people having been able to see the precise text of the envisaged Act in advance. The constitutional protection, which will be provided under Article 40.3.4º of the Constitution, will refer to that Act as contained in the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason it would not be appropriate to provide for referral of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act to the Supreme Court is that, by virtue of the people having decided to give <Col N="1446" /> constitutional protection to that Act in the terms proposed in this Bill, the Act is made constitutional. In other words, the vote of the people will make the Act constitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people had already, in effect, given their verdict on the matter, it would be totally inappropriate then to go back to the Supreme Court and to give it the role of considering the issue of constitutionality. It is quite straightforward.</P>
      <P>The Senator is asking to delete the lines which state that Articles 26 and 27 shall not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically we are saying if the people vote for this, then the Oireachtas will be obliged after the referendum, within 180 days, to enact that Bill, word by word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>When that has been completed, the people will have decided on that and on its the constitutionality, and we are not giving either the Supreme Court or others the role of second guessing that.</P>
      <P>Article 27 provides for a mechanism for the referral of Bills to the people. Senator Ryan has given the background to that. A majority of the Members of Seanad Éireann and not less than one third of the Members of Dáil Éireann may by a joint petition addressed to the President by them under this Article request the President to decline to sign. In other words, it is a methodology for ascertaining the will of the people on particular legislation.</P>
      <P>What we are putting forward here is a referendum mechanism which was designed expressly to ascertain the will of the people on the precise text of the envisaged legislation in advance of its passage through the Oireachtas. Therefore it would be illogical to leave open the possibility that a further referral to the people would take place when the same Bill came before the Oireachtas, which is what is being proposed if we delete the lines referring to Article 27.</P>
      <P>Here is the mechanism by which we are going to the people to ascertain their will on this particular Bill, and there is no point, for the purposes of this procedure, in the provisions of Article 27 applying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite disingenuous in the way he is explaining this. The reality is that only the short bit will be written into the Constitution. All of the rest of the Bill, from the First Schedule to the very end, will become statutory law and it will not be included in the Constitution. That will not become law until the first bit is passed by the people and included in the Constitution. Then the Govern<Col N="1447" /> ment and the Oireachtas will have the ability, within 180 days, to bring in the Bill and let it become legislation.</P>
      <P>This is unprecedented constitutional misbehaviour. The Minister is introducing a law, rolling it in with the first Bill, and prohibiting this House and the other House from going through the normal process of examining a Bill through the five Stages. He is also withdrawing from the Oireachtas the powers to amend legislation. It is unprecedented. It has never been done since the foundation of the State in this manner. The Minister is introducing an unprecedented legal constitutional process which is open to serious challenge in the courts.</P>
      <P>He is not only withdrawing from this House and the other House the powers to amend legislation but also prohibiting the President from referring it to the Supreme Court. He has done two things. He has tied up the President so she cannot do anything and he has tied up both of these Houses from addressing it at any time in the future or from going through the normal process.</P>
      <P>I believe this section breaches a fundamental Article in the Constitution, that is, Article 15.2.1º. That Article states:</P>
      <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister is withdrawing that power from the Oireachtas. He is, in a sense, vesting the legislative powers in the people but he is not really doing so because, in effect, what they will vote to put into the Constitution is the first bit.</P>
      <P>It is a constitutional quagmire. It is irresponsible of a Government to go down this particular route, to flout the Constitution in such an appalling manner and to insult the position of the President and of the Legislature &ndash; both House of the Oireachtas &ndash; in the manner in which it is being done.</P>

      <P>I have been convinced for a long time that the Minister and the Government are far from convinced about the road they have chosen on this issue but they are stuck with it. It is really astonishing. The Minister is quite certain and eloquent, as only he can be, about how inappropriate and illogical it would be to refer this to the Supreme Court if the people had decided on it, and perhaps he is right. However, presumably the President, left to her own devices, would come to a similar conclusion. She is a very eminent lawyer, a very sensible and practical woman. If what the Minister is saying is true, which is that it would be inappropriate to do this, then I am quite sure the President would act accordingly. Obviously the Minister does not believe the President would necessarily do that because he wants to take away the option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>If it is as obvious as the Minister says it is, he should leave it to the President and she will make up her own mind. Similarly if, in the Minister's mind, the President gets it wrong and refers it to the Supreme Court, their lordships are perfectly capable of saying at the very beginning, &ldquo;This is inappropriate. It has been decided on by the people. Take it back. It is over. It is constitutional.&rdquo;  There is no need for this little bit. If what the Minister says is as clear-cut and unarguable as he has said, then neither the President nor the Supreme Court will exercise the options available to them under Article 26.</P>
      <P>The reality is of course that the Government has been advised by somebody that unless it includes this, it might be possible for them to do it. If the President decides that it is appropriate to do it, if the Supreme Court accepts that it is appropriate to consider it, it is an extraordinary presumption on the part of the Oireachtas to withdraw that right from them. If, on the other hand, it is as clear cut as the Minister said, then he does not need to touch it at all. He should take this subsection out, let it be as it is and let the President and the Supreme Court operate autonomously without our restricting them because the Government is afraid that they might do something the Government does not want them to do.</P>
      <P>It is a quite outrageous interference. If the Minister believes it is so clearcut, then he should trust the President and the Supreme Court. If he does not think it is appropriate, then he should not have these two lines in the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>I want an answer from the Minister to my question if this is unprecedented. It could be that the people will have their say in the vote, but within 180 days there may be a change of Government, or of minds, and the Bill will not be passed. In that case we will be saying that the people have decided, but we are not enacting the law. What then of the people's will? The constitutional amendment will fall, even though the people have spoken. Is that not a fact?</P>

      <P>Yes, but we should consider that scenario. I hope the people know that, when they vote, there is no guarantee that their will will be respected. That has never happened before. Why sail these uncharted waters? Another issue is the President's prerogative to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court being put aside. It is a muddle. Why put it to the people at all since it is so uncertain? This is dangerous. Senator Taylor-Quinn, who has more experience on constitutional matters, has made the dangers clear, as has Senator Ryan. This should be left out. The Minister should take heed of what has been said in the House on this very important amendment.</P>

      <P>I asked the Government to make clear in its public information that, subsequently, the legislation cannot be referred to the Supreme Court by the President in whom many have confidence, whatever their opinion, fair or not, may be of politicians in general. The Government must also make it clear that there is still the right to travel and information, that the fertilised egg is protected to the same degree, and that the morning after pill and post-coital IUD will still be available.</P>
      <P>I have already applied to the commission for funding to campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. Both sides will be treated equally. Therefore, when the Government receives its funds to promote the amendment, I will receive mine.

      <P>The acid test for any constitutional issue is the decision of the people. This is the first time that a constitutional amendment is in tandem with legislation. If the people decide in a referendum, why should the Supreme Court or the President interfere? The Supreme Court is the guardian of the Constitution, but not the judge of what the people decide. It would be ludicrous for the President or the Supreme Court to seek to arbitrate again on the matter. It would undermine democracy as its essence is that if there is a constitutional difficulty, then the people decide. The Constitution belongs to the people. The Supreme Court may arbitrate down the road, but not shortly after the referendum. Anything else would be a deviation from the principles of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Constitutionally, it is a correct, sound approach. Many of the comments made about the President are overstated. I have great confidence in her. This side of the House enthusiastically supported her nomination and election. However, any President would only refer a Bill to test its constitutionality and rarely do so in accordance with his or her private views. In this case, because the whole issue is being put to the people, they will have decided on its constitutionality, the reason there is no need to utilise Article 26 or Article 27.</P>
      <P>Once the Bill is passed it will be subject to interpretation by the Supreme Court should anyone wish to challenge it. Any legislation we pass here is subject to interpretation by the courts if cases are made. The constitutional status of the Act is the key point. It will require that the rest of the Constitution be construed in a manner which is consistent with the fact that it is <i>intra vires</i> of the Constitution. The Act will enjoy the full protection of the Constitution once passed by the people after the amendment is decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take this to its practical conclusion. The Minister has clearly stated that this will be put directly to the people and will be passed by the people and that the people are the ultimate decision-makers. I accept that absolutely but I must ask the Minister to get down to the practicalities. The Minister might imagine himself at the polling station in Turner's Cross. He is presented with his ballot paper. Is he also presented with the entire document, the entire Bill? No. What the people will be presented in the referendum with the words in sections 1 and 2. That is exactly what will be on the ballot paper. This is what the people will read when they go in and they will mark either yes or no. They will not have seen the Bill and they will not know what it is all about. Technically speaking, the people will not vote on that Bill because that Bill will not be presented to each voter. If this proposal is passed, this bit will go into the Constitution. There will be an election, the Government will possibly change but Bertie will be able to say that he was a good lad, he kept his promise to the four Independents and he had a constitutional referendum. He will say that the other crowd will not bring it in after the change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that this is unprecedented legislative practice. It is giving <Col N="1452" /> almost an unconstitutional power to the Oireachtas. That is the reality. It is a fundamental breach of the Constitution. I do not believe Senator O'Donovan, who has a legal background, believes the argument he made. The realities are that the people will not be voting on that Bill; they will hear that there is legislation hanging around but they will not know the fine detail. It is unprecedented and unconstitutional and should not proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a huge respect for the capacity of this Minister and I have a certain degree of sympathy for him. Apart from saying that they should not have started on it, I will not try to make this into a party political issue. I have tried to avoid that. My own views on this have been known for a long time.</P>
      <P>I come back again to the fact that the President knows the role of her office better than I do and the Government is saying it does not trust her to understand her role. She will have to sign this Bill. It would have been more honest to say that this Bill when enacted by the Oireachtas does not need to be signed by the President. We are telling her that she still has the role of signing this Bill but we are withdrawing her constitutional role to question whether it is consistent with the Constitution. It is possible that this Bill might contradict another section.</P>
      <P>Let us remember what happened to Article 40.3.3º. One of the reasons for the problem was that it produced conflicting rights, not just in 40.3.3º but in terms of the fundamental idea of the right of the citizen to life. That is why the Supreme Court interpreted 40.3.3º in a way which is totally at variance with what its advocates thought it would mean because it contradicted something else in the Constitution. That is a separate issue but the fundamental issue is that I trust the President not to do something which is at variance with the Constitution. I trust the Supreme Court not to do something which is a variance with the Constitution. If it would be inappropriate for this Bill to be referred by the President to the Supreme Court to adjudicate on it, I am perfectly happy to leave that choice to the President who has to sign it. I therefore do not understand why if it is so obvious, we have to prohibit it. I think there might be a problem that their lordships might feel that some sections of this Bill were in conflict with the Constitution. I do not know.</P>

      <P>It would be wiser for us to identify such a thing in advance. The Minister may well have a point. Maybe the President should not and probably would not, and maybe the Supreme Court should not and probably would not, get involved in this, but it is a pre-emptive strike entirely out of proportion to the risk to take the powers away from them, while at the same time reserving to the Oireachtas the right to ignore the people. That is the case whatever the Minister's view as to whether it should or should not be enacted.</P>
      <P>If I am a supporter of a Government and this legislation has not been passed, I will be doing my best to ensure that it is not passed, because I will be a Member of an Oireachtas which was given that power under the Constitution to do precisely that. I will not be intimidated by people telling me things such as the Minister has said. I still believe it is wrong afterwards. If the Oireachtas is left with the right to refuse to pass this legislation, then as far as I am concerned the Oireachtas is entitled to exercise that right and nobody should pretend otherwise.</P>
      <P>If we do not believe that the President or the Supreme Court are capable of understanding what their roles are in a constitutional democracy, if we believe that they are so capable of being wrong to the extent that we write them out to make sure of it, then our constitutional order does not stand up to much.

      <P>I think there is some confusion about the role of the President and the role of the courts. The Constitution belongs to the people and it would be utter nonsense if provisions under Articles 26 of the Constitution, allowing the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court, were used after having given the people their say. We will ask the people to decide in February or March and once they have decided, <i>de facto</i> that will be the end of the matter. We should not be confused, the people will be first to decide and having done so the functions of the President or the Supreme Court are nullified.

As I said on Second Stage, based on legal advice I got, we are contravening Article 26 of the Constitution, which allows the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court to see if it is repugnant to the Constitution. We are undermining the Constitution. If the Government wants to refer everything to the people, why not be honest about it, abolish the Constitution and introduce a system like the one that exists in Switzerland?

      <P>The Minister referred to the Good Friday Agreement in a passing comment. From its foundation, the Fianna Fáil Party was very slow to involve itself in constitutional politics. It did not engage in constitutional politics until it got its own Constitution in 1937. It is now showing a blatant disregard for the Constitution of which its founding father was the architect in 1937. I am concerned that it is reverting to unconstitutional matters given the cavalier manner in which it is dealing with this issue. I am surprised a Minister of the calibre of the Minister, Deputy Martin, for whom I have regard, would involve himself in this. I thought he was one of the fathers of the future of Fianna Fáil. Further reducing the powers of the Constitution and the Oireachtas is to be frowned upon.</P>

      <P>It is no harm to have some light relief from time to time. The amended Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution only came into effect when the Government declared within a limited period that the State had become bound by the Good Friday Agreement. If no such declaration had been made by the Government, the amendment would have lapsed. That was a complex and unprecedented formula that was put to the people. The word &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; has been bandied about as if it was a dirty word, but it is not. Things happen in an unprecedented way from time to time. It happened with the Good Friday Agreement and on this occasion, two new subsections will be added to Article 40.3 if the Oireachtas, within six months, enacts the protection of human life in pregnancy Bill.</P>

      <P>de Valera's is a fine constitution. It is a remarkably liberal document dating from the 1930s when liberalism was not a characteristic of some parties in the House, which should not force us back into that time too enthusiastically. They have issues about which they should not invite us to think. If the Minister's argument about the Bill is right, there is a question about the constitutional propriety of the process. My party raised the appropriateness of the legislation to amend the Constitution containing other matters, that is, the Second Schedule. These are constitutional issues at which the Supreme Court might feel it is entitled to look. While it may not be appropriate for it to rule on the constitutional niceties of the Bill to protect human life, it might feel entitled to look at the process of the amendment and the legislation and state that is not what Bun<Col N="1458" /> reacht na hÉireann envisaged as the correct way to amend the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be entitled to say that after a referendum is held because a referendum not held in accordance with law would be null and void. If we did not hold a referendum in accordance with the Constitution, there would be a serious issue as to whether a decision was made by the people and, therefore, whether it was an amendment to the Constitution. It would not be outside the bounds of possibility for the Supreme Court to take upon itself the right to consider the process by which it was done and decide on it. That would not represent an interference in the activity. It would be a defence of the Constitution, which is the job of the Supreme Court. Without going through the nitty-gritty of the Bill, it could look at the process. The subsection means that an attempt by anybody to get the Supreme Court to look at the validity of the process in terms of the Constitution is being prevented. That is a fair issue because the process is new, unprecedented and different, as the Minister said. There is nothing wrong with unprecedented decisions, but they deserve to be scrutinised. This is preventing the process from being scrutinised.</P>

We disagree on a fundamental part of the Bill. The arguments Senator Ryan made are compelling. He has given a slightly different angle to it, which is interesting.

      <P>I wish to announce a correction to the list of amendments. After amendment No. 6, the words &ldquo;section opposed&rdquo; should read &ldquo;Schedule opposed&rdquo; and the names of Senators Ryan, Costello and O'Meara should have appeared on the printed list in addition to the names of Senators Jackman, Keogh, Manning and Taylor-Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same question. Senator Ryan has kindly explained it to me. However, given that he and the Minister have not agreed on the explanation of earlier matters, it would be wise if the Minister explained it to me as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is page seven, lines 24 to 32. The subsection begins: &ldquo;If a law, containing only the provisions set out. . . &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <P>The subsection states:</P>
      <P>If a law, containing only the provisions set out in . . .  The Second Schedule to the Twenty-fifth Amendment . . .  Act . . .  is enacted by the Oireachtas, this section, other than the amendment of Article 40 of this Constitution effected thereby, shall be omitted from every official text of this Constitution published thereafter, but notwithstanding such omission this section shall continue to have the force of law.</P>
      <P>It is self-explanatory. What will be included in the Constitution&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsections 4º and 5º will be included in the Constitution. The First Schedule contains the proposed text of the amendment of Article 46 of the Constitution. The proposed text to be inserted as Article 46.6.1º, in turn, contains the proposed text of Articles 40.3.4º and 40.3.5º of the Constitution. The proposed text of Article 40.3.4º provides that, in particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002. The use of the term &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amendment, if enacted, is not intended to be a restatement or redefinition of &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo; as used in Article 40.3.3º.</P>
      <P>The existing Article 40.3.3º, as amended in 1992, will remain in place. The effect of the text proposed as Article 40.3.5º is that any Bill containing provisions to amend the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, must be referred to the people in a further referendum if, in future, people wish to amend it.</P>
      <P>The effect of the text proposed as Article 46.6.2º is that if the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, is enacted, and amendments are made to Article 40, the amendments to Article 46 will no longer appear in the official text of the Constitution, and the amendments made to Article 40 will take effect, appearing in the appropriate place within that Article. This is because once the amendment to Article 40.3 takes place, it would be undesirable for the new Article 40.3 to appear in more than one place in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text proposed as Article 46.6.3º contains a mechanism whereby, unless within 180 days &ndash; as Senators know, we discussed this matter already &ndash; a law is enacted in exactly the terms of the text seen and approved by the people when they vote on the proposed amendment, the whole of Article <Col N="1463" /> 46.6 will cease to have effect and the Constitution will revert to the form in which it existed before the referendum.</P>
    <P>The text proposed as Article 46.4 states that the Bill for the law on the protection of human life in pregnancy is excluded from the terms of Articles 26 and 27 of the Constitution, which we have just debated in the previous amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still not totally clear to me. Can the Minister explain the text in the First Schedule, Part 2, lines 30 to 32, which states, &ldquo;but not withstanding such omission this section shall continue to have the force of law&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The term is, &ldquo;but not withstanding such omission [which means that it is being taken out] this section shall continue to have the force of law&rdquo;. While this may be absolutely clear to everyone else, it is opaque to me. I cannot follow exactly what that means. My concern is that we will have to explain this to people, so I would like to be sure what I am explaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that it means the same provision will not appear twice in the Constitution. That is the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because it already exists in one place and there is no point in having it in two places. Therefore, it is not as if the substance is being left out of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance is very clearly in there but it is a kind of redundant clause which the Minister is tidying out of the way. I have no problem with that at all. It seems logical to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. If this amendment to the Constitution is passed, do I take it that henceforth Article 40.3.3º will state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal <Col N="1464" /> right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another state.</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
    <P>I take it the new text will then be inserted as follows:</P>
    <P>4º In particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.</P>
    <P>5º The provisions of section 2 of Article 46 and sections 1, 3 and 4 of Article 47 of this Constitution shall apply to any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas containing a proposal to amend the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, as they apply to a Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution and any such Bill shall be signed by the President forthwith upon his being satisfied that the Bill has been duly approved by the people in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of Article 47 of this Constitution and shall be duly promulgated by the President as a law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>They will vote on the proposed Bill to amend the Constitution, as they have done in the case of every other constitutional amend<Col N="1465" /> ment, whether it was the Fourteenth, Fifteenth or Sixteenth Amendment.

      <P>I am sorry, Senator Taylor-Quinn, but we are not yet dealing with the Second Schedule. We are dealing with the First Schedule at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, a Chathaoirligh, but we are dealing with a fundamental principle of what the people will be voting on. We need to be very clear about what will be presented to the people on the ballot paper and what they will actually be asked to vote on. We have now got clarification from the Minister, specifically, but the more clarification we get the more unconstitutional the proposal appears to be. It is essential that it be strongly opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification, I would point out that this is very similar to what occurred in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1998, state:</P>
      <P>if a declaration under this section is made this subsection and subsections other than the amendment of the Constitution affected thereby, and subsection (5) of this section, shall be omitted from every official text of this Constitution, published thereafter, but notwithstanding such omissions this section shall continue to have the force of law.</P>
      <P>It is exactly the same kind of provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 went on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" />if such a declaration is not made within 12 months of this section being added to the Constitution, or such longer period as may be provided for by law, this section shall cease to have effect and shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution published thereafter. . . </P>
    <P>It is a very similar construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is very similar but not the same. The Minister was talking about a declaration there, not about a Bill that is presented in five Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was talking about an action that was dependent on something happening after the people had voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, which is quite extraneous to the normal legislative process that is incorporated in the Constitution. The Minister was not talking about introducing a Bill that goes through five Stages in each House of the Oireachtas and which is subsequently referred to the President who, in turn, can refer it to the Supreme Court. To draw similarities is not fair because the circumstances are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have argued about the fundamental point that the people are sovereign, and that is very important. It is the people who will decide on this. Only then, after they have decided, will the Act go back to the Oireachtas to be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have no problem with the Act going back to the Oireachtas if the normal process could be followed, whereby be it could be amended in both Houses, passed and referred to the President. What is happening here, however, is unprecedented. It is bringing an unconstitutional role to the Houses of the Oireachtas. In another sense it is diminishing the powers of the President. Inherent within it is another Act which amends the Constitution to reduce the powers of the President. Within this constitutional amendment is another, not very apparent, constitutional amendment which considerably reduces the powers of the President.</P>

      <P>Tairgim leasú a 9:</P>
      <P>I leathanach 9, líne 12, &ldquo;(nó, i gcás éigeandála liachta agus i gcás ina gcreideann an cleachtóir lena mbaineann gur gá sin ar mhaithe le bainistiú leas a othair nó a hothair, in aon áit eile)&rdquo; a chur isteach i ndiaidh &ldquo;fhormheasta&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 12, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(or, in case of medical emergency and where the practitioner concerned believes the management of the welfare of his or her patient so requires, any other place)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to the notion of an approved place. It causes a lot of concern because an element of confusion could arise. Will the Minister clarify what he is likely to do? My understanding is that the term &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; will mean that the Minister, if the referendum is passed and the Bill becomes law, will prescribe by regulation or order the approved places where the procedures can be carried out. I know from work on the all-party committee that in general the major Dublin maternity hospitals are the ones which handle medical emergencies or difficulties in pregnancies from around the country. Am I right in assuming that these hospitals would be approved places? Will the Minister clarify the important matter of what is likely to happen if the referendum is passed and the Bill is enacted? </P>
      <P>On the issue of an approved place, what happens in the event of a pregnancy related medical emergency which occurs far from an approved place? Will the Minister clarify what would happen in such circumstances? I know the legislation also deals with the issue of intent in relation to termination, medical procedure and abortion, and that is presumably to protect medical practitioners. It is not just we as legislators and the public who will be voting in the referendum who need to be clear about what is happening here. Medical practitioners will be in the front line in the carrying out of the provisions of this legislation. I ask the Minister to clarify that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment is designed to clarify the position, particularly in relation to medical practitioners. The wording of the amendment is self-explanatory. We seek to provide further protection in the legislation with the inclusion of the words &ldquo;(or, in the case of medical emergency and where the practitioner concerned believes the management of the welfare of his or her patient so requires, any other place)&rdquo;. In other words, we <Col N="1469" /> seek to ensure that the welfare of the patient is paramount, which I think is also the Minister's intention. Until I hear the Minister's thinking on where these approved places are, I am convinced, given the way the legislation is phrased, that we need to expand along the lines of our amendment. I consider that not only necessary but urgent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the areas in the Bill that causes me most concern. From a practical point of view, this is where we may run into a great deal of difficulty, particularly when we take account of the definition of the term &ldquo;approved place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Second Schedule provides that a person can be a conscientious objector to what is in fact a legal procedure to save the life of the mother. When this section was discussed by the Dáil at Committee Stage, I felt that at any moment they would discuss the situation regarding haemorrhage in particular. While I agree with the masters of the three maternity hospitals that there are four to six cases a year of serious pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, Eisenmenger's syndrome or a problem with another cardiac condition, it is important that we remember there are likely to be greater rather than fewer serious cardiac problems because we have made great strides in cardiac surgery in children in the past 20 years. Those children are now coming up to child-bearing age.</P>
      <P>I cannot be the only doctor who had a patient in her early 30s who was eager to have a child, but was anxious because she had a major cardiac operation as a child and wondered what I thought. That woman's cardiologist told her he felt she should proceed if that was what she wanted. We all had to be aware during her pregnancy that it was at 20 weeks &ndash; when the unborn child is not viable and the blood volume really increases &ndash; that she might run into trouble. We had to be in a position to provide that something could be done to terminate the pregnancy, if necessary.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, I would have thought that situation is all right. Judge O'Flaherty's judgment indicated that there did not have to be immediate signs that a woman's death was about to take place or one did not have to be certain that a woman's death would take place, but that if there was a real and substantial risk to the mother's life the pregnancy could be terminated. It could be aborted, even though the unborn child would not be not viable. I agree with the Minister that there are a small number of cases in this area and there may be more, but I am sure that the obstetricians will be well able to cope with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation regarding haemorrhage was not really considered by the Dáil at Committee Stage. When this area was discussed, I recall the Minister said that he would go back to his medical advisers and ask them what they thought. I am sure he did that because I do not think he wants <Col N="1470" /> any woman's life to be put in danger. There may be a problem in this area in that those who work in large maternity hospitals deal with women who have serious haemorrhage in association with pregnancy, childbirth or in the six weeks after childbirth. That is so common that they may have thought it was run of the mill and could be coped with, but I am not sure it can between the definition on an &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; and the section on conscientious objections.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was asked on Tuesday, 27 November what would be an approved place, he said the Minister would make an order that would list hospitals so approved and, on foot of amendments being brought forward, the Oireachtas would have the opportunity to affirm these orders. We got more information from the Taoiseach on what would be an approved place. In a reply to Deputy Noonan he said, the term &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; is intended to be applied to hospitals under responsible management, possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology and in the treatment and prevention of life-threatening diseases arising out of or complicated by pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned women with HELLP syndrome. For the benefit of other Senators, this is a condition where a woman has very high blood pressure and her condition is so serious that she suffers haemolysis of her red blood cells. That affects her liver and kidneys which start to shut down. This is a dire situation. The last such case I read about in medical literature was of a woman who was approximately 20 weeks pregnant when this happened. It was totally unexpected, but she had access to University College Hospital, Galway, where she was treated very properly. There is some time in such cases to get the woman to hospital. These are not the type of cases about which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Taoiseach's definition of an &ldquo;approved place&rdquo;, having regard to the contracting nature of the maternity services. Even during the Minister's term of office quite a number of hospitals with maternity units have been closed. For example, we have all been involved at some level with the debate that has taken place in the North-Eastern Health Board on the closure of Monaghan and Dundalk hospitals. That decision was right because there was not an adequate number of staff in those hospitals to provide the level of service pregnant women require. The Minister was right to support the report which recommended that there could be midwife led services there, but that will not come under the Taoiseach's definition of what is an approved place. I presume we must go by the Taoiseach's definition, given that no one else has given one.</P>
    <P>There is a contraction in maternity services and a serious deficit of midwives around the country. There is also the problem in the lack of obstetricians. There are major problems regarding medical insurance in these areas. Given these problems, we face serious problems in dealing <Col N="1471" /> with woman who suffer haemorrhage in association with pregnancy.</P>
    <P>As to why they are important, the maternal mortality rate has dropped in all western European countries and we, in the medical profession, have been advised not to quote cases because they are too easily identified. In a bad year we might have three cases of maternal mortality. Naturally, if they are discussed in a maternal mortality report, everyone will know who the woman was. We have stopped doing that for at least the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I was involved in producing maternal mortality reports years ago. It is only 30 years since there may have been 30 such deaths in a year. Major improvements have been made, especially since, with the advent of contraception, there has been a decrease in the number of older women having a large number of children. The most likely women to die were older women with large families. Thankfully, there has been a great diminution in the number of women dying during pregnancy. That is due not only to improved obstetrics care but also to the fact that women have more of a choice about whether they become pregnant. If women have had an illness, in many cases they are unlikely to try to become pregnant again. I can remember hearing of women with rheumatic hearts in maternity wards in this city. They were lined up for death. All that was ahead of them was cardiac failure and while the baby may have been born and may have survived, its mother would have died.</P>
    <P>We are advised always to refer to the Report of the Confidential Inquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom. These are excellent reports produced every three years. They reveal that haemorrhage is a major cause of direct maternal deaths. The rate has varied between about 10% and 20% over the past ten years. The unfortunate thing is that many of these cases were unexpected. The cases do not always include all those in early pregnancy as some of the deaths are due to spontaneous abortions which are not reported as many did not happen in maternity hospitals. There may be even more than we know &ndash; the results of the confidential inquiries and the general health statistics always differ, with the greater number of deaths recorded in the latter.</P>
    <P>What women have these haemorrhages? A large number of them are older women and many are women who have had poor maternal care or are not known by the hospitals. Unfortunately, a number of them are from ethnic minorities while others are women who have concealed their pregnancies. This is increasing in this country rather than decreasing. It is a problem that will not go away. This is one of the great difficulties about excluding everywhere that does not have obstetric or paediatric care from the list of approved places. I suggest we would be wiser not to have approved places.</P>
    <P>We have some idea about identifying cases that <Col N="1472" /> might be at risk in this country. Due to the decrease in maternal mortality in recent years efforts have been made to bring forward reports on near miss maternal mortality and I know the Minister has supported this. The following is cited from a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in March 1992:</P>
    <P>Sir, We wish to introduce the term near miss maternal mortality (NMM). This is defined as a serious maternal morbidity directly or indirectly due to pregnancy, arising in pregnancy or within 42 days of delivery necessitating transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or coronary care unit (CCU). The NMM rate is calculated per 1,000 deliveries (including abortions, ectopic pregnancies and hydatidiform moles).</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that abortions in this case are spontaneous abortions. They are not therapeutic abortions, although those that take place before the child is viable could be described as that. They can happen after spontaneous abortions. This is really risky because when someone is 15 to 19 weeks into pregnancy she may have had very little contact with the doctor or hospital. These are a very vulnerable group. That letter was from 1992 and I am sure the Minister or his advisers will have seen a recent letter in the same journal from the University College Hospital in Galway that raised this issue again. They pointed out that there are still no statistics on near miss maternal mortality available and that they should be provided. The major hospitals in the Dublin area are certainly trying to produce this and I applaud the Minister's encouragement of that as it is extraordinarily important.</P>
    <P>A recent near miss maternal mortality survey carried out in the Coombe Hospital gives some indication of conditions. Dr. Bridgette Byrne was the consultant in charge and Dr. Carmel Sheridan was one of the registrars who worked on it. The survey ran from January 1999 until October 2001 inclusive. It was very well done. It was important that it should be a prospective survey as there is no point in carrying out a retrospective survey. In the period, 21,170 women delivered babies. Of that number, more than 50 were near miss maternal mortalities, that is about one in 400. It is many people. Haemorrhage was the major cause of near miss maternal mortality, with 31 women suffering from it. This does not include those who with post-partum or caesarean hysterectomies also suffered serious haemorrhages.</P>
    <P>There were eight instances of eclampsia which is associated with high blood pressure and kidney problems. That is a much smaller number, yet it is for them we are catering in our approved places. There was a case of failed incubation &ndash; that was an anaesthetic problem &ndash; and amniotic fluid embolism, which is totally unexpected and nothing could be done about it. There was also a case of diabetic ketoacidosis. That can be a problem, which involves dealing with diabetics, and I <Col N="1473" /> am sure the hospital was able to care for the person. There was also a case of respiratory failure.</P>
    <P>The big group were the 31 who suffered haemorrhage. How much bleeding did these women have? The near miss maternal mortality criteria was taken from a protocol from Pretoria, South Africa, which was agreed some years ago and is considered to be very useful. It asked if the woman had to have more than five units of blood. That would involve the replacement of a woman's entire blood volume. It is quite a bleed, and there were 31 of them.</P>
    <P>Suppose this were to happen in a rural area. I do not know if the Independent Deputies who are pushing this have been assured that approved places are to be provided in each of their constituencies. I would like to know what is going to happen to someone who starts bleeding in Goleen. Bantry has no obstetrics unit and it will not be an approved place. I do not think the Minister should build one there &ndash; that is not what I am asking. If this happens I suggest that Senator O'Donovan should become a conscientious objector, head for Castletownbere and let Deputy Healy-Rae deal with the matter. By the time the woman would reach Cork she would be very ill. She may have bled for quite some time before anyone got to her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>She would not be treated on the side of a hill and one would not propose that. That is the core point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Amazingly some women could be treated there. If a woman had a spontaneous abortion, up to about 18 weeks, she could be treated. I worked in the Rotunda Hospital and we used to go around the district before these women were admitted. We dealt with them in houses. I recall being with a woman in a room at the top of Parnell Square while her husband shone a light on her from the next room because they were living in poverty. She lay on a mattress on the floor while the registrar and I dealt with her. She was not admitted to hospital.</P>
      <P>However, it is not correct of the Minister to say no one will be able to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will run into serious danger because of this provision even though the Minister does not want anyone to run into serious danger. I am dying to see what Deputy Fox will do when people in Glendalough ask her to get a woman to Dublin in an ambulance when the snow is on the ground and the ambulance has to pass Loughlinstown Hospital because it has no obstetrics or paediatric care, the Blackrock Clinic, although in these circumstances the woman would be taken in, and St. Vincent's Hospital until it arrives Holles Street Hospital. That is a serious situation. Something should certainly be done for her in Loughlinstown but it will not be an approved place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will Deputy Gildea do for people in Ard<Col N="1474" /> ara? Will he attempt to cross the mountain passes to reach Letterkenny or will he travel to Sligo? Both journeys involve long distances and that coastline is well populated as people are encouraged to live there. Others are advised to travel to Derry where they will not have the problem of meeting a conscientious objector. This is serious.</P>
    <P>I do not like another aspect of the approved places, namely that they will only be used for what is a legal procedure. Nothing new will be made legal. An inference can be drawn from this provision that some doctors may be doing things they should not be in other places but that is not happening. The intention of the provision is to prevent people from carrying out socio-economic abortions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly to give the best medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all about safety. I will argue the point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often the best thing is to travel to the centre of greatest expertise but when one is travelling between Goleen and Cork one is dealing with another scenario. I do not ask the Minister to establish an obstetrics unit in Bantry. I read the health strategy to establish whether the proposed medical helicopter would be introduced but it has not been provided for and, therefore, such a helicopter will not be available to fish these women out.</P>
      <P>I would not be concerned about this except that I have seen dreadful bleeding, involving 50 units of blood. The cases mentioned involved five units. However, I spoke to the consultant involved and greater amounts of blood are involved in these cases. At least in places like Bantry the medical personnel would be able to group and cross match blood and request it. This provision is fraught with danger but none of my colleagues will not conduct socio-economic abortions on women.</P>
      <P>It is nine years since the X case and there has not been one case in which the suicide ground was used so that someone could have an abortion. The only case that was mentioned in the press was the 13 year old child who had been raped and was threatening suicide. An approved place is unfortunate. Senior managers may have said to the Minister not to worry because they can cope with everything, but I am not sure that will be case. The Minister will be aware of the old expression &ldquo;over my dead body&rdquo;. I do not want anything to happen that will be over any woman's dead body and I am quite sure the Minister also does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The atmosphere in the Chamber indicates this issue was not dealt with in the Lower House with the same clarity and detail demonstrated by Senator Henry as she arrived at the nub of the issue. She has outlined real life situations using her medical expertise and know<Col N="1475" /> ledge. I ask the Minister to re-examine the amendment. Perhaps Senator Henry will table the amendment for Report Stage so that he will have time to go through it. Fine Gael would have examined the concept of approved places but we wanted reassurance that the necessary expertise would be available in the approved places.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage Senator Henry said she was concerned about women in remote parts of the country who might be at risk. She mentioned Goleen and Wicklow and I refer to west Limerick, north Tipperary or west Clare. The Senator is saying lives can be saved by adopting a broader interpretation. This needs to be spelt out clearly and a great deal of work needs to be done on approved places. She is absolutely correct, as we read day in day out about the shortage of midwives in large urban centres, that rural areas should be examined in this context. People take it that everything is fine because childbirth is natural, but Senator Henry graphically explained what happens when one comes across a relative or friend who experiences complications and an immediate decision must be made regarding the life of the mother.</P>
      <P>I am extremely supportive of Senator Henry's amendment. Extensive logical and practical information has been put to the Minister regarding this issue. He has said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to earlier amendments but he has time to take into account Senator Henry's professional understanding of the plight of women in such cases, particularly where women have survived but are at risk. I implore the Minister to take the amendment on board and consider it before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The breadth and depth of knowledge she displayed must be seriously considered. An approved place is ill defined in the legislation but her point is that no matter how it is defined it will not cover certain circumstances which could result in a fatality. She provided statistics on the incidence of haemorrhage among women, which could happen in a maternity hospital or as a result of a serious accident. There is a wide set of circumstances which could give rise to a medical condition that would need to be treated in an emergency where an approved place might not be easily accessible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the option of the Labour Party amendment or that of Senator Henry. She has proposed the deletion of &ldquo;an approved place&rdquo; so that all circumstances that might arise can be dealt with through a reasonable response. Our amendment would leave the reference to &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; in the Bill on the general understanding that it would be a hospital with obstetric and paediatric and neo-natal services, <Col N="1476" /> etc., but would provide for the following caveat, &ldquo;(or, in cases of medical emergency and where the practitioner concerned believes the management of the welfare of his or her patient so requires, any other place)&rdquo;. What we are saying is that &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; will not cover all circumstances and that the Minister should accept an amendment which would deal with emergencies.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any examples given, whether it is Goleen or the fastness of Donegal, there could be circumstances arising in Dublin, with the current traffic congestion, where it would take just as long to reach an approved place, wherever that may be. It is unsatisfactory that we must deal with this definition of &ldquo;approved place&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;a place in the State approved for the time being by order as being suitable&rdquo;, without having a clear idea how many of these places will be approved, where they will be and what the services will be in these approved places. It is left up in the air and it is confusing.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there are serious practical problems which must be addressed here and we would like a positive response from the Minister. He must remember that what we are talking about is a procedure that, even within the context of the terms of the provision here, will be an emergency. The Bill states, &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life&rdquo;, and therefore we are dealing with approved places only in the context of emergencies and immediate action being required.</P>
    <P>One is talking about special circumstances with which one must deal all the time. That is a highly important point. It is not about the run of the mill medical procedures. These are exceptional circumstances in every single case we are talking about. That must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I understand we are taking amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together. In the other amendment, where we are proposing to delete the last clause of section 1(2), that is, after &ldquo;a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life&rdquo; to delete the words &ldquo;other than by self-destruction&ldquo;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support my colleagues who have put forward these various amendments, but in particular Senator Henry. I agree with the praise which has been given to her. The Minister must really listen carefully to what has been said because it was said so simply and without heat but clearly and factually from firmly grounded personal medical experience. The examples she <Col N="1477" /> gave were admirable also because they indicated the difficulty of people having to travel long distances and the risks to which their lives might be exposed in this area.</P>
      <P>There is a suspicion around the House that, for political reasons, no amendments will be accepted in the Seanad. We are well used to this but it is a violation of the designated role of this House under the Constitution for such a position to be adopted, even informally, and we all know that it happens.</P>
      <P>This is a compassionate and caring Minister. I need not remind him that he is Minister for Health and Children and that his responsibility is not to the political convenience of the Government or any particular party. His responsibility is clearly the welfare of patients. That is paramount, however much trouble it might get the Minister into with some of his colleagues if the Bill must be returned to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a very serious problem indeed has been drawn to our attention. If it goes through without an amendment of this kind, as I read the Bill, a doctor in an emergency who performs a therapeutic routine in order to save the life of a patient may in fact be guilty of a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>He will if he is not in the approved place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to tell me if that is the case, that a doctor saving a woman's life on the side of the road or in another kind of hospital, which does not have all the facilities which the Taoiseach thinks they should have, is guilty of a criminal offence, that the Minister is criminalising the saving of life. He cannot accept that.</P>
      <P>What about it if the Bill must return to the Dáil? That is where it must go. At the end of the day our responsibility is to the welfare of the patient.</P>
      <P>There is an argument, as there is with regard to home births, etc., that it is better to have these emergencies dealt with in a place where there are facilities of the best kind available. In an ideal world that is so, but the amendment in the names of Senators Ryan, Costello and O'Meara makes it perfectly clear that this is in the case of emergencies.</P>
      <P>Emergencies are not neat. That is part of their character. They are untidy, unpredictable, unexpected and one must act on the spur of the moment. If one has the medical expertise that will allow him or her to save the life of another human being, is it appropriate that because of technical considerations this act should be deemed by the State under this legislation to be criminal? I cannot believe that to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister could not possibly have heard a clearer argument in defence of an amendment of this sort put forward by this side of the House. I will certainly be strongly supporting this important amendment. The Minister and his advisers would only gain credit for taking <Col N="1478" /> action in this regard to ensure the welfare of the patient, the ordinary citizen of Ireland. That, not political convenience of any kind, is what must be paramount.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has listened to the incredibly compelling argument put forward by Senator Henry could only support her amendment. It is utterly compelling. She has made the case. She has the expertise which, unfortunately, none of us has. We are lucky that she is here to participate in this debate. Others of us have expertise and experience in different areas of an immediate nature which relate to this proposed Bill, but the almost heartrending plea and argument that Senator Henry is making cannot possibly be ignored.</P>
      <P>Once more we are back to theory as opposed to practice. This is a theme which runs right through this Bill. We can not afford to ignore realities in relation to women's life and health. If we ignore this amendment, this is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I cannot add any more to the argument that has been put forward by Senator Henry in terms of compassion for expectant mothers. I would earnestly entreat the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>This section gives us a definition of approved place. It states clearly that it is one &ldquo;approved for the time by order as being suitable for the purpose of this section&rdquo;. Therefore the Minister will be empowered to make an order to designate an approved place. The Minister can choose to designate as few or as many as he or she so wishes and therefore in a sense we are literally at the whim of the Minister. One individual can make a decision in whatever manner he or she chooses. How will the Minister decide what is an approved place, where it will be located and the details of such a place?</P>
      <P>The subsection further restricts the right to life of the mother if she does not have access to an approved place. Article 40.3.3º states that the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the right to life of the mother and guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws &ndash; not by orders &ndash; to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>The number of places approved may increase or diminish a woman's right. It may vary depending on what part of the country she lives in, the climatic conditions at any given time and the distance she may reside from an approved place. The inclusion of the words &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; will restrict a woman's right to life. Senator Henry made a compelling case, which impresses me as I am from a rural area, on near miss maternal mortality in the survey. Of the 50 women included, 31 suffered from a serious haemorrhage. She also gave examples of localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants to be responsible as we are discussing a situation where a normal, natural <Col N="1479" /> miscarriage occurs and the woman needs medical attention. If she does not get to the approved place to receive the proper medical attention, she may lose her life. As Senator Henry said &ndash; we are fortunate to have someone of her medical expertise among us &ndash; five units of blood was the criterion applied in the survey, a considerable amount.</P>

      <P>It is a startling and convincing figure. The Minister must consider the information supplied by Senator Henry and consequently accept this amendment. There is a danger in including the words &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; as they will put at risk the lives of women living in isolated rural areas which are medically disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry stated, the recently published health strategy did not provide the helicopter which many of us had called for. In west Clare it is over 50 miles from Loop Head to Ennis. Limerick or Galway, 90 miles away, may become the approved place. This is a serious situation which must be reviewed, not just because of the information laid before us, but also because of the constitutional protection. Will women be discriminated against because of where they reside?</P>

      <P>This is a good discussion, but the emergency about which we are talking is acute and sudden blood loss. The fluid lost can be replaced on the side of the road. In rural Ireland most general practitioners carry plasma expanders and fluid. The first thing to do is to stabilise the patient and reverse the shock. She is then taken to a hospital for proper and adequate treatment.</P>
      <P>The other reality is that women in Ireland are voting for high-tech maternity units. District hospitals are closed and children are no longer delivered in nursing homes. Mothers go to the Rotunda, the Coombe and Holles Street because they feel certain that they will get the best possible treatment if anything goes wrong. If the Minister was to designate a hospital which did not have full obstetrical support &ndash; the minimum in any unit is two obstetricians on full call &ndash; he would be guilty of and encouraging malpractice. The public, especially ladies, would turn on him. In the Bill he must ensure appropriate treatment is given in appropriate units.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment would provide for an exclusion of requirement that procedures be carried out in approved places in an emergency and when the medical prac<Col N="1480" /> titioner believes that the welfare of his or her patient requires it. Senator Henry's amendment would remove the requirement regarding an approved place in section 1(2) and its definition in section 1(3). This would permit the procedures to be undertaken in any location, not just those approved by the Minister or the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Oireachtas will ultimately approve the places as I brought forward an amendment to this effect in the other House with the support of other parties. This means that orders to give effect to approved places will have to be voted on by both Houses, which is not the normal way to introduce orders and regulations which require a motion to nullify them. It will not be one person's decision, although the Minister will make the proposals. We envisage they will include major maternity and acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>When this started I sought advice on this specific point from the masters of the three major maternity hospitals. As a lay person, I asked about emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not but, with respect, these are the people who are aware of the complications. It is generally agreed that they gave clear, solid submissions to the Oireachtas committee. As this issue was raised on Committee Stage in the other House, I sought medical advice from my own chief medical officer. I discussed it again this morning. As Senator Fitzpatrick said, the first priority where a woman is haemorrhaging is to stabilise and then move her to a centre where she can get the best of care. What the masters said to me was that in these rare and exceptional cases, about which Senator Costello spoke &ndash; exceptional does not equate to emergency &ndash; they would bring in other medical practitioners to help and discuss the case. Cardiac, liver, renal or a range of other functions could be involved where the life of a mother is at risk because of pregnancy. All would involve a multidisciplinary team approach to her care in order to decide the best course of action.</P>
      <P>The major issues discussed and the major medical conditions which would constitute a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother were pre-eclampsia or Eisenmenger's syndrome or cancer of the womb. It is said that these would be diagnosed in the normal way. Immediate action would not be required. There would be three or four such cases in any given year. These are the conditions where the woman concerned would be brought to a tertiary level centre. Her condition would be assessed and monitored over a period of time. It is in that context that decisions are made as to whether a medical procedure is necessary to save her life that would have the effect of ending the life of the unborn in her womb.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1481" />There would be a great issue of safety if we were to delete the words &ldquo;approved places.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because one would then be opening up the idea of taking chances. I accept the validity and the motivation of the excellent contribution of Senator Henry, but it is equally valid to argue the other side of the coin. The position on mortality rates has improved dramatically in recent years. The position on maternal mortality rates has improved in the last 30 or 40 years because of advances in medical practice and in terms of the environment in which women give birth. It did not happen by accident. Other socio-economic issues are also a factor. There is a very strong argument on safety grounds for putting in place a framework and controls in terms of where the medical procedures in question should take place. There are also strong arguments on the other side of the coin, but if one was to delete the words in question, one would leave the situation wide open. One may leave it open for individuals to carry out illegal abortions. That is one consideration.</P>
      <P>The chief medical officer and others are very strongly of the view that there is a very strong safety dimension to this issue. Even the Institute of Obstetricians makes the point about the need for multidisciplinary teams of doctors who would invariably be involved before a medical procedure would be carried out that would end the life of the unborn in the event of a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. The situation is by no means black and white.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that there would be ample time to treat the conditions in question in terms of appropriate facilities where the highest level of medical expertise could be brought to bear on the situation. The legal side is equally important. Section 1(1) states that &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn life after implantation in the womb of a woman. Subsections (1) and (2) are not simple alternatives to each other, but must be read together. We are talking here about intentional destruction. The absence of one element under section 1(2) does not automatically mean that an abortion is being committed under section 1(1). There is an inference that if a doctor intervenes in an emergency and because of his intervention the unborn human life is ended, that automatically constitutes an abortion. It does not. There has to be deliberate premeditated intent to terminate the life of the unborn in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very unlikely event that a case would be of the sort which would be taken, the rebuttal presumption is enshrined in the Bill. The Director of Public Prosecutions would have to initiate the case in the first instance. There are very strong barriers or obstacles to those who might want to take a range of cases against doctors in any given situation, but it is not as simple as that. There would be many hurdles to jump before a case <Col N="1482" /> ends up in court. We do not want to reach that position because we do not want medical practitioners in a situation where they have to save the life of the mother to be looking over their shoulders. This is the first Bill to give legislative certainty to medical practitioners in intervening to save the life of a mother. While they have been doing so up to now, they themselves have said they feel they are acting in an uncertain legal environment and are anxious that it be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Given the strength of the arguments made, I will look at the matter again overnight. I wish to make it clear that I am not promising anything. We will have a final discussion on Report Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am not so worried about a doctor being sued. I do not think that will happen. My concern is that someone will do nothing because they will be afraid to act in a dire situation. Senator Fitzpatrick is correct. General practitioners could do an enormous amount, but might be in a situation where they would be forced to terminate a pregnancy if they encounter someone with a serious bleed 16 weeks into pregnancy. Senator Fitzpatrick points out that a GP would try to stabilise the patient, but bleeding during pregnancy is another kettle of fish. Confidential inquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom note that Dextran should be avoided for fluid replacement because of its possible effects on haemostasis. In other words, it can lead to a situation where the bleeding will become worse. It is suggested that intravenous crystalloid and artificial plasmatic expanders such as Haemoceel should be used. I do not know of any GP who is going around with intravenous crystalloid and artificial plasmatic expanders in his or her bag.</P>

      <P>I am not worried about a doctor being sued. I am worried about him or her doing nothing in an emergency. I am worried about the woman losing her life because the doctor cannot get her to an approved place. The figures I mentioned from the Coombe Hospital survey do not cover early or ectopic pregnancies. They were excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister will look at the matter again overnight. I am not trying to be difficult. I do not think there is one Member in this or the other House, one member of the <Col N="1483" /> Government, anyone, who wants any woman's life to be in danger. I do not think people will get smart and try to do things in peripheral hospitals. It is vital that patients are moved to tertiary level hospitals. Doctors are warned not to deal with cases with which they cannot cope. They must be moved quickly to ensure expert care. I am not asking the Minister to establish peripheral units. I am merely pointing out the danger that a doctor not in an approved place may do nothing. We are constantly warned that time is of the essense where there is bleeding, particularly in obstetrics.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the matter again. I do not think people will deal with cases with which they cannot cope as they will only invite litigation if they do. The Minister does not want a woman to be in danger, nor does Senator Fitzpatrick. None of us does.</P>
    <P>There is a piece at the end where one can be a conscientious objector to carrying out one of these procedures. The procedure is a life-saving one for the mother. A woman could arrive in a very serious condition at a peripheral hospital and meet a junior doctor. The doctor may have to verify if the hospital is approved. Having discovered it is not, he might announce he is a conscientious objector. It would not be possible to blame him. The medical council guidelines warn about such cases. The senior medical practitioners have to try to take responsibility for dealing with the most difficult cases. However, there may be nobody senior available.</P>
    <P>At the last two meetings of obstetricians and gynaecologists, this topic was raised repeatedly and people from the peripheral hospitals were extremely anxious about it. The Minister's definition of approved places appears to be expanding on the Taoiseach's definition, but it is still very loose. Because the Minister is making orders, we could leave out approved places and if people start getting smart, the Minister could say it is outrageous and do something about it.</P>
    <P>Of course women want to be looked after in the best places, but there is much evidence from the British figures and now from the Coombe survey which is rather alarming. If we consider ectopic pregnancies and spontaneous&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, they eventually turned up at the Coombe. It has not been published yet, but I am grateful to the people who carried out the survey and spoke to me. Although most of these events were managed in a maternity hospital, management outside these perimeters occurred in selective cases. This is the problem. They did not manage to get them to the hospital, even the Coombe. This is a matter of life and death. Nobody, especially the Minister for Health and Children, who may have to look after the children that are left, wants to enable this. I am grateful that the Minister has said he will consider this. <Col N="1484" /> We have nothing to lose. The medical profession is very honourable. I hate the suspicion people have that the medical profession will try to do abortions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's open approach to this issue. He has clearly listened to the concerns that have been raised. I look forward to hearing what he has to say tomorrow, having thought about it overnight.</P>
      <P>Based on the last comments by Senator Henry, unfortunately over the past 20 years a degree of fear has entered into the general relationship between pregnant women, or women who intend to become pregnant, and the medical profession. We are debating the issue of legislative certainty for doctors on the one hand and the need to ensure women's lives are protected in every context. From listening to the masters of the main maternity hospitals who addressed the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it is clear their day-to-day concern is to always ensure the pregnant woman is protected and kept in the best possible health.</P>
      <P>When we pass legislation, we have a responsibility to ensure there are no loopholes left and there is the greatest degree of certainty possible for doctors and of course patients. That is the root of our concern over the issue of approved places. The more I hear about this, the more concerned I become. In his response the Minister said the approved places in general will be the major maternity and acute hospitals so there will not be a shortage of approved places. However, there will be a list of approved places and this will not include every hospital in the country. Once the list is published and passed by the Oireachtas, they will become the only places women can go in the certainty that, in the event of a medical procedure being required that would result in ending the pregnancy, this will happen. That is why we tabled the amendment and in the light of the Minister's response, I believe it is still necessary. The Minister has said the deletion of the words &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; would result in not having any hospital that could carry out such a procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure could be carried out anywhere and clearly that is not the intention of the legislation, which should give legislative certainty for doctors and patients in cases of medical emergency. In light of what the Minister has said, our amendment is necessary to address our concerns and those of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned in passing by the Minister, it is the intention of this legislation to ensure that illegal abortions are not carried out. In other words, the Minister relies on the judgment of the medical practitioners in the major maternity and acute hospitals to determine whether a particular medical procedure is required, which would result unintentionally or otherwise in the ending of the <Col N="1485" /> pregnancy. We are placing our trust in those hospitals to implement the legislation and the constitutional amendment if passed by the people. We should be clear about what we are putting into law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's open attitude and in responding tomorrow, I ask him to try to give us more details about where the approved places will be.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated approved places would be existing maternity hospitals. If that is the case, I remind Senator Fitzpatrick that Loop Head is 200 miles from the Rotunda Hospital. It is 70 miles to the maternity hospital in Limerick and 90 miles to the maternity hospital in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all. One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy O'Hanlon, withdrew the maternity service from Clare in 1987 or 1988 and the women from there were so vehemently opposed that they marched on the streets. They have no choice but to go to Limerick because no other facility exists.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Henry's concerns about the fears that may exist concerning general practitioners. It is possible to envisage GPs in Carrigaholt, Kilkee or Kilrush finding that under section 2(1) they have to carry out a medical procedure at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which human life is ended. In such a case a GP would have to decide whether to take a chance and put her on an ambulance to Limerick or Galway. A GP who carries out a procedure in a surgery or the patient's house may be prosecuted as having engaged in criminal activity.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its continuous refusal to rectify the disgraceful situation whereby only certain areas have school attendance officers, leaving large areas of population without this essential service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister for Education and Science is aware of the reasons I speak vehemently about this issue. What was rural Dublin 20 years ago is no longer rural Dublin. Certain sections of the Minister's constituency are in the Dublin Corporation area, while large areas are controlled by county councils. The School Attendance Act, 1926, and the school attendance committees which were formed in 1892 observed the differ<Col N="1486" /> ence between urban and rural areas. That was fine for urban villages around the city of Dublin, such as Tallaght, Terenure, Clondalkin, Lucan, Swords and Howth, although I am not familiar with the Minister's end of the city. Those villages have grown enormously over the past 20 or 30 years, but they are outside the remit of Dublin Corporation. For that reason, there are no school attendance officers in those areas. I am aware that other county boroughs throughout the country and the old Dún Laoghaire Corporation area had and still have school attendance officers.</P>
    <P>The 1926 Act spells out in black and white the obligation on children to attend school, on parents to send children to school and on the school attendance committees to provide for school attendance officers to ensure these obligations are carried out. I am sure the Minister knows that many children from the age of eight are falling through the net and being lost to society. In many cases they descend into a subculture of crime which leads to drugs and probably prison.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why such a glaring problem has not been recognised. The gardaí in rural areas, which include the old villages around Dublin, are the school attendance agents. I cannot understand how anyone expects gardaí from stations in Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and Tallaght to be school attendance officers. The strength of the Garda unit in Clondalkin has been reduced by almost one third since 1975, but crime has increased by more than one third. It is ludicrous to think that school attendance problems will be dealt with in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Although we do not often see school attendance officers in the courts, at least there is a system in the city area which involves reporting back to the local authority. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is always asking us as local authority members to use our powers more. I do not understand why certain local authorities have the support of school attendance officers, while major local authorities, like my own, have only nominal support. There is a population of more than 250,000 in the South Dublin County Council area. However, it does not have one school attendance officer. I strongly suggest that someone should do a rain check on how many parents have been brought to court because their children are not attending school. It would be a lonely trawl through the records to find anyone who has been prosecuted recently.</P>
    <P>We are resorting to taking children into care when their behaviour is at variance with society's norms. These children could easily be helped at an earlier stage if we had decent school attendance support. It is shameful. We all know that in many built up areas there are some single and married parents who, because of drug or alcohol addiction, do not have access to education and are not able, competent or willing to ensure their children attend school. We may as well condemn those children at seven years of age. It is not unusual to see a number of children playing in <Col N="1487" /> my area on any given school day. I guarantee that when they are 16, they will not be playing. They will still be together, but they will be up to no good. It seems wrong. The fine for non-attendance was 40 shillings in 1926, it is now £2. I do not know how many euros that will be.</P>
    <P>It is negligent of us to do nothing. The Minister will probably tell me about the new agency, which I would welcome. However, it will probably not become operational until two years from now. It is possible Fianna Fáil will not be in Government. I am not saying that the objectives of the legislation should be ignored, but there may be different ways of achieving them. In the long run there will be more and more delays and we will be creating out-of-school schools for young delinquents.</P>
    <P>I never want to return to the old days when the man from the school went around to homes on a bicycle and if the parents did not co-operate the child was sent into care, usually in what was euphemistically described as an industrial school. If we do not pull up our socks collectively and if we continue to ignore what is happening, we may have to provide some form of custodial schooling in order to save these young people from themselves and from the consequences of the lack of care they have received.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, most politicians have sat on school boards and I currently do so. What do we do with the appallingly disruptive pupils who do not conform, even after 50 chances? They are sent out into the wilderness. If they had been identified sooner we might not have that problem. We should be providing another form of schooling for those who cannot make it through the formal system.</P>
    <P>I plead for power to be returned to local authorities in both rural and urban areas. It is only a couple of years ago that there were cases of people on the same street living on either side of the city-county boundary and those on the county side did not get the fuel allowance on the basis that they had at their disposal the picking of branches and osiers. I have always thought &ldquo;osiers&rdquo; a wonderful word. We now have the ridiculous circumstance in which children in former villages which are now thriving towns are being deprived and that is a terrible social sin. The Minister's heart is in the right place, but that is no good unless an Act is put in place that will give control back to local authorities and allow them to employ school attendance officers with some hope of making a breakthrough.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted to second the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Ridge, who was referred to at one point as Sister Ridge. I do not know if that was supposed to be a teaching sister or a reverend mother.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the arguments we have all rehearsed in relation to cherishing our children equally. As Senator Ridge rightly points out, there is an anomaly whereby some areas have school attendance officers to follow up on truancy while others do not. There are two different systems operating in two parts of the Dún Laoghaire constituency.</P>
      <P>If we are to have true equality in our society the education system has a vital role. The Minister believes that, as do I. It feels like a thousand years since I was a teacher and a guidance counsellor and I am constantly amazed and disappointed that in spite of major improvements being made and efforts by every Government, so little has changed for the most disadvantaged members of our society. It is very difficult to break the cycle of deprivation. The mantra of &ldquo;education, education, education&rdquo; is essential if our children are to have the future they deserve. The disadvantaged should be on a par with their peers and get the sort of education and opportunities that, thankfully, my children have enjoyed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been quite rightly congratulated for giving the go ahead to recruit a chief executive officer for the new educational welfare board. I remember debating the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999. I have been so engrossed in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, that I did not have an opportunity to look back through the debates from that time. I remember that when I graduated and was teaching and studying for the higher diploma in education, one of the jobs I went for was that of school attendance officer. I cannot remember the name of the man who was in charge of that area at the time, but he was a very enlightened person and he wanted to have a system of welfare officers. He wanted to get away from having school attendance officers and the type of scenario Senator Ridge spoke of where truants were sent to Artane. It was over 20 years ago and he had that enlightened attitude. I remarked on that when we debated the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999. It was not a bad Bill, but it is only now that we are recruiting the chief executive officer for the educational welfare board.</P>
      <P>Part of the remit of the board is to have educational welfare officers operating at regional and local level and that is great. The service will include the existing school attendance service and its focus will be to assist children at risk and their families to avoid non-attendance at school. In co-operation with schools it will provide a range of supports and measures to discourage absenteeism and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new approach shifts the focus from punitive sanctions imposed after a non-attendance pattern is already well established. The Minister says it is very important that the new service is available as soon as possible and that it will be of great benefit to children, parents, teachers and schools. He thanks the board for its work to date <Col N="1489" /> and looks forward to further progress. It is no wonder there was a little cynicism in what Senator Ridge had to say about this issue. It does not seem to have been given urgent priority. I do not blame the Minister for that because I do not doubt his commitment, but somewhere along the line, perhaps within the permanent government, as I call it, in the Department of Education and Science, there has been some reluctance to progress this.</P>
    <P>My plea is that all the children be treated equally and cherished equally and that the heart-felt plea of Senator Ridge be recognised. I ask that there be school welfare officers throughout the country and support for children and parents to ensure those children get every advantage in their school career and stay in school. If they are not there they are not learning anything or, worse, are out on the streets learning the kind of things we prefer they do not know.</P>
    <P>There are areas of utter deprivation in Dún Laoghaire, though people almost laugh when I say it. There is a black spot two miles from my home where two years ago the unemployment rate was 87%, though it is now less than that. It is full of lone mothers. There is a great sense of community there and the area is being refurbished. One knows that the young people from that area will not be captains of industry unless a miracle happens. They will end up two miles in the other direction in the open prison for young offenders in Shanganagh Castle. The Governor of Mountjoy Prison has repeatedly stated the well-known fact that those imprisoned for minor and serious drug offences are illiterate, not numerate, and come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Young offenders are only sent to Shanganagh for six months and the first task is to give them some basic life skills. There needs to be follow-up for these young people. As Senator Ridge said, there is no point in a school attendance officer going to a child's home to find no one there and that officer then has to go away. An integrated service with proper follow-up is needed.</P>
    <P>In theory it is great that everything mentioned in the Government amendment is promised and that the process of recruiting the chief executive officer for the Educational Welfare Board is in train. I do not know if that is completed. I cannot emphasise enough how urgent this issue is, especially in a society where there is a widening gulf between the haves and have nots. I implore the Minister to take seriously the timely motion our colleague has tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seanad Éireann welcomes the Government's initiative in enacting the Education (Welfare) Act and establishing the interim Educational Welfare Board, which is currently making arrangements for a new schools welfare service to include the present <Col N="1490" /> attendance officers and put in place the new support service for school children at risk and develop a nationwide service and for introducing positive measures to prevent school leaving and to make attendance more feasible and attractive.</P>
    <P>I find the wording the Government's &ldquo;continuous refusal to rectify the disgraceful situation&rdquo; in the motion tabled by Senator Ridge disturbing. The Government has enacted the Education (Welfare) Act. Senator Ridge is correct to say we had a haphazard system. I worked in it and dealt with it and I would hate for the new system to be under the remit of a local authority. It is not the place for it because local authorities have not dealt with this issue well. The previous scheme was too large to work and could not be monitored properly. It was very haphazard in that all the corporations &ndash; Dublin, Limerick and Waterford &ndash; had attendance officers, as they were called, and no other local authority did. Successive Governments did not rectify this, which is why I am delighted the Government is getting it right.</P>
    <P>The Government is right to take this matter slowly because this is the first time school attendance will be put on a proper statutory basis and where there will be a national framework for the provision of a service to deal with children who are at risk or are drop-outs. The board must be put on a statutory basis and it is timely that this is done. The Minister has acknowledged this.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Educational Welfare Board are to devise a national policy, deal with absenteeism and provide supports for children. Since the Government came to power, a number of supports have been introduced in schools, such as home-school links, using resource teachers to help those who cannot be contained in classrooms, start-up education to assist parents in becoming aware of the importance of their children attending school and the psychological service, which is not yet 100% right, but I know the Minister's heart is in the right place in this regard. These basic support services are in place. While they are not yet in operation everywhere because it is a huge and monumental task to deal with all the small areas where children drop out of school, we have, however, begun to deal with the issue. I am delighted we have targeted funds towards disadvantaged areas for young people who drop out of school at 14, 15 and 16. The task is to lure them back into the system and to set up a structure to do that where they have taken up employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge is correct to say that many of those who have dropped out have taken up employment. Many leave school because they get jobs. It is right that the new board will form links with employers to implement a registration process whereby employers will have to notify the board when they employ young people. This will assist in continuing to provide education for these young people of 14, 15 and 16. I welcome that and I want it to be structured well enough that that link between employers and the Educational <Col N="1491" /> Welfare Board will be adhered to. Many young people are lured by these easy part-time jobs from which they get a fondness for money which results in their not wanting to return to education. It is important we educate parents about the importance and benefits of attendance at school and education, and this will be a feature of the new board.</P>
    <P>Many new measures are being taken and much is happening. Perhaps Senator Ridge is correct to say it is not happening quickly enough. She is also correct to say that we do not want the old haphazard system. I worked in it and it failed badly throughout the country. However, the system in the Act can work because it is a national framework and there will be education welfare officers who will have a wider remit than attendance officers of old. They will be accountable to the board and this is very important in terms of how they will operate. Linking in with school managers, the psychological service and parents, and managing case studies will be part of the remit of the board.</P>
    <P>This is very good legislation. When the board is established and we have the right chief executive officer, the man who knows where he is coming from&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and who has a feel for what is necessary to deal with this, it should not again happen that people will drop out of school and slip through the net. Resources are being allocated to back-up services. The amendment welcomes what the Minister has done and asks that he ensure that the legislation is implemented and made work on a national basis so that it will be streamlined for every principal throughout the country and will not be the haphazard arrangement where enforcement was dependent on how well one knew the attendance officer. That system failed. We need a proper, firm and accountable structure which brings together all those who deal with young people at risk to ensure they work together to develop a quality service for the good of young people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the points made by Members. I recognise the points made by Senator Ridge and appreciate the existing anomalous position in terms of attendance officers and the Garda. I realise the great importance of this area. On the question of providing a second form of education, Youthreach is very successful in this regard and we supported it strongly in the recent Estimates.</P>

      <P>It was interesting that the Senator raised that point. Senator Keogh said she was interested in a job in that field in the first instance and, at that stage, the person in charge wanted to change to welfare officers. Senator Ormonde recognised that the education welfare board can, in effect, provide a national framework. The staff of the schools' psychological service has been increased from 44 to 88, and advertisements have recently been placed to increase that figure to 125. The service is moving forward quite rapidly and by the end of the next year the Government has agreed that we can proceed to a figure of 200. That will be two years ahead of the figure envisaged in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I am proud to introduce a major new development in Irish education, the provision of a nation-wide educational welfare service for which detailed planning is already under way. The initiative is underpinned by the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which I brought through the Oireachtas only last year. I know the legislation was discussed before that and Senator Keogh mentioned the year 1998. Various discussions took place but I brought it through the Oireachtas last year.</P>
      <P>We know from research that poor school attendance is a common feature of educational disadvantage. The Government in addressing this issue considered that, in addition to the supports already in place, a comprehensive new educational welfare service should be provided. Amendment of the old legislation, under which the existing school attendance service operates, was not considered to be an appropriate way to achieve what the Government had in mind. Instead, major new legislation, setting out a comprehensive new framework, was prepared and has been signed into law. This legislation will see the ending of the old school attendance arrangements and their replacement by a new, nation-wide educational welfare service, incorporating the existing school attendance officers.</P>
      <P>The new service, which will be phased in, will work in conjunction and co-operation with a range of education and other services and supports already in place. The phasing in means it will be provided in areas of greatest disadvantage first, before being spread around the country. Examples of existing education supports and services include the 8-15 early school leavers initiative, the stay in school retention initiative, the giving children an even break initiative, the disadvantaged areas scheme, and the home-school-community liaison scheme. The resources going into these schemes are substantial. There are, for example, more than 370 teachers working full-time as home-school-community liaison officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced the establishment of the new National Educational Welfare Board on 29 May. I established the board on an interim basis in order to enable it to carry out the necessary planning and preparation work for phasing in the new <Col N="1493" /> educational welfare service. I launched the work of the board at its first meeting on 15 June.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides a comprehensive new framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving in a new and supportive way. The Act forms an important part of my policy to tackle disadvantage in education. One might ask why an interim board is being set up, but the alternative would be to leave my Department to establish the different section. Instead of doing that, we will set the board up on an interim basis and allow it to establish the various necessary elements for the full statutory board, and then convert the interim board into the statutory one. It is a more efficient and quicker way of doing it, and will be generally more effective.</P>
    <P>The board will address the underlying causes of non-attendance at school by supporting and encouraging children to attend on a regular basis and by identifying, at an early stage, children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems. This new approach shifts the focus of school attendance policy away from punitive sanctions imposed after a non-attendance pattern is already well developed. We have put in place a more preventative strategy aimed at assisting children and their families to avoid non-attendance and related problems.</P>
    <P>The following elements constitute the main provisions of the Act. The minimum school leaving age will be raised from 15 to 16, or the completion of three years of post primary education, whichever is the later. As I have already said, a National Educational Welfare Board was established in May this year. The board will develop, co-ordinate and implement school attendance policy so as to ensure that every child in the State attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an appropriate education. The board will appoint education welfare officers around the country to work in close co-operation with schools, teachers, parents, community and voluntary bodies, and relevant statutory authorities with a view to encouraging regular school attendance and developing strategies to reduce absenteeism and early school leaving. The education welfare officers will focus, in particular, on children at risk and those who are experiencing difficulties in school attendance, in order to resolve any impediments to their regular attendance at school.</P>
    <P>The board will maintain a register of children receiving education outside the recognised school structure and will assess the adequacy of such education on an ongoing basis. Parents will be required to ensure that their children attend a recognised school or otherwise receive an appropriate minimum education. The board will establish a register of young persons of 16 and 17 years of age who leave school early to take up employment and will make appropriate arrangements for their continuing education and training in consultation with providers and employers, as Senator <Col N="1494" /> Ormonde emphasised. Employers will be obliged to notify the board when they employ an early school leaver, and may not employ a young person who is an early school leaver and who is not registered with the board.</P>
    <P>The Act also contains important provisions covering admission to, and expulsion from, a recognised school. It is my intention that the new services will be fully in place as soon as possible. In that regard, I wish to set out the progress made by the board to date. The designate board has moved ahead quickly with the planning and preparatory work for the new service. The board has met regularly and has established two sub-committees to advance current priorities &ndash; one to progress matters of staffing and organisational structure, and the other to examine the area of research. In considering the implications arising from implementing the provisions of the Act, the board is aware that a range of interested parties will need to be consulted and it will make appropriate arrangements in this regard as soon as a chief executive has been appointed.</P>
    <P>The key resource needed to provide the new service is, of course, staff. The board has, therefore, appointed a firm of management consultants to assist it in identifying staffing requirements and an appropriate organisational structure for the new service. As a first priority, the consultants were asked to develop proposals in relation to the recruitment and appointment of a chief executive. This process has been completed and I recently gave approval to the board to go ahead with its proposals in this regard. The post has been advertised in the national newspapers and the closing date for applications was Friday, 7 December. The requirements for senior management and other posts are currently being identified by the consultants and I understand that the board has placed a tight deadline for the completion of this work.</P>
    <P>I intend to put the designate board on a statutory basis as soon as possible, taking account of the views of the board in this regard. This will be done through commencing provisions of the Act, as necessary. A key factor here is that the board will have the necessary legal standing to appoint staff as the planning and preparatory work is advanced.</P>
    <P>The new education welfare service is a hugely significant development and is a key part of the Government's strategy for social inclusion. I am determined to ensure that the needs of our children are central to this development, particularly those who are disadvantaged or most at risk. We can no longer afford to be reactive in addressing the problems of school non-attendance and early school leaving. The decision to establish the new educational welfare service is fundamental to meeting the needs of those most marginalised. It will enable us to be proactive. It will also equip us to explore the causes of school dropout and make it possible not only to deal with it more effectively but to prevent it in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Having received this update on the current <Col N="1495" /> status of the National Education Welfare Board and how effective its work is becoming, I trust Senators will be satisfied that this matter is being dealt with as a matter of urgency. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on this debate even though it is an important one. Like some of my colleagues, I have been in all day on the abortion referendum legislation and I needed to do some other things. However, fortuitously, as often happens in political life I had a visit yesterday from an old friend who is the uncle of a young person who is in precisely this situation. I would like to ask the Minister about this. Given that I have come in immediately after he has spoken, he will not have an opportunity to reply but perhaps he would be kind enough to get one of his officials to drop me a note addressing this specific problem.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for using this occasion to raise this specific problem because it is indicative of the kind of difficulty that underlies the putting down of this motion. I realise the Minister said we can no longer afford to be reactive in this and he wants to address the issue quite generally. There are certain specific cases. He is concerned about the question of poor school attendance but this man is the uncle of a 12 or 13 year old child who has not been attending school for the last year or 18 months. He has quite severe asthma. His mother, who is the parent of another child, is a single mother and has had serious ill health for the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>The young person went to school until the onset of the mother's illness and there may be some psychological factor related to that. He is a highly intelligent young man who did well at school. About 18 months ago he started to sulk, hid, could not be found, refused to go to school, was awkward and difficult, ran away and no satisfactory explanation has been found. The mother is upset, as is the boy's uncle. They went to the local school attendance officer who is also the policeman involved. In my day that person used to be called the truant officer. This lad, who I am sure is a nice decent policeman, came in, talked to the kid and read him a poem about going to school and left it at that and there has been no follow-up whatever. They feel this attendance officer is useless, that there is nobody else to turn to and they have tried everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the mother is guilty of an offence by not ensuring the child is in school. What she was told was that because there is not abuse in the background they will not push it. In other words, if he was in a situation where she was a bad mother, or there was a drunken father or there was physical or sexual abuse the State would intervene. In this situation where this bright intelligent child has not been in school for the past year or 18 months, is receiving no tuition at home and the school attendance officer has been called <Col N="1496" /> in and thought it sufficient just to read a poem, what does the parent do?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, taking some notes because I would appreciate if an official in the Department could drop me a note. This was in a rural area in the sunny south east. Can anything be done? How can this kid whose mother wants him to go back to school be got back to school? His uncle has tried, the mother has tried, the school attendance officer has been invoked, but perhaps because he was too laid back and easy going nothing whatever happened. This is a real casualty. It is about a kid who is slipping through the net and even though the authorities have been alerted nothing is happening. I would like some assistance if possible because it is important.</P>
    <P>To return from the specific to the general, this is a situation where the most vulnerable elements in our society are involved. Many of the social problems we encounter come from young people who drop through the school system. This is an increasing phenomenon. Even from an economic point of view, it is a very wise investment to have a proper service instituted. I was glad to hear the positive information the Minister put on the record but it all very much in the future. To encourage the Government to live up to its obligations on this occasion I will vote with the Opposition. I also know that if you give a little nip to the hand that you anticipate feeding you, it might encourage them a little. I give a slight nip to the hand in the hope that I will get a helpful and practical answer to the questions I have posed, through the Chair, to the Minister this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. Initially when I read the motion tabled by Senator Ridge I thought she was seeking additional manpower to continue with the system as it existed. I was glad to hear that clarified because the 1926 regulations should long since have been removed. It is no longer acceptable that the Garda is chasing young children to find out whether they are attending school. It is similar to the Garda chasing a family for a dog licence.</P>
      <P>Tackling educational disadvantage has been one of the key priorities of the Government since coming to office. In times of plenty there is no greater virtue than to look after those most in need and, particularly, those in areas of disadvantage. When a country has sufficient wealth it should target those people. They are citizens of the nation and should be allowed participate in a meaningful way in whatever course they choose to take. We all agree that education is the key to tackling such disadvantage. The Government has invested heavily in targeting disadvantage, considering that in 1997, 1998 and 1999 alone the resources dedicated to education increased by 45%. While more needs to be done, that is a massive increase in any person's language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill which has been alluded to by all speakers is one of the most <Col N="1497" /> important Bills to come before the House in terms of targeting disadvantage. For many years research has told us that irregular school attendance leads to early drop out from school which, as we all know, leads to disadvantage. As Senator Ridge said, disadvantage leads to crime and crime leads to drugs and away they go from there. The targeting of disadvantaged areas is highly recommended.</P>
    <P>There is also inter-generational disadvantage of which we all have experience in our constituencies, mine probably more than most in that there are generations of disadvantaged people in the inner city areas. It is a worthwhile exercise to chase down and fight the causes of such disadvantage. Education is one of the key way in which to do that.</P>
    <P>Schools have tried in a meaningful way to deal with this problem but it is unfair to ask them to be the sole runners. They need the resources from people who understand the problems that result in children's non-attendance at school in the first place and they also need support to tackle the underlying problems as to why they would want to miss out on their schooling. All the State agencies, the health professionals, the paramedics, psychologists and others, in conjunction with teachers and parents, need to come together in a holistic way to tackle the problem. I think they are doing that. As we speak we see the benefits of it in some of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Education (Welfare) Bill is to provide supports. I was glad to hear the Minister address the matter of the development of local welfare officers and urge him to put these positions in place as quickly as possible. I am confident that he will commit to financing the educational welfare board to the tune of £4 million in the first three years of its existence because if we do have a board, it will need resources.</P>
    <P>Parents also have a key role to play. This cannot be ignored. The education welfare Bill assisted school principals in maintaining a register of students. We will now have increased numbers of education officers who can be notified when there is a problem and provide support for students with difficulties. There should also be liaison with other schools on best practice. All these are elements of preparing and implementing a school attendance strategy to encourage regular attendance. When in place we will have a system which will put us on the right road. I am happy that the Minister expects we will have that system up and running sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The idea that we have in place a comprehensive national system to ensure children of compulsory school-going age attend school and that if they do not, they receive a basic assessable minimum level of education is welcome. The greatest blot on the copybook of all Governments is the fact that it took us so long to introduce proper psychological assessments. I do not know how teachers and parents managed in the past <Col N="1498" /> without proper assessments of children or how they could have prepared any kind of meaningful learning programme for the children who needed them.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any valid or acceptable excuse for any child leaving the education system illiterate or innumerate. The OECD report, published last week, showing that we are top of the list when it comes to literacy, was welcome in that respect. There is no valid excuse for the fact that 3,000 pupils drop out of school before the junior certificate or that 8,000 drop out before the leaving certificate. The system we have now put in place will, I hope, support and assist in this matter. I hope also the Government, education authorities, parents and anyone else involved will participate in a meaningful way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on the motion. I am in somewhat of a dilemma between the motion and the amendment as I do not fully agree with either. While I accept the comments made by Senator Ridge and support the arguments she made, depending on the 1926 Act is like looking to the past.</P>
      <P>Where I disagree with the motion is that I do not wish to see the 1926 Act extended. For many years we have tried to have it changed. Since about 1930 the INTO has tried to have it amended. In 1942 the Government finally agreed and a new school attendance Bill was published. It was challenged and referred to the Supreme Court on the basis that it fulfilled the constitutional requirement to ensure a certain minimum standard of education was achieved. There is a constitutional imperative to ensure a minimum standard is achieved at primary level. There was an attempt made to define what was meant by a minimum standard. In 1942 the great Catholic right wing of the time decided to test the legislation in court where it was found to be an interference with the rights of the family and the rights of parents to decide what the minimum level was. The legislation was never enacted and we have struggled on with the 1926 Act ever since.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act is a huge improvement in its vision, but we have yet to see it in action. It is correct in its vision. I agree that it was inappropriate and wrong for gardaí in uniform to act as school attendance officers. I agree with Senator Ridge that it is far better to have school attendance officers who have done an extraordinary job for which they deserve recognition. They received little support during the years, but have developed their job professionally and taken a proactive interest in school attendance. They have served us well and will now move on to a new role. Gardaí never wanted the role of school attendance officer and always felt it was inappropriate that they should go to schools with the symbols and semblance of authority to talk about a six or seven year old child who was not attending school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" />The Act places a significant additional burden on principals and classroom teachers. It requires every school principal to keep a separate account of attendance. It does not simply count the roll, but requires the principal to keep an account for each individual child which can be looked at in case of difficulty. The school is also expected to adopt a proactive school attendance policy. We agree that these are fine provisions but on behalf of principals and class teachers this additional work should be paid for. This is chain management where additional work is required. It is a positive policy that is moving forward and developing from a need, but we must ensure it is paid for.</P>
    <P>In the recent benchmarking review the benchmarking body stated that in the claim I articulated on behalf of the INTO I was seeking a 92% increase for certain school principals &ndash; the highest claim received by the body on behalf of any group of workers in the public service. Primary school principals have shown a need to be rewarded in this way. The amount is not as big as it sounds because it is 92% of a small figure.</P>
    <P>Moving on from this, there is a need to recognise that in disadvantaged areas school attendance can depend on many things. As a rule of thumb, if a child is consistently late for school, we can be almost sure that it is the fault of the parents. It is rarely the child's fault. That is not to say that we must blame the parents, but there is probably a significant problem in the home. Perhaps the children are not awakened or sent to school on time, or they have not slept because the television has been on all night or they have not had breakfast and are tired and hungry. One of the points teachers have made on a number of occasions is that there are certain areas where it would be useful to provide a meal in school for children and that this would ensure school is more attractive. This is done all over the world.</P>
    <P>Another facility is what is called a &ldquo;calm room,&rdquo; effectively a room where a child can, if necessary, sleep where he or she has got no sleep at home. A child who is tired cannot learn, a child who is hungry will not learn and a child who is both tired and hungry will certainly not learn. This is an issue that has been brought to our attention by teachers time and again.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the importance of the psychological service. I want to make two simple points on this issue which any lay person would grasp. The psychological service is crucial. It is fundamental to identifying problems and moving forward. Credit is due to the Minister and his predecessor for starting and moving the process forward. While there has been significant improvement, it is not hitting all bases. One of the main problems is that the psychologists assigned to schools are carrying out a major round of testing and identifying the problems children are experiencing. That is important work, but because they are spending all their time <Col N="1500" /> and there are not enough of them doing it, they do not have time to become involved in programmes to help the children concerned deal with their problems, whether they arise from a learning, emotional or other difficulty.</P>
    <P>A pilot programme, whereby teachers do most of the testing, was introduced recently in the Monaghan area. Teachers can carry out a certain number of tests. While they are not psychologists, they have studied psychology and can carry out a certain amount of educational psychological testing and thereby take a certain level of work from visiting psychologists. Visiting psychologists can pick up the slack and determine what it is that a child needs.</P>
    <P>Having decided what a child needs, he or she should get it. However, what the Department is doing is disgraceful. It calls in an inspector to approve the meeting of the needs of a child identified by the psychologist. That amounts to time wasting for the child who needs support, it defers dealing with the issue and is a crude method of controlling finances. The authority should be dealt with at school level. If a psychologist identifies what a child needs, that is what the child should get &ndash; end of story.</P>
    <P>A psychologist is assigned to a number of schools. He or she should be available to interact on a regular basis with the principal, school staff and parents in order to ensure the child concerned is making progress.</P>
    <P>School is an attractive place for children. It is the place where they can find comfort, be relaxed, will not be hungry or tired and where their difficulties will be identified, problems assessed, needs articulated and a programme established and put in place for them. That is what teachers, principals and parents want and what pupils need, but there are too many gaps. The waiting list for psychological assessment is unreal in certain parts of the country. The practice of waiting for the inspector to approve additional resources is unfair, unrealistic and takes too long. The level of resources being made available is not adequate. That is the downside.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge has raised an issue of significant importance at the core of the learning process. It is an issue of concern for schools in many parts of the country, not just in the Dublin area. These problems can be found in many areas of the country. While generally found in urban areas, significant problems have been found in rural areas, often in remote areas where children can get lost in the system. That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ridge for tabling the motion on which I am delighted to have been able to speak. I hope the Minister, while indicating he will not accept it, will take on board the sensible points made by the Senator to ensure the problems she identified will be resolved through the provision of additional resources in the areas required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the good advice and positive response of my colleagues and the Mini<Col N="1501" /> ster's courtesy and helpful approach in this matter. My colleague, Senator O'Toole, and another speaker identified that the key issue in this area is that of time. Young lives go by very fast. If one loses a child at the age of seven years in the system and cannot reclaim him or her until the age of 13 or 14 years, there is not much value in it. I emphasise that the school population is very high in the urban areas about which I spoke. There are many children at risk who are not attending school and nobody has taken up the slack that <Col N="1502" /> arises from parents not knowing or caring where their children are. We owe it to the young people concerned to give them some chance. It will be only a slight chance, but it is better than not giving them anything. I will press the motion purely on the grounds of the need to address the matter speedily.</P>
      <P>I sincerely welcome the Minister's proposals for the new educational welfare board and thank my colleagues for their contributions.</P>

      <P>We were responding to the Minister's statement that approved places would be maternity hospitals. There are dangers in that because of the distances affecting people in rural areas. I gave the examples of the distances between Loop Head and Limerick and Galway, and spoke of the danger to the life of a woman who was haemorrhaging heavily. Senator Henry clearly explained these dangers earlier when she conveyed the results of the Coombe Hospital survey.</P>
      <P>The other danger is that a GP in a remote rural area must balance taking the actions that he deems necessary against what is in the Bill. If a GP were to perform a necessary medical procedure outside of an approved place, he or she might be open to an action. In such a case, he or she might decide to take the risk of transporting the woman to hospital and she might lose her life as a result. I welcome the Minister's commitment to re-examine this matter overnight and come back with a different proposal tomorrow. I urge him to do so and hope that he takes our concerns seriously.</P>

I regret that this Bill is being denigrated &ndash; but I do not blame the Minister &ndash; by pausing at 9 p.m. to introduce another Bill, albeit an important one. This Bill was guillotined on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil, which the Minister, I am sure, did not want. However, we are again showing disrespect by interrupting it. After all, this Bill involves the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution and women's lives.

    <P>In page 8, lines 15 and 16 to delete &ldquo;other than by self-destruction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Much of the argument on this was made by myself and colleagues on Second Stage and I do not propose to reiterate it. This the crux of the Bill as the intention is to reverse the judgment in the X case, and the people's decision in the 1992 referendum. By excluding the risk of self-destruction, we place the Bill in a dangerous area.</P>
    <P>It is true that the statistical risk of suicide may be slight, but can we afford to take the risk? Of those who threaten suicide, eight out of ten may not do it but two probably will. That is a loss of human life which I am not prepared to risk. I have been involved with a number of counselling agencies and they say that when a person threatens suicide, there is a strong possibility that he or she will not do so, but one must always assume that the person will, otherwise the risk is too high. Yet we are prepared to take this risk with the lives of women, which is completely and utterly wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris is correct in saying that this is the crux of the Bill. It is an attempt to reverse the X case judgment which established the legitimacy of the termination of pregnancy where the mother's life is in danger because she threatens suicide.</P>
      <P>It is right to say that this is extraordinarily rare. Dr. John Sheehan, in his address to the all-party committee, said that there are grave difficulties in predicting suicide. The Minister is familiar with Appleby's work which I discussed with Dr. Dermot Walsh, the inspector of mental hospitals. The problem with his work was that it was an attempt to correlate groups of statistics from places as diverse as Finland and the South Sea Islands. They were all retrospective studies. Appleby pointed out that there were cases in which women committed suicide because they were pregnant. He also said that the protective effect of pregnancy &ndash; which is real &ndash; does not come into play if the reason for the pregnancy lies in rape or incest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider our figures for infanticide in the past, we have to conclude that this was a way of getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy in place of a termination. Sometimes even now, the bodies of babies are found around the country. Often their mothers are never discovered. I was once asked by a Swedish television company about such a body found beside a canal. I told them that it was an unusual case, but within a few days another was found beside the Shannon and a third in the Phoenix Park. The Swedes rightly asked me what I meant by an unusual case. When we consider the number of adults who are missing, we must wonder about the bodies of new-born children that have never been discovered. In <Col N="1506" /> the rural areas of some countries, infanticide was not as uncommon as we would prefer to think.</P>
    <P>The preventative effect of pregnancy on suicide is important but we must take into account the circumstances under which the person becomes pregnant and her age. Since the X case, the C case has been the only other one where suicide was threatened. As I said on Second Stage, I was much more worried about her than I was about the X case. The X case girl had supportive parents but in the case of the child who had been very violently raped and beaten up there seemed to be grave family circumstances. It seemed to be a disordered family with problems and the man who had raped her was a relation. I feared for that child's life. She was 13 years old. She seemed to be very alone and in the care of the health board. The case went before many courts.</P>
    <P>None of us wants to see these cases. I hope they will be rare. I remember the case in Granard where a child of a similar age, Ann Lovett, went to term but died giving birth in a grotto at the feet of the Blessed Virgin. To see a mother and child lost in that situation must remind us that these circumstances may occur.</P>
    <P>I referred to another type of case in the debate on Second Stage. A woman with very bad post-natal depression told me that if she became pregnant again she would kill herself. Termination of pregnancy is not to be advocated as a cure for post-natal depression but this woman said to me that she would kill herself if she became pregnant again. Bad cases turn up every now and then.</P>
    <P>Since the X and the C cases I have not once heard of any doctor in this country trying to procure a socio-economic abortion or an abortion where the risk of suicide was cited as a defence. This legislation seems to show a lack of trust in the medical profession and I certainly will be supporting Senator Norris's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the issue of suicide is one of the core issues of this legislation. The court judgment in the X case and the subsequent C case is the reason we are dealing with this amendment. I refer to the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the evidence about suicide in pregnancy which was given by the psychiatric profession and the masters of the maternity hospitals. The rate of suicide among pregnant women is far lower than in the general population of women. This has been referred to by Senator Henry as the protective effect of pregnancy. One can logically see why that would be.</P>
      <P>We are not talking here about a pregnancy which is wanted or planned or even accidental. We are talking about pregnancies which give rise to major trauma. We have the instances of the X case and the C case where teenagers became pregnant as a result of rape, one of which was particularly horrific and has been outlined by Senator Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see how a woman and particularly a child or a teenager who has been raped, beaten, traumatised and dealt with in an awful fashion <Col N="1507" /> would greet a consequent pregnancy. I read this morning in the <i>Irish Independent </i>of a case in England where a raped 19 year old became pregnant. She went into complete denial and did not tell anyone about the pregnancy. She delivered the baby alone in her bedroom and then threw the baby out the window. It landed in the neighbour's garden where it was found two days later. The teenager is in extreme trauma. This happened in a country with abortion quite easily available.</P>
    <P>A pregnancy arising out of a traumatic incident such as rape has to be seen in an entirely different context. Experts cannot totally rule out the possibility of suicide, particularly in the instance of trauma or rape. We have a dreadfully high rate of suicide in Ireland. We should not lessen the seriousness of suicide or potential suicide.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that a pregnant woman who claims to be suicidal during a crisis pregnancy should not be believed because she is saying this in order to get an abortion. That is an extraordinarily dangerous suggestion. We should never do so. I hear it sneaking into discussions from time to time.</P>
    <P>It has been said that hard cases make bad law but we have had two hard cases which have informed our law in recent years. These are cases which were foreseen when the 1983 referendum was held. They were nightmares which we hoped would never be visited upon us but they were. We have no reason to believe they will not be again. We have written the right to travel and the right to information in the Constitution. The right to travel is extremely important and arises directly out of the abhorrence of the public at the notion that a child would be forced to continue a pregnancy against her will. Most citizens would not force any woman to continue a pregnancy against her will.</P>
    <P>Let us envisage the situation of a woman who has been raped and beaten to such an extent that she cannot travel but is suicidal. You are then looking at a situation where she is presumably under psychiatric care if she is threatening suicide and she needs medical treatment for physical injuries. If she cannot travel then that woman would be forced to continue the pregnancy. That is a distinct possibility. It cannot be ruled out. This kind of law that we have made in the past has created quite extraordinary dilemmas for us as legislators, for medical practitioners and ultimately for the women affected.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely opposed to excluding the threat of suicide. We all acknowledge the points that have been made about the preventative or protective effect of pregnancy. The risk of suicide by a pregnant woman would be extremely small. I hate hearing that hard cases make bad law. When somebody is in such an appalling condition that she would threaten suicide, that is a very hard case. One of the most fundamental things anybody who has ever had train<Col N="1508" /> ing as a counsellor is told is never to ignore the threat of suicide. Although it is a long time since I trained as a counsellor, this has always stayed with me.</P>
      <P>I think the people are just as compassionate now as they were at the time of the X case. Nothing has changed. During the time of the X case I stood on the other side of the House and said that if my 14 year old daughter were pregnant as a result of rape and suicidal, I did not know what I would do. I am not in favour of abortion as pro-choice people are said to be. I would much prefer that women would be given every support in bringing their pregnancy to fruition, but I could not say to my daughter that I would take the risk with her life. That would be reprehensible.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years nothing has changed. There was a notion that the floodgates would open and there would be queues of women at psychiatrists' doors pretending to be suicidal because they did not want a baby. Even though women could have done that for the past nine years, it has not happened. Women would not take human life in that way. In my experience as chair of the Well Woman Clinic, which gives non-directive counselling, women agonise over the decision. I have not heard of any women who take this decision lightly.</P>
      <P>A particularly unfortunate phrase was used by the Taoiseach in answering Deputy Noonan's question when he said:</P>
      <P>The legislative vacuum must be filled and if legal provision were made for a suicide risk, a system of psychiatric assessment and court supervision would almost inevitably follow. If that were to happen, even if it were initially to be done on a narrow basis, the scene would be set for a gradual introduction of social abortion in Ireland.</P>
      <P>What is the basis for that? There is no evidence to suggest it. Despite the disgraceful fact that we have not legislated on foot of the X case, our organisation, in acknowledging it is very difficult, put forward a suggestion that could be developed. However, the Taoiseach's response shows complete lack of trust in women and lack of compassion for their predicament. Thank God there are a few women in the Oireachtas who have spoken very vehemently on this. It is wrong that there are so few women involved in formulating our laws. We could disagree on the principle of things, but there are issues that relate to life and death that women understand better because their lives are on the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are we rowing back on the X case when the compassion has already been shown by the people? I do not anticipate there will be large numbers of cases like that and I sincerely hope there would not be. To make a giant leap from discussing a pregnancy caused by rape to saying there will be a queue of women waiting to have an abortion goes beyond credibility. I do not <Col N="1509" /> accept it. If the referendum comes about, the people will not accept it either.</P>

      <P>The law in Ireland is fairly straightforward. It is covered by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and by article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, which was passed in 1983 following a heated debate in both Houses and outside. It was one of the most controversial times in modern politics. This guarantees the unborn a right to life equal to that of the pregnant woman.</P>
      <P>Following the referendum in 1992, which came about as a result of the X case, if due to physical, psychological or mental conditions there is a real and substantial threat to the woman's life if she continues the pregnancy, then she is protected under the Constitution. In effect, the Government is attempting to withdraw the psychological, the suicide element. That is extremely serious. The people voted on this matter a decade ago and made a very clear decision. The Government has not taken that on board and successive Governments have failed to introduce legislation. The people are now being asked to decide again and withdraw constitutional rights that currently exist for women. It is a seriously regressive step.</P>
      <P>Following the X case in 1992, the law protects the life of a woman who may be in danger of losing her life as a result of suicide. How many cases have arisen? How many cases are documented by the Department of Health and Children? Women are not by nature interested in playing games with something so fundamental. Women do not go around pretending to be suicidal nor do psychiatrists fake certificates claiming them to be so. To bring in legislation is effectively saying that women abuse this facility. There is no recorded evidence of such a trend in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Why does the Government feel the need to restrict further the rights of women as they currently exist in the Constitution? It is an extraordinarily regressive step. It is particularly extraordinary that the Progressive Democrats and a Progressive Democrats Attorney General are the main architects of this legislation, given the platforms on which they pontificated since 1987. It has already been put on the record what the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said at various times during the debate in recent years. It shows their total hypocrisy and it is an appallingly cynical political manoeuvre in relation to women's lives. It is unfortunate they have gone down that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better to delete the phrase at the end of section 1(2) as it does not serve any purpose. It is an insult to women and to the psychiatric profession. It is saying that medical practitioners with physiological expertise are more credible than those with a psychiatric or psychological qualification. No one in the House, the other House, or the Department is in a position to adjudicate on that matter or to introduce legis<Col N="1510" /> lation to so adjudicate. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the other speakers. Does the Minister consider it to be discriminatory to provide that a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother as a result of mental illness is not as important as her physical health?</P>
      <P>We would have liked legislation introduced after the X and C cases. Senators Taylor-Quinn and Keogh referred to that. The people would be equally horrified if 14 or 15 year old children were faced with this type of situation as a result of rape or incest. The Minister is ruling out any situation where that problem could arise. There were ways open to the Minister to tighten up the legislation if he had wanted to do so. He could have included a provision to get a second and third opinion from psychiatrists and he could have established a panel of psychiatrists to deal with the threat of suicide. That would be detailed and controlled procedure. Why were those options not considered? I thought that would have been the first thing the Minister would have done. The X and C cases were treated as if they did not happen or as if they should be forgotten. I hope such cases do not happen again.</P>
      <P>We do not know if issues of suicide were brought to the Minister's attention. As women, we are concerned about that issue. The Mental Health Bill was introduced and there was much talk about bringing mental health into the 21st century. We are ignoring the fact that people can suffer from mental illness and be suicidal. We are talking about young girls who may be in this situation as a result of rape or incest, which are both horrific acts. This may happen to them at a time when their hormones are not properly developed. That child will be left in limbo. We will be hypocritical and tell the parents to let her go to another jurisdiction. It is all right in another jurisdiction. We are not interested in what happens year after year in rape cases before the courts. I am flabbergasted.</P>
      <P>The legislation could have been tightened up. We are not talking about idle threats. The Minister could have included controls, such as a panel of psychiatrists to assess the risk of suicide and make a decision. They have been written out of the legislation. As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, they are in a different category to the physicians who look after the physical health of the mother. I am shocked that something has not been done.</P>

      <P>This issue deserves to be considered with compassion and consideration. The amendments go to the core of the Bill in terms of wanting to remove suicide or self-destruction as a basis for the termination of a pregnancy or an illegal abortion within the country. The Government has taken a view, notwithstanding the X and C cases and having considered the process which led to the Green Paper and the evidence from the Oireachtas committee dealing with this issue, that the evidence did not lend itself to a view that suic<Col N="1511" /> ide should continue as a basis for facilitating the termination of a pregnancy.</P>
      <P>It is instructive to reflect on why the Oireachtas did not legislate for the X case. People here have put forward a view that it is only a matter of doing A, B, C or D.</P>

      <P>An attempt was not made by the Oireachtas or by successive Governments since 1992 to legislate for the X case. We should ask why that was the case. Was it because it was politically impossible to get such legislation through the Houses?

      <P>The eminent psychiatrists at the Oireachtas committee said on the record that there was no fail safe test for suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that we are second guessing psychiatrists or questioning their judgment is erroneous. That is not the motivation behind it. There is a difference between the diagnosis of physical and medical issues, as psychiatry and psychiatrists have acknowledged. I acknowledge we can cite different texts as different people made different submissions. In the report Dr. Anthony Clare said:</P>
      <P>I would say that the only reason that I am here, I think, and that you will find psychiatrists involved in this, is, in a way, because, I suppose we have been drawn in to try and get people off the hook over this issue of a danger to the health and life of a woman who is pregnant and wishes to terminate the pregnancy, so who better than to get the psychiatrist to tell you that if this is refused, this woman will kill herself. Well, no such statement can be made with any great safety, whether the person making it is a psychologist, psychiatrist or a general practitioner.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Sheehan, consultant in perinatal psychiatry at the Rotunda Hospital, said that suicide is what he and his colleagues call &ldquo;multi-factorial&rdquo;. It is not related to a single factor, but to multiple factors, including the presence of psychiatric illness. It can be related to depression, psychosis or alcohol problems coupled to with absence of social supports, socio-economic class or marital status. There is no test or fail-safe way to indicate if a person will or will not commit suicide. Dr. Sheehan also indicated that the medical response to a pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide is to help and support her while treating her underlying mental condition. Professor John Bonnar, chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution that prior to the introduction of the UK's abortion Act, risk of suicide was grounds for termination and that large numbers of patients used to have terminations on psychiatric grounds linked to risk of suicide. Those cases suddenly disappeared when the abortion Act came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" />The problem with risk of suicide and psychiatric indications is that they are clearly different from the physical problems we have been discussing, such as pre-eclampsia, ectopic pregnancy and cancer of the cervix. In practice the psychiatric indications become exceedingly elastic. Legislation to control that has usually been unsuccessful and has been used to achieve abortion. Those are the kinds of submissions that were made and there were others. The Master of the Rotunda, Dr. Peter McKenna, took the different view that one cannot ever rule out the possibility of suicide. Dr. Sean Daly, Master of the Coombe, said he had never come across a case where a risk of suicide was posed. The Psychological Society of Ireland, which is in favour of freedom of information, argued that one can identify a risk of suicide, but psychiatrists say there is no test to do so. A key point is that it is very unlikely a psychiatrist would recommend abortion as a treatment for a suicidal woman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they are saying. I have read it in the Official Report and in work which has come out subsequent to the publishing of this Bill. People have said they are unaware of a psychiatrist recommending a termination as a treatment for suicide. This is by no means an attempt to second guess psychiatry. From the mouths of psychiatrists themselves comes the clear message that there is no fail-safe test to prove a risk of suicide. In other jurisdictions psychiatry has been used for making a more liberal abortion regime a reality. People may throw their eyes up to heaven, but that is a reality.</P>
      <P>Many submissions were made in the drafting of the Green Paper, which came out before the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution considered this matter. While there are a number of clinical and social factors associated with suicide, it has proved difficult to predict which women will commit suicide. A thorough assessment of the clinical, social and mental health status of the woman is made before initiating the appropriate therapy. Underlying mental conditions are treated and an attempt is made to resolve any social problems associated with the pregnancy. It is considered important that major life decisions are not made while suffering from acute psychiatric illness.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that this is a difficult issue and I am not saying there are not many perspectives that can be brought to bear on it. The argument has been made that if there were more women in the Houses there would be a different perspective on the legislation. My experience is that in wider society many women have strong pro-life perspectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. I will be more specific. There are as many women out there who would agree with this approach as there are who would <Col N="1514" /> disagree with it. Perspectives on this issue are not bound to gender alone. There is no gender divide whereby women are of one view and men of another. There is a range of views among men to the same extent as there is among women. I have met women who have completely different views from Senators Keogh, Jackman and Taylor-Quinn. We have to be open enough to acknowledge that is the nature of the issue and of this debate on it. If we look at the 105,000 submissions that were made, we will find quite a lot of views, therefore it is not fair to say that one gender takes one view and the other a different one.</P>
      <P>We are not lessening the importance of the issue of suicide. We have done much recently &ndash; compared to what was done previously &ndash; to provide additional support and improve resources for mental health patients, particularly those at risk of suicide. We have established the Suicide Research Foundation, implemented many of the recommendations of the task force on suicide and created multi-disciplinary, consulant-led teams for child and adolescent psychiatry in every health board. There has been much progress over the past four years on the wider issue of suicide which points to the multi-factorial nature of its causes and to the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister addressed a couple of questions to the House. He asked why Government did not legislate on this matter after the X case. It should have and it was told that by the Supreme Court. The Oireachtas has been reproached by the Judiciary for not legislating and the reason it did not was that there was complete moral cowardice in all parties. They shied away from this issue. The proposed referendum is another cynical manoeuvre caused by four independent Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the Minister's question. The cynical manoeuvre is the context of this Bill. The Minister referred to psychiatrists and said there was a difference of opinion and that people refused to be hard and fast in their pronouncements. That demonstrates how very honest the psychiatrists are and should give us confidence in them. Are we expected to believe that people who are prepared to give evidence with such clarity and without being self serving will dishonour their professional standards by signing chits at the drop of a hat? There is a contempt for the psychiatric profession in that attitude, though it may not be intended or realised. We must be prepared to trust psychiatrists. Everything the Minister has said about the evidence <Col N="1515" /> they gave revealed how complex the issue is. I agree.</P>
      <P>Not many young women are going to commit suicide simply because they are pregnant. We heard evidence from Senator Henry that the woman's instinct for survival is increased by pregnancy as there is a natural maternal wish to protect the infant in the womb. We are talking about cases the Government has failed to address in this legislation, such as rape and incest and in which there is obviously confusion in the mind of the young person involved. In such cases a young person who has been brutally assaulted is sentenced by our uncaring society to an involuntary nine months of penal servitude, during which she is host to an invading organism. This is so complex that I believe a young person would take the awful step of taking her own life.</P>
      <P>The Minister introduced evidence from various people, including Professor Bonnar. The Minister should have put on record that he is by no means a disinterested party in this.</P>

      <P>I will not prolong the argument much longer. We all agree with much that the Minister said. We have accepted that the threat of suicide is minimal. We have acknowledged that there has not been a queue of women claiming to be suicidal and demanding abortions, even though it was legal to do so for the past nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would the Minister do if it was his 13 or 14 year old daughter who had been raped and <Col N="1516" /> traumatised? Who can be absolute about this? I cannot put my hand on my heart and say I would put her on a flight to England and ensure she had an abortion. If she were that traumatised and I was genuinely convinced she was suicidal, I probably would because I would do what was best for her. I believe the Minister in his heart of hearts would too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Sheehan, with whom I work, was correct in describing suicide as a combination of many factors. Abortion is not described as a good treatment for psychiatric disease. Psychiatrists must be the advocates of their patients. Many psychotropic drugs are contra-indicative during pregnancy. Someone with a serious psychiatric illness who is pregnant because of rape or incest which may be the basis of her illness may have to have her psychotropic drugs on which she is dependent withdrawn because of their effect on the developing foetus. It is a very difficult problem and I am glad it is the Minister's, not mine. We must point out these various difficulties to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have preferred that something be done about this in 1992 by the then Government. I do not blame the current Government. It is just that the position has been left unaltered since that time.</P>
      <P>I can understand, if there had not been the X and C cases, why psychiatrists would have come to the conclusion the Minister said they did when he was in discussions with them. However, those were cases where young teenagers were obviously suicidal and the X case precipitated a referendum. The Minister ruled out the psychiatric element as if psychiatrists had not discussed the X case and the fact that legislation had not been introduced to deal with it. I am sure they must have had an opinion on the X and C cases. The Minister gave the impression they were not discussed in the detail I would have liked them to have been.</P>
      <P>In the context of placing the risk to the life of a mother because of suicidal tendencies brought on by mental illness or whatever alongside the physical risk to her life, I am surprised that psychiatrists did not examine the X and C cases in the discussions because they were concrete examples of where the trauma of incest and rape caused young women to become suicidal. This was especially the case for the young girl in the C case on whose behalf the health boards had to intervene to sort out her position. She was left traumatised by the brutal treatment meted out to her and she had no support. The girl in the X case had the support of caring parents. The Minister gave the impression that the suicide issue was examined but was dismissed and that the reality of the X and C cases did not appear to have been explored, which upsets me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister, with the help of psychiatrists, could have legislated for specifics such as where it is proved a woman is suicidal because <Col N="1517" /> of rape or incest. That is ruled out now. What happens if there is another X or C case? Do we forget about that 13 or 14 year old if it happens again? Is the Minister saying it does not matter if she feels suicidal because she can go to England for an abortion? I cannot accept the hypocrisy of that stance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated these issues, they have been debated in the other House and they have been debated at great length since 1992 in the Green Paper process and by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which took considerable evidence from psychiatrists and obstetricians organisations and so on. The Government's view and position is that the evidence given did not lend to the maintenance of suicide within the legislation as a basis for abortion. That is the considered view of the Government having examined all the submissions made and having assessed the evidence submitted to the all-party committee. I have dealt with the difficulty in respect of psychiatry articulated by psychiatrists in terms of there being no fail-safe test for the suicide issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what his views on the issue are. He was saying honestly as a psychiatrist that, if we were looking to psychiatrists to try to get us off the hook, there was no fail-safe test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very honest of Professor Clare to say there is no fail-safe, black and white test. However, there is a difference in the medical profession between the treatment of physical illness and mental illness. I doubt very much that any of those psychiatrists who gave evidence disagreed with the X case judgment. I would like <Col N="1518" /> that to be put on the record because the Minister may have given the impression, although I am sure he did not want to, that Professor Clare was washing his hands&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister did not mean to do so and that is why I am doing him the courtesy of making that clear. I do not believe there was evidence that psychiatrists felt they should be excluded from the process and that they were incapable in certain cases of giving a judgment. They cannot say infallibly that a young person will commit suicide, but they cannot say in most cases that she will not. They can, however, give a balanced, professional judgment and say, &ldquo;On balance, we believe that this young person will take her own life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While scant respect is paid to the way in which the Supreme Court approached the situation, it examined the evidence quite forensically. Learned judges &ndash; the top legal brains in the country &ndash; were prepared to accept, in all seriousness, that a particular, specific young woman would in all probability take her own life. The psychiatrists gave clear, concrete evidence that that was their professional judgment. The Supreme Court agreed that, from a legal point of view and having examined and dissected the evidence, this was the case. For that reason it took the serious step of entering the judgment in the X case. The most expert people in the State, both in the psychiatric and legal fields, came to that conclusion, yet we are now saying, &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  If only one life was saved, it would be worthwhile.</P>

    <P>I feel strongly about this amendment and, in a <Col N="1521" /> sense, the Minister made my case when he spoke of the highly responsible evidence given by psychiatrists to the committee.

It seems to me that one must accept that the psychiatric profession is an honourable branch of the medical profession whose opinion is worthy of being listened to and that it is unwise and dangerous to discriminate against one branch of the medical profession.</P>

However, they may not do so if that advice comes from psychiatrists. That seems to be totally wrong. I intend to press this amendment to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be back in this House again, this time to propose important legislation, the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001. It might be of use to Senators if I were to give some background to <Col N="1522" /> the proposals in the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the State to ratify two European Union conventions on extradition, the 1995 convention on simplified extradition procedures between member states of the European Union and the 1996 convention on extradition between member states of the European Union. The Bill before the House will enable Ireland to ratify these conventions and it is our intention to do so at an early date after the Bill is enacted. The Bill also proposes some substantive and procedural changes to our general extradition law.</P>
      <P>It is universally recognised among civilised states that offenders should not be permitted to escape justice by fleeing from the state where they have committed offences to another jurisdiction. The extraordinary improvements in communications and transport have facilitated greater cross-frontier movement generally. However, the downside of this ease of travel is that it facilitates the movement of offenders who often cross not one but several borders to escape justice. Accordingly, the provision of efficient and effective extradition arrangements is now more necessary than ever.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House will facilitate more effective co-operation in combating crime and it forms part of a package of measures to ensure a coherent and effective international response to the threat of terrorism in the aftermath of the appalling attacks on the United States on 11 September. It will expedite the bringing to justice of suspected criminals who seek to avoid prosecution by leaving the jurisdiction where the crime has been committed. There have been a number of initiatives at European Union level to combat the threat of terrorism and the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 20 September 2001 urged member states to take all the necessary steps to bring the two conventions on extradition into force by 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>In addition, that JHA Council and the European Council on the following day approved the commencement of negotiations among member states on a framework decision for a European arrest warrant and intensive negotiations have been taking place on this proposal for the past two and a half months. Indeed, there is a motion before the Seanad today concerning the European arrest warrant. Consequently, there is no need for me to deal with the impact of that in this speech except to say that when it is adopted and the necessary legislative measures are put in place in the member states &ndash; the proposed timescale is 1 January 2004 &ndash; it will replace both the 1995 and 1996 conventions to which we are giving effect today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the threat posed by terrorism to the lives of people, the economic and social stability of countries and even the rule of law and democracy itself, the proposals in the Bill to simplify extradition arrangements between member states of the European Union are apposite. The realities of the modern world make it imperative <Col N="1523" /> that we examine ways of improving co-operation in combating crime and to ensure that fugitives cannot escape justice by fleeing to another country.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the actual provisions of the Bill, I will outline our existing extradition provisions. It is important to place extradition in its historical context. Our primary legislation is the Extradition Act, 1965, which provides for both the simplified arrangements Ireland operates with Britain and Northern Ireland, Part III, and our extradition arrangements with other countries, Part II. Part II is modelled on the multilateral Council of Europe Convention on Extradition which was opened for signature in 1957, to which Ireland is a party. It provides the basis for extradition between this country and most of the other Council of Europe member states. It also governs our extradition arrangements with certain other countries, such as the United States of America and Australia, with whom we have extradition agreements. In addition, Ireland is a party to a number of international conventions which provide special extradition arrangements in relation to specific offences, for example, in the aviation field.</P>
    <P>The Extradition Act, 1965, has been amended on a number of occasions, twice in 1987 and once in 1994. The 1965 Act was the first occasion on which legislation dealing with extradition was passed by the Oireachtas. Prior to that the relevant extradition provisions were provided for in pre-1922 statutes, mainly the Extradition Act, 1870.</P>
    <P>With regard to extradition and terrorism the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was drawn up in the light of the prevalence of terrorist attacks and the practice of their perpetrators to flee the country in which they had carried out the attack. The underlying principle of the terrorism convention was that perpetrators of acts of terrorism should not be immune from extradition by pleading that the act they had committed was a political offence. In domestic law the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, gave effect to the terrorism convention. It restricts the circumstances in which a person can avoid extradition on the grounds that the offence in question is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>There was also a second Extradition Act in 1987 called the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987. It mainly dealt with issues relating to extradition to Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Finally, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, amended, clarified and extended the range of offences which could not be regarded as political for extradition purposes. Although our law has been updated several times, it is an area that needs re-examination again in the light of prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today will build on the earlier extradition Acts and will considerably <Col N="1524" /> streamline and improve the efficiency of our law on extradition. By way of introduction to the Bill, I will briefly touch on the two conventions to which it will give effect.</P>
    <P>The 1995 convention on simplified extradition procedures between the member states of the European Union provides for a simplified procedure where the person sought consents to his or her surrender, such consent to be given before the High Court which must be satisfied that the consent is given voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. Once consent is given and where the person claimed is a citizen of Ireland, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agrees the person will be extradited.</P>
    <P>A person who has consented to his or her surrender may also renounce his or her right to the specialty rule, the rule whereby a person extradited for one offence may not be tried for other offences committed before his or her extradition, such renunciation to be recorded before the High Court. The consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also required.</P>
    <P>While the 1995 convention also provides that consent to surrender or renunciation of the rule of specialty may not be revoked, it allows parties to opt out of this requirement by making a declaration to that effect on ratification. It is proposed that Ireland will make a declaration allowing persons to revoke their consent or renunciation, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The 1996 convention relating to extradition between the member states of the European Union, as well as extending the range of extraditable offences, also provides for the further improvement and simplification of procedures in a number of respects. Extradition requests, documents and correspondence may be sent by facsimile transmission provided the facsimile machine is fitted with a cryptographic device to ensure authenticity and confidentiality. Changes are also proposed in relation to the authentication and certification of documents. The convention also requires all states to designate a central authority to be responsible for transmitting and receiving extradition requests and supporting documentation, and it is proposed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be the central authority for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives effect to a number of changes in our general extradition law. All extradition proceedings will in future be held in the High Court. Evidence may be given by a witness outside the State through a television link or by affidavit in any extradition proceedings. The Bill also deals with other miscellaneous matters such as foreign seals, the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas and their content.</P>
    <P>Both conventions, to which the Bill will give effect, include a provision that their terms will not affect more favourable bilateral arrangements already in existence between any member states. This means that, as far as implementation of the conventions is involved, the backing of warrants procedure with the United Kingdom contained in <Col N="1525" /> Part III of the 1965 Act will not be affected. However, the Bill will bring about a number of changes in our extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom in addition to those changes to our general extradition law which I mentioned. For example, there is a new definition of &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; to deal with difficulties that may arise because acts that constitute offences by the law of both states may be designated differently. It is being provided, in effect, that the offence in the State need not be in the same category or of the same description as the offence in the United Kingdom. Offences will correspond where the acts of the person sought would constitute an indictable offence if committed in Ireland or are punishable on summary conviction by at least six months' imprisonment. The United Kingdom has a provision in its 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act making revenue offences extraditable in the context of the backing of warrants arrangements with this country and the Bill will do likewise. Revenue offences will also be extraditable between Ireland and other members states of the European Union by virtue of the 1996 convention.</P>
    <P>It is also being provided in relation to the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Union that to constitute an extraditable offence it will be sufficient for an offence to be criminal in this State at the date of making of the extradition request. I will deal with this matter in more detail later.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline in more detail for the benefit of the House the provisions of the Bill. The first substantive section is section 4 which provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may by order designate countries that have adopted the convention of 1995. The 1995 convention is a European Union convention and open only to EU member states.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with provisional arrest. It amends section 27 of the 1965 Extradition Act and implements Article 4 of the 1995 convention. It sets out the information that must be provided to enable the simplified procedure to go ahead. This information has to be communicated also to the arrested person who must also be informed of his or her right to consent to surrender.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to consent to surrender. It inserts a new section 29A into the 1965 Act. It provides that where a person in extradition proceedings is brought before the High Court under a provisional arrest warrant or a warrant of arrest, he or she may consent to being surrendered to the convention country concerned. The procedure is elaborated on in subsections (2) to (4) of the new section. Where the person claimed is a citizen of Ireland, the Minister has to consent; this is set out in subsection (2)(<i>e</i>) and (3)(<i>f</i>).</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of the new section provides that if a person who is provisionally arrested consents to his or her being surrendered, the Minister shall inform the convention country concerned not later than ten days after the person is arrested. <Col N="1526" /> This is also a requirement where the person does not consent to being surrendered.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) of the new section provides that a person who has consented to his or her surrender may subsequently, but before the making of a surrender order by the Minister, withdraw such consent. Section 6 also makes a technical amendment to section 14 of the 1965 Act to take account of the new consent provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 7 concerns a person's option to waive his or her right to the rule of specialty, which provides that a person extradited for one offence may not be tried for other offences committed before his or her extradition unless certain conditions are complied with. This section amends section 20 of the 1965 Act and inserts a new section 20A. A person who has consented to his or her surrender may also consent to the Minister giving his consent to the waiving of specialty.</P>
    <P>An amendment introduced on Report State in the Dáil inserted new subsections (2) and (3) to section 20A. As mentioned, the 1995 convention provides that a person who has consented to his or her surrender may also renounce his or her right to the specialty rule; the 1995 convention also provides that consent or renunciation may not be revoked. However, it allows parties to opt out of this requirement by making a declaration to that effect on ratification. It is proposed that Ireland will make such a declaration, and this amendment allows for renunciation of the waiver of the right to specialty. The amendment, therefore, addressed the question of a person's right to revoke his or her consent to waiving the rule of specialty.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Senators to the fact that under Article 7 of the 1995 convention, to which this section gives effect, consent and renunciation of specialty must be given before the judicial authorities of the requested state. There is also a provision for a waiver of specialty in Article 10 of the 1996 convention in certain limited circumstances contemplated by Article 10, but in that case the waiver is to be given after his or her surrender before the judicial authority of the requesting state. I will deal with this in more detail when I come to discuss section 15.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with consent to surrender and provides for the insertion of a new section 33A in the 1965 Act, which sets out the procedure where consent to surrender has been given; Articles 10 and 11 of the 1995 convention deal with surrender. The date of consent will be the date on which the consent is made and recorded before the High Court. Subsection (1) of the new section 33A provides, in accordance with the convention, that the Minister shall notify the requesting country of that decision within 20 days of its making while subsection (2) provides that the Minister shall make an order for the surrender of the person sought not later than 20 days after the giving of notification. Subsection (4) of the new section provides for the person to be released if he or she has not been surrendered to the requesting state within the specified period. However, subsection <Col N="1527" /> (3) allows a derogation from this period if surrender within the specified period has been prevented by circumstances beyond the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill, that is, sections 9 to 19, gives effect to the 1996 convention relating to extradition between members states of the European Union. I described the purpose of the 1996 convention.</P>
    <P>Section 9 inserted a new subsection (1B) into section 3 of the 1965 Act and defined &ldquo;Convention country&rdquo; for the purposes of amendments being made to that Act by Part 3 of the Bill. Subsection (1C), also being inserted into section 3 of the 1965 Act, provides for a central authority. The explanatory report to the 1996 convention dealing with the designation of a central authority by each member state states that &ldquo;the central authority will be a focal point for transmission and reception of extradition requests and necessary supporting documents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may by order designate countries that have adopted the convention of 1996. The 1996 convention is a European Union convention and open only to EU member states.</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends section 10 of the 1965 Act and gives effect under a new section 10(1A) to the reduction in the threshold for extradition as between contracting states provided for in Article 2(1) of the 1996 convention. This provides that offences will be extraditable if they are punishable by six months' imprisonment in the requested member states and 12 months in the requesting member state. The current general threshold, as provided for in section 10(1) of the 1965 Act and Article 2 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, is 12 months in both states. Where extradition is sought in respect of a person who has been convicted and sentenced for such an offence, he or she must have been sentenced to at least four months' imprisonment. It is also being provided in a new subsection (2A) that where extradition is granted for an offence that complies with the minimum sentence requirements, that is, 12 months and six months in the requesting and requested states, respectively, extradition may also be granted for certain other offences, that is, minor offences, that fail to comply with this requirement.</P>
    <P>An amendment introduced to this section and to section 26 in the context of our extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom on Committee State in the Dáil provides that it will be sufficient for an offence to be criminal here at the date of making of the extradition request and in the requesting state at both the date of commission and request to constitute an extraditable offence, that is, to change from the current position where an offence to be extraditable in Ireland must have been an offence under our law and the law of the requesting state at the time it was committed and at the time of the request. However, if any part of the act constituting the <Col N="1528" /> extradition request was committed in this state, then it has to be an offence under the law of this State on the day on which it was committed.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, under our current law the position seems to be that to be extraditable the offence must have been a crime under Irish law at the time of its commission. The matter is not of great moment for the generality of extradition offences since they normally deal with core offences such as murder and theft which have always been criminal in all civilised states. As a result it rarely, if ever, becomes an issue in extradition proceedings. However, it could be an issue in regard to new offences that are created, particularly offences such as torture or other crimes against humanity in respect of which states are obliged under UN and other conventions to provide extra territorial jurisdiction for their domestic courts. Other examples would be crimes involving child pornography or abuse of children or trafficking in women which could expect to be condemned in all civilised countries. This provision will ensure that no one can escape simply because both states had not criminalised the offence in question at the time of its commission. This will assist us in meeting our international obligations especially when what is in question are crimes against humanity and other crimes of a type universally condemned by all civilised states.</P>
    <P>Section 12 concerns the political offence exemption. This section amends section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987. Article 5 of the 1996 convention requires that, as between contracting countries and for the purposes of the convention, no offence may be regarded as a political offence, but it allows member states to confine this requirement to the offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Suppression of Terrorism Convention. It is proposed that Ireland, on ratification, will make a declaration to this effect, setting out the offences under our law that may not be regarded as political, namely, the offences set out in section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, and in the Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The current position in our law with regard to the political offence exception is that since all EU states are parties to the Suppression of Terrorism Convention and orders applying Part II of the 1965 Act have been made in relation to all EU states, our Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, as amended by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, will apply to all EU states and there is, therefore, no need to include any &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; provision in the Bill in relation to those states. This section has been included to cater for the possibility that, post-enlargement, new EU member states may become parties to the Convention on Extradition between member states of the European Union who are not parties to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>Section 13 removes the current bar on extra<Col N="1529" /> dition for revenue offences. This section gives effect to Article 6 of the 1996 convention which makes revenue offences extraditable between EU states. The current section 13 of the Extradition Act, 1965, contains an absolute bar on extradition for revenue offences. The amendments being made to that Act by this provision will also enable simple amendments to be made to existing bilateral extradition agreements, for example, those with the USA and Australia, to provide for extradition for revenue offences, if that is desired. It will also be possible to allow for extradition for revenue offences to be included in any future bilateral agreements that may be negotiated. I previously mentioned that the UK has a provision in its legislation, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994, which allows for revenue offences to be extraditable in the context of the backing of warrants arrangements with this country. The amendments in subparagraph (c) of the section will do likewise in our law.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with cases of pardon or amnesty. This section inserts a new section 18A in the Extradition Act, 1965. It provides that extradition shall not be granted where the person claimed has (i) been granted a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution; or (ii) become immune by virtue of any amnesty or pardon in accordance with the law of the requesting country; or (iii) by virtue of any Act of the Oireachtas, become immune from prosecution or punishment for the act for which extradition is sought. The explanatory report to the 1996 convention dealing with this matter states, <i>inter alia</i>: &ldquo;This Article (Article 9) provides that an amnesty declared in the requested member state, in which that State had competence to prosecute the offence under its own criminal law, will constitute a mandatory reason for not granting extradition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I already referred to the fact that section 15 modifies certain aspects of the rule of specialty for the purposes of the 1996 convention. Members will recall from what I said earlier that the 1995 convention and section 7 of the Bill dealt with the renunciation of specialty where a person sought consent to surrender. Section 15 amends section 20 of the principal Act and provides that a person extradited for one offence may be tried or prosecuted for other offences committed before his or her extradition if the offences do not give rise to imprisonment, or where imprisonment is involved, if the person has expressly waived the benefit of specialty, such waiver to be made before the competent judicial authorities of the requesting state and to be shown to have been made voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, extradition to a convention country for an extraditable offence of a person claimed can also extend to offences which are not punishable by deprivation of liberty, or offences where upon conviction the person might be liable to a term of imprisonment and another penalty that does not involve imprisonment, and the High Court is satisfied that the other penalty only, and <Col N="1530" /> not the term of imprisonment, will be imposed should he or she be convicted. The provision also comprehends offences involving measures not involving the deprivation of liberty, including a financial penalty or a measure in lieu thereof, even if failure or refusal to submit to any measure or comply with any such penalty may involve restriction of his or her personal liberty. On the other hand, in the case of an offence where imprisonment is involved, the person may only be proceeded against if he or she has expressly waived the benefit of specialty after his or her surrender and before the competent judicial authority of the requesting state and, in the case of an Irish citizen, the Minister also consents. Article 7(2) of the convention provides that a member state may declare that it will authorise extradition of its nationals only under certain specified conditions. Ireland's declaration in this respect will provide on ratification of the convention for the need for such consent.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill addresses the application of rule of specialty in the State that is the reverse of what I have just discussed in the context of section 15. This section amends section 39 of the Extradition Act, 1965, which deals with the application of the rule of specialty in the case of persons extradited to Ireland and contains analogous provisions to the previous section. Article 10 of the 1996 convention provides that the consent of the requested state is not necessary in relation to those proceedings unless that state makes a similar declaration to Ireland in relation to its own citizens. Again, a person has to expressly waive the benefit of specialty, such waiver to be made before a judge of the High Court, who has to be satisfied that the person consented voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences.</P>
    <P>Section 17 covers authentication of documents. Article 15 of the 1996 convention, which deals with authentication, is aimed at simplifying the formal requirements in relation to documentation for extradition. The general principle established is that any document or copy thereof transmitted for the purposes of extradition between convention countries shall be exempted from authentication or any other formality. A new subsection (2) is being inserted into section 25 of the principal Act and provides that for the purposes of an extradition request from a convention county, a document shall be deemed to be an authenticated copy if it has been certified as a true copy by the judicial authority that issued the original or by an officer of the central authority duly authorised to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 17(b) of the Bill substitutes a new section for section 37 of the principal Act to simplify the requirements to be met for extradition documents from non-convention countries &ndash; subsection (1) &ndash; and from convention countries &ndash; subsections (2) and (3) &ndash; to be received in evidence without further proof. In respect of non-convention countries, the document will be required to be signed by a judge, magistrate or officer of the requesting country and to be certi<Col N="1531" /> fied by being sealed with the seal of a Minister of State, Ministry, etc. The range of official seals which may be used for this purpose is being extended to facilitate the operation of the section. In respect of convention countries, it will be sufficient for a copy of a conviction and sentence order or of a warrant to be certified either by the judicial authority that issued the original or by the central authority. Other extradition documents from a convention country purporting to be copies will be received in evidence without further proof.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill allows for the facsimile transmission of documents. This section inserts a new section 23A in the 1965 Act and is intended to give effect to Article 13(3), (4) and (5) of the 1996 Convention. The central authority provided for in section 9 is given the authority to receive extradition requests and documents from convention countries by fax. In order to guarantee the authenticity of extradition documents, the central authority of the requesting member state shall state in its request that it certifies that the documents transmitted in support of that request correspond to the originals. Use will be made of cryptographic devices to ensure confidentiality and authenticity. Where the central authority in the State is for some reason not satisfied that the documents correspond with the originals, it may require the central authority of the requesting country to provide the original document or a true copy thereof.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the transit of persons sought through Ireland. The section amends section 40 of the Principal Act and is intended to give effect to Article 16 of the 1996 convention, which deals with the transit of a surrendered person through Ireland from one contracting party to another. Any requests for transit by a convention country must contain the information specified in the new section 40(1)(A), that is, information regarding the person's identity where there exists an arrest warrant in respect of the person being transited; the nature and description of the offence for which he or she is sought; a description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, the date and place of its commission; and other relevant information. A new subsection (2)(A) is inserted into section 40 to deal with the unscheduled landing of an aircraft in the State which has on board a person who is being conveyed to a convention country upon his or her surrender to that country pursuant to extradition proceedings.</P>
    <P>I turn to Part IV, sections 20 to 26, which provides for a number of substantive and procedural changes to our general extradition law. Section 20 provides for all extradition proceedings to be moved to the High Court. This is a change from the current law where the initial application for the extradition of persons from the State is made to the District Court. In 1994 such applications were centralised in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court. However, since nearly all extradition <Col N="1532" /> cases end up in the High Court in any event it is considered that the consolidation of all extradition proceedings in the High Court would provide for a more efficient and expeditious hearing of such cases. Since 1994 all bail applications in extradition cases must be taken in the High Court. The Presidents of the High Court and the District Court have been consulted and there has been no objection to the proposal.</P>
    <P>An amendment introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil provides in section 20(3) for transitional arrangements. It provides that amendments effected by section 20(1) shall not operate to affect extradition proceedings brought before the commencement of this section. In particular, the District Court shall, in relation to any such proceedings, have the same jurisdiction that it had immediately before commencement. A further amendment to this section, which was introduced on Report Stage, provides for a right of appeal on a point of law from the High Court to the Supreme Court. This provision, together with the possibility of <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, provides the necessary safeguards for a person subject to extradition proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 21 seeks to address a serious difficulty with the operation of section 4 of the Extradition Act, 1965. This arises in connection with multilateral agreements which contain extradition provisions. It is a difficulty that was not foreseen when the current provision was inserted in 1987. It is proposed in section 21 to return to the pre-1987 position. The issue has two aspects, the first of which relates to our own accession to the international agreements. The second and more difficult issue arises as other states accede to agreements and, thereby, impose obligations on Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> those new parties to the agreement. When Ireland ratifies a multilateral convention which contains obligations relating to extradition, it must ensure that it can comply with these obligations before the convention enters into force for Ireland. Under multilateral conventions, the period between ratification and bringing the extradition provisions into effect tends to be quite short, typically 30 days.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 of the 1965 Extradition Act, as amended by the 1987 Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, in order to allow for extradition between Ireland and another state which is party to the agreement, it is necessary for an extradition order to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This must be done after the State becomes a party to the agreement but before the agreement enters into force for Ireland. This can generally be managed through the normal scheduling of parliamentary business.</P>
    <P>Subsequent orders, necessary to take into account the State's obligations to other states as they become party to the agreement after its entry into force for this State, must be made between the date that such a state becomes party to the agreement and the date that the agreement enters into force for it. The timeframe within <Col N="1533" /> which we have to pass motions and the number of motions is dictated by the accession of new parties to agreements. That timeframe is therefore outside our control but the consequences of not meeting deadlines would put Ireland in a very unsatisfactory position of not being able to meet its obligations under such international agreements, of which there is an increasing number. Section 21 is designed to meet this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the Oireachtas will already have been given an opportunity to examine and consider the agreements in question when the legislation giving effect to them in Ireland was or is being enacted. The making of the extradition orders is a necessary additional but consequential piece of business that the State must undertake.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the giving of evidence by affidavit. It inserts a new section 7B into the 1965 Act and provides that evidence as to any matter to which proceedings under that Act relate may be given by affidavit, or by a statement in writing that purports to have been sworn by the deponent in a place other than the State and in the presence of a person duly authorised to attest to the swearing of such a statement by the deponent. The High Court may, if it considers that the interests of justice so require, direct that oral evidence be given of the matters described in the affidavit or statement.</P>
    <P>Section 23 amends section 8 of the 1965 Act by inserting a new subsection (1A) and substituting new subsections (3), 3(A) and 3(B) for the present subsection (3). It also makes a technical amendment to subsection (8). The purpose of the changes is to deal with difficulties that have arisen in practice from the present wording of section 8. For example, the existing section has been interpreted as requiring that every order made must embody the terms of the extradition agreement. Thus, as is most often the case, if the purpose of the order is merely to apply Part II to a new state on the accession of that state to, say, the 1957 European Extradition Convention, the text of the convention is set out in the order, despite the fact that the text will be available in the previous order which will be referred to in the new order and cited together with it.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the section propose that when an extradition agreement is made with another state or states the text of the agreement will be included but that when Part II is applied to a new state on the accession of that state to an existing agreement, the text of the agreement will not be included in the order. However, the order will recite or embody the terms of any reservation or declaration entered to that agreement by the country to which the order applies. When an amendment to an existing agreement is made the order need only contain the text of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The current section 8(8) of the Principal Act requires the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the text of the orders made. The proposed new section 8(8) will merely require notice to be given in <i>Iris <Col N="1534" />Oifigiúil</i> that the order has been made. It is useful to emphasise that, overall, these changes will mean a more streamlined and efficient procedure than has existed heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that evidence may be given through television link by a person outside the State. It amends section 29 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, to provide for the possibility of a person, other than the person whose extradition is being sought, being able to give evidence from abroad in extradition cases via Iive television link. Leave of the court will be required.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the issue of foreign seals. Section 21(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Principal Act is substituted by a new provision to take account of the fact that some countries do not have ministerial seals and seal documents under the seal of a ministry or Department. It is now being provided that a seal of the relevant Minister, ministry or Department is sufficient. This amendment also requires a consequential amendment to be made to section 39(2) of the 1965 Act and this is provided for in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with any difficulty that may arise with &ldquo;correspondence of offences&rdquo; in Part III cases, that is the backing of warrants arrangements with the UK. The new definition of correspondence will mean that while the offence in the State may not be in the same category or of the same description as the offence in the UK, it will still be extraditable provided the act constituting the offence would, if done in the State, constitute an offence which is punishable on indictment or punishable on summary conviction by imprisonment for a maximum term of not less than six months.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the amendment to section 26 which was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that it will be sufficient for an offence to be a crime in the requesting state, that is, the UK at both the date of commission and request and criminal here at the date of making of the extradition request to constitute an extraditable offence.</P>
    <P>An amendment was also introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil to insert a new section 27 into the Bill. The new section amends section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, to add four 1949 Geneva conventions to the list in section 3(<i>a</i>) of that Act so that the war-related crimes contemplated by those conventions could not be regarded as political offences. This is being done, following consultation with the Attorney General's office, to ensure that the political offence exemption will not arise in cases involving these conventions. These conventions have been given effect in Ireland by the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962. However, the 1962 Act does not make specific provision about reliance on the political offence exemption nor for extradition and this amendment is being made to remove any doubt about the possibility of the political offence exemption being relied upon in Ireland in the case of offences under these conventions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" />I think all Senators will agree that we should consider ways to update and improve extradition arrangements as we develop and reinforce co-operation in the judicial area between member states of the European Union. This Bill will, I believe, prove to be an effective and modern legal instrument which will assist in bringing to justice suspected criminals who leave the jurisdiction where the crime has been committed. Essentially it will provide for a more streamlined extradition procedure between member states.</P>
    <P>Those are the provisions of the Bill. While it is a relatively short Bill, it is detailed and complex legislation and, as I mentioned previously, it contains a range of measures which will strengthen and considerably improve existing legislation in this area. It will also meet our international obligations. It is clear that the taking of all measures to combat terrorism is an objective to which all parties in this House are committed and I believe that this Bill represents a valuable additional strand in the array of measures that are available to counteract this threat. Again I emphasise that the Government will be introducing a number of measures over the coming months which will further strengthen anti-terrorism legislation. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill and on that note, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. We voted against it and we had good reason for doing so.</P>
      <P>In general I welcome this legislation which is somewhat overdue. In effect, it is a Bill proposing to legislate for two conventions, the 1995 European Union convention on extradition and the 1996 convention on extradition between member states of the European Union. I welcome the general principle of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister at the outset stated that it is his intention to have it enacted at an early date. I hope that in his response he will be in a position to give us some indication of how soon he intends to enact it because it is important that it be enacted sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit disingenuous of the Minister to come before the House and again refer to the tragic events of 11 September in the United States as a reason for bringing forward this legislation. This is something which should be going ahead regardless of anything happening in any other jurisdiction. This is something to which we signed up many years ago and for which we have agreed to legislate. Therefore there is an onus on us to pro<Col N="1536" /> ceed to legislation, which is what we are doing now.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that it involves bringing in all the member states of the European Union. It is important that it includes all member states and indeed other countries with whom we have made extradition procedural arrangements such as Australia and the United States.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements on existing law are proposed in this Bill and I welcome them. It is apt and appropriate that certain aspects, particularly those regarding revenue offences, are being dealt with here in a procedural fashion and also that people cannot use the defence they had in the past that it was a political offence to prevent their extradition. That latter point is very important.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate in more detail on the section which deals with where a person consents to his or her surrender. I want him to put on record in greater detail the whole consent procedure and the details on when a person would renounce the right to the specialty rule. It is important that the full detail of those matters are put on record. While no member state should be used as a haven to harbour criminals from another State, equally it is important that the civil rights of the individual are fully and properly protected. I would appreciate a deeper and fuller elaboration from the Minister on this aspect of the Bill when he addresses it further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the range of extraditable offences, particularly, as I have already stated, those regarding revenue offences. I also welcome the simplification procedure. The fact that all cases will be held in the High Court is clear and I welcome the fact that television links or affidavits can be introduced in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the fact that offences in the UK may be somewhat different in the way they are presented will no longer be an excuse for them not to apply and those changes must be welcomed. We have, needless to say, close communication with the UK. Because of the constant movement of people and close communication, some little technical detail should not prohibit getting down to the main business.</P>
    <P>Given that we are changing over to the euro at the beginning of 2002, it is appropriate that the revenue offence be brought in. That is why I asked the Minister to initiate the legislation immediately and put it into full effect. There would be good reason for using it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that new offences will be introduced for extradition, particularly for the offences that include torture and crimes against humanity and indeed trafficking in people, particularly women and children, in pornography or anything of that nature. The extension to those areas must we welcomed by this House. It is not before time that we are legislating for such offences.</P>
    <P>In the context of the sad affair in Wexford at the weekend, I wonder what procedures can be adopted to bring the people who perpetrated those crimes against humanity to justice. What is <Col N="1537" /> the position in that regard? Whether the perpetrators of the crime were from a member state of the European Union or from a country outside the European Union but were resident or harboured in the European Union, what does the Minister propose to do in that regard? It was suggested in some reports that they may be criminals from Russia who manoeuvre this type of situation. What is the procedure between the European Union member states on addressing this issue? It is extremely important that that matter be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the revenue offences. I welcome the fact that section 13 of the Bill lifts the absolute bar on extradition for revenue offences and I want to see that put into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister should comment on section 14 about pardon or amnesty. It provides that extradition shall not be granted where a person has been granted a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution which states that the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction is vested in the President, but such power or commutation or remission, may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate in greater detail on that particular aspect of the Bill as I do not understand the specifics of what is involved. How often has this article of the Constitution been used? Is it necessary to include it in the Bill? Perhaps the Minister envisages that the President will be busy dishing out pardons, meaning that certain people will be exempt from extradition.</P>
    <P>Given modern communications technology, it is important that this Bill improves the means of dealing with documentation and brings it into the 21st century. Also, the necessary protections relating to documentation appear to be provided for in the Bill. It is commendable that the High Court will deal with this issue as everyone will know where to go and how to proceed.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill is welcome. The aspects addressing the trade in humans must be treated seriously. It has been reported in recent years that many women from other member states are brought into Dublin for prostitution purposes. Does the Minister or his Department have any specific details about this? Will action be taken against the people who arrange this trade? There is an increase in vicious and vile crimes against women and children and it is important that this Bill helps bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will not be another one to collect dust on the shelves but will be effective in creating a better quality of life for many people and in protecting member states from despicable criminals who have roamed with impunity because of problems with extradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and this Bill which we debate against the backdrop of some of the most horrendous terrorist attacks in history. However, the Bill concerns <Col N="1538" /> more than those attacks and I commend the Minister for acting so swiftly on the 20 September request of the Justice and Home Affairs Council urging EU member states to take all urgent steps to implement the two conventions on extradition by 1 January 2002, which this Bill will do.</P>
      <P>Extradition is an emotive subject in Ireland with many high profile cases and legal wrangles ongoing between the Republic, Britain and other countries. One famous case which concerned Deputy McDaid, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, was not mentioned tonight. As we have matured as a nation and as the European Union has matured, we can have a rational debate. We can bring the various forces and arms of the State to bear against terrorists of all types.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions relating to extradition for revenue offences. In recent years, some of the most appalling attacks on our society were carried out by drug barons and those who import heroin and other hard drugs, which has caused mayhem throughout society. In the 1980s, areas of Dublin were devastated by the importation of heroin and today cocaine is taking its place. Yet, in some member states of what we regard as the civilised European Union drug barons openly flaunt their wealth and live the high life despite everyone knowing the source of their money. Due to cumbersome legislation and the absence of an extradition framework, they go about their business unhindered in most parts of the EU.</P>
      <P>Many of them left this jurisdiction because of the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. For this Bill and the CAB to be truly effective, it must be possible to pursue these people and request their extradition from their havens when a prosecution is pending over the revenue aspect of their illicit businesses. This is one of the Bill's most important aspects. I endorse the provisions of section 13 which will be used as the main vehicle to address one of the biggest threats to society and to young people in particular.</P>
      <P>The advent of the peace process and the shifting of hearts and minds within the various traditions on the island mean that extradition is no longer as emotive as it was in the past. I recall High Court cases in which, due to technical hitches or a document failing to be authenticated or presented at the right place, we made heroes out of people who were only terrorists. I hope the Bill addresses this and that we will have a smooth transfer of persons between the EU member states. We do not want cases tied up in court for years. A simple provision, such as that in section 18, can help prevent this by addressing the changes required with the advent of modern technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill inserts a new section, section 23A into the Principal Act and gives effect to Articles Nos. 13.3 to 13.5, inclusive, of the 1996 convention. The central authority is given the authority to receive extradition requests and documents by fax. In order to guarantee authenticity, the central authority of the requesting member state shall state in its request that it certifies that the <Col N="1539" /> documents transmitted correspond to the originals. This is a simple and straightforward step to address technological changes and attempts to avoid the legal challenges which have been a feature of extradition proceedings between Britain and Ireland. The Bill is technical, as is the explanatory memorandum, but its thrust and what we are trying to achieve is positive.</P>
    <P>Some issues arise regarding new member states. When will the conventions come into force in these states? Will it be prior to or on accession or will there be a transition period? This must be addressed as it could allow the people we are tracking down to move to new member states where they would have a reprieve of a year or two before the conventions are ratified there.</P>
    <P>The mindset of the civilised world has changed in regard to terrorism. As a country which has suffered terrorist atrocities, we can understand how Americans felt on 11 September. However, it is important that we move forward on a number of fronts. Civilised countries now realise that all forms of terrorism must be rooted out. The attitude of some countries which were apologetic about terrorism in the past has changed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation and hope it achieves its objectives. Given the positive developments in Northern Ireland, the resources which were used to counteract terrorism can now be used to deal effectively with the new problem that affects society, drug dealers and those who import hard drugs such as heroin.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will receive full co-operation from the legal systems in EU member states in terms of practical policing measures. This is an important issue. It is fine for us to talk about extradition and the ratification of the various EU conventions on extradition, but there will be problems if there is a lack of co-operation from EU police forces when it comes to tracking down and sharing information. This legislation is required because of issues such as the events of 11 September and the drug problems we face. I agree with the Minister's comments that, overall, these changes will mean a more streamlined and efficient procedure.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made during the debate to the case in Wexford at the weekend when people lost their lives in tragic circumstances. It is very heartening to know that somebody is being charged tonight in Belgium. I welcome the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will be delighted that we did not forget him here tonight and that we remember his travails. The history of extradition legislation in this House goes back to 1987. I recall that, before the election in 1987, the Fianna Fáil party took a strong position in opposition to extradition. I also recall the first vote in the House when I reminded the now Fianna Fáil <Col N="1540" /> Whip that his mother would be less than pleased with him for voting for extradition. That was in 1987, but it does not feel like 14 years ago. On that occasion I voted against the legislation, as the Government Whip will recall, because I said it should involve a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
      <P>I have to concede that, since that time, amendments to the legislation have made it much stronger and much more dependable. Every one of the amendments made in that time has been welcomed. I particularly welcomed the redefinition and development of the term &ldquo;political&rdquo;. Clear definitions, descriptions and decisions have been made with regard to our relations with the UK, to crimes committed there and to extradition requests from there. The Irish Government should be complimented for its work over the last two or three months in rejecting the right-wing fascistic demands of some European countries about the European arrest warrant. The Attorney General and the Government have handled that issue very responsibly. It underlines the need for us to be particularly careful about legislation. We must ensure that legislation is in compliance with the Constitution and our views on natural justice.</P>
      <P>Revenue offences can now be included as extraditable offences. I listened recently to the head of the corresponding group to our Criminal Assets Bureau in the UK. As the Minister is aware, they do not have a criminal assets bureau in the UK but they aspire to having one. The Criminal Assets Bureau legislation is a model that is now being copied in many different European jurisdictions. Listening to people who are trying to deal with major criminals in different European countries, the common view among all police forces and those trying to convict offenders is that it is better to have them free without their money than in jail with their money. The possibility of convicting people on revenue offences will do more to clean up Europe than many other aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the unacceptable over-reaction of the United States in some of its recent legislation. The USA Patriotic Act is the best or worst example, depending on one's point of view. That country prides itself on its civil liberties and natural justice, but it holds hundreds of people without trial. It is utterly unacceptable. In many cases people who were completely cleared of involvement in terrorism by the courts were found guilty of minor visa or immigration offences. This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am greatly concerned by one aspect of the Bill. I question the constitutionality of section 26. I welcome without hesitation the reference to the inclusion of new technology and the arrangements regarding teleconferencing and evidence by television. I also welcome section 18 in relation to the facsimile transmission of documents. I ask the Minister to explain why he stopped at facsimile given that there is now cryptographic mailing and attachments? When President Clinton visited Ireland a few years ago, he and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, went <Col N="1541" /> to Gateway and signed off on a new system of signature and encryption which ensures that documents can be sent electronically and not just by fax. The proposal is unnecessarily restrictive &ndash; it should also include e-mailing. In 1987 it was impossible to find a fax machine in this House. Only last year I had an argument with the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas when I refused to allow them to include my fax number in the directory because the fax is now well out of date. However, I have never encountered any movement on these issues when I raise them with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>There is a question about the constitutionality of section 26. It mentions the correspondence of offences in the context of offences committed in this jurisdiction. Previously, an alleged offence had to be an offence in this State and in the requesting state on the date it was committed. That condition was very clear. I do not argue with the reasons for it, but we are moving to a situation where a person can be extradited on the basis of an offence which is obviously an offence in the requesting state but which is an offence in Ireland only on the date of the receipt of the request. It may not have been an offence in Ireland on the date of the offence. I do not believe that gels with the Constitution. Article 15.5 of the Constitution declares that: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo;  We are effectively deciding that for the purposes of a corresponding offence, which is an alleged breach of the law, it is all right for it to be an offence on the date of the request from the requesting state. There is a major gap here &ndash; somebody could be extradited from this State for something which was not an offence in this State on the date of its alleged commission. I ask the Minister to explain this point.</P>
    <P>It is not that I disagree with the spirit of this, but I do not want us to bring something forward which could be found to be unconstitutional. In my reading of it, it clearly seems to be unconstitutional. Section 26 (2) states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this Part an offence under the law of a place to which this Part applies corresponds to an offence under the law of the State where the act constituting the offence under the law of that place would, if done in the State, constitute an offence under the law of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In each case the State in question is this one. It is stating it is an offence in the State. It is not an offence in this State, unless it was an offence under the legislation on the date it was committed. Therefore, the subsection is declaring something to be an offence while the next subsection declares it to be an offence if it was an offence on the date of the request, but not on the date it was allegedly committed. This is a significant issue. I agree with the spirit of what the Minister is trying to achieve to which I have no objection. I do not want to create loopholes, but this may <Col N="1542" /> be an escape route and somebody may be caught out.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on dealing with the thorny question of where the same acts have different names in different countries. Where the Bill deals with an act or offence, it does so quite well. That is superb and nobody can argue with it. However, in section 26(2) we are proposing something that will be in breach of Article 15.5 because we are declaring an act to be an infringement of the law which was not so at the date of its commission. That is very clear in both Irish and English. I look forward to the Minister's response. Apart from this I commend the Bill.</P>

I feel like doing so myself. We have been here all day and it is pretty boring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Acting Chairman is not at all partisan. We will all have a good time and be happy and friends given that it is coming up to Christmas. In general terms I welcome this tidying up which is all part of a growing sense of our European associations. I agree with Senator O'Toole on two matters in particular. It is very important for us to pursue criminals in the revenue area through the CAB, etc. The Senator may have found a flaw or conundrum in the Bill, which I am sure the Minister's advisers will consider to see if it is necessary to make some kind of emendation.</P>
      <P>In the development of recent Irish history it is interesting to notice the way in which the Bill is being introduced. How things have changed. I remember when &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; was a dirty word. It was on a par with &ldquo;eviction&rdquo; and &ldquo;informer&rdquo;. I remember people outside Leinster House getting quite an amount of support against any form of extradition. I remember when the Establishment here, both political and legal, was resistant to extradition and put up every obstacle possible, particularly when it came to extradition to the United Kingdom, one of the principal reasons being this fig leaf of political motivation. I am glad we are reducing this notion. If a person murders, maims or injures others, I do not care what is the motivation. It is murder, torture, violation of people's human and civil rights and their dignity as people. The sooner we get rid of this nonsense of political motivation, especially in the European jurisdiction, the better. I welcome this new attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I am a little worried about being uncritically free with extradition. When we discuss the Bill in detail on the next Stage, perhaps we will be able to take a look at this. I share Senator O'Toole's concern about the United <Col N="1543" /> States, particularly in the light of remarks being made. I am not anti-American, but I am critical of certain aspects, particularly the cavalier attitude both they and the British have taken recently to civil rights.</P>
    <P>A senior Cabinet Minister recently dismissed concerns about human rights as pettifogging. I am prepared to continue in this way when the question of human rights is involved because there is alacrity in the way in which so many Administrations have rushed to make use of what happened on 11 September in order to introduce draconian measures. In the United States there are now military tribunals, which are closed and violate all notions of natural law. They carry the death penalty and clearly restrict disastrously the rights of accused persons. Will we extradite in these circumstances to an Administration which permits this abuse of the decencies of the law? </P>
    <P>Let us look closer to home, at France. Before we send people off let us examine what the possible effect may be. Let us look at what has been coming up in the newspapers in recent years among our wonderful European allies like the French. Having lied about it for years senior generals are now admitting that they routinely tortured and murdered people in Algeria. Let us make pretty sure this aspect has been cleaned out of French public life. I am in a position to state that it certainly was not within the past ten years. I worked quite closely with a Belgian Baptist pastor, Dr. Joseph Dousay, who was murdered by the French secret police. In the circumstances one ought to ask some questions and show a little reserve.</P>
    <P>I am balancing matters. On the one hand, I am in favour of rooting out real criminals and against the use of the fig leaf of an excuse of political motivation for dastardly acts. On the other, even the accused ought to have their human rights protected. We must be very careful about those countries to which we export our citizens for trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House. It is late in the day to be discussing extradition. No doubt this is the first of his package of proposals in dealing with terrorism. They arise from the European conventions of 1995 and 1996. Although the Minister has not stated it categorically, clearly the reason they are being brought before us now has much to do with the events of 11 September. He has not given us any reason five and six years after the conventions were passed they are now being brought before us for ratification and promulgation in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On extradition, we have gone a long way down the road in recent years. The political offence is no longer as central, in legislative or legal terms, as it was in the past. In relation to ordinary crime, nobody could object to pursuing criminals across Europe and beyond. There should be reciprocal efforts made by all jurisdictions to try to catch <Col N="1544" /> those who have committed crimes in one country or another. That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The legislation setting up the Criminal Assets Bureau seems to have been successful. We have driven people who have committed serious crimes, such as the importation and distribution of illegal substances which have caused innumerable fatalities, out of the country. It is important they are pursued and extradited for crimes committed. We are introducing simplified procedures, which are welcome.</P>
    <P>The proposal to fax documents from one jurisdiction to another in a confidential way is welcome. It should also be possible to use the Internet and e-mail documentation. It is as easy to sign for a document and to establish confidentiality that way as it is with a facsimile. We should look at the best of modern technology. Perhaps an amendment to that effect would be received favourably.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision of television links for witnesses for offences which might have taken place in another country. If someone goes on holidays, they might be reluctant to return to give evidence in a case where an offence had been committed. A television link would improve the situation.</P>
    <P>As regards civil liberties, the pursuit of terrorism has sparked the introduction of the legislation at this time. I did not expect to be discussing such legislation five or six years after it was introduced as a convention. We must be careful about civil liberties. We must be careful that we do not over-react and decide to introduce legislation which we might rue in the future. We do not want to respond too hastily to a tragic event by introducing legislation without proper analysis and examination. The two motions on terrorism and arrest warrants which we will discuss later must be examined carefully. We do not want to pass them with a nod.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify what is proposed in section 26, to which Senator O'Toole referred. The Minister said that offences will correspond where the acts of the person sought would constitute an indictable offence if committed in Ireland or are punishable on summary conviction by at least six months imprisonment. We are discussing legislation which will make the termination of a pregnancy an offence which carries a penalty of 12 years on conviction. However, it is not an offence in the neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is also being provided in relation to the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Union that to constitute an extraditable offence it will be sufficient for an offence to be criminal in the State at the date of making the extradition request. How does that tally with what we are doing? We will have an offence with a penalty in excess of six months, which is the penalty prescribed in the legislation. It will be a substantial offence in this country which will warrant the extradition of the person concerned. We know that thousands of <Col N="1545" /> women go to Britain for medical procedures which result in the termination of unborn life, yet it is not an offence there. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how the two pieces of legislation will tally. That conundrum must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Commitments were made many years ago, as far back as the Barra Ó Briain committee in 1979, about the video recording of all interrogations. What progress has been made in terms of the protection of the civil rights of those in Garda custody? If we want to introduce modern technology for the transmission of evidence, surely we should use the same technology for the interrogation of suspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a couple of questions. One does not wish to politicise issues, particularly in light of what happened in New York on 11 September, but one must remember that not all members of the European Union have the standards of personal liberty which we take for granted. There are countries where people are detained for considerable lengths of time under circumstances with which we would not be happy. Irish judges, for example, would not tolerate what is happening in Greece to the airplane spotters, which will now be resolved. It could not happen here. Our Judiciary and Supreme Court would not allow people to be detained in custody for the length of time people are being detained. I want to be assured that something will be built into the legislation which ensures that people will be dealt with expeditiously and that they will not be extradited to another country and left waiting in custody for months or years. I read the Minister's script, but I do not know if we have a guarantee on that issue.</P>
      <P>The second issue is that which Senator Costello raised. What do we do with Irish people who commit offences abroad which are regarded as offences in Ireland? We allow them to do things outside the State, while knowing that what they are doing is illegal in the State. It is extraordinary to allow people to do things abroad which we regard as so serious that we insert into our Constitution a prohibition on them. We say we will not stop them from going abroad. Does that mean we accept that what they do abroad is not an offence? We will not stop them from doing it, but are they committing an offence by doing it abroad and, if so and if they stay abroad, can we require the neighbouring jurisdiction to return them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that a Fianna Fáil Minister is introducing extradition legislation. I always remember the heady days of the 1980s when Fianna Fáil was utterly opposed to extradition. It then went into Government and discovered it had to support it. I sat here virtually on my own as an Independent Senator and opposed an extradition Bill, which was passed. A Fianna Fáil Senator asked me afterwards for a copy of my script because he had to go to a meeting about extradition at the weekend and he thought it would be a great speech to <Col N="1546" /> give. I hope that what we are getting now is the authentic Fianna Fáil and not something to fulfil a necessary condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to what has turned out to be a very good debate. I was heartened by the support for the innovative features of the Bill. The debate was lively, interesting and thought provoking, but that was only to be expected. Extradition is one of those subjects on which many have strong views. Senator Norris referred to the fact that I was having a conversation for a time during Senator O'Toole's contribution. I was in fact commenting on the quality of the Senator's speech to Senator Fitzgerald. The fact that I did not make any comment to Senator Fitzgerald during Senator Norris's contribution should not be read as meaning I did not consider his contribution to possess quality also.</P>
      <P>Recent atrocities highlight the importance of governments presenting a co-ordinated response to terrorism and international crime, a point on which all Senators will agree with me. We must redouble our efforts to ensure that our approach to countering the terrorism problem leaves nothing to be desired. The Government is committed to that and is working on several other legislative proposals to give effect to the relevant conventions to combat international crime and terrorism. These proposals will be before the Oireachtas shortly. Of particular significance in this regard is the plan of action approved by the European Council on 21 September last to counter terrorism. The plan calls on member states to amend all existing international conventions in the fight against terrorism. A similar call was contained in the UN Security Council resolution of 28 September, which called on states to sign and ratify the UN Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. We recently signed that convention and the Government intends to give effect to it and other UN conventions relevant to the fight against terrorism, not yet ratified, as part of our response to the events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>There are other legislative proposals in the pipeline which are intended to enable Ireland to become a party to the UN conventions on the suppression of terrorist bombings, the taking of hostages and the prevention and punishment of attacks on internationally protected persons. Work is under way in my Department to frame proposals necessary to give effect to those conventions and steps are being taken to accede to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, accession to which does not require legislative changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that everyone in this House fully supports the taking of all appropriate measures in the fight against terrorism in respect of which we must prioritise facilitating more effective co-operation in combating crime and bringing to justice suspected criminals. The recent <Col N="1547" /> appalling events in the United States of America were defining moments for all of us. Those tragic events highlighted the need for greater national and international effort in the fight against terrorism and to this end we must ensure that the judicial systems of all states, especially member states of the EU, work in harmony to present a co-ordinated response. Senators are aware of the proposals relating to the European arrest warrant, regarding which a motion will be moved in this House later this evening. Proposals for an arrest warrant give us a further opportunity to consider the current surrender and extradition arrangements that exist between member states. Since a motion on the European arrest warrant is being moved later I will confine myself to some brief remarks on the effect of the proposals as legislative instruments.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that every Member fully supports the taking of all appropriate measures in the fight against terrorism. To achieve this we must give priority to facilitating more effective co-operation in combating crime and bringing to justice suspected criminals. The recent appalling events in the United States of America were defining moments for all of us. Those tragic events highlighted the need for greater national and international effort in the fight against terrorism and to this end we must ensure that the judicial systems of all states, especially member states of the EU, work in harmony to present a co-ordinated response. Senators are aware of the proposals relating to the European arrest warrant and I have stated that I will confine myself to some brief remarks about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for a European arrest warrant are contained in a draft framework decision. Framework decisions are a new type of instrument provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty's <Col N="1548" /> provisions on police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Their objective is the approximation of the laws and regulations of the member states with regard to specific areas. They are binding upon member states in terms of the result to be achieved by them, but it is for each member state to decide upon the level of implementation. In this respect they resemble directives under the first pillar. The purpose of the framework decision proposed is to replace existing extradition procedures within member states of the EU with a simplified procedure based on the European arrest warrant. That will, in effect, replace inter-state extradition with an inter-court procedure. The proposals are comprehensive and will replace existing multilateral procedures between member states of the Union. The establishment of surrender of wanted persons based on warrants issued by judicial authorities is entirely reasonable. We are already familiar with extradition proceedings based on a backing-of-warrants system through our extradition arrangements with the UK.</P>
    <P>I noted in my earlier remarks that the 1965 Act has been the basis of all extradition law. It was based on the Council of Europe's 1957 convention on extradition. The Act has served us well for 36 years. Nevertheless, we cannot stand still and must respond to the new circumstances. The 1995 and 1996 EU extradition conventions represent another step in ensuring more efficient extradition procedures between member states. All member states have committed themselves to ratifying these conventions by the end of this year and the Bill will enable Ireland to fulfil its obligations in this regard.</P>

      <P>&mdash;prosecution by leaving the jurisdiction where the crime has been committed. This measure will help to achieve this aim.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole commented on the European arrest warrant and welcomed the new changes relating to revenue offences. He referred to section 26 which relates to correspondence of offences and said he was concerned about its constitutionality. The section provides that it is sufficient that the offence in question be an offence in this country on the date of request, and that much was cleared by the Attorney General. The normal rule against retrospection does not apply to extradition. Extradition is not a criminal offence but a criminal procedure. A Pinochet type situation is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped to enact the legislation before Christmas to ratify the convention in January <Col N="1549" /> 2002. This commitment was given last September. The conventions come into effect 90 days after their ratification. The new member states accept the 1995 and 1996 conventions on accession.</P>
    <P>Several states are involved in the Wexford case. Co-operation between member states has been excellent and offences probably arise in several of them. They will be addressed under the European arrest warrant. The offence of illegal trafficking is included on the positive list of the European arrest warrant. The legislation does not extend current laws and pardons and ensures that, where a pardon was granted, the person is not to be prosecuted for that offence in another country.</P>
    <P>Senators have noted the Bill extends the definition of extraditable offences to include revenue offences. It is framed on the basis that it covers taxes, duties, customs and exchange controls. The existing extradition procedures and arrangements will, when the Bill is enacted, apply to any revenue offence which comes within the meaning of extraditable offence or corresponding offence in the same way that these procedures and arrangements apply to other offences.</P>
    <P>Until now there was a general prohibition on extradition for revenue offences. However, the 1965 Act allowed for extradition in certain cases. It was felt it would be contrary to public policy to exclude the possibility of extradition for that limited range of offences. Accordingly, extradition was permitted for offences involving the use or threat of force, for example, maiming of customs officers, perjury, the forging of a document issued under statutory authority, for example, a birth certificate, or an offence committed by a Revenue office, for example, bribery, embezzlement of public funds etc. The 1965 Act did not contain a reference to customs. It is now included and will enable extradition to take place for offences involving the importation of prohibited or restricted articles which are not subject to duty.</P>
    <P>Section 3(<i>a</i>) of the 1994 Extradition (Amendment) Act made a further exception from the general prohibition on extradition for revenue offences. It excluded offences within the scope of article 3 of the 1988 drugs convention. Thus an offence within the scope of article 3, that is, illegal production of narcotic drugs, possession for the purpose of supply and so on of the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances done at Vienna on 20 December 1988 became an extraditable offence. The effect of the 1994 amendment was that the extradition of a person in connection with a drug offence covered by article 3 of the drugs convention could not be refused on the grounds that the offence in question was a revenue offence. This will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The political offence exemption has been substantially reduced over the years to the extent that it now covers only a very small number of cases such as treason and espionage. In Irish law, the Extradition (European Convention on the <Col N="1550" /> Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, and the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, have limited the exemption by excluding a large range of offences, including murder, explosives and firearms offences. The 1996 EU convention which the Bill will allow us to ratify repeats all the limitations in the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which were already enacted in the 1987 Act. In other words, the Bill makes no change to existing law relating to political offences.</P>
    <P>On simplified procedures and renunciation of speciality, the existing position is that almost all EU member states have some form of simplified procedures for extradition where the person sought consents. To date that is not the case with the possible exception of our backing of warrants system with the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I also understand that the original proposal was that a person who consented to simplified procedures would also automatically renounce the rule of speciality. On practical and policy grounds, it would seem desirable that the issues be kept separate as a person may wish to consent to return but not to renounce speciality, and the convention in the Bill so provides. While the previous position was that renouncing speciality was a state prerogative for the purposes of the 1995 convention, we see no objection to allowing individuals renounce speciality, subject to the safeguards of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 14 of the 1957 European convention, the state can give consent to the prosecution by the requesting state of an offence other than the offence for which the person was extradited, provided it is an extraditable offence. In the context of simplified procedures in the 1995 convention, renunciation of speciality before surrender is general and not linked to individual offences. Under the 1996 convention, a person may, after a surrender, renounce speciality for offences other than an offence to which the request was related. It may be in the interest of the person to have, for example, minor offences <Col N="1551" /> dealt with while he is in jail. He will be fully advised of his rights before he makes his decision and consent must be given in open court.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Ryan's points, not all European Union states have our level of liberties. With regard to investigative detention, extradition will not be allowed for this purpose. The arrest warrant also gives guarantees of this. This was a point I raised during the course of the discussion on the European arrest warrant in Brussels. It is true that, in certain European Union jurisdictions, there is provision for investigative detention whereby a person can be held during the course of an investigation of an offence. I sought to have this clarified and eventually succeeded in obtaining a declaration by Ireland to the effect that no individual would be extradited from this country for investigative detention and that an individual could only be extradited for the purpose of trial or detention to serve a term of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>At the request of Fianna Fáil Members of the Oireachtas, certain safeguards were inserted in the extradition legislation at the time to provide that the Attorney General would have to be satisfied that the individual being extradited had a case to answer and there was provision for the Minister for Justice of the day, which exists to this day, to intervene in a given extradition case and refuse extradition. I have seen files such as this on a number of occasions and, while I have not had occasion to intervene, <Col N="1552" /> the power still exists for the Minister to do so. These related to safeguards relating to extradition and did not relate to preventing people who should face criminal charges from being extradited.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello welcomed the restrictions on political offences and I am inclined to go along with him. The use of technology and new methods will be developed. With regard to civil liberties, the fact that there is a positive and negative list on the European arrest warrant means the test of dual criminality, while abolished in respect of those offences on the positive list, will still apply in reality because I cannot envisage any offences, or at least very few, which carry a term of three years imprisonment or more and which are an offence in another European Union state but do not constitute an offence here.</P>
      <P>I think I dealt with the worry about correspondence with regard to section 26 in the context of dual criminality. The act must be an offence in both states &ndash; here on the date of the request and in the other state at the time of commission and request. For example, as abortion is not a crime in the United Kingdom, extradition would not arise.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris welcomed the Bill, but he wondered about its political motivation. I dealt with that matter in my reply to Senator Ryan. Senator Cregan generally welcomed the legislation and was extremely constructive as was Senator Taylor-Quinn.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion provided by Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States</P>
      <P>a copy of which proposed measure was laid before Seanad Éireann on 11th day of December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that the House has been able to create space in a very busy Seanad schedule, to facilitate debate on this very important motion.</P>
      <P>Everybody here and every citizen we represent knows by now that the appalling atrocities committed in the United States on 11 September last have shocked the world into the realisation that internationally organised terrorism threatens us all. Before our eyes we saw the evil of terrorism strike, with devastating effect, at the heart of the most powerful nation on earth. The impact of this shock has been enormous. Those who suffered most, obviously, are the families and friends of the dead and injured &ndash; many of them Irish or with Irish connections. Apart from that, global business confidence has been shaken, international travel has been very significantly curtailed and, as we all know, a war is being waged in Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the 11 September attack.</P>
      <P>Another direct outfall of the 11 September attacks has been a very substantial acceleration in the evolution and development of proposals to counter international terrorism. The main purpose of this debate is to enable the House to debate two such proposals which have emerged in the recent past at EU level.</P>
      <P>Before I come to this proposal, it is appropriate that I say something about the pace and the range of activity taking place within the European Union Justice and Home Affairs area &ndash; commonly referred to as the third pillar area. The reality is that over the past while, the pace of third pillar activity has greatly exceeded activity levels in the first and second pillars. Respected independent experts have commented on this. In a recent article dealing with the area of freedom, security and justice, for example, Professor Monar of the Sussex University Institute has stated:</P>
      <P>The European Union has now entered the new millennium with a new major political project which future historians may well regard as another of these defining ventures: the creation of the &ldquo;area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ). Laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union it occupies the same rank as a fundamental treaty objective as, for instance, the implementation of a common foreign and security policy, the single market and economic and monetary union. Politically its longer term significance could be even greater than that of these earlier important projects because it is all about delivering a range of essential public goods to the citizens of the European Union. These include key issues of internal security and access to justice, areas which have historically played a central role in legitimising the build-up of public authorities and the creation of the modern state and which &ndash; much more so than, for instance, foreign and security policy matters &ndash; are of direct concern to citizens.</P>
      <P>He goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other example in the history of European integration of a policy-making area which made its way as quickly and comprehensively to the centre of the Treaties and to the <Col N="1555" /> top of the EU's policy-making agenda. Ten years ago, at the beginning of the 1990s, what was then called 'justice and home affairs' did not even exist as a policy-making area within the scope of the Treaties, and the limited co-operation between the member states which had been building up since the mid-1970s took place in a range of poorly co-ordinated intergovernmental groups which lacked adequate institutional structures, legal instruments and objectives. Today, after the Amsterdam reforms, the additional impetus given by the 1999 Tampere European Council and a broad range of legislation adopted or in preparation policy making in justice and home affairs has not only become a fundamental treaty objective but also one of the most dynamic and expansionist areas of EU development in terms of generating new policy initiatives, institutional structures and its impact on European and national actors.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September have added further impetus to the evolution and development of EU third pillar proposals. This, not surprisingly, imposes considerable pressure at both official and ministerial levels for countries such as ours with limited resources &ndash; we have to maintain pace with our EU partners, many of whom are much more heavily resourced than us. Apart from that, there is, and will be, additional pressure on national parliaments in respect of issues requiring parliamentary approval. Time pressures can mean that proposals will be brought to parliaments for approval when negotiations at EU level are either still in train or just barely concluded.</P>
    <P>The proposal which is the subject of the motion before the House has been the subject of discussion, and significant amendment, over the past two months and only came up for decision at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on Thursday and Friday last, with the objective of it being agreed at the JHA Council. Although the proposal came up for decision on Thursday and Friday last, there was still a significant level of debate resulting in further important amendments to the text &ndash; some made at Ireland's behest &ndash; in an effort to secure overall agreement. The result is that the Dáil and Seanad are being asked to debate texts the latest version of which only became available yesterday.</P>
    <P>My point in outlining the time pressures involved is not to suggest that Ireland is somehow being hard done by in having to deal with these matters at short notice &ndash; many of our EU partners have the same difficulties. My main point is that third pillar business is progressing, and is likely to progress for the future, in a way that will require us to look afresh at how we can, on the one hand, conduct business efficiently and effectively at EU level, while, on the other, also facili<Col N="1556" /> tate the necessary level of oversight and scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As it happens, agreement at the JHA Council proved elusive last week in relation to the European arrest warrant. I believe it is necessary, for reasons I shall outline when I come to the detail of the proposal, that the Taoiseach should be able to join the other EU heads of state or government this week in signalling his agreement to the European arrest warrant on the basis that the prior agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been secured.</P>
    <P>As to why this particular proposal and the motion on combating terrorism which will be debated later tonight came before the House at all, Senators will be aware of the provisions of Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by or under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 5º of this section and the second and fourth Protocols set out in the said Treaty, but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This provision was inserted largely on the basis of concerns which were expressed by the Labour Party. The understandable concern of the Labour Party in proposing the constitutional provision was that, in respect of certain matters on which the State could exercise an option or discretion, the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas should precede any ministerial agreement. Senators will be aware that several matters have come before the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.6º dealing with asylum, immigration and civil law matters.</P>
    <P>It has not, however, been the understanding that matters needed to be brought before the Houses where the relevant treaty provision referred to actions that fall to be taken by the EU Council of Ministers, as distinct from actions taken on the basis that they fall within the &ldquo;options or discretions&rdquo; open to the State. The practice in relation to proposals for framework decisions, for example, which fall to be decided by the JHA Council and involve the approximation of laws, is to seek the advice of the Attorney General as to whether any constitutional issues arise. If a constitutional impediment is identified, the practice is to seek to have the offending provision removed as a precondition to ministerial agreement.</P>
    <P>This procedure not only has the advantage of efficiency in dealing with JHA Council business, but ensuring that constitutional issues are identified and addressed before there is any agreement. Consistent with this approach, our EU partners, once they understood our constitutional difficulties, were invariably prepared to be accommodating in meeting those difficulties. Our partners have been accommodating also in <Col N="1557" /> relation to this proposal. Several provisions in the original draft proposal for a European arrest warrant gave rise to concern on constitutional grounds, but important adjustments have been made so that all but one of these have been fully addressed.</P>
    <P>I will return later to the one remaining issue on which a question might be raised as to constitutionality and I shall be commending the proposals as they now stand to the House. The point I want to make is that, by virtue of the fact that important constitutional issues arose in respect of one of the draft framework decisions now before the House, the Government has decided, having taken the advice of the Attorney General, that while it has not been the norm to refer proposals for Council framework decisions to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the better course for the future would be to bring all proposals for framework decisions before the Houses.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the proposed framework decision on the European arrest warrant, the European Council meeting in Tampere in October 1999 asked the Commission to bring forward a proposal for an arrest warrant. The Commission tabled its proposal in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. We discussed the proposed framework decision at the Joint Committee on European Affairs some weeks ago. There has been intensive negotiation since then and the text I have laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas represents what is likely to be the final shape of the decision. Fourteen of the member states, including Ireland, were able to indicate broad agreement to the proposals contained in the current text when the Justice and Home Affairs Council met on Thursday and Friday last week. I understand, following further direct bilateral contacts between the remaining member state and the Presidency, that the remaining member state is now also in a position to agree to the proposal as currently framed.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a European arrest warrant has at its core the concept of mutual recognition and respect for the judicial processes of the member states of the EU. Based on those concepts, the proposal seeks to simplify procedures to ensure a more efficient system of justice throughout the Union. Towards that end, it is proposed to replace among the member states the existing extradition arrangements based on the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition with a simplified surrender procedure. In essence, it replaces the inter-state aspects of extradition with an inter-court system. It is important to emphasise that the European arrest warrant applies between EU member states only and that existing arrangements with non-EU states will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Ireland accepted the need to review current systems in light of the new and devastating threat from international terrorism. However, it was <Col N="1558" /> also concerned to ensure that the basic safeguards to protect the individual's rights and liberties were adequately protected. A proper balance needed to be found between the need to protect society at large while retaining the long established safeguards that have been a feature of extradition law heretofore. I believe we have achieved that balance.</P>
    <P>The general rule set out in the framework decision provides that an arrest warrant may issue in respect of offences with a maximum penalty of at least one year's imprisonment. However, in the case of an offence on a positive list which carries a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment, the dual criminality requirement will not apply. The positive list I have referred to contains 32 of the most serious offences. These include hijacking, terrorism, murder, laundering the proceeds of crime, child pornography, firearms and explosives offences, illicit trafficking in drugs and radioactive materials, and, given our recent sad experiences, it will allow us to deal more effectively with illicit trafficking in humans.</P>
    <P>In the case of offences on the positive list, a warrant may issue based on the definition of the offence in the law of the requesting state. As I indicated, the dual criminality test will no longer apply to offences on the positive list where there is a maximum penalty of at least three years. That is to say, it will no longer be necessary for the court in the requested country to consider whether the offence on which the warrant is based is an offence in both the requesting and requested state. However, given the seriousness of the offences listed, it is highly improbable that we could be faced with a situation where we would be surrendering someone for conduct which, if it occurred in Ireland, would not be a serious offence here too. The requirement of dual criminality will, however, continue to apply to all other offences coming within the scope of the framework decision.</P>
    <P>The decision as now presented contains many safeguards. I was especially concerned that a person who had been surrendered should not be subject to investigative detention. That has been guaranteed. We have ensured that the proposed decision includes provisions ensuring that consideration is given to protection of the fundamental constitutional rights of the wanted person before he or she is surrendered. The rule of specialty, whereby the person may only be proceeded against for the offences specified in the warrant, is being retained. The consent of the individual and of the Minister will have to be given if the person is to be tried for other charges.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a person may be surrendered only in respect of offences committed in whole or in part in the requesting state; any attempt to pursue a person in respect of offences committed elsewhere will not be allowed. I sought to ensure throughout the negotiations that the indepen<Col N="1559" /> dence and discretion of the Judiciary in dealing with requests for surrender would be fully protected. This protection has been achieved. The framework decision also contains provisions ensuring that a person's right to free expression and free association are not interfered with.</P>
    <P>I believe the framework decision will enable the European Union to respond to the new threats while preserving the fundamental concepts and ideals of individual freedom and liberty. It enables us, together with our partners in the European Union, to play our part in protecting our citizens against the evils of international crime and terrorism while upholding and protecting those basic rights and freedoms that are so essential in a free and democratic society.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if I outlined in a little more detail the content of the draft framework decision. Chapter 1 covers Articles 1 to 9, inclusive, and deals with general principles. Article 1 makes clear that a warrant may issue only where there is an intention to prosecute or to execute a sentence, that is, it is not for investigative detention. I have succeeded in having a declaration inserted in order to avoid any possibility of ambiguity on that point as far as Ireland is concerned. This Article also provides that nothing in the proposed decision shall interfere with the obligation on member states to respect fundamental rights and legal principles. It is important that should appear in Article 1 as a basic principle.</P>
    <P>Article 2 is the fundamental part of the proposed decision, as it defines its scope. While the arrest warrant will apply to offences punishable by a minimum of 12 months in the issuing state, there is also set out what has been referred to as a positive list of major offences. The list contains 32 such offences. A major offence is one which attracts a penalty of a least three years' imprisonment. In the case of these major offences, the offence shall be as defined in the law of the requesting member states, but the critical point is that the court in the requested member state shall not apply the dual criminality test in such cases. This is a departure from current practice but, as I have indicated, we are very likely to find in practice that offences of the kind listed are in fact serious offences in all civilised societies. The dual criminality test will continue to apply to all offences other than those major ones to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to one aspect of the proposed framework decision where a question might be raised as to its implications, constitutionally, for Ireland. The issue arises in the context of the positive list to which I referred and the proposal that dual criminality should not apply where a person is sought for an offence on the positive list attracting a term of imprisonment of at least three years in the requesting state. The reliance on the definition of the offence in the law of the <Col N="1560" /> requesting state only, without any means of establishing the position in the law of the requested state in relation to the same set of events or circumstances, has the effect of ousting the dual criminality test for any such offence. The Attorney General has advised that, in the absence of Dáil and Seanad approval pursuant to Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution, an Irish court would be as likely as not to make a finding of unconstitutionality in such circumstances. Article 29.4.6º gives the appropriate constitutional protection against that risk, although even in the absence of Article 29.4.6º it should still constitute merely a risk, albeit a substantial one, since there is no conclusive case law on the point.</P>
    <P>Articles 3 and 4 set out mandatory and optional grounds on which a court in the requested state may refuse to execute a warrant. Between them, these Articles contain all the major reasons for non-execution of extradition requests under current law and practice. These grounds include, in addition to grounds related to dual criminality to which I have referred, situations where the person has benefited from an amnesty in the requested state, where he or she has already been tried for the offence in question or is currently being proceeded against, where he or she would not be held criminally responsible for the offence in the requested state, or where the person has been subject to a judgment in a third country for the offence in question. Article 4.7 ensures that the warrant may be refused where the offence took place in whole or in part in the requested state. It also ensures that a warrant may be refused if it relates to an offence committed outside the territory of the requesting state and the law of the requested state would not allow it to exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction for that offence.</P>
    <P>In addition to these grounds, Article 5 specifies guarantees to be given by the requesting state. It must provide the wanted person with a new hearing if he or she has been tried in absentia. It must give assurances about access to regular sentence reviews where a person is facing a life sentence. It also makes provision that sentences may be served in the person's own state of residence or nationality.</P>
    <P>Article 6 defines the judicial authorities, that is, the courts, as the relevant competent authorities for the issuing and execution of warrants. I draw the attention of Senators to this article because it marks the change from the inter-state nature of extradition as we have known it and replaces it with an inter-court system for the surrender of wanted persons. Article 8 provides that member states may designate central authorities to assist the judicial authorities. In Ireland, the central authority will be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Article 9 sets out the minimum content of an arrest warrant.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of the draft decision covers Articles <Col N="1561" /> 10 to 20, inclusive. The Chapter deals with surrender procedures. Articles 10 and 10a are concerned with means of transmitting warrants. Article 12 ensures that the arrested person has access to legal advice and, where necessary, to the facilities of an interpreter. Article 13 provides that while there is an obligation on the requested state to ensure the person remains available for surrender, it also provides that the person may, in the words of the text, be provisionally released. In our system, that means being released on bail.</P>
    <P>An arrested person may consent to surrender. He or she may also agree to revoke the rule of specialty. As I mentioned earlier, that rule ensures that a person may be proceeded against only in respect of the offences specified in the warrant. Article 14 ensures safeguards for the arrested person. It requires that there is a system in place to ensure that consent is given voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. In our case, that will mean giving the consent in open court and with access to legal advice. At the insistence of Ireland and some other member states, Article 14(4) makes clear that consent may be revoked, that is, a person may change his or her mind. All of these safeguards are designed to protect the person from undue pressure to consent.</P>
    <P>Article 15 provides that the court in the requested state may seek additional information and that if this is not forthcoming within a specified and relatively short time, the person is to be released. Article 16 provides guidelines for situations where there is a number of warrants from other member states or extradition requests from third countries in respect of the same person and a judgment is required as to the priority between those requests.</P>
    <P>Article 17 sets out timeframes for the taking of decisions by the courts on the execution of warrants. All member states recognised that it was important to ensure the new arrangements would result in faster and more streamlined arrangements. However, I had serious concerns about the very prescriptive approach taken in the initial drafts. I took the view that such an approach encroached on the independence and discretion of the courts. I have ensured, therefore, that the rigidity has been removed and we now have a set of target dates to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Articles 17a and 17b spell out the process to apply when a delay occurs in the surrender process. It provides that the person may be temporarily transferred to the requesting member state or may be interviewed in the requested state but in accordance with the law and practice of the requested state. In other words, interviews being conducted here would be carried out in accordance with Irish law and practice. Where a person has been transferred temporarily, he or she has the right to return to attend all hearings relating to him or her. I think it very unlikely that we will <Col N="1562" /> agree to temporary transfers as it may be seen as interfering with a person's rights of access to the courts and to legal advice.</P>
    <P>Article 17c deals with privileges and immunities. We are speaking here of immunities which certain office holders may enjoy. Article 17c provides for waiver of immunities and to deferment of surrender until the immunity has elapsed. Article 17d has been included to deal with situations where a person has been extradited to an EU member state by a non-EU state. It ensures that the conditions under which that person was extradited are respected. It is important that the Union acts in good faith towards third countries and that treaty obligations with third countries are respected. This Article will ensure all that.</P>
    <P>Article 18 sets out arrangements for the surrender of the wanted person following a decision of the court to execute the warrant. It provides that the surrender should take place as soon as possible and within ten days in instances where the person has consented to being surrendered. Importantly, it also provides that surrender may be delayed for humanitarian reasons or for reasons related to the person's health.</P>
    <P>Article 19 deals with cases where, although it has been decided to execute an arrest warrant, it is also necessary to continue with other proceedings under way in the requested state or to allow for the completion of a sentence already being served in the requested state. In such cases the requesting and requested state are required to come to an agreement on how to ensure the surrender takes place. Article 20 makes provision for transit through a third member state of a person being surrendered and specifies the information to be provided to the member state of transit.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 includes Articles 21 to 23 and is entitled &ldquo;Effects of the Surrender&rdquo;. Article 21 ensures that time spent in detention in the requested state while awaiting surrender is deducted from the sentence, if any, imposed in the requesting state.</P>
    <P>Article 22 deals with the important issue of specialty. As I mentioned, this term refers to the long established concept that a person may only be tried for the offences in respect of which or she was extradited or surrendered. That basic position is being maintained. However, it may be altered to the extent that the person agrees to waive the right to specialty and, as I said when dealing with Article 13, the giving of that consent has several safeguards attached to it. Specialty has long been viewed as something attaching to state sovereignty and, as a consequence, it is also necessary for the state that surrendered the person to give its consent to the rule of specialty being waived. In keeping with our view that this is a state rather than judicial function, I have ensured, by means of a special declaration, that in Ireland's case requests for the lifting of the rule <Col N="1563" /> will be dealt with by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as the central authority for Ireland, rather than the courts.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arises under Article 23 which deals with the possibility of the person being subject to further onward extradition to a third country. As in the case of specialty, all such requests in relation to persons surrendered initially by Ireland will have to be subject to the agreement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This protects Irish citizens in particular &ndash; we could not agree to having our citizens whom we had agreed to surrender to another member state being sent to another member state or third country without our agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 23a makes provision for the handing over of property accumulated as a result of or in connection with the person's alleged activities. There are safeguards in the article to ensure, for instance, that the rights of third parties in the property are secured.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 covers Articles 25 to 28. I should perhaps clarify the position on Article 24. This was in the initial text as a fundamental rights safeguard clause but following the inclusion of paragraph 3 in Article 1, it was felt that Article 24 was no longer necessary. Senators will recall that Article 1(3) provides that nothing in this proposed framework decision shall relieve member states of the obligations to protect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles.</P>
    <P>Article 25 states that the proposed framework decision is to replace all the extradition arrangements existing between member states. It might be useful to remind ourselves again that existing arrangements within non-EU states are not affected by the proposed framework decision. I would also like to point out an important feature in Article 25(2). It allows existing bilateral arrangements to continue. In this regard, the UK authorities have approached me with a view to having discussions about whether it would be more beneficial for the United Kingdom and Ireland to continue their existing bilateral arrangements or to rely on the European arrest warrant. I will keep the House informed of developments.</P>
    <P>Article 26 makes transitional arrangements. The new arrangements under this framework decision are due to come into operation in January 2004. Subject to the adoption of this decision, all member states will be required in the meantime to bring forth national legislation to implement the new system. That will be the case here in Ireland also. Article 27 makes provision for reports on the operation of the system, including reports to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I recommend the draft decision to the House. It is a balanced and measured response on the part of the member states of the European Union <Col N="1564" /> to a shocking and entirely unprecedented attack on world peace and stability. It provides a comprehensive set of safeguards for any individual subject to an arrest warrant while providing society at large with a new and effective means of dealing with a most serious threat to the well-being of our democratic systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome motion. Ireland signed up to the human rights convention of 1947 and agrees that the universal values of human dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, respect for human rights and fundamental freedom is essential to democracy, and anything that impinges on those fundamental rights is a major breach of the democratic process. Ireland condemns the recent terrorist activities that have had such a major impact on civil liberties, and any motion or legislation introduced to protect citizens throughout the European Union and beyond should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the convention on the suppression of terrorism adopted by the Council of Europe which establishes that terrorist offences cannot be regarded as political offences or as offences connected with political offences or as offences inspired by political motives. It is vital that this House records its approval of the convention, which is before the House in the form of this motion. The same principle applies in respect of the earlier Bill.</P>
      <P>The offences dealt with in the motion are important because they impact on the population at large or the general well-being or integrity of an individual. The offences, which include kidnapping, causing extensive destruction to aircraft, ships or means of public transport which in turn can impact on a large number of people, interfering with or disrupting water supplies, the release of dangerous substances and causing fires, explosions or floods, the effect of which is to endanger human life, relate specifically to the violation of the integrity of the individual and for that reason they are welcome.</P>
      <P>It is important also that those who incite, aid or attempt to aid anybody who proceeds to commit these offences will be covered under this legislation and can be brought to justice. The fact that there is a common procedure among member states is welcome. Member states will co-operate on these areas and various mechanisms will be available to each of them to allow them bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes. That is extremely welcome.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will elaborate in more detail on the section dealing with liability of legal persons because I am not sure what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of article 9 is welcome in that if an offence falls within the jurisdiction of more than one member state when any of the states concerned can validly prosecute on the basis of the same fact, the member states concerned shall co-<Col N="1565" /> operate to decide which of them will prosecute. It is important that in coming to that decision, the various mechanisms and facilities in each member state will be used to proceed to take the type of action that is necessary. Which member state shall be responsible is very clear and welcome.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate in more detail on article 10, which deals with the protection of victims. The article further states that in addition to the measures laid down in the framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, each member state shall, if necessary, take all measures possible to ensure appropriate assistance for victims' families. Will the Minister elaborate on what the Council of Europe decided in regard to appropriate assistance for victims' families because there are many such victims throughout Europe and the world? What do member states propose to do to assist victims' families? It is important that victims and their families are appropriately assisted in whatever action is taken.</P>
    <P>I note in the report from the Council of Europe that the Council reached provisional agreement on the text of the annex subject to parliamentary scrutiny reservations by the Swedish, Danish and Irish delegations and reconsultation with the European Parliament. Will the Minister elaborate on the reservations of the Irish delegation? What specific points did it make and what were the concerns raised by the delegation? Was the Irish delegation of the view that it could not implement something? I would like more detail on that.</P>
    <P>In the times in which we live it is extremely important that there is full co-operation among all EU member states and that they bring to justice those who commit terrorist offences across member states to justice. It is equally important that member states provide assistance to victims of terrorism from states outside member states, as well as victims of major human rights violations under the United Nations charter.</P>

      <P>I am sorry this important measure is being given such pathetic consideration. I have not read the document relating to it, although it has been placed in the Oireachtas Library where I presume it lies with EU regulations on cod, hake and monkfish. The Leader said on the Order of Business that the motion would be taken without debate, but now we find that it is absolutely vital that it should be debated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that arrangement related to these two motions. I thought it related to the previous legislation. I am sorry; I misunderstood the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" />This is an important EU proposal which the Minister stated will deal with human trafficking. I must travel to Moscow at the weekend for a UN conference on the trafficking of women and children. This is an extraordinarily important proposal and considerable time should have been made available to debate it because Ireland's contribution in this area is important. We introduced legislation regarding child pornography on the Internet and did well. Initially, when we said something should be done about it we were told no one would co-operate whereas nowadays everybody co-operates and most try to ensure their servers are clean. We are in a powerful position to take a lead on these issues.</P>
    <P>I am also sorry we cannot have a debate on the illicit trafficking of drugs and radioactive materials. I would also include biological substances such as toxins, bacteria and viruses, which can also be used as weapons. I have repeatedly referred to the 1972 UN convention on biological and toxic weapons under which there is no verification protocol. The United States continues to seek such verification in Iraq, but the protocol needs to be applied in every country. The United States is the first country to suffer problems related to bio-terrorism in the form of the recent anthrax attacks. It has been repeatedly suggested that the anthrax may have been brought in from outside, but there are approximately 80 facilities in the United States where it is available. Both the CIA and FBI have quelled fears that a flask of anthrax was given to one of the suspects involved in the 11 September attacks in the Czech Republic prior to the attacks. The possibility that it was of American origin is more likely.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in that an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of UN members, including Ireland, is trying to introduce a verification protocol to be included in the fifth review of the biological and toxic weapons convention, which is under way, but the Americans withdrew in July. There is, therefore, no possibility of introducing the protocol because unanimity is required. We could have asked the Minister to address this issue under the motion, but have not been given an opportunity because it is being rushed through. I do not know when the Taoiseach or the Minister is attending the committee and it is regrettable that most EU member states must also rush this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is an important measure to which we could have made a more important contribution if we had been in a position to debate it properly. I apologise to the Leader for saying the motion was to be agreed without debate, but that was my understanding this morning. I did not realise it had to be passed so quickly. We dealt with little business earlier in the week and it is a great pity the motion could not have been taken then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. The Minister has made the case on behalf of the Govern<Col N="1567" /> ment. I will provide time during the next session in order that Senators can discuss what is raised in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done a good job on many aspects of this issue. He appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and said he could only provide limited information for whatever reason, perhaps entirely valid, but he has dealt with many of the issues about which I had reservations in one form or another. I am not unhappy with the proposal. I must live with the reality that we live in the European Union, which our neighbouring island still calls the European Community, even though that title is ten years out of date. It must be recognised that we have to begin to realise where we are living. I do not have a fundamental problem, therefore, with the proposed measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government did a reasonable job in the negotiations, but I have serious reservations. It is 11.50 p.m. and we are discussing a fundamental change, which is not necessarily wrong or unwelcome, in an atmosphere where we all feel there is haste. I acquired the relevant document from the Oireachtas Library, the staff of which work hard and late, and it is 33 pages long. This framework decision must be transposed into Irish law through legislation. I take it from the Minister's somewhat enigmatic nod that I am correct.</P>
      <P>Through this motion we are giving the Taoiseach authority when he attends the Laeken Summit later this week to agree the framework decision. That is not a bad idea because we have processed too much EU business through a <i>post hoc </i>approval system. We are trying to persuade the sceptical element of the public that the European Union is transparent, accountable and open. A rushed debate at 11.50 p.m. about something as complex is this is not the way to do business. The Minister would love me to say I am opposed to this in order that he could point out that Deputy Howlin is in favour of it, but I will not go down that route. How could one oppose a framework decision when legislation will be introduced subsequently? When it is introduced we will be informed that we cannot amend it because it was agreed at Laeken in December 2001.</P>
      <P>A series of questions must be asked, however, about this measure. What does this phrase, which I have never seen before, mean: &ldquo;The following offences, if they are punishable in an issuing member state by a custodial sentence of a maximum of at least three years. . . &rdquo;? What is meant by &ldquo;a maximum of at least three years&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am good at dealing with legislation. I understand and can respond to it but I do not understand this. I understand a minimum of at <Col N="1568" /> least three years to mean that offences which carried sentences in excess of three were covered by it, which would be fine as we seek to exclude trivial offences. We do not want to extradite someone for stealing a loaf of bread while on holiday in the Canaries, for example.</P>
      <P>This illustrates the problem in rushing through legislation. I accept there will be a right of judicial intervention on both sides so that people will not be taken out of this country without some judicial oversight. As I have considerable regard for the Judiciary, I have no fundamental problem with this proposal. However, we must still know what this contradictory phrase means. I do not understand but I expect the Minister, who is a lawyer, to explain it.</P>
      <P>Without arguing with the Cathaoirleach, the allocation of only seven minutes to speak on such a complex subject makes my point precisely. I do not seek to waste time but this is too complex an issue to be rushed. Computer related crime is listed in the offences. This is an extraordinarily broad concept. Would we say typing or printing related crime? This measure should have been considered line by line by an Oireachtas committee. We hope to re-engage the people with the European project, but this is not the way to do it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate on the references to the immunities of office holders which is something we do not have. We know the circumstances in which one state declined to approve this initially before changing its mind yesterday after much pressure was applied. This leaves us in the position of not being sure if it has been approved or not. What is &ldquo;immunity of office holders&rdquo; as we, properly, have no such thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that I have only five minutes reflects the points made by previous speakers. It is not long enough to discuss something as fundamental as shifting the basis on which we deal with suspects in other jurisdictions in the European Union, making provision for European wide arrest warrants and changing the surrender procedure between states. As the Minister stated, the integration of policy making and the judicial process is one of the most fundamental developments to take place. If it had not been for the intervention of the Labour Party, as he acknowledged, the various articles and agreements would have been implemented by ministerial decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this the first step in getting approval and will legislation be introduced to incorporate these provisions in Irish law? What is the standing of the approval of a motion which incorporates various provisions? If legislation follows, both Houses of the Oireachtas will have already approved the substance of this Framework Document. Such legislation would merely put it into legal provisions. I assumed that we would pass the legislation and then orders or motions would <Col N="1569" /> be passed to implement its provisions. Is it being done in this way so that the Taoiseach can say to his European colleagues that we are good Europeans who are strong on combating terrorism?</P>
    <P>Are we surrendering or pooling our sovereign powers? We are surrendering them if different standards operate in different jurisdictions in the European Union, which is the case. The example has already been given of the medical procedure which is a crime carrying a 12 year sentence in our jurisdiction but which is not a crime in our neighbouring jurisdiction. We have different standards in the conduct and procedures of courts, of detention and interrogation and of imprisonment. These will all be of consequence if this motion is approved and European arrest warrants are issued.</P>
    <P>Serious questions must be addressed. I acknowledge the Minister's work in arguing Ireland's case, particularly our constitutional position on various issues. However, we can go too far too quickly in taking measures to deal with terrorism and other serious crimes. We agree with tackling these matters but to surrender the authority and jurisdiction of our State raises other fundamental issues. I would prefer to have the time to tease those out fully and to get a clear picture of how a European arrest warrant will operate. What protections will there be for individuals? There must be guidelines on its operation. We should have had more information and time in advance to study the Framework Document. This is an artificial deadline imposed because the Taoiseach wishes to make a splash when he next meets his colleagues in Europe.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators from both sides of the House who contributed to this debate. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to Article 10 and asked about the protection of victims. There is a separate EU legal instrument on this matter. In the framework decision on combating terrorism it does not arise under the European arrest warrant. I will be glad to provide a copy of the instrument on the protection of victims. She also referred to article 7, liability of legal persons. This is in the terrorism instrument which the House will be discussing immediately after this debate. Senators Taylor-Quinn and Henry referred to the whole question of parliamentary scrutiny. On the Irish reservation on parliamentary scrutiny I was concerned to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to examine these matters, albeit at short notice. I have also indicated that in future the framework decisions will come to the Oireachtas. The time element will be a tremendous difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know already that the Irish Constitution provides that where we are talking about the State entering into discretions or options there is an obligation on us to discuss these matters in the Houses of the Oireachtas. If the measures are <Col N="1570" /> necessitated by our membership of the European Union, it is a different matter and it is covered by a different provision of the Constitution. When we are discussing discretions or options such as a framework decision of this nature there will be a difficulty in relation to time.</P>
    <P>Invariably, the Justice and Home Affairs Council under the third pillar will discuss the relevant proposals. They may or may not reach agreement. If they reach agreement, the matter can be referred to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the usual way. In doing this the Minister of the day would be obliged to state to the European Council that he cannot accede or agree to the actual text until such time as he has the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Therefore, I suppose that in the future what will occur is that the Minister of the day will signify political agreement to the text or framework decision and then the matter will come to the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister entering a parliamentary reservation at the Council meeting.</P>
    <P>If the parliamentary reservation presented at the Council meeting subsequently proves to be more than a mere formality and should the Houses of Parliament or either one of them decide to negate the framework decision, it would not be possible for the Minister to proceed. This will be innovative in terms of parliamentary scrutiny of agreements reached at European level which Senator Ryan correctly states may well be long overdue, but it will cause very serious and practical difficulties. If, for example, in the context of the framework decision we are discussing here or the European arrest warrant, there was political agreement in relation to it at the European Council meeting of justice and home affairs Ministers last Thursday and Friday in Brussels&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know why. The story advanced was that they did not agree with the list of offences. They thought that the list of offences specified in the warrant was much too exhaustive. The truth of the matter is that it left us in this position that we bring our framework decision here and let us say that Italy still had a reservation. The Taoiseach will go to Laeken on Friday and he must be in a position to signify or confirm Ireland's agreement following upon the ratification by this and the other House. If Italy was still to enter a reservation and had not pulled back in this regard this morning, it is fair to say that when the Taoiseach goes to Laeken and if there was a substantive change to the text at <Col N="1571" /> Laeken, it would have to come back again to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make here is that the time factor that will be involved in this is something that we will have to resolve. We must co-operate across all the political spectrum and with the Independents in the House and the other House so that we can reach the necessary consensus on how these things can be dealt with in the future. We have a problem which we need to solve.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan. This is a healthy democratic development which means that in the future we will discuss the framework decisions in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will give a greater level of credibility and confidence to the framework decisions if the people's representatives discuss them.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked what the position was in relation to maximum and minimum.</P>

      <P>I suppose the straight answer is that the minimum, the lowest level, must be three years or, to put it another way, the lowest level of the maximum sentence must be three years. This concept is a means of developing harmonisation between various legal systems or, to put it another way, when we use the words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; in terms of longevity, maximum becomes the equivalent of minimum. That is the only way I can explain it to Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>The JHA Council, in welcoming the proposal, emphasised the need for a common understanding of what terrorism means in order to facilitate cross-border co-operation. The Council also instructed senior officials to forward work urgently so as to enable the Council to achieve significant political agreement at its meeting last week. The European Council, meeting on 21 September, endorsed that approach signifying, in particular, its agreement to the adoption of a common definition of terrorism and asking the JHA Council to flesh out that agreement. Work has been taken forward within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union on the proposed framework decision. That work has been undertaken in the main by the co-ordinating article 36 committee and COREPER. It also involved two further meetings of the JHA Council, on 16 October and 16 November, prior to last week's meeting on 6 and 7 December. Negotiations continued right up to and during that Council meeting at which political agreement was achieved on the text in the terms in which it has been laid before this House.</P>
      <P>It also involved two further meetings of the JHA Council, on 16 October and 16 November, prior to last week's meeting on 6 and 7 December. Negotiations continued right up to and during that Council meeting at which political agreement was achieved on the text in the terms in which it has been laid before this House. That agreement is provisional in that the text is subject to parliamentary scrutiny reservations by Sweden and Denmark, as well as Ireland, and there is also to be reconsultation of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed framework decision is to approximate member states' legislation on terrorism in accordance with article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, thus facilitating co-operation between member states at a <Col N="1573" /> number of levels. Article 34(2)(b) provides that the Council may, acting unanimously on the initiative of any member state or of the Commission, adopt framework decisions for the purpose of the approximation of the laws and regulations of the member states. It also provides that framework decisions shall be binding upon the member states as to the result to be achieved but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods and that they do not entail direct effect.</P>
    <P>The proposed framework decision on combating terrorism will approximate member states' legislation, in particular, by establishing a common definition of a terrorist act and laying down common criminal sanctions. The provisions, which it makes for this purpose, are explicitly stated in article 1b as not being intended to amend the obligation to respect the fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles enshrined in article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The proposed framework decision accordingly provides as follows.</P>
    <P>Article 1 defines a terrorist act by reference to specified conduct as defined as offences under national law and when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population, unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation. The conduct specified in the article represents the types of acts traditionally associated with acts of terrorism and includes, for example, attacks upon a person's life which may cause death, attacks upon the physical integrity of a person, kidnapping and hostage taking, causing extensive destruction to a Government or public facility, a transport system or an infrastructure facility, seizure of aircraft, ships or other means of public or goods transport, the manufacture, possession, acquisition, transport, supply or use of weapons, explosives or of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, the release of dangerous substances etc. Threatening to commit such offences is also covered. Member states will be required to take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist offences under domestic law include such offences.</P>
    <P>Article 1A provides that certain other offences, aggravated theft, drawing up false administrative documents and extortion are to be regarded as terrorist linked offences when undertaken for the purpose of committing one of the terrorist acts to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Article 2 deals with offences relating to a terrorist group and provides for acts consisting of directing a terrorist group or knowingly participating in the activities of a terrorist group. It will require member states to ensure that these offences are also punishable. Member states will also be required by article 3 to make inciting, or aiding or abetting an offence referred to in articles 1 or 2 punishable as well as attempting to <Col N="1574" /> commit offences covered by articles 1 and 1A with certain limited exceptions.</P>
    <P>Article 4 deals with the penalties which terrorist offences and terrorist linked or related offences should attract. The core principle is set down in Article 4(1), which provides that member states shall ensure that the offences concerned are to be punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties. That article further provides that terrorist offences, including attempting to commit such offences or aiding, abetting or inciting their commission, should be punishable by custodial sentences heavier than those imposed under national law for similar offences committed in the absence of the special intent required by Article 1, that is the intent to seriously intimidate a population, unduly compel a Government etc. That requirement will not apply, however, where sentence imposed under national law is already the maximum possible sentence, which would be the case for us where an offence attracts a possible life sentence.</P>
    <P>Article 4 also requires member states to provide that the offence of directing a terrorist group is punishable by a maximum custodial sentence of not less than 15 years, except where it relates only to threatening to commit terrorist offences in which case the maximum penalty is to be not less than eight years. The offence of knowingly participating in a terrorist group is also to be punishable by a maximum penalty of not less than eight years. There is a related provision in article 6, which will enable, but not require, member states to provide that the maximum penalties to which I have referred will not apply in circumstances where the offender renounces terrorist activity and provides certain specified assistance to the judicial or administrative authorities.</P>
    <P>I referred to Article 1b and the provision it makes to the effect that the proposed framework decision is not intended to have the effect of amending the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Senators will recall in this regard that article 6 of the Treaty refers, <i>inter alia,</i> to the fact that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, and requires the Union to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to member states.</P>
    <P>Article 7 provides for offences committed by legal persons and will require member states to ensure that such persons can be held liable for terrorist offences etc. committed for their benefit by certain persons connected to them.</P>
    <P>Article 8 provides that, as with natural persons, penalties for legal persons must also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in the case of legal persons and may include fines and other penalties.</P>
    <P>Article 9 will require member states to estab<Col N="1575" /> lish jurisdiction over offences covered by the proposed framework decision in circumstances where the offence is committed in whole or in part on its territory, on board a vessel flying its flag or an aircraft registered in the state involved, the offender is one of its nationals or residents, the offence has been committed for the benefit of a legal person established in its territory, or the offence has been committed against the institutions or people of the member state in question or against an institution of the European Union or an EU body based in the member state, and in respect of any case in which extradition has been refused. Member states may also take jurisdiction in respect of offences dealt with in the proposed framework decision committed in other member states. Provision is made for co-operation between member states where more than one member state has jurisdiction with a view to deciding in which member state proceedings may most appropriately be taken.</P>
    <P>Article 9 will require member states to ensure that they have jurisdiction in respect of offences relating to a terrorist group, that is, directing or knowingly participating in a terrorist group, or inciting, aiding and abetting and attempting to commit terrorist offences where such offences have been committed in whole or in part within its territory and irrespective of where the terrorist group is based or pursues its criminal activities.</P>
    <P>Article 10 deals with the position of victims and is intended to supplement the proposed framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings by requiring all appropriate assistance to be provided to the families of victims as well as providing that the investigation or prosecution of an offence covered by the proposed framework decision should not be dependent on a report or accusation made by a person subjected to the offence at least in circumstances where that offence has been committed in the territory of the member state.</P>
    <P>Article 11 will require member states to take the necessary measures to comply with the proposed framework decision by 31 December 2002 and provides for the Council to assess the manner in which member states have implemented the measure by 31 December the following year. Article 12 provides for the coming into force of the proposed framework decision following its publication in the Official Journal of the EC.</P>
    <P>I envisage implementation of the proposed framework decision being achieved by way of primary legislation, which will be brought before the House in the coming year. I intend that legislation will, in addition to addressing the specific requirements arising from the proposed framework decision itself which I have already outlined, also be directed to making any further changes to our law judged necessary for the purposes of dealing with international terrorism. I do not consider that the implementing legislation should present difficulties. Ireland's experience in combating terrorism means that our existing <Col N="1576" /> legislation in this regard is more comprehensive than the provisions of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September represented a defining moment for the world in which we live. Few events have demonstrated so starkly the choice between good and evil as the attacks perpetrated that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania by the forces of international terrorism. I am determined that Ireland will respond decisively and comprehensively to the challenge which those events represent and that will be my aim in framing the legislative proposals needed to give effect to the proposed framework decision and related issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I again welcome the Minister and I welcome the motion. I welcome his statement that he will introduce primary legislation early next year to cover the details outlined in this framework of the European Council. It is vitally important that a common framework is in place and that there is full co-operation between member states to ensure terrorists are pursued and brought to justice and that the full rigours of the law apply to them. It is also important that we, as a democratic state, fully recognise, appreciate and value the important elements of democracy, particularly human dignity, liberty, freedom of movement and speech and equality regardless of race, class, creed or sex. That is essential for a basic democratic state. It is enshrined in all the European Union treaties and conventions we have signed as a member of the European Union and in the Constitution. I welcome anything which extends that framework. It is vitally important that we improve the position of people and their quality of life.</P>
      <P>I note that the motion outlines the specific details of what is a terrorist offence. We have seen such terrorist actions. The events of 11 September are repeatedly given as an example, but we did not have to wait until then. Serious offences constantly take place in Third World countries and EU member states are indirectly involved. A number of EU member states, particularly France and Italy, manufacture landmines and other weaponry which are used in Third World countries. The Minister needs to address this issue. While it is fine to say it is a wonderful economic Union which has developed democratically, we have moral responsibilities to the less well-off. The Minister should raise the issue at every opportunity with his fellow Ministers in Europe, particularly those from Italy and France which indirectly violate fundamental human rights in countries outside the European Union. There is not any room for duplicity. It is highly commendable that all member states will sign up to this and introduce legislation to deal with it. However, it is hypocritical for them to do so while indirectly providing ammunition and weapons which violate people's integrity and freedom. We should call a spade a spade. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specifics of the motion, subsequently intro<Col N="1577" /> duced in legislation, are highly commendable. Although we are a small member state, the Minister has a moral authority given that we have proven our effectiveness in the United Nations. While complying with EU declarations and conventions, he might encourage the United States to fully respect the United Nations charter and not to breach elements of it, particularly in terms of conducting warfare in Iraq, as we heard on the news recently. These issues must be addressed. Like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister has a role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome subsection (5) of Article 9 which deals with jurisdiction and prosecution. It states that the article should not exclude the exercise of jurisdiction in criminal matters as laid down by a member state in accordance with its national legislation. That is important. During the previous debate I requested the Minister to outline the measures under Article 10 which would be provided to protect and assist victims. It states that each member state shall, if necessary, take all measures possible to ensure appropriate assistance for victims' families. Perhaps the Minister could do this when he introduces the legislation early next year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general tenor of the motion and hope all member states ratify it. It is vitally important that due process is administered across the board. I hope the simplification of procedures does not diminish the protection of constitutional rights of all members of the European Union. Fundamental freedoms are important and must be protected by the rule of law and the administration of justice. It is important to ensure that occurs. Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on the reservations of the Irish delegation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have divided views on the legislation. I notice there is an inflated rhetoric at the end of the Minister's speech which states that &ldquo;the events of 11 September represented a defining moment for the world in which we live. Few events have demonstrated so starkly the choice between good and evil as the attacks perpetrated that day in New York.&rdquo;  I am not sure the contrast is that stark. I listened to President Bush making that point, but the actions of the United States subsequently have called this into question, particularly when it has engaged in bombing a prison, when Donald Rumsfeld has spoken about taking no prisoners and military tribunals which carry the death penalty and seriously restrict the rights of citizens engaged in those courts have been established in the United States. I am worried about this. When the President said the reason the United States was attacked was because it was a beacon of democracy, I also raised a question mark. I am not anti-American, but reserve the right to question American foreign policy. That can clearly be done.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the terms under which the Minister introduced the legislation, he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 1 defines a terrorist act by reference to specified conduct as defined as offences <Col N="1578" /> under national law and when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population, unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.</P>
    <P>Are the hands of the West completely clean? There is a list of criteria which we should apply to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Let us take the beam from our eye. Let us look, for example, at the situation in East Timor. Documents have emerged this week which indicate that Kissinger was involved. Are we comfortable with this? Was it terrorism? Was the carpet bombing of Kampuchea, a non-combatant in the Vietnam war, an act of terrorism against a civilian population? Who was responsible? Will Kissinger be arraigned before an international war crimes tribunal? </P>
    <P>We talk about attacks upon a person's life which may cause death. I am a strong supporter of the state of Israel but, unfortunately and most regrettably, the blanket term &ldquo;terrorism,&rdquo; which can be applied to any community as an easy method of targeting them, has been used unscrupulously by the government of Mr. Sharon to attempt to legitimise what is called targeted assassination. That is regarding murder as a legitimate arm of foreign policy. Is this something we should also question? </P>
    <P>As regards causing extensive destruction of a Government or public facility, let us look again at the Middle East. I am concerned that the inflated rhetoric in which, regrettably, the Minister has indulged will assist unscrupulous regimes in using the label &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; to target people's human rights in these countries. This is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>Will there be an investigation, under these terms, into the School of the Americas where death squads were trained in the USA? If we are to seriously address the question of terrorism we must establish a level playing field. If principles are involved, they have to be extended not only to the people we are comfortable to have as our allies, but also to protect the human rights of citizens within countries with which we disagree.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see there were difficulties in defining &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;. Ireland could make a contribution in that regard. One can make a stab at defining &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; by saying that it refers to the attempt by a government or an individual to use the fear of physical force or physical force in order to induce a change in government policy. I am sure it would be possible, given the legal minds in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to come up with such a definition. It is late at night and I am happy to share time with my colleague, Senator Henry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Norris said. It is very worrying that yesterday's terrorists are today's very best friends and that words out of some mouths are considered an incitement to <Col N="1579" /> violence but out of others are considered peaceful. I am delighted that the matters of biological and chemical weapons and the release of dangerous substances have been raised. I hear that whoever is in the Tora Bora caves may be smoked out and, if they are, it will surely be through the use of chemical weapons. Will we criticise that? I certainly would.</P>
      <P>In talking about people aiding, abetting and inciting the commission of various criminal activities which have been described as terrorist offences, we should be careful about the use of phrases like &ldquo;elimination of people&rdquo;. Does that refer to their assassination and does it mean that the law can be taken into the hands of the person with the gun in their hand? Senator Norris pointed out that it was said that no prisoners would be taken and this morning I heard Mr. Rumsfeld asked if prisoners taken by British soldiers would be handed over to the USA. In the EU we do not normally hand over people to countries which still impose the death penalty. Mr. Rumsfeld said that British troops would not be in a position to take any prisoners, which is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>There now exists the offence of directing a terrorist group which is punishable with a maximum custodial sentence. Those who have been recognised as members of what could hardly be described as the legitimate government are from the Northern Alliance, which was a terrorist group one day and people we could aid and abet the next. Surely they are little better than the unsavoury Taliban, a group which was recognised as the government so that it could be fought.</P>
      <P>It is very unfortunate that we cannot debate this more. It is close to inhuman and degrading treatment of legislators that we have to debate the European Convention on Human Rights at 12.35 a.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything my two colleagues said. While nobody, in principle, could disagree with what is in the declaration, an act of monumental hypocrisy is being perpetrated by the EU. I do not include Ireland in that accusation yet. I have been in Brussels and heard senior officials of the Commission and the Parliament say they wanted to put together a European arms industry which could compete with the United States of America. They want to sell arms to the world and we all know that means selling arms to anybody who wants to buy them. If they do not like the Government or the agency involved, the arms are sold through a third party. If the EU, the USA, Russia and China are serious about ending terrorism, the first thing they must <Col N="1580" /> do is deal with the arms trade. Until that is done, this is an exercise in monumental hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>I am not accusing the Minister and I do not want to make a political issue of this, but if we do not deal with the international arms trade, then all this is as hypocritical as failing to deal with the reprocessing of nuclear waste. Anything prohibiting people from putting together weapons of mass destruction is an act of monumental hypocrisy because it says to people that while they must not do this, we will continue making money out of preparing the raw materials from which such weapons can be made. We must make up our minds, once and for all. The arms industry is immoral and profoundly inefficient. However, with the mere seven minutes allotted to me, I do not want to spend all my time on that matter.</P>
      <P>Nobody could disagree with the declaration in principle, but one can argue about many of the phrases in it, as my colleagues have done. I have an argument with Article 1 on page six of the draft declaration. It refers to terrorist offences, but subsection (d) is blank. The Houses of the Oireachtas should not pass draft declarations which have gaps in them. Paragraph 3(d) contains five dots in parenthesis. I am not being trivial; this is the wrong way to approach this matter. We should have a draft which excludes things which are excluded and which does not include things that do not exist. If we are to have parliamentary scrutiny, as we should, it ought to be parliamentary scrutiny of real documents and not rough drafts which will have to be amended. The bracketed dots will have to be taken out of the declaration, yet the Oireachtas will have already given its approval. We ought to conduct our business better, something I have said repeatedly.</P>
      <P>The first paragraph on page 5 of the declaration is described as paragraph 0, which means it was thought up after the rest of the declaration had been drafted. That is not the way we should do business. I do not care that it is called &ldquo;paragraph 0&rdquo;, but it should not be there. It should have been written properly. At the end of the page paragraph 11 refers to actions by armed forces during periods of armed conflict governed by international humanitarian law and which are not covered by the declaration. In referring to action by armed forces of a state in the exercise of official duties, is a distinction being made between armed forces and armed forces of the state or is it giving implicit recognition to paramilitary forces in countries where democracy has been suppressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question relates to Article 9 about which I am confused, although that could be because of the lateness of the hour or any number of reasons. Does it relate to terrorism within the European Union or terrorism generally? There is no justification for anyone to use any of the devices listed as terrorist offences in any country of the European Union. There never has been nor will there ever be as long as they have been and continue to be democracies. I could argue about the quality of democracy in many member <Col N="1581" /> states, but, ultimately, there is no justification for the use of such devices.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, circumstances are entirely different in Saudi Arabia, Burma or a dozen different countries, and I am not prepared to say that people are not entitled to use the methods the people of this country used to achieve liberation from a system of government which was not one in which they chose to be involved. We should not say to others that they must behave in a different way from the way we did.</P>
    <P>I am glad one of the draft Council statements asserts, correctly, that nothing in this measure should be construed as criticising the conduct of those who have acted in the interests of preserving or restoring democratic values, such as was done in some member states during the Second World War. It is a pity the Minister did not mention this because it is important. They could now be considered terrorists, whereas they were not. Members of the French, Italian and Danish resistance were not terrorists. Let us be very careful about this. The horrors of 11 September were terrorism, but it is extremely important not to be drawn into a position where people who take up arms to resist tyranny are also classified as terrorists. Will the Minister assure me that this legislation applies to criminal acts conducted within the jurisdiction of the European Union and no more?</P>

      <P>Taking up the final point made by Senator Ryan, one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. That is the way it has been through the centuries. One will find as many people in the Muslim world who regard Americans as terrorists as one will find people in the western world who regard Osama bin Laden and the Taliban as such. It is a highly emotive and subjective matter and has a great deal to do with social and individual circumstances in a country at a certain time. At the foundation of the State the original Sinn Féin organisation was described as terrorist. In the recent conflict certain sections of various communities would have regarded the party as a terrorist organisation while others would have regarded it as a freedom movement. The various images of Bobby Sands throughout the world demonstrate that the latter impression has been transmitted. Even the Minister's party was described by Seán Lemass as slightly constitutional in its origins and formation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very difficult issue to define. Who will say the activities of the United States have not been terrorist in nature? There are people in many countries throughout the world who would say that. In Chile it helped eliminate a democratically elected Government, it invaded the little country of Grenada, the CIA attempted to overthrow the Administration in Cuba, and the American Government's activities in Cambodia attempted to bring it into the Vietnam War. Now a very simplistic approach has been taken to the issues in Afghanistan. Many in other jurisdictions would describe the actions of the United States <Col N="1582" /> as terrorism. I am certainly not anti-American, but it is very difficult to say what is and what is not terrorism.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one or two minor issues relating to the document. Regarding the list of activities in Article 1 described as terrorist offences, I am fascinated by Article 1(h) which concerns the release of dangerous substances which might endanger human life. Dangerous substances have been released from Sellafield for many years. It is a potential timebomb on our doorstep. The legislation goes on to state that we can go a step further in terms of jurisdiction and the prosecution of offences in that each member state may extend its jurisdiction where an offence has been committed in whole or in part in the territory of another member state of the European Union. If we sign up to this and can extend our jurisdiction to another member state if the offence has been committed in its territory, and if the offence in question is the release of dangerous substances, something which has often occurred through the extreme neglect and negligence of British Nuclear Fuels Limited, can we make a case that this is covered by the framework decision document and seek remedy by prosecution? That would certainly be very valuable.</P>
    <P>It is a shame we must discuss something as fundamental as this in this manner. This is at the heart of the response to the events of 11 September, and how we deal with it is extremely important. We saw how the Offences Against the State Act was abused by extending it to include so-called linked offences. Something like this framework decision document deserves a thorough teasing out and discussion which we cannot possible give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on this important motion. I am gratified, although not surprised, by the consensus on the need for concerted, strong and effective action to counteract international terrorism to ensure that to the greatest possible extent the horrific scenes we witnessed on 11 September are never repeated. This proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism is proof of the ability of European Union member states to act together in a decisive manner to uphold democratic values common to us and to further the Union's stated aim of creating an area of freedom, security and justice for all its citizens. Unfortunately, we, in Ireland, have had long experience of dealing with terrorism. We have been able to contribute, therefore, in a positive way to the development of this framework decision. It has helped us to develop these proposals into effective tools which can be used against those who engage in or assist terrorism.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to enact legislation to give effect to this proposed framework decision in due course. As I indicated, this should not present great difficulties as Ireland's legislation is very comprehensive as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" />In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, this House passed the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act which in legal terms represented a significant enhancement of the previous offences against the State legislation. In moral terms it represented our determination to protect lives and democracy itself. It is the case that the capacity of the criminal law to respond to atrocities such as that in Omagh is kept under constant review in the light of experience, and the Government will not hesitate in bringing to this House further proposals it considers necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposed framework decision is only one measure, albeit a significant one, taken at European level to combat terrorism. The European Council held an extraordinary meeting on 21 September to consider measures to progress the fight against international terrorism and set out a plan of action which included the introduction of the European arrest warrant, a measure already discussed, and also the adoption of a common definition of &ldquo;terrorism.&rdquo;  The Government is satisfied that these measures strike an appropriate balance between taking strong action against terrorism and at the same time ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.</P>
    <P>The attacks on the United States on 11 September were unprecedented. They force civilised societies to think again about the measures, legislative and others, in place to deal with the scourge of terrorism. Rarely has the choice between good and evil been put into such stark relief as by the attacks carried out that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania by the forces of international terrorism with their consequent tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that Ireland is determined with our partners in the European Union to frame a decisive and effective response to those who would perpetrate such attacks. That would be the aim in framing the legislative proposals needed to give effect to this proposed framework decision and related issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the question of arms control. Ireland has a long and proud tradition on the international stage in promoting disarmament, notably at UN level. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the decommissioning of arms on our own island. Ireland continues at every opportunity to keep the issue of the arms trail proliferation in all weapons at the top of the agenda. In regard to article 10 and the whole question of victims, to which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred, the framework decision on the standing of victims, which I have undertaken to provide, makes a range of provisions to respect the status of the victim of an offence in criminal proceedings, for example, providing information on proceedings to the victim and encouraging support mechanisms and so on. The full details are in the instrument which I will provide to the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the situation outside the European Union. The issues he raised go far <Col N="1584" /> beyond the terms of this framework decision. This instrument deals with terrorist offences committed in the territory of an EU state. He referred also to the ills of the world. I would not suggest, nor would any Senator, that this measure is a panacea for all ills in all countries by all actions at all times. However, what we must seek to do is to take effective and achievable action where it is possible for us to do so, that is, in the European Union.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Ryan, paragraph 11 of the preamble refers to armed forces. These are armed forces of the member states of the EU. No Ireland forces are envisaged. With regard to the textual corrections, there is a time factor involved which is undesirable. This is a JHA Council document which was discussed as late as last week. I agree with the Senator that it is not ideal. It will have to be tidied up by the Council secretariat in due course. If there were to be substantive change to the actual text, it would have to return here, but this would not relate to technical changes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the framework decision, it can only be utilised in the fight against terrorism, not in relation to other matters. We discussed the issues referred to by Senator Costello, the question of one man's terrorist being another man's freedom fighter. I recall saying at a Council meeting that it is even true that one man's beer is another man's water. The Council stated that the framework decision on the fight against terrorism covers acts which are considered by all member states of the European Union as serious infringements of their criminal laws committed by individuals whose objective constitutes a threat to their democratic societies' respect for the rule of law and civilisation upon which these societies are founded. It has to be understood in this sense and cannot be construed so as to argue that the conduct of those who have acted in the interests of preserving or restoring these democratic values, as was notably the case in some member states during the Second World War, could now be considered as terrorist acts, nor can it be construed so as to incriminate on terrorist grounds a person exercising his or her fundamental right to manifest his or her opinions, even if in the course of the exercise of such right, he or she commits offences. This obviously was to preserve the right to freedom of expression of opinion, the right, for example, to protest and obviously the right of assembly in that respect.</P>
    <P>I reject Senator Costello's assertion that the passing of these framework decisions is in some way related to the Taoiseach deciding to go on some glory trail &ndash; far from it. If Senator Costello was aware of the amount of work which the Taoiseach and the Government put into these framework decisions in the interest of Ireland's people and Ireland's standing internationally, he would know that such comments are misguided.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators across the spectrum for the constructive manner in which these framework decisions have been discussed. I realise the cir<Col N="1585" /> cumstances under which we are discussing them is not ideal. The committee of Europe will have to sit down one of these days to see whether it can arrive at a framework for framework decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of Senator Norris regarding the insertion of &ldquo;including duly qualified psychiatrists&rdquo;. It should not be necessary to include this amendment because psychiatrists are registered medical practitioners. On Committee Stage in the Dáil the Minister said that they could not or would not perform medical procedures. That is not correct because they would be capable of doing medical procedures. Psychiatrists should not be ruled out just because their professional expertise is psychiatry. They all undergo general medical training and are capable of undertaking medical procedures. I would not like to think they were ruled out due to any consideration of incompetence nor would I like to think they were ruled out because they were untrustworthy and more likely to acquiesce to promoting a situation where a woman's life was in danger.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right in saying that psychiatric illness is not as measurable as blood pressure or haemoglobin levels, but psychiatrists have a skill in assessing the mental health of the person they are dealing with. It is important to remember also that psychiatrists must be the advocates of their patients, particularly if they are seriously ill. This needs to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychiatrists are only too well aware of the reaction there will be in a woman with serious mental illness who becomes pregnant and from whom psychotropic drugs have to be withdrawn because of the effect they would have on the developing foetus. In some cases this can be so serious that the woman could become suicidal because of the <Col N="1586" /> withdrawal of the drugs and this should be taken into account when we consider the role of the psychiatrist. Psychiatrists will not simply promote the idea that a person is suicidal. The person may become suicidal because the psychiatrist has had to withdraw the drugs.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris has felt it essential to bring forward the special position of psychiatrists but I would like to point out that at the same time they are equal members of the medical profession. They are registered medical practitioners and they should not be considered more likely to acquiesce to abortions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her support. She can speak with direct experience of the medical profession. It is invidious to create a kind of two-tier system within the medical profession suggesting that psychiatrists are in some way more amenable to the idea of abortion or less trustworthy. The excellent briefing I was given from the Well Woman Centre raises the question by saying that it is unclear whether psychiatrists are included under the definition of medical practitioner. I have attempted to be helpful by making it clear and by specifying that they are so treated under the provisions of this Bill. Will the Minister explain to the House whether psychiatrists are considered medical practitioners under this Bill and whether this extension is redundant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was extensive debate on that and we agreed to disagree and voted on it. This moves on to the definition of medical practitioner. The objective of the amendment appears to be to make the opinion of a psychiatrist a valid basis for the termination of a pregnancy. That would be the obvious implication of the amendment. In the proposed legislation the definition of medical practitioner clearly refers to the practitioner who undertakes a medical intervention in the course of which, or as a result of which, unborn human life is ended as in section 1(2). The speciality or the designation of the practitioner concerned is not specified in the Act and no such group of practitioners is explicitly excluded.</P>
      <P>That said, the amendment proposed by Senator Norris will explicitly bring psychiatrists within the scope of the definition. That would not be appropriate given that in essence then, although I know this is not what he intends as this is linked to his previous position on the suicide issue, the impact or import of the amendment would be that a psychiatrist would get legal cover to undertake a surgical or medical procedure proper to a practitioner with the appropriate qualifications and skills. That is not desirable or appropriate and would not be possible or right.</P>

      <P>It would be wise to insert this amendment &ndash; I see the Minister shaking his head &ndash; if we did not know what a medical procedure was, but I am aware from the Supreme Court judgments that a surgical procedure was considered appropriate in the termination of a pregnancy and that this was taken for granted. Senator Ryan may have gone into it in more detail but, unfortunately, my Irish did not allow me to follow all of his contribution. While approximately one-third of therapeutic abortions are carried out now by medical means, these are usually done at an early stage in pregnancy. I thought that a surgical intervention was considered acceptable, but Senator Ryan may have more information in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Bill is silent on the definition of &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; and since that is central to the Bill, it is appropriate that we should have <Col N="1589" /> some discussion on what is intended by it. The term &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; appears to be broad and would describe a number of forms of medical activity. It is appropriate, therefore, that it should specifically include the normal surgical procedure in terms of what is envisaged in the legislation. I am surprised there has not been an attempt to describe or define &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo;. It would be worthwhile to include here some definition. What we have put forward is an improvement, unless the Minister has some alternative definition to bring forward.</P>

To confine the Minister, therefore, to a very tight definition will not work.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello is right. The Bill is silent on the definition of the term &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo;. It is not confined to any type of medical procedure such as might be contemplated by current medical practice. Currently abortion can be brought about by either surgical operation or by the administration of certain drugs such as the RU486 pill. The Bill must also be capable of covering future developments in this field. It is considered best not to seek to define the term &ldquo;medical practice,&rdquo; especially in a way which might tend to include non-surgical interventions that have the effect of bringing about an abortion. If the Bill was to define the term &ldquo;medical procedures&rdquo; as including a surgical operation, another practical point would apply. We would have to list all the possible types of intervention that would constitute a medical procedure in the legislation, which would not be pragmatic or practical.</P>

    <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
    <P>In page 8, line 23, after &ldquo;life&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(after implantation in the womb)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar anomaly in the Second Schedule, which our amendment seeks to address. It relates to section 1(3) of the legislation which provides for the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner. It states: &ldquo;. . . means a reasonable opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable.&rdquo;  The medical practitioner must have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life whereas the legislation is supposed to be about the prevention of abortion, which is defined as &ldquo;the intentional destruction of unborn human life after implantation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a difference, in some people's view, between unborn human life and unborn human life after implantation. Our concern, therefore, is that a medical practitioner will be required to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life whereas the Bill is about unborn human life after implantation. The duty being imposed on the medical practitioner is greater than that which the Bill is supposed to address. I do not understand this.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the medical practitioner must have an opinion formed in good faith that has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life after implantation in the womb, which is what the Bill is supposed to be about, otherwise the Minister will impose a duty on the medical practitioner which is more extensive than what the Bill is supposed to be about. That is not fair to medical practitioners. I speak as the spouse of a medical practitioner</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation is to deal with unborn life after implantation and prevent a substantial risk to the life of a woman in pregnancy, which is made clear in sections 1(1) and 1(2). My strong legal advice is that it is completely unnecessary to add the words &ldquo;after implantation in the womb&rdquo; to the definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised the Minister has strong legal opinion because this is such a complicated and convoluted process that those who drafted the legislation would have to insist that nothing else could be done. We had a long discussion regarding Articles 40.3.3º and 40.3.4º because they could be in conflict and the absence of a definition of the term &ldquo;unborn.&rdquo;  This Schedule introduces a definition of the term &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; based on a moment in time when implantation takes places in a woman's womb. If we are attempting to regulate the medical profession, then we should regulate it in regard to the period <Col N="1591" /> of time, which is consistent with the objective of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The legislation contains the words &ldquo;in this section&rdquo;. Therefore, one is dealing with sections 1(1), 1(2) and 1(3). Section 1(1) contains the words &ldquo;after implantation&rdquo;. There is no problem because it includes the words &ldquo;in the section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is no definition of the term &ldquo;unborn life&rdquo; in the section. The nearest guideline refers to unborn human life after implantation which will be interpreted in the light of the Constitution which refers to the life of the unborn. The medical practitioner, therefore, in coming to a reasonable opinion must have a broader concern than to avoid carrying out what is defined as an &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; under the Schedule unless it is stated his or her concern must apply to unborn human life after implantation. That is our suggestion. I am not surprised that the legal advice is that it is unnecessary. Our legal advice is that the phrase is ambiguous and could put a greater burden on the medical practitioner than intended.</P>

      <P>A theologian wrote to me on this subject regarding how we must try to differentiate between unborn human life in the womb after implantation, about which she was happy, and unborn human life, which involves <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation or any situation where it is outside the womb. The Minister has had a great stroke of luck because I have mislaid the letter. I hope Senator Ryan will not press the amendment in order that I can find it because it is an interesting argument.</P>

      <P>I support Senators Henry and Ryan. There is ambiguity in the definition of the term &ldquo;reasonable opinion&rdquo; which the legislation bluntly defines as a &ldquo;reasonable opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable.&rdquo;  By saying that refers solely to unborn human life in the womb after implantation without inserting those words in the legislation, the question of when unborn human life is dealt with is brought into play. There have been various discussions regarding what constitutes unborn human life which was debated extensively on Second Stage. The Minister's legal opinion should be similar to ours, that he should insert these words to eliminate ambiguity since that is what he intends. One <Col N="1592" /> person's legal opinion is perhaps not another's, but if the words were inserted, there would be no ambiguity.</P>

      <P>I have strong legal advice, and it is self-evident from reading the text, that it is not necessary. Section 1(1) states that, in this Act, abortion &ldquo;means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb&rdquo;. Section 1(2) has the exemption of medical procedures to save the mother's life and section 1(3) deals with an approved place, a medical practitioner and a reasonable opinion, all of which are contained in section 1(1) and (2). Clearly the definitions relate to the section and the language used in it &ndash; it is self-evident. We might all agree and await a gem of wisdom from the Supreme Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept with reluctance that the Minister may be right but not that it is self-evident. This is an unsatisfactory process because we have to deal with the whole Bill as the Schedule instead of dealing with it section by section, allowing us to discuss each amendment in detail. Instead we must deal with all the amendments together. It is too late to blame the Minister for that.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the draft Bill contained in the Second Schedule states that abortion &ldquo;means the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb&rdquo;. Later, the doctor is told that he or she must have a reasonable opinion that a procedure is necessary. However, in forming a reasonable opinion, the doctor must have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life. Unborn human life, as referred to in section 1, is something that exists prior to implantation as we discussed earlier. Unborn human life is that living organism which is implanted in the womb and the doctor must consider not just whether he or she is breaking this law, but also unborn human life which is not implanted in the womb. It is not self-evident but a matter of opinion over which we will agree to differ. At Senator Henry's request, I will not push the matter tonight as she wishes to return tomorrow to discuss it further with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 26, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;over 18 years of age or of a female child under 18 years of age&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled because the definition of a woman as a female person is extremely broad when we consider the people who may be affected by this legislation. The Minister, I am sure, has good reasons for this wording but is he aware of the man who spoke recently on Joe Duffy's radio programme about going to England with his pregnant wife who had a psychiatric illness? At three months, she decided that she could not go through with the pregnancy, which is why they went to England to have an abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He described travelling in a mini-bus with five other women and an 11 year old girl. This amendment would ensure that we remember that the person we describe as a woman may often be a child as young as 11 years of age. The bald statement that a woman is a female person does not <Col N="1595" /> reflect the reality at the root of what we are discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The tragedy is that, under the terms of this legislation, a child will be treated as a woman and in circumstances of rape or incest will receive no more consideration than an adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is often the simple things that pull us up short. This amendment is one of those and I agree with it. It puts into sharp focus the fact that a child perhaps as young as 11 years has been raped or a child of 13, as we have seen, can be suicidal. That poor child is now committed by the State to going through a pregnancy. You could say that the child is sentenced to death. We are saying that we will not protect the child who is threatening suicide. The only way we will find out if we are right or wrong is when the child commits suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. It is a very narrow interpretation. The 12 or 13 year old child is not being considered. It is a deliberate omission and I would prefer a recognition of the fact that we are talking about young girls. We need the definition included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>People have views on the broader issues of the debate. We are talking now about the definition of a woman in the Bill. The definition as used in the Bill means a female person and that encompasses a female person of any age. Senator Norris is opening up new horizons in terms of what can be permitted and not permitted in terms of abortion and this has not been ventured before either in the Oireachtas committee or anywhere. It is a much broader issue altogether. It works both ways. It is important that a child or a young person would have the benefit of the medical intervention that is legitimised in this Bill in terms of a medical doctor intervening to save the life of a woman, irrespective of her age, who is pregnant and whose life is at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A child would be much more likely to commit suicide when confused and unhappy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence for that. A similar definition was used already by the Oireachtas and has been used in the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that defining a woman as a female person is of any great assistance. She can only be defined in opposition to a male person. Male persons cannot get pregnant. They are unlikely to seek abortions. It is a slightly fatuous definition. Senator Henry has unearthed <Col N="1596" /> something in terms of distinction between an adult and a child. Children are more vulnerable and need to be protected more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to approach this from a different angle. Will the Minister tell the House why it was felt necessary to put a definition of a woman into the Bill? I suspect the reason for that formulation is to ensure that children are not excluded. The reasonable understanding of a woman in this context would be of an adult woman. What they are doing is deliberately putting in a definition to make sure that children are included.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry's amendment makes explicit what is implicit in the Government's insistence on putting this into the Bill. We all know what a woman is. There are lots of other phrases in this legislation &ndash; the definition of a womb, for instance &ndash; which you will not find in a medical dictionary. I wonder why the Government feels it has to have a definition of a woman in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one can ever refer to a 13 or a 14 year old girl as a woman. It would be very unusual. It is wise to show that we are dealing with female children as well as female adults. With a minor there is the intervention of the parents to be taken into account. This would be important. It would be worthwhile looking at this. The Minister could consider it overnight. There is a difference between saying a woman is a female <Col N="1597" /> person and saying a woman is a female person over 18 years of age or a female child. This woman means a female person. It sounds like someone who is autonomous. A female child is not. The female child would be subject to the direction of parents or guardians. It is a totally different situation.</P>
      <P>The female woman is quite different from the female child. They are not the same entity even in legal terms. I cannot understand why they have been lumped together. We would not have had the problems of the X and C cases if these had been people over 18. The girls would not have required either parents or health boards to bring them to England. I cannot see why the Minister thinks that even legally they are the same. They are not. They will be regarded differently under the law because the law is applied differently to minors.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the arguments on both sides. The Minister says that there is no difference between what is in the Bill and what Senator Henry proposes. In stark terminology there is not, but it makes a huge difference in terms of the norm in which people define and perceive whether it is children or women. The definition that woman means a female person appeared to everybody as tautologous, unnecessary and fatuous. It seems now it is very carefully chosen to camouflage the fact that we are talking about children and young girls. No pre-teen young girl aged ten, 11 or 12 has ever been described as a woman.</P>

      <P>This may be true in some legalism that I have not encountered. This seems a somewhat underhand way to camouflage the fact that children are being treated exactly the same as adult women. Anybody would say that a woman is an adult female person. It does not need a definition. It certainly does not encompass young children. From that point of view, Senator Henry's amendment is extremely important to show exactly what is intended given that it is put in this stark fashion. It not only includes women over 18 years of age but also a female child who is much younger. It would be preferable to accept Senator Henry's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems there is a distinction between the adult and the child. If we look at the Bible it mentions when I was a child, I thought as a child and when I became a man, I thought as a man. It is obvious there is a distinction. It seems the intention here is clearly to criminalise children as well, and that is very regrettable.</P>
      <P>There is also a question of sensitivity in terms of language. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity in language that any female person can be described as a woman. That simply is not true in common parlance. We do not describe a female child as a woman. It would be very unusual to describe somebody under the age of 16 as a woman. It also raises other curious questions in terms of the Bill and its definitions and lack of definitions. The Minister has resisted giving a definition of the unborn and we teased this out earlier today. However, my understanding is &ndash; my medical colleagues will correct me if I am wrong &ndash; sexual distinction starts fairly early in the whole process of gestation. That means there certainly is a time before the child is born when it is perfectly easy to determine that the embryo is female. Does that mean in addition to the unborn we will now have unborn women? This would be ludicrous and shows the lack of appreciation of the subtleties of language in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Let us not, an hour later, pretend that somehow, during the 26 hours this Bill has been debated in both Houses, we did not know we were referring to children. This was known in 1983 and in 1992 when we had the X case. This has been known since 1861 in terms of the Offences Against the Person Act. Let us not cast aspersions against other people in terms of motivations behind the use of language.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Henry's motivation in raising the issue through her amendment. However, there is no difference in precision between the definition proposed by Senator Henry and the definition in the Bill. Let us not make a big deal out of this now and try to pretend there is something significant in the amendment tabled. There is significance in the broader, more substantive issue of whether people want a particular abortion regime involving a particular cut-off date. Is that what people are suggesting?</P>

      <P>This Bill is to prohibit abortion. It is not defining unborn human life, it is defining the crime and offence of abortion. Are we now saying that people want to introduce a new criminal offence of abortion that has a cut-off point at some age? I did not see that in any part of the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I may be wrong, it might be buried in there somewhere, but I certainly did not see it in any of the submissions for the Green Paper. It has not been raised in this House today. I accept that people are entitled to raise it, but there is no attempt here to camouflage that. The word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is defined to avoid doubt in relation to a minor or a child, particularly in terms of carrying out procedures. It works both ways.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister and I would not accuse him of cynicism. This has been a very useful debate because it has clarified issues. Yes, it is disgraceful that for example a nine year old rape victim should not be permitted an abortion with the advice of her parents. That is dreadful, shocking and inhuman. Of course there is a difference between an adult and a child. That there is no such distinction allowed for in this Bill is wrong. I am very grateful that Senator Henry raised this issue. She may not have raised it in precisely the way it has developed, or perhaps she did. I feel very strongly that we must have regard to the rights of children who are vulnerable. As adults we have no right to insist that a child at this early age in her life should be forced by the State to continue the pregnancy and give birth as a result of rape or incest. That is grossly immoral and obscene.</P>

      <P>I did not table this amendment to try to make a benchmark at which there would be different applications of legislation. On Second Stage I said I was not trying to do anything in this legislation other than protect the life of the mother. I thought the protection of human life in pregnancy should include the protection of the life of the mother. I tabled the amendment because the two age groups have a different legal standing. A person is not the same when he or she is a minor as when he or she is an adult. That is the reason I wanted to make a distinction in the legislation. There is nothing Machiavellian about it. We are talking about two different legal entities.</P>

    <P>The longer I am a Member of one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas the more confused I am by the way we work out the appropriate sentence for something. I know the figure of 12 years proposed exceeds the maximum penalty for a long list of horrendous offences which involve considerable threats to the lives of adult human beings, such as the use of a syringe full of blood to threaten someone. Many such offences carry sentences of a maximum of five to seven years. I do not know where we got the figure of 12 years. <Col N="1601" /> I do not propose to make a huge song and dance about this, but would love the Minister to explain a rational basis for it. Was someone asked to think of a number between five and 20 and we got 12? I would like the Minister to outline where it fits in with the area of criminal law in terms of defining a penalty.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a back street abortionist or a doctor who does something which is interpreted as something he or she should not have done. It could be a D and C which is carried out after a rape for the ostensible reason that a risk was posed to the life or health of a rape victim. We are talking about a medical procedure in the course of which unborn human life is ended. One of the most common ways in which unborn human life is ended, particularly after rape, is by the use of a D and C to clean out a woman's womb. Everyone knows that happens. The Bill is stating it is a prohibited offence which could carry a sentence of 12 years in prison. This is out of proportion. I am also taken aback that it appears to be by indictment. There is not any reference in the Bill to prosecution other than by indictment. I am surprised at this.</P>

      <P>If a person received the maximum sentence of 12 years, it might not be served if one makes that argument. That is where we stand in terms of the Offences Against the Person Act. The purpose was to try to reach a balance which would reduce significantly the sentence enshrined in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, while continuing to recognise the seriousness of the offence of abortion. It is a balance between those two issues. It is a sensitive issue. I am not saying it is not a difficult one. Any penalty which would be applied in a case would be at the discretion of the Judiciary. We could take, for example, <Col N="1602" /> the D and C argument or a doctor's argument. There can only be a prosecution or conviction if it is the intentional destruction of the unborn in the womb. There are many hurdles in trying to prosecute someone. It must first go to the Director of Public Prosecutions and there is room for rebuttal by the practitioner concerned. The DPP must be satisfied that a case should be taken in the first place. A case has not been taken against any woman since 1861. That is the <i>de facto</i> position.</P>

We have a 12 year penalty for someone convicted of an offence which is not an offence in the neighbouring jurisdiction. How can one justify giving a 12 year sentence on indictment to someone involved in aiding or procuring an abortion? There is no possibility of a summary case being taken because it must be indictable. How many other offences do not have the option of a lower or higher court? A limited number of horrendous offences are dealt with in this way. It is ludicrous and hypocritical to say the only penalty prescribed is 12 years, a fine or both, when it is not an offence and there is not a penalty in most other European Union jurisdictions.</P>

How will it be proved that it was intended for this or another jurisdiction? It is hypocrisy. What are we doing by pulling the figure of 12 years out of the air for someone who performs an abortion or aids or abets a person to terminate a pregnancy? I do not know where the figure came from.

The punish<Col N="1603" /> ment should be commensurate with the crime. The people will decide whether human life in pregnancy has the same protection in law as a human being. The penalty for anyone who breaches that law must be commensurate with the crime. The Bill states that it shall not exceed 12 years, which means there will be judicial discretion. To suggest that it should be curtailed to a maximum of five years is not to give the same value to the protection of the unborn as to the born.

      <P>I very strongly oppose putting clauses into the Constitution which criminalise women who have faced the prospect of an abortion. It is fallacious to say it is not life imprisonment and that the sentence is only 12 years. The logic of this is skewed. We are discussing this as if these women were inanimate objects and as if the 100,000 women who had abortions did not put much thought into it and went to England as a matter of course. We know stories of the sad journey they made and we should be more respectful of what those women have experienced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question on Second Stage, but I did not get an answer. Now is as good a <Col N="1604" /> time as any to try again. Medical abortifacients are being employed more and more in the UK and about one third of abortions are now procured using them. They have a 95% success rate up to seven weeks and about a 75% success rate up to nine weeks. One of the problems for women travelling to England is the cost, which is about £300 sterling for the abortion &ndash; at least £400 &ndash; and perhaps £200 for flights. There is then the question of staying there, which is where we run into difficulties.</P>
      <P>If a woman decides to have a medical abortion, the doctor prefers to have her close at hand because the hormonal element of the medical abortifacient is taken first. There then has to be a gap of at least 12 hours &ndash; preferably 24 &ndash; before the prostaglandin tablets are taken. What happens if a woman decides not to stay in England after taking the hormonal component, which blocks the progesterone from maintaining the pregnancy, and instead goes home and takes the prostaglandin in Ireland? Has she procured an abortion in England or in Ireland? She would have taken the first set of tablets in England, but the second lot in Ireland, which will complete the abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made that no attempt was made to differentiate between the &ldquo;person&rdquo; and &ldquo;the woman being the female person&rdquo;. Is the Minister telling us that a young girl who is suicidal and contravenes subsection (1) of this section, which refers to the intentional destruction, by any means, of unborn human life after implantation in the womb, is subject to 12 years imprisonment? The distinction is not made in relation to the &ldquo;person&rdquo; so the young suicidal girl is now a criminal and may be imprisoned for 12 years or fined, or both. Are we depending on the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an exception in such a case?</P>

No matter what remedy we put in place for unwanted pregnancies, I will not accept that a seven or eight week old embryo is of equal value to any woman for whom I care. There are not many men in this House who, if put in a position where they had to choose, would take a different view, whatever its intricacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss as to why we are talking about the liberality in the Bill of a penalty of only 12 years while also saying that the Act will not operate to restrict any person from travelling to another state on the grounds that his or her intended conduct there would, if it occurred in this State, constitute an offence. Not only are we <Col N="1605" /> saying that an offence carrying a 12 year penalty is not an offence when committed abroad, we are writing it into our Constitution that we will not prosecute in that case.</P>

      <P>I will try to be moderate in my language and restrained. I concede that, of necessity, the 12 year period of the penalty is arbitrary. However, what is being represented is a minimalist approach. In other words, on the margins, 12 years is an excessive penalty, but we can also envisage circumstances where it would be an adequate penalty for people who callously and calculatedly exploit young women. For that reason, 12 years is a reasonable number of years. As has been explained, it is at the discretion of the Judiciary.</P>

We never advanced that argument and I said from the beginning, as did the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, that the legislation and the constitutional amendment would not prevent women going abroad for abortions. What came across in the all-party committee was that the most effective mechanism we could employ to assist women with crisis pregnancies or who have had an abortion was the establishment of a crisis pregnancy agency. That was the mechanism put forward by the Oireachtas and which we adopted. We have provided for the first time a national agency with a direct focus on crisis pregnancy and the need to support women in that position, developing proper education and prevention programmes, proper options, and so on, and also providing post-abortion counselling services. It was identified in the Trinity study, which was articulated comprehensively in the all-party committee's deliberations, that women required that type of support.</P>

All political parties, including the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, have presided over the criminalisation of women since 1861. I have to stand back and count to ten when I hear tremendous remonstrations against and huge emotional comment about my criminalising women through this legislation when every Member who says that in the House tonight has presided over the criminalisation of women and a penalty of life imprisonment for abortion since 1861. It is a bit hard to take some of the emotional outbursts on this subject. That must be said and put on record.</P>

      <P>It has long been recognised as law. The other fundamental point on the criminalisation issue is that we could go the whole hog and decriminalise abortion completely, but that would be to legalise it. If one continues with the argument that there should not be any sentence for abortion, the <i>de facto</i> consequence would be to legalise it. No political party has put that forward as a perspective. Therefore, we are clearly talking about degree and the amount of years, if there is to be consistency in the debate. It is a question of whether it will be five, six, seven, eight, ten or 12 years.</P>
      <P>I have explained that the Government did not wish to go the route of the Offences Against the Persons Act of 1861 which we believed was too severe in its penalty of life imprisonment. We have many safeguards in the Bill in the form of what I call stepping stones leading to eventual prosecution and the term of imprisonment will ultimately be at the discretion of the Judiciary, which will take into account all the circumstances of individual cases, as it has done before. Despite all the provisions in the 1861 Act, there has not been a conviction of woman in circumstances which contravene that Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he cannot give a commitment and the DPP may not see eye to eye. A distinction should be made there. Senator Dardis does not appear to take the woman into account, but to think more in terms of the person running an abortion clinic in this country or aiding and abetting in that regard. That is why Senator Henry wanted the definition. We were not talking about 60 and 70 year olds but young girls for whom this whole issue has arisen. That is the context in which the people will view this referendum. They will see it in the context of the X and C cases and they will ask if such young girls will be criminalised.

      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Henry, it might be helpful if I gave an example of another case I used before. I cited the example of a young girl who went to England for an abortion. Unfortunately, something went wrong and after she returned home, she started to haemorrhage badly. This was two months ago when there would have been much discussion about this legislation. The poor child went into a Well Woman Centre because she was afraid to go to her GP or to hospital. It is the first time this has happened. Her concern was that the Garda should not be called. The child was terrified that would happen. Following on from the point made by Senator Henry, if somebody goes to England for an abortion and haemorrhages after returning, is she all right because the procedure took place there, despite the fact that something has gone wrong? There will be these grey areas.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief point in regard to the 1861 Act. Much legislation was passed prior to the foundation of the State which has not been repealed. Therefore, it is not correct <Col N="1611" /> for the Minister to say that successive Governments have presided over the situation. There has been an omission in not addressing legislation that was passed in the last century. There is plenty of legislation on the Statute Book that has fallen into disuse. The Minister has updated the provisions in this area by means of a constitutional amendment and, in the process, he has introduced legislation which has the effect of criminalising women and children. At the same time, activity will take place elsewhere where no criminalisation is involved. That is at the heart of the hypocrisy of what is being done deliberately now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that we have to deal with all the amendments to the Schedule before we can talk about the Schedule. It is a peculiar way of doing things.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 deals with the offences we have discussed. It states that where there is a prosecution for an offence under this section &ndash; procuring or aiding or abetting &ndash; and where it is proved that a written record purporting to be a record of the opinion, as in the requirement under section 1(2) that a doctor had formed the appropriate opinion and taken the steps necessary, that opinion shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been a reasonable opinion formed in good faith. Where there is a record showing that a doctor attempted to follow the procedures and arrived at a conclusion, he or she should not have to prove it.</P>
      <P>It should be the requirement of the prosecuting authorities to prove the contrary. In other words, because of the existence of the document, as the amendment states, it &ldquo;shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been a reasonable opinion, formed in good faith. . . &rdquo;  A doctor should not have to go into court and prove that he or she formed that opinion if there is evidence to show that he or she acted in reasonable good faith. The amendment provides that where a document exists that would be sufficient to lead to a presumption that the doctor was behaving properly unless we have some suspicion that the doctors of the nation will get involved in a conspiracy to run abortion clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We consulted doctors and obstetricians in relation to how this might apply. Broadly speaking, they are satisfied that section 1(2) is an improvement on the current legal situation which they feel is somewhat uncertain. This amendment, in essence, proposes that in the event of a prosecution for an alleged breach of the law regarding abortion, a written record of a doctor's reasonable opinion under the Act shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been made in good faith and with regard to the need to preserve unborn human life.</P>
      <P>My advice is that the amendment does not take account of the reality of criminal law where a presumption of innocence applies in any case and proof beyond reasonable doubt is required for a person to be found guilty of an offence. That presumption of innocence is in criminal law. Presumption of innocence applies and a case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before anybody can be found guilty of an offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that criminal law says that people are innocent until proved guilty, but this is a delicate area for the medical profession. There is no argument against including this explicitly to reassure medical practitioners that there will not be a witch hunt conducted against them and that as <Col N="1614" /> long as they operate according to laid down procedures, they will be immune from prosecution. It is an extra level of reassurance.</P>
    <P>I accept that given the open nature of our legislation, particularly post the X case, many doctors would find the provisions of section 1(2) an improvement on the uncertainty that was there. If such prescriptions are made, it is a good idea to clarify that those left at the cutting edge of these decisions are reassured. That is what the amendment proposes.</P>

      <P>This section causes me great concern because coupled with the fact that the terminations can only take place in an approved place, a situation could arise whereby someone could be brought to an approved place and find that no one was agreeable to undertake what is a legal procedure. There is nothing in the Bill to the effect that someone has to be made available to treat the person or that a person must declare his or her position on what are legal, life-saving procedures when applying for employment. Nor is there anything in the Bill to the effect that when doctors take on these patients, they have to tell them that they will not perform legal, life-saving procedures. That is in direct conflict with the Medical Council guidelines published in 1998. I understand there is to be another publication shortly, but it has not yet been finalised so we must go on the 1998 guidelines.</P>
      <P>For example, in section F &ndash; Reproductive Medicine, under The Child in Utero, the guidelines state: &ldquo;Refusal by a doctor to treat a woman with a serious illness because she is pregnant would be grounds for complaint and could be considered to be professional misconduct.&rdquo; I would have thought that section allows people to flout that guideline because in a life-threatening situation doctors can say they have a conscientious objection to carrying out the procedure, and there is no onus on that person to find another doctor to treat the patient. There is nothing in the section to the effect that there is an onus on the hospital to ensure someone is always on duty to deal with such cases.</P>
      <P>In Section B &ndash; Doctors and Patients, under Maternity Care, it states: &ldquo;Registered medical practitioners who agree to undertake the antenatal and delivery care of a woman should clearly inform her at the time of booking about the arrangements for delivery.&rdquo;  If a woman is in a life-threatening situation and this person decides that he or she has a conscientious objection to doing anything which may terminate the pregnancy, should they not be obliged to inform her at the time of booking? This is a very loose section and I foresee women's lives being put in danger again. It is not impossible to find doctors who will refuse to become involved in certain forms of treatment, and I understand the reason they should be allowed to opt out, but some provision should be inserted in the Bill to the effect that they have to inform their patients and those employing them so that provision can be made for these patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may remember the situation that arose a number of years ago where a general practitioner in the west of the city refused to prescribe the pill even though she had a large GMS <Col N="1616" /> practice, and it was impossible for her patients to go anywhere else. That doctor could not be made prescribe the pill, but neither could she be made refer those people to someone who would prescribe it. Ethically one should do that. There are many doctors who will not prescribe, say, the morning after pill, but all those whom I know refer patients to someone who does prescribe it.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult situation and we need to work out the way it will apply in practice. What if someone who is bleeding profusely goes to an approved hospital but there are not the teams of people mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick to take care of her? What if there is only one person on duty and that person decides to conscientiously object? Nothing will be done for that patient, but the hospital will not have had any prior knowledge that this person would claim to be a conscientious objector. Certainly those bringing the patient to the hospital will have no knowledge of it. This section is too loose and the doctors have to be reminded that they have an ethical duty not just to their patients but to society in general and indeed to the profession.</P>

      <P>With her medical expertise, Senator Henry has hit the nail on the head once again. What we have here is an opt-out clause. We have defined three areas including &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo;, who will carry out a medical procedure in an approved place, but we are saying that the person who is employed in that approved place for that medical procedure will not have to carry out that procedure. Why do we have approved places? Why define &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; and the medical procedure if we are not obliging the person employed to carry out the procedure to do so? Is there some hidden meaning in the expression &ldquo;in person&rdquo;? Why is &ldquo;any person&rdquo; mentioned? According to the Bill, the only person who can carry out the medical procedure is a medical practitioner. Why is that not stated in the Bill? Why is it left out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I thank the Minister for that, but that does not take from the argument as to why the medical practitioner who will carry out the medical procedure is not obliged to do so. That is the nub of the issue because of the manner in which the Minister has gone to such detail in prescribing the exact person and place in which the procedure will be carried out. There is a general opt-out clause for those supposed to carry out the procedure. The Minister cannot allow those employed for this purpose to act on a whim. They should have to abide by best medical practice and the Hippocratic oath to save a person's life. They will carry out the medical procedure in an emergency where there is a real and substantial risk to the mother's life, yet an opt-out clause is included under which the woman concerned could be left high and dry and in danger of losing her life. A penalty should be imposed on anybody who does not proceed in this fashion.</P>

      <P>If somebody acts in this fashion, a woman's death could result. That is a reasonable conclusion if nobody else is available to carry out the procedure. This situation could arise in the middle of the night. Can people be employed if the purpose is to ensure such medical procedures are carried out? It is difficult to comprehend the provision. The Minister has serious problems in this regard. He should examine the provision overnight and consider accepting one of the amendments tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The amendment should be rejected. Even in pagan Britain opt-out clauses are provided for nurses and other medical personnel who may not want to assist in a procedure that is against their personal ethics. Doctors must be given such an opt-out. What medical emergencies would require this to happen immediately? An opt-out clause must be provided. Everybody can be a conscientious objector in some cases, <Col N="1618" /> including doctors and nurses. It was forgotten in the debate on earlier amendments that two people are involved, the medical practitioner and the unborn child. If somebody does not want to destroy an unborn child, he or she must be able to avail of an opt-out clause.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The nub of the issue is whether we want to legislate for the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council. That is at the heart of both amendments. Amendment No. 22 seeks to add a provision whereby the failure of a medical practitioner to act in the best interest of his or her patient may be held to constitute professional misconduct. This seeks to bring elements of the Medical Council's ethical code for doctors into the legislation. These require that if a doctor for ethical reasons is not in a position to treat a patient, he or she must arrange to refer the patient to a colleague who will provide the treatment required.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 again proposes to add to the conscientious objections provision by inserting the words &ldquo;any medical practitioner must act in accordance with his or her ethical obligations.&rdquo;  I accept the Senators' objective in tabling the amendment is undoubtedly to seek to ensure a doctor should not use this provision as a basis for withholding treatment from a patient where there is no colleague available to provide the care required, but this is in accordance with the current ethical guidelines of the Medical Council. In other words, under its ethical guidelines which govern registration, misconduct and so on, a doctor is obliged to refer the patient to another doctor who will carry out the necessary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other potential difficulties. Senator Henry pointed out that ethical guidelines change. I have a difficulty incorporating them in legislation, particularly that which will enjoy constitutional protection, and linking the legislation with the current ethical guidelines of the Medical Council giving them the automatic protection of law. That is not appropriate because guidelines can change over time. That is the reason we have introduced this combination of a constitutional amendment and legislation. If at a future date the ethical guidelines were amended in such a way that they were not in keeping with the spirit of <Col N="1619" /> the legislation, the effect of the amendments would be to create an inherent contradiction.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Costello's contribution, we do not live in a totalitarian state and there must be room for conscientious objections on issues of fundamental ethical concern. This also applies in regard to blood transfusions on which certain religious groups hold particular views such as Jehovah's Witnesses. Senator Henry acknowledged in her contribution that this is a difficult area. One cannot cut off the right of a person to have a conscientious objection. That is not her intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>This issue relates to life threatening situations, not socio-economic abortions. This is a serious issue. There is an absolutely appalling problem in the State in regard to malpractice suits. The situation is so bad that St. Paul's Medical Indemnity Society is refusing as of today to insure any more medical practitioners or hospitals in Ireland. It stated it would fulfil its current obligations. We are in a dire position regarding medical indemnity and there will be a major temptation for people to say they are conscientious objectors. Senior consultants must make sure they take on the more difficult cases, but I do not know what will happen if approved places are spread over a wide area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is making the case for approved places in one sense. The concept behind them is that there would be a strong senior multidisciplinary in them which would have all the necessary expertise, equipment and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not provided that at approved centres a doctor must insist that someone is on duty who will cope with these medical procedures. There is no provision in the legislation to ensure somebody will cover them. The provision is loosely worded. I am not making the case for approved places because it would be worse if women went to an unapproved centres as people would be wise to become conscientious objectors as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept people can be conscientious objectors. I would be the last person to suggest they could not do so. The legislation states: &ldquo;Nothing in the Act shall be construed as obliging any person to carry out a medical procedure.&rdquo;  I agree with the Minister that we cannot legislate for ethical guidelines as they are laid down by the <Col N="1620" /> Medical Council and they may change. He is not then allowing for referral where someone is a conscientious objector so that a woman can get the treatment she needs, which is a point raised by Senator Henry. It is not against conscientious objection but to ensure that there is a referral so that in a life-threatening situation a woman's life will be saved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>On balance, I favour Senator Henry's amendment. Senator Ryan's opens the way to compensation cases, a matter which has bedevilled the medical profession. I am glad she elaborated on this point. If one is saying that the failure of a medical practitioner to act in the best interests of his or her patient may be held to constitute professional misconduct, which is probably the case anyway, one is almost inviting compensation cases by patients who feel that they were not treated appropriately. I hope that it will be put to a vote soon if we are to vote.</P>

      <P>I regret if anyone believes that I unnecessarily delayed the House. It was not my intention. The record will show that I was not the most voluble contributor to this debate. However, I must raise one more matter. There are many definitions in the legislation, but the womb is not defined. Senator Henry procured the only medical dictionary in the Library of the Oireachtas and the word is not in it although the word &ldquo;uterus&rdquo; appears.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry assures me that the ordinary understanding of the word &ldquo;womb&rdquo; includes the fallopian tubes, which raises the question of ectopic pregnancy. Such pregnancy is regularly terminated by medical intervention. It occurs after implantation as fertilised embryos can be implanted in the fallopian tubes. Modern practice involves their removal. Will the Minister reconsider what is meant by womb in this context? If it is the ordinary medical understanding, it might involve the fallopian tubes which would mean that the current practice for dealing with such pregnancies would be prohibited.</P>

      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, I object to the definition of abortion. I know that we can define things as we wish for a Bill, but this definition is unfortunate. I have not seen a definition of abortion without an end point, that is, that did not stop at viability. I am happy with the start, that is, at implantation, but there is a loosening of language from then on. No termination of a pregnancy which takes place after the child is viable could be considered an abortion. I am surprised Senator Lydon, among others, did not object to this. The word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; is used too loosely throughout the world, which is why I object to it. It is bad enough in legislation but I am sorry to see it in the Constitution.</P>
