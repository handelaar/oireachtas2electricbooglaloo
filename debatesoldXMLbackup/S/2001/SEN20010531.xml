    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding Mini-CTC signalling project, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Mental Health Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; and No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. or if section 48 is reached earlier, to be adjourned at that point. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave asked a question yesterday about the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill. I understand Report Stage in the Dáil is likely to be taken on 22 June and it should be introduced to this House before the end of the session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Deputy Leader clarify that only the first three parts of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill will be considered today and not the fourth part?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is the ideal forum to debate the issues of refugees and racism and the accusations made against the Taoiseach and a number of Ministers in recent advertisements. This area is suffused with a lot of emotion which could be dissolved if the House debated it and clarified aspects of the Refugee Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on the proposed tax amnesty, or whatever the Government is calling it, and its implications in the wider context of tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a tax amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the arrangements the Government proposes to make regarding certain protections for people who did not declare offshore accounts. I seek an assurance from the Deputy Leader that this will not have implications for the matters being dealt with at <Col N="1430" /> the tribunals. I wish to be certain that the Government is not leading us into a trap&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is not from the Government but the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Revenue Commissioners. I do not see what the other side of the House is concerned about. We are all concerned about openness, transparency and accountability. If there is a difficulty with what I am saying, Members on the other side should elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be factual in what he is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, do you have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the work of the tribunals may be undermined or perverted by proposals by the Revenue Commissioners which could be interpreted as giving retrospective protection to people who did not previously declare at tribunals that they had offshore accounts. Will the Deputy Leader clarify this? It has nothing to do with Fianna Fáil but perhaps that party's members know something we do not.</P>
      <P>It may have gone unnoticed that in the past week in France a new railway line has been opened from Calais to the Mediterranean. This is how France provides support for rail transport. On many occasions in this House I have raised the question of opening the Sligo-Galway-Limerick railway line. When I last raised it some years ago I was supported by the Progressive Democrats. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, has also supported the idea on a number of occasions. Will the Deputy Leader ascertain the Government's view on this in terms of improving the infrastructure of the west? The issue has been raised by many people, including members of all political parties. It should be delivered as part of the commitment to the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed between some of the Whips. I am concerned that we will be dealing with some amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill today while others which we have not seen will be considered on another date, but they may be relevant to earlier amendments. I have reservations about proceeding in this way although I accept the House is under pressure to deal with significant legislation before the end of the session and we are not in the business of delaying proceedings. It appears the Government is anxious to pass a lot of legislation before the <Col N="1431" /> summer recess which would lead one to conclusions about events in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the House and explain what she intends to do to ensure that foreign workers coming to this country because of the labour shortage are properly treated by employers and are given the full rights and protections they are entitled to under the law and which Irish workers enjoy? Are legislative amendments required to ensure foreign workers, especially those from non-EU states, are properly treated in view of the severe labour force shortage in some sectors?</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate before the end of the session to consider how the many millions of pounds in funding allocated by the Government for child care and the provision of child care places are being used in practice? It is my strong suspicion that it is not working out in practice and the crisis that existed last year and the year before is worsening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to be invited to the House to debate asylum seekers. There was a debate on Senator Norris's Private Members' motion on racism, but the Minister must give asylum seekers who have been in Ireland since before 31 December 2000 the right to work. It is hypocritical to seek workers from abroad when there are well qualified asylum seekers in the country who have management experience and third level degrees. They are anxious to work and they do not want to be social welfare recipients. However, in the Limerick area in particular they are forced to hang around and they are suffering intense depression as a result. It is most hypocritical and I ask the Minister to respond to the positive aspects of my points and to come to the House to debate what he is or is not doing about asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>We were promised a debate on the educational needs of those with learning difficulties, with particular reference to educational supports for children with autism. I have been promised such a debate since last year and we are in the final days of this session, but nothing has happened. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to explain why No. 1 is being taken without debate. The CTC signalling project was a controversial issue that was widely ventilated in the House. The motion appears to contain element of compellability and the House should discuss that aspect. There may be an explanation but if one is not forthcoming, I intend to propose an amendment <Col N="1432" /> to the Order of Business that the motion be debated.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the House that not all the Whips were consulted. I am the Whip for the Independent group while Senator O'Toole is our distinguished spokesperson. He is called first&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and he represents us on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. However, he is not our leader or Whip. Otherwise, why am I paid a small amount of money per month for acting as the Whip?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>

      <P>It would be nice if my office was contacted occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to outline whether the Government believes it is doing enough to promote the referenda that will be held shortly, given the public's apathy in relation to them. We are facing the possibility of the lowest turn-out in the history of the State. At worst, the referendum on the Nice treaty could be defeated while, at best, it may be a huge embarrassment from an international standpoint if the turn-out is below 20%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government aware of the apathy that exists in relation to the referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Jackman's call for a debate on autism because the latest figures are chilling. There has been a large increase in the number of children with autism, particularly in the Dublin area, and the matter warrants a debate.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the relevant Minister &ndash; I presume it is the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke &ndash; to request the Garda for assistance on a particular matter? Some roads have been closed while others have been changed to a one way system to enable the Luas line to be built. There are early warning signs but the level of congestion requires the presence of gardaí to control traffic. The traffic is unbelievably dreadful at present and will remain so for a year. There is a need for more than early warning signs &ndash; help is required &ndash; and I presume the Deputy Leader will use his undoubted good offices in that regard on my behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Deputy Leader to the publication earlier this week of the EU scoreboard on compliance with EU directives. It appears Ireland is four years behind others and that the country will not reach the deadline of next March. There should be a debate on Europe immediately after the referenda next <Col N="1433" /> week because this matter is urgent in view of Prime Minister Jospin's bare knuckle attack this week on countries such as Ireland.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quill's call yesterday and Senator Jackman's request today for a debate on education. Figures published yesterday suggest that 57% of adults in Ireland are illiterate. This figure relates to people who have difficulty with basic reading. I was not aware that the level was so high, but if that is the case, a debate on education should be held immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole regarding the reopening of the Sligo to Limerick line. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on carriageways. There is a suggestion that super highways and dual carriageways will be developed in association with the railway strategy. However, we should consider whether a mistake is being made because some of the highways might not be necessary if the railway was developed. A DART-like system is now necessary in Galway, which is the fastest growing city in Europe, to link it to the hinterland towns of Tuam, Athenry and Dunmore. A debate on carriageways in association with railways would be most appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to second Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business if the Deputy Leader does not provide a satisfactory explanation. It is an important motion which relates to compellability. It is a highly controversial area and Members should have an opportunity to discuss it. I am ignorant of the exact procedures which must be followed and the Deputy Leader may have an explanation as to why there should be no discussion. However, as a matter of principle, the House should discuss the motion and I intend to oppose the Order of Business unless the reply is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Coogan's call for a debate on refugees and racism. Some of those people are much sought after but, sadly, when they are employed they are treated as if they are subhuman. No person should be robbed of his or her dignity and, as Senator Coogan pointed out, a debate on the issue would be useful.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator O'Toole's call for the reopening of the western seaboard railway line from Sligo to Limerick. However, in any discussion on that issue, we should seek the extension of the line from Limerick to Cahirciveen.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the Limerick railway. I pay tribute to former Senator Martin J. O'Toole because the line would have been lifted and scrapped years ago but for his intervention. He carried out a campaign with the help of a small group to retain the line. I hope it will be reopened.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education, but I do not agree that 57% of people are illiterate.</P>

      <P>I must defend the teachers who have taught the children down the years and have done a good job. It is a slur on them to say that 57% of children are illiterate. It is incorrect and scandalous and the people who formulated those statistics should be brought before us&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader tell us when the local government Bill will come before the House? It is important legislation and we await it with great anxiety. The Leader told us it would arrive during this session and there is much speculation as to when.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Farrell's call for a debate on education and I support him regarding the interpretation of the survey that was carried out on illiteracy. Technologically, I am illiterate, and a lot of the elements of the survey referred to this. Frankly, it is very misleading <Col N="1435" /> and Senator Farrell is right to assert this. We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter during the debate on education.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the recent proposal from the Revenue Commissioners, supported by the Government, regarding considerations for those who declare offshore accounts. As the politician who first expressed concern in public about amnesties &ndash; I regarded them as charters for drug barons &ndash; I feel a debate would allay the fears of Senator O'Toole regarding the lack of distinction he sees between amnesties and what is now proposed. There is a very clear distinction. What is proposed is a very pragmatic approach to work on behalf of the taxpayer. A debate would elucidate the Government's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for yesterday's comments by Senator Norris on the problems facing elderly men in rural Ireland. I would like to link them to a statement in the papers this morning indicating that Senator Quinn has stated he would welcome the employment of those over a certain age in his new supermarket venture in Limerick. I wish him well in that.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader allow Government time for a discussion on ageism in the workplace?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years, I and my colleagues on both sides of the House who are members of the National Economic and Social Forum have raised this issue at times of high unemployment. Perhaps it was not popular then. Now that there are very severe skills shortages. Despite the figures issued during the week by the Central Statistics Office which indicate that only 65,000 people are actively seeking work, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed has stated that statistically there are twice that number who would wish to work. For a variety of reasons, they are unable to do so, due to lack of skills, age discrimination in the workplace, or because of the location &ndash; as was mentioned by Senator Norris yesterday. In my own area, the unemployment rate is twice the national average &ndash; almost 6% in the Border regions. Therefore, a debate would be timely. I ask that Government time be allowed for this so all sides of the House will be able to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to be literate in my reply. Senator Coogan raised the issue of racism, and there were several other issues raised by other Senators. I see no difficulty in having a discussion on the matter. Racism cannot be tolerated. The associated issue of asylum seekers, as Senators Jackman and Ridge pointed out, is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Both issues could be discussed in a wide-ranging debate on racism. I find the poster that was put up by Amnesty International dis<Col N="1436" /> tasteful. It should not have been put up, given their perspective on rights throughout the world, for which they should be applauded. That is just one aspect of the Senators' call for a debate.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Liam Fitzgerald and others spoke of the statement of practice from the Revenue Commissioners. That is a matter for the Commissioners and, as I understand from this morning's newspapers, the Attorney General has been asked to offer an opinion on the people who were involved in the so-called tax amnesty in 1993. It is not a matter that we need to avoid but one that can be debated within the House.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, McDonagh, Coghlan and Ó Fearghail spoke about railways and infrastructure in the west. We passed the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill in the House. It would have been appropriate to discuss these issues then, but that does not mean we cannot do so in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. The reason we are handling it in the way we are and not taking the fourth part today is that there are ongoing inter-party discussions to reach a resolution as to what the agreed position should be.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara also raised the issue of foreign workers. It would be bad if they were not treated in the same way as every other worker. They have that protection under law. If they are not treated equally, it should be brought to the attention of the authorities and investigated. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, is determined that foreign workers should be given all their rights.</P>
      <P>Child care was also raised by Senator O'Meara and that is a matter that can be discussed. The issue of asylum seekers was raised by Senator Jackman. They are entitled to due process. It is important that we distinguish between migrant workers, who are coming in legally, and asylum seekers. A different standard is being applied to asylum seekers. That is acceptable because we must be careful that people entering the country do not come from a criminal background or require the State to adopt defensive measures.</P>
      <P>The matter of education was raised by Senators Jackman, Ridge, Quinn, Farrell and Liam Fitzgerald, both yesterday and today. Senator Jackman spoke of it in the context of autism, which is a narrower debate. Given the volume of opinion within the House, I hope that the matter can be debated very soon.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris spoke about item No. 1 and the sub-committee. The sub-committee is being given the power to send for persons, papers and records. If the sub-committee has decided that is required, then the House should assent to it. There is no need to debate the issue &ndash; it is beyond that. Obviously, if there is a report from the sub-committee, the House can address it at a later stage. Senator Ross raised that point. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey referred to the referenda. I and the majority of Members in the House, with one or two exceptions, are in favour of the adop<Col N="1437" /> tion of the three questions that are being put to the people by way of referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of new mental health legislation is an important milestone in the development of our thinking in relation to mental illness in modern Ireland. Since the mid-1980s we have seen the development of an integrated and community based approach to the care of the mentally ill. This process has been based on the fundamental objectives of policy on the care of the mentally ill which have been adapted by successive Governments since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984. Advances in the management and treatment of mental illness allow many sufferers to live within their own communities, carry on with their lives and continue to contribute to society in a positive and fruitful way.</P>
      <P>Alongside the development of a community based service there is a need for reform of the statutory safeguards for those with mental disorders who are considered to be in need of hospital care. Since the 19th century powers have existed in law to protect those with mental disorders from the consequences of their behaviour and, more particularly, from abuse and exploitation in society. The current criteria under which mentally disordered persons may be detained involuntarily are set out in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which was last amended in 1961. The Act was innovative in the 1940s and its principles have been described as enlightened for its time. However, successive Governments have acknowledged that this legislation is in need of substantial reform to bring it into line with current thinking and international norms on the detention and treatment of people with mental disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there were just over 24,000 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units. Some 10% of these admissions, approximately 2,400, were involuntary. Ireland has a significantly higher rate of involuntary admission than other European countries. Commenting on figures for 1999, the Health Research Board stated that non-voluntary admissions in Ireland represented 75.3 per 100,000 of the total population compared to <Col N="1439" /><Col N="1440" /> 40 per 100,000 of the total population in England and Wales, and 26 per 100,000 total population in Italy. It is hoped that the introduction of this new mental health legislation, with its more stringent procedures for involuntary detention, will cause the number of involuntary admissions to decline, bringing practice in this country more into line with the rest of Europe. </P>
    <P>At the core of this Bill, therefore, is the need to address the civil and human rights of persons receiving care and treatment in our psychiatric services. It will provide a modern framework within which people who are mentally disordered and who need treatment or protection, either in their own interest or in the interest of others, can be cared for and treated. In this regard, the Bill will bring our legislation on the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>Another purpose of the Bill is to put in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment in our mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated. The primary vehicle for achieving this will be the new mental health commission, to be established under this Bill. The commission's primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. The existing Office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced with the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, who will be employed by the commission. Both the commission and the inspector will operate independently of the Minister for Health and Children and the Department. This independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Specifically, this Bill focuses on improving and modernising the criteria and mechanisms for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment, establishing a system of automatic and independent review of all detentions, including the provision of legal aid to all those who are detained, and putting in place a framework by which the standards of care and treatment provided in our in-patient mental health facilities can be supervised and regulated.</P>
    <P>Central to meeting these objectives will be the establishment of the new mental health commission. The commission's main functions will include promoting and encouraging the maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services; arranging for an independent review by a mental health tribunal of all decisions to detain a patient on an involuntary basis, and each decision to extend the duration of such detentions; the establishment and administration of a legal aid scheme for detained persons; the maintenance of a register of approved centres, in which hospitals or residential facilities providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered; and the appointment of the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Among the many improvements made to the Bill in its passage through the Dáil was an expansion in the membership of the commission. Its membership of 13 now includes a practising barrister or solicitor, three registered medical practitioners, of which two will be consultant psychiatrists, two representatives of the nursing profession, a social worker, a psychologist, a representative of the public, three representatives of voluntary bodies promoting the interest of people suffering from mental illness, of which two will be people who have themselves suffered mental illness, and a representative of the health boards.</P>
    <P>A key provision of the Bill is that each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a person involuntarily for psychiatric care and treatment will be reviewed. Another significant improvement, agreed by the Dáil on Report Stage was a reduction in the length of the period for the review of a person's detention from 28 days to 21 days. The review provided for under this Bill will be independent and automatic. The process will be put in train immediately on a person's admission. All patients will have a right to review, even if they are discharged before the 21 day period has elapsed. Section 27 of the Bill provides that they and their legal representative must be informed of that right when they are being discharged.</P>
    <P>Each review will be carried out by a mental health tribunal, operating under the aegis of the new mental health commission. As a result of amendments made in the Dáil mental health tribunals will include a lay person among their members, in addition to a consultant psychiatrist and a lawyer. The mental health commission will also arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist, whose report will be sent to the tribunal for consideration.</P>
    <P>The review that is proposed in this Bill will be substantive and is fully in keeping with our obligations under international law. It will focus on whether the person concerned is mentally disordered and whether the correct procedures were carried out in detaining him or her. A tribunal will be empowered to order the release of a patient if it considers that he or she does not require to be detained involuntarily.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to clarify a number of points in relation to this review. Some commentators have referred to the fact that the White Paper proposed a review of detention after seven days and have suggested that what is contained in the Bill offers less protection to involuntary patients than was promised in the White Paper. This is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposed that a procedural review of the legality of a person's detention would take place within seven days of involuntary detention. The type of review envisaged then would have been a paper exercise, simply checking that all the correct procedures had been carried out. It would not have touched on the crucial question which must arise in all cases of involun<Col N="1442" /> tary detention, that is whether the person is mentally disordered to the extent that it warrants a restriction on his or her liberty. The White Paper did not consider that the type of fundamental, clinical review which is proposed in this Bill was necessary until a person had been detained continuously for over a year.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposal in the White Paper did not go far enough to ensure the rights and interests of the detained person are protected. The proposal in this Bill for a substantive review within 21 days represents a major advance on that put forward in the 1995 White Paper. The Bill which is before the House today is a culmination of a long and detailed process of consultation and careful consideration, which began with the publication of a Government Green Paper in 1992. That was followed by the White Paper of 1995 and the publication of this Bill in December 1999.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of this Bill, the Minister has received many submissions from interested groups and individuals expressing their views and concerns about aspects of the Bill's provisions. The variety of groups which have been involved illustrates the importance and the complexity of this legislation. They include the following groups: the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, the Law Society of Ireland, the National Disability Authority, Schizophrenia Ireland, SIPTU, Social Workers in Psychiatry, the Royal College of Psychiatrists &ndash; Irish division, and the Mental Health Association. </P>
    <P>All submissions received were carefully considered, meetings were held with some of the groups and a great many of the amendments which were put forward, both on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil were in response to the concerns expressed by the various interests. The Bill before the House today, therefore, has been significantly improved and enhanced as a result of amendments made to it during the course of its passage through the Dáil. In addition to those I have mentioned, the most significant amendments which have been made to the Bill are as follows.</P>
    <P>A new section, section 4, has been inserted into the Bill, which provides that the best interests of the person concerned should be the principal consideration in making decisions under the Bill, with due regard given to the interests of others, such as family or friends, who may be affected. The definition of mental illness in section 3 has been strengthened, drawing on the model of mental health legislation in New South Wales, Australia. Provision has been made for ministerial regulations to define the qualifications of an authorised officer of a health board, who has a function in relation to applications under section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 25 regarding the involuntary detention of children has been substantially revised in order that the involuntary admission of children for psychiatric treatment can take place with the minimum number of examinations and court <Col N="1443" /> appearances possible consistent with safeguarding their rights. Safeguards have been inserted in section 28 in order that patients are not prematurely discharged or discharged into homelessness and also to enshrine in the Bill the principle that patients should not be held involuntarily for any longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>A provision has been inserted in section 42 to require the mental health commission to report to the Minister within 18 months on the operation of the process of involuntary admission and review. Section 57 which relates to the consent of an involuntary patient to treatment has been amended to provide that the consent of a patient must be obtained whenever possible. Treatment should not be administered without consent except where it is necessary to safeguard the life or well-being of the patient and where he or she in incapable of giving consent.</P>
    <P>A new provision has been added to section 64 to allow the mental health commission to attach conditions to the registration of psychiatric units and hospitals. This will give the commission powers to ensure standards are improved and maintained. A new section, section 75, has been inserted which provides for a review by the Minister of the whole Bill within five years of the establishment of the new mental health commission. The Minister will report the findings of the review to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill lay the foundations for achieving a sustained improvement in the quality of care provided in our mental health services. Both the new mental health commission and the inspector of mental health services will play a pivotal role in this regard. The current inspector of mental hospitals has already begun this process. A document entitled, Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services, was prepared by the current inspector and published by the Department of Health and Children in 1998. The guidelines are an educational endeavour to increase awareness of the main quality issues in service delivery and their monitoring, refinement and improvement. They have been circulated to mental health professionals and service providers around the country. I anticipate that similar guidelines and other measures will be developed by the new commission to assist service providers in their pursuit of excellence in care delivery.</P>
    <P>The present inspector of mental hospitals plays a crucial role in providing independent and detailed analysis of our mental health services. The inspectorate has provided both expertise and assistance in identifying problems and outlining the need for improvements. Under the provisions of the Bill the existing office of the inspector of mental hospitals will be replaced with the office of the inspector of mental health services, thus giving the new inspector a much broader remit than that of the current one. The new inspector will be employed by the mental health commission and have complete independence from <Col N="1444" /> the Minister and his or her Department. This represents a major improvement on the proposal in the White Paper that the office of the inspector be associated with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the annual inspections of in-patient facilities which are carried out at present the new Bill will require the inspector to carry out an annual review of all mental health services. This includes community residences and day centres as well as acute in-patient facilities. The inspector's review of the services, including reports on inspections carried out, will be published with the mental health commission's annual report and laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another important responsibility of the inspector will be the regulation of standards in the mental health services. A register of approved centres, in which each hospital or in-patient facility providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered, will be maintained by the new mental health commission. Regulations will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres. It will include requirements on food and accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records. The execution and enforcement of these regulations will be the responsibility of the mental health commission through the work of the inspector of mental health services.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses the need to provide safeguards for patients in relation to consent to treatment. The Mental Health Act, 1945, and subsequent amending legislation, does not cover the issue of informed consent to treatment given by a detained patient. However it had been widely assumed that if a person was involuntarily detained in a psychiatric hospital his or her consent to treatment was not required. Concern about the rights of mentally disordered patients has led to a questioning of this assumption. In response to this concern, Part 4 of the Bill clarifies for the first time the obligations of the mental health professionals regarding consent and brings our legislation in this area into conformity with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Part of the Bill has been significantly strengthened and improved during its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One of the major challenges facing the mental health services is to provide all in-patients with a good quality alternative to care in large psychiatric institutions. The overall number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals and acute psychiatric units continues to decline and stood at 4,559 at the end of 2000. Unfortunately the rate of progress in closing down the old hospitals and building up the community service has not been as fast as had been hoped when Planning for the Future was adopted as Government policy in 1984. It has to be acknowledged that during the years the mental health services have frequently lost out to other services which have been given priority in the allocation of development funding. If we are to sustain and develop the concept of a compre<Col N="1445" /> hensive psychiatric service located in the community, adequate funding and support must be provided. I fully recognise that much needs to be done in this regard and it is intended to facilitate health boards as far as possible in bringing about the necessary improvements and developments.</P>
    <P>It is time to make a concerted effort to tackle in a determined and comprehensive manner the problems in our mental health services. To this end, an additional £18.6 million has been allocated to the mental health services this year. This represents an increase of 50% on the additional funding provided last year, which represented a 100% increase on funding provided in 1999.</P>
    <P>Priority is being given to child and adolescent psychiatric services, to which an additional £3.225 million has been allocated this year. Steady progress has been made in recent years in developing a specialised service for this particular client group. Each health board now has a minimum of two consultant-led child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams. This year's funding will expand the existing child and adolescent psychiatric services by supporting the recruitment of additional consultants and the further development of multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
    <P>A working group was established in June last year to examine current needs in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry and make recommendations on its future development. The working group presented its first report to me in March 2001. It recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of addressing current needs. The report also recommended that a total of seven psychiatric in-patient units for children aged six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established in respect of proposed units in Cork, Limerick and Galway and capital funding will be provided for these units and a further two units in the Eastern Regional Health Board area under the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The estimated cost of the working group's recommendations is £90 million and the required funding will be discussed in next year's health Estimates.</P>
    <P>Other priorities in the development of mental health services include the continuing development and expansion of community based services, the development of old age psychiatry and the expansion of suicide prevention programmes now in place in all health boards. The provision of capital funding is also essential if the mental health services are to be transformed in the way that we would all wish to see. Substantial capital funding under the national development plan will go towards the development of mental health facilities. Approximately £150 million capital funding is being provided over the lifetime of the plan for this purpose, of which a significant part will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals which will replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The Bill improves on the proposals put forward in the 1995 White Paper in a number of significant respects. I acknowledge however that a number of other issues raised by the White Paper are absent from the Bill. I am aware that this has caused some disappointment among those with an interest in the mental health services and would like to assure the House that these issues have not been overlooked or forgotten. The issues discussed in the White Paper which have not been included in the Bill &ndash; most notably, the proposals in relation to mentally disordered people before the courts and in custody &ndash; require further detailed consideration by the Department of Health and Children. Discussions on them must also take place with other Government Departments and agencies. It is the Minister's intention, when this Bill has been enacted, to ensure that these outstanding issues are addressed by the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the important issue of the civil and human rights of those who are involuntarily detained for psychiatric care and treatment. As a group, these people are among the most vulnerable in our society. They are often unable to speak for themselves. It is incumbent on us as a society to recognise our obligations in relation to these people. I am pleased to be able to bring before the House a Bill which will ensure that Ireland will now adhere to the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would take issue with those who assert that this Bill does no more than the minimum required to bring us into line with the European Convention. In many respects, it goes further than what was proposed in the White Paper. Crucially, it provides for the establishment of the new mental health commission which will have the capacity, as an independent body, to drive the agenda in relation to modernising our mental health services. I am confident that the commission as proposed in this Bill, in conjunction with the enhanced inspectorate, will enable us to develop in the years ahead a mental health service which is in keeping with the needs and requirements of a modern society.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <P>This Bill was first published in 1999 and a week has not gone by since then when Senator Henry and I have not asked for it to be introduced as a matter of the utmost priority. It is sad that, two years later, the Seanad is only now debating the Bill. We had hoped that it could have been introduced in the Seanad and that Members would, therefore, have had adequate time to debate its provisions. However, I hope sufficient time will be allocated on Committee and Report Stages to allow us to discuss the many amendments we intend to table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a huge number of representations and submissions from different organisations, the law reform committee of the Law Society, ordinary individuals, health boards, psy<Col N="1447" /> chiatrists and youth groups about this Bill, in respect of which there is intense interest. It is a pity it deals with only one aspect of mental health matters, namely, involuntary detention. I accept that this is an important issue but having had such a long period to consider matters, the Minister could have gone further and addressed other issues.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children's policy document, Shaping a Healthier Future, states that those in greatest need should be helped first, that we must include, with the utmost priority, those suffering from mental illness, in particular those suffering from severe mental illness, those who spend so much time in psychiatric care and that what we are really looking for is equity and also quality of service and accountability. The Bill only addresses the equity, quality of care and accountability in a narrow sense, namely, in respect of involuntary detentions.</P>
    <P>Had it not been for the concerted efforts of Senator Henry, myself and others to have them debated, the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals would have sat on a shelf gathering dust. Those reports make harrowing reading and show that there is little difference between health boards in terms of the type of service on offer. I compliment the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on the tremendous work he has done. I am sure he was very frustrated over the years and must have believed that the matters on which he reported were not being debated. I accept that efforts were made to improve the system when those reports appeared. If his reports had not emerged, we would not have had the opportunity to understand the conditions experienced by and the trauma undergone by people's loved ones who have been obliged to spend long periods in psychiatric institutions.</P>
    <P>Improvements have come about as a result of the need to bring our legislation on the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. That is one of the many reasons I am glad Ireland is so committed to the European Union. Would these issues ever be addressed if that was not the case? I may appear sad and cynical today, but as a nation we should be doing far more to address the needs of the mentally ill, who are the most vulnerable and weak in our society. This matter affects all families.</P>
    <P>I am glad that standards of care and treatment will be monitored, inspected and regulated. The legislation provides for the compulsory detention of mentally incapacitated persons, in certain circumstances, under the <i>parens patriae</i> power vested in the State. It is important to stress that any restriction on the liberty of such people and any interference with their rights must be kept to a minimum and that their dignity and self-respect should be fostered. In addition, there should be ongoing updates and reforms to reflect what should be a mature society's understanding of <Col N="1448" /> mental illness and of the needs and the rights of the mentally ill. Society is changing and the proportion of elderly people within it will continue to increase. From reading about this issue, I am aware that our legislation and mental health regime are out of step with those in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. There is no doubt that we are far behind our near neighbours.</P>
    <P>When we debated the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, we should have addressed many of the crucial issues which arise in respect of this matter. The last Act dealing with this area came into force in 1945. Some 55 years later the Green Paper and the White Paper &ndash; many of the recommendations it contained are not dealt with in the Bill &ndash; appeared. My party welcomes certain aspects of the Bill before us, particularly the procedures relating to involuntary detention. However, we intend to introduce amendments which will hopefully improve the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new mental health commission which will have responsibility for promoting and fostering high standards and good practice in mental health services. In my opinion, the funding outlined by the Minister of State will fall short of what is needed to bring our psychiatric services and institutions up to a decent level and ensure that people receive adequate care.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Service, which will replace the existing Office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, will be an independent entity. I stress again my thanks and those of the general public to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for highlighting so many of the problems that exist in our mental hospitals. I welcome the fact that the new office will be independent of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a register of approved centres. When one considers the statistics to which the Minister of State referred it is incredible that 2,400 of the 24,000 admissions to mental hospitals last year were involuntary. Why is the rate of involuntary admissions in Ireland significantly higher than that which obtains in other European countries? As the Minister of State indicated, the Health Research Board estimates that the figure for Ireland represents 75.3 per 100,000 of the total population. That is high compared with 40 per 100,000 in England and Wales, our nearest neighbour and with which it is right to make comparisons, and 26 per 100,000 in Italy.</P>
    <P>We hope it will not be just an aspiration to do something to reduce the numbers of involuntary admissions to bring our practice into line with other countries in Europe. I do not see any reference in the Bill to voluntarily admitted patients consenting to the treatment they are about to undertake. This has been the subject of research.</P>
    <P>Prisons are an area that could have been addressed in the Bill and the subject has been highlighted repeatedly. It has received significant coverage on radio programmes, especially in the <Col N="1449" /> form of many excellent contributions from Dr. Smith, director of the Central Mental Hospital, who has stated starkly that at least 100 prisoners in Mountjoy Prison should be in a psychiatric institution and not in prison. He has repeatedly referred to the fact that incarceration in padded cells for up to ten days is the only option available for the treatment of these prisoners. The visiting committee asked why people with obvious psychiatric problems are committed to prison. That question has not been addressed and has been omitted because of the demarcation between the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but that should not be a reason people in prison with psychiatric problems are not dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>Suicide is an issue which has been debated repeatedly because of the initiative shown by Deputy Neville who, as a Senator in this House, pushed hard for the decriminalisation of suicide. This is something which could have and should have been dealt with in the Bill. There is a need for multidisciplinary teams which are accessible to all health boards. Services are fragmented and diffuse and there is a difference in the service available in the various health boards.</P>
    <P>Another issue whose omission from the Bill upsets me enormously is illustrated by the fact that tremendous upset is caused to adult and teenage psychiatric patients in Limerick Regional Hospital because they do not have separate and designated units. This means the two different age groups are lumped together. This is extremely stressful for the elderly who are subjected to the energy of young people suffering from psychiatric illness. It is extraordinary that something has not been done about this. It is distressing for both groups and also for their relatives when they come to visit because they feel helpless and believe there is nothing they can do to deal with the matter. This area has not been dealt with, even though it is a simple matter of resources.</P>
    <P>I have had contact with parents of children who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who tell me that, because no designated service or integrated approach is shown to them by the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science &ndash; with the result that, in many cases, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be brought in &ndash; those children do not receive the assistance they need. I was shocked when examining this issue to find that six of the eight health boards do not have facilities to deal with children suffering from psychiatric illness. Where is the equity in that? The issue is not addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know the confines of the legislation are narrow, but the Minister missed out on an opportunity to deal once and for all with the many problems associated with psychiatric illness, not just in the elderly and adult population but also in young people, among whom there has been an increase in the incidence of suicide, and in children who suffer from disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. While there may <Col N="1450" /> not be an increase in that last group, parents now highlight the issue because they no longer accept that their children should be left without appropriate treatment. Dublin is the only area where girls who suffer from anorexia receive adequate and suitable treatment. The more opportunity we have had to examine the issue of the treatment of mental illness, the more I have become frustrated with the fact that the Bill does not go far enough to improve the lives of many young people with psychiatric problems.</P>
    <P>The adult care order was debated intensively in the other House but is not addressed in the Bill. Why is this so, especially given the recommendations in the White Paper? Why bother even having a White Paper if its recommendations are not addressed? This is the fragmented approach to which I referred. Having had the opportunity of bringing forth recommendations from the Green Paper to the White Paper, we find they have not been addressed in the Bill nor have we been given a sufficient reason for that.</P>
    <P>This debate is frustrating because I do not have time on Second Stage to deal with all the issues, such as the fact that, despite the psychiatric view that people with personality disorders are not amenable to treatment, form the greatest numbers who clog up general practitioners' surgeries and social workers' time and cause a crisis in the community because of their destructive and difficult behaviour, the Bill excludes them from any form of management. It is important to convene a high level task force on that matter. Another issue is the need for further training of social workers, prison service psychiatrists and especially gardaí, who are involved in detention and who have requested support and opportunities for training in the mental health area. There is much more to be said on the area of mental health and I will say it on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome this long-awaited and much needed Bill. It does not go far enough but that is a matter for another day. I pay tribute to those who work in the psychiatric services. They bring a great deal of concern, humanity and human warmth to what is often a difficult job with probably no result at the end in many cases.</P>
      <P>The two central issues in the Bill are the proposed mental health commission and the mental health inspectorate. Senator Jackman said in the House the other night that we need a health inspectorate and health commission to oversee all medical facilities and to act as ombudsman or buffer between the health care system and the patients who are its customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that should not be forgotten is that all the improvements made to the system have been made against a background of public indifference, if not outright hostility. Recently in the Northern Area Health Board area there was orchestrated opposition to patients being moved into a residential area. This was outrageous and <Col N="1451" /> scandalous but those responsible for it got away with it for months before the issue was resolved.</P>
    <P>It would not be any harm to praise the Inspector of Mental Hospitals who, through his annual reports, has prodded the body politic, if not the public conscience, to improve the mental health and psychiatric systems. Apart from new forms of medication the first major development was the introduction of the movement of patients from the big old psychiatric hospitals into the community. In the early days this was not done with the required sensitivity or medical and financial support and there were one or two nasty upsets. The system has now settled down more satisfactorily. In my own area the health board moved patients into the general area around the hospital and no attempt was made to move patients into stable and established communities. That may change in time.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill deals with involuntary admissions of persons to approved centres. Section 8(2) states, &ldquo;Nothing in<i> subsection (1)</i> shall be construed as authorising the involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre by reason only of the fact that the person <i>(a) </i>is suffering from a personality disorder, <i>(b) </i>is socially deviant, or <i>(c)</i> is addicted to drugs or intoxicants.&rdquo; I have enough experience as a general practitioner to know that one would have to be a genius to make such a clear distinction. I look forward to hearing the Minister explaining this section when it is discussed on Committee Stage. Several Members have worked in the medical or psychiatric services and we would all like an explanation as to how this section will be applied with due regard to the safety of the patient and the public and the general concerns of the patient's family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. It is always useful to hear Senator Fitzpatrick speak before me. He speaks such good sense that I can refer to much of what he says.</P>
      <P>As I have the dubious distinction of being the first Member of the Oireachtas to have the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals discussed in either House, I am relieved to see that the Bill has reached the House today. There has been a great improvement in the Bill since it was introduced to the House in December 1999. I congratulate the departmental officials and all who have been involved on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil on the amount of work done on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having expressed my congratulations I will not annoy the Minister of State by describing the Bill as the involuntary admissions and commissions Bill. There are however large areas in the White Paper published in 1995 which are not included in the Bill. The most important of these is chapter 7 which dealt with the diversion of those with mental disorders who came before the courts to mental health courts. The exclusion of this recom<Col N="1452" /> mendation from the Bill is a disappointment to many of us. One feels that the Bill has been driven forward by the fact that the European Union convention on human rights and treatment has placed pressure on the Government to regulate involuntary admission in this country. This lack of regulation has been a great problem for those working in the mental health service, whom Dr. Fitzpatrick so rightly praised, and for general practitioners, community psychiatric workers and others, as well as for patients and their families. A problem also arose because there was no method for those who had been involuntarily admitted to hospital to be discharged.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by the Dáil is an improvement on the Bill as initiated but it is a pity it is not set out in a more logical way. It should deal with matters in sequence, beginning with the assessment of the patient. Senator Fitzpatrick has pointed out the difficulty presented in section 8(2). I am delighted I am not one of the geniuses who must decide whether a person is suffering from a personality disorder, is a social deviant or addicted to drugs or intoxicants. Many are precipitated into psychiatric situations by their addiction to drugs or intoxicants. I do not know how this provision will be dealt with. If we are to have these exclusions from involuntary admissions, why are conduct disorders in children not included. I will certainly propose an amendment to that effect in order that the question will at least be debated on Committee Stage when the House will have much work to do.</P>
    <P>The Bill should then proceed from assessment to admission. I have concerns regarding the provision which allows the admission of a patient into a psychiatric hospital by a consultant psychiatrist, registered medical practitioner or registered nurse. I would like a medical practitioner or a registered nurse to have a certain number of years training before making such an admission. Our psychiatric service has a huge dependence on non-EU doctors. They occupy almost the entire number of medical posts at non-consultant level. I would not like to see someone who had arrived the previous night from Pakistan deciding whether a patient should be admitted to a psychiatric unit. I would not like to see a recently qualified registered psychiatric nurse doing so either. This provision must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen more in the Bill regarding a programme of treatment for patients. It does not appear to contain a provision giving a statutory right to a programme of treatment. A period of 21 days is a long time before a person comes before the mental health tribunal. If we are to have tribunals for adults, why will we not have them for children? I would like to have seen a statutory requirement for a pre-discharge programme for patients and planning for patients after their discharge.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no community element, the lack of which is one of the most serious deficiencies in the psychiatric service. Planning for the Future was a splendid document. A considerable <Col N="1453" /> number have been discharged from psychiatric institutions but unfortunately money has not been provided for community services. People are trying to provide community services for psychiatrically disturbed patients with inadequate facilities and money. The Bill is concerned with civil liberties. People have a right to their liberty but they also have a right to proper treatment. Despite the improvements the Mental Health Commission will make I would like to see a statutory right to proper treatment. No one wants people to spend an hour longer in hospital than is necessary but there should be a treatment plan for them and a logical follow-up in the community.</P>
    <P>Chapter 7 of the White Paper made very useful recommendations. The same recommendations were made by the Henchy committee in 1978. The Council of Europe also made a recommendation that we should have mental health courts. There is no discussion as to what is to happen to the people who are referred to in section 8(2) as those who are suffering from personality disorders, are socially deviant or addicted to drugs or intoxicants. People like these would have been dealt with by mental health courts.</P>
    <P>We are constantly trying to establish reciprocity and bring our legislation into line with legislation in Northern Ireland. The Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order, 1986, is totally concerned with patients in criminal procedures or under sentence. It is really excellent and I hope to introduce a considerable number of its provisions on Committee Stage in the hope that some amendments might be accepted in order to deal with these people.</P>
    <P>I thought the Bill would include an updated definition of criminal insanity but it does not. At present, if a person is found to be insane, as defined under Irish law, the person will be sent to the Central Mental Hospital but it is extraordinary that there is a waiting list for admission to that hospital. It is serious that people with severe mental disorders will not receive hospital treatment but will be sent to prison instead.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I have received support from many Senators for my view that prison is not a suitable place in which to treat people with mental illness. In a recent Adjournment debate I described the treatment of those brought before the courts for minor offences who can end up in padded cells in Mountjoy and other prisons for days or even weeks in some cases. I am quite sure the Minister does not want such people to be there but neither do the people who are trying to run the prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an entirely unsuitable place in which to hold mentally ill people. There is a psychiatric service in the prisons but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform himself admitted in a debate in this House that the service is totally inadequate. I do not think anyone <Col N="1454" /> would deny that. I am delighted that Senator Lydon is here because he will be able to state how totally inadequate the psychological services are.</P>
      <P>A huge amount of work remains to be done in this regard but it is not covered by the Bill and this is a great disappointment. The Minister said that all this will come about after this Bill has been enacted but it should be recalled that 20 years ago the Mental Health Bill was never enacted. I am not saying that the same thing will happen to this Bill but I am very much against the &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo; attitude. It has not worked out in the past.</P>
      <P>People who are mentally ill and commit offences, no matter how minor, frequently turn up in our prisons because judges have nowhere else to send them. The Judiciary has repeatedly deplored this situation. The state of the Central Mental Hospital is something else. Units to which acutely ill people are admitted have not changed since Queen Victoria was a girl. The hospital was built in 1850, yet it is almost exactly the same now when Queen Victoria's great, great, grandchild is on the throne of England and in her 70s. There is no in-cell sanitation for these acutely ill people, apart from a plastic bucket. This is absolutely unbelievable and there are tiers of wards like this.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, a new unit was opened some years ago where those who are not so ill have been put. However, a great number of these patients could be transferred down the country to allow more room to transfer people from prison to the Central Mental Hospital where they would receive the best form of medical treatment available. It is a pity the Bill does not address the transfer of patients from the Central Mental Hospital to other psychiatric units, although some staff may have become deskilled from treating acutely ill people. We are supposed to be trying to get these people better. Many of them have improved considerably and there should be a system whereby we can transfer them from of the Central Mental Hospital to other units.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions for the treatment of children have been much improved, although I wish they could also be dealt with by way of tribunals. Perhaps we can deal with that matter on Committee Stage. There is a big problem concerning violent adolescents who are mentally ill. The facilities to deal with such children are totally inadequate because there are no secure units to which they can be sent. A £90 million building programme has been announced but when will it happen? I am aware of the difficulties there have been in trying to get even four-bed secure units within our acute general hospitals. There seems to be a blockage everywhere when it comes to obtaining treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a problem for the Department which has to fight its corner on this awful problem. Recently, a general practitioner told me there is a terrible problem in finding sanctuaries for fathers who have been beaten up by their violent adolescent sons. He said that places can be <Col N="1455" /> found for mothers in this situation but it is extremely difficult to find anywhere for fathers.</P>
    <P>It is a good job that the &ldquo;person of unsound mind&rdquo; forms are going because general practitioners have had terrible problems with them. Could we not do more about the admission of patients, be they adults or children? The applicant is nearly always a relation of the patient but the definition of an authorised person within the health board is not very carefully specified either. Could we not expand the definition to include social workers and psychiatric community care nurses? Patients who are admitted involuntarily later return to the person who admitted them, who may be their spouse, father or mother. The social tensions that can arise in such cases are undesirable and, therefore, we should put more thought and time into this matter.</P>
    <P>Admission orders have been much improved but some work remains to be done on them. More needs to be done also in order to build up community psychiatric teams but there is not enough about community care in the Bill. The role of such community work needs to be stressed. In addition, the legislation contains no provision for hostels which are the equivalent of long-stay wards. There is a dreadful problem in getting people accepted from psychiatric institutions back into houses within the community. There has been disgraceful behaviour in Swords concerning people who are being kept in institutions when they could quite easily be living in the community. This area must be tackled more forcefully.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the Bill's provisions for clinical trials. I know this section has been inserted in the legislation to protect involuntary patients from being involved in what one could describe as major clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies. We must remember, however, that if it were not for clinical trials, psychiatrically ill patients would not have benefited from the improvements that have emerged from drug treatments over the past 30 years. Inserting this total ban on clinical trials will prevent us from even having trials on, for example, the value of psychotherapy.</P>
    <P>My secretary, Ms Enda Dowling, who was undertaking some research on my behalf, drew my attention to a recent newspaper article in which someone who is a great enthusiast for fish oils described a trial involving such oils at the University of Sheffield. That trial showed a 25% improvement in the symptoms of patients suffering from schizophrenia. I realise that one cannot just give people things and say, &ldquo;I think they got better&rdquo;. We all live in the age of evidence-based medicine nowadays. Yet if we were to have a total ban on clinical trials we would not even be in a position to give seriously ill people fish oils to see if they made any improvement.</P>
    <P>We may have to arrive at a situation where someone could give consent to such trials if they were felt to be of therapeutic benefit to the pati<Col N="1456" /> ent. After all, the thrust of our deliberations should be to obtain better treatment for patients. There is a principle of reciprocity involved; the State has a duty to provide facilities for the treatment of those whom it deprives of their liberty. It must be ensured that facilities and treatment are available.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the tribunals. Has anyone informed the Minister for Finance about them? The cost will be astronomical. Significant legal aid will have to be paid to a large number of lawyers. Patients will have legal representation but will consultant psychiatrists be represented? That is not clear in the legislation. The tribunals are important but they will only see the patient at a moment in time. What happens if the tribunal decides to discharge a patient following which he or she leaves the premises and commits suicide or a violent crime? Judges and lawyers will be exempt from audit in these scenarios. Must the consultant who is not favour of the discharge of the patient take responsibility for what happens when the patient leaves a psychiatric unit?</P>
    <P>An enormous increase in the number of psychiatrists will be required because some will be needed to sit on the tribunals. The experience in Great Britain when tribunals were introduced was that approximately 60% of patients sought to appear before them. It is good that psychiatrists who have retired within the previous seven years can sit on the tribunals. That at least will mean practising psychiatrists will only have to appear before them. What is the position regarding psychiatrists' clinics when they appear before the tribunals? Surely all their appointments will not be cancelled. A large number of extra staff will be employed as a result.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the clinics of general practitioners who might have to chase around after a patient who does not want to be involuntarily admitted? The last person I knew who had to involuntarily admit a patient had to pursue him along a railway line in Inchicore for a considerable length of time. When the patient eventually agreed to go to hospital he got in the doctor's car but then ran off when they stopped at traffic lights. When he was later captured and it was thought he would go to hospital peacefully a large kitchen knife fell from his sleeve as he was being put into an ambulance. Will doctors be insured by the State while out of their clinics chasing patients? GPs are being asked to take on a great deal of responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I am glad the position of the Garda has been regularised but psychiatric community nurses should become more involved. I do not like the notion of sending staff from the approved centre to bring in a patient because it smacks too much of the men in white coats coming to get somebody. There is no mention of the involvement of the ambulance service which could be considered as a possibility.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage will be interesting because the Department has provided a list of all those who have contacted it. However patients, former <Col N="1457" /> patients, their relatives, numerous GPs and psychiatrists and various organisations have been in touch with me. Promises were made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness regarding the psychiatric services on which I am quite sure the Department of Health and Children would not like to default.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because we will have an opportunity to visit the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage which I hope will be taken before the end of the session. The legislation has been a long time in gestation. It is almost a decade since the White Paper on Mental Health was published and it is not before time that the legislation has come before us. There has not been much merit in the delay but at least an opportunity was provided for widespread consultation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is narrow in focus but is good, promising legislation in terms of what it sets out to do. I welcome the framework proposed, particularly the establishment of the mental health commission and the appointment of an inspector of mental services. These two vital provisions will enable us to work much more systematically towards the betterment of services in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>We must hang our heads in shame in regard to the provision for mentally ill citizens in many cases to date. Earlier I read the report of the Simon Community which was published yesterday. It points out that a minimum of 25% of homeless people on the streets of our cities are mentally ill. That tells its own story. When it was rightly decided to close grim, grey institutions such as Our Lady's Hospital, Cork, no proper provision was made for an alternative system. A promise was made to put a community care package in place to provide a more humane and respectful alternative to the grim, grey institutions but it never materialised. Minuscule provision was made as a result of which people were driven out of institutions which provided a certain security onto the streets.</P>
      <P>The statistics relating to mentally ill people who are homeless on our streets make grim reading. In addition we are regularly reminded by people such as Dr. Smith about the large number of mentally ill people who are incarcerated. This highlights the dearth of provision in terms of proper care for the mentally ill. We must catch up in terms of providing alternative institutions and community care. I hope the legislation and the money that has been promised will at least start a new drive to make up for the lack of provision through the years to look after the mentally ill. To do any less would be a shame and an indictment of all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome a number of provisions in the legislation. The appointment of a commission and an inspector is a significant step in the right direction. Senator Henry will not have to argue like a fish woman in future to have the report of the inspector of mental hospitals debated in the House. She had to do so in the past because it <Col N="1458" /> was not considered a priority. I hope such a debate will become a priority of both Houses in future in order that we will have up-to-date information on the level of provision. Without such information we will not be in a position to make adjustments, vote more money or sanction the recruitment of more staff and therefore make proper provision for the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions for young people who have psychiatric problems. When I was chairperson of an all-party committee juvenile justice was debated and we received reports from a number of sources about young people with psychiatric problems but there was no centre where they could be properly cared for. They were lumped in with other young people in institutions such as Oberstown House where a proper assessment of their needs was not conducted and the care and treatment they needed was not available. Ailments which could have been addressed were left unattended.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill better provision will be made for young people, which is important. It was accepted as part of our culture that once a person was committed, he or she stayed there for the rest of his or her life. There was a tolerance of or a containment approach to mental hospitals in the old days. I hope the new psychological and psychiatric insight we now have means we will adopt a different approach and that we will seek in so far as possible to treat people with a view to putting them back into the community as ordinary citizens like the rest of us. Good things are also happening in this area. Voluntary groups, for example, provide art and crafts in psychiatric hospitals which help to motivate people. They seek to exploit the intellectual gifts of a number of people who are mentally ill and to help them to live a better and more rounded life. I compliment those who do such work.</P>
    <P>We have a narrow focus in this area. However, I take heart from the proposals in this Bill. We must make proper provision in certain areas without delay. We must revisit the area of court judgments, particularly the judgment of guilty but insane because it is unsatisfactory as it currently stands. There are also areas where medical and psychiatric opinion must be examined before sentences are handed down. There is a number of cases, which I will specify on Committee Stage, where proper and adequate psychiatric, psychological or medical opinion should be engaged before a sentence is finalised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is a major step in the right direction. A number of other related steps must be taken quickly if we want to have modern and satisfactory services for our mentally ill people. The key to the success of this Bill is the provision of adequate staffing at every level to ensure that this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important and useful legislation. Things have changed dramatically and radically since the mid-19th century when many psychiatric hospitals were built. While the dark <Col N="1459" /> and dismal buildings with the high walls still exist, they are occupied by groups other than those suffering from mental health disabilities. The policy of the State and of successive Governments has been to deal with mental health issues, where possible, in the community, not in institutions. That is a positive, constructive and worthwhile approach.</P>
      <P>Other speakers mentioned homelessness and that a number of people with mental health problems are beyond the help and care of the institutions, health boards or community welfare officers. It is a shame that there are many homeless people in the country. I understand that a disproportionate number of homeless people in London are Irish and that a significant number of them have mental health problems. That is an issue which must be addressed not just in this country but in cities, such as London. I am not aware of the proposals the Department of Health and Children has to deal with that. Perhaps now is the time to move these issues up the Department's agenda.</P>
      <P>I was a teacher for a number of years and I saw young people of 14 or 15 years of age whose behavioural pattern caused them to be expelled from school and to end up in the courts or on junior liaison officer schemes and eventually in prison. A number of them have disturbed patterns of behaviour. I am talking about people who do not respond to the normal positive pressure from parents and schools. More needs to be done by the Department of Education and Science, rather than the Department of Health and Children, to keep people in society and to stop them from becoming ill. We need constructive and positive intervention at an earlier stage. These young people are readily identified by the schools. There must be liaison between health boards and schools to determine what can be done to help such students.</P>
      <P>One student's parents referred their son to me recently. He had been expelled from his second level school because of his behaviour. He was extremely disturbed. The best the Department of Education and Science could offer was one to one teaching for eight hours a week. However, there were other issues, including mental health issues, which needed to be considered. This problem can be tackled by more and better liaison between the various groups.</P>
      <P>Our mental hospitals or long-term care institutions are extremely well invigilated, according to the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. I acknowledge the many improvements in the system and the professionalism of all the people concerned. Nevertheless, when one visits these hospitals one sees the patients looking into blank space. Many of them have been there all their lives or for a significant portion of them. There is no interaction in many cases between the excellent medical care and the occupational therapy they receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> I received a report recently from the North Eastern Health Board about occupational therapy services in Meath and Louth. There is one vacant occupational therapy post in the mental health services in County Louth while there are two such posts in County Meath. However, both posts in County Meath have been vacant since they were approved four years ago. There are no occupational therapy services for mental health patients in Counties Louth or Meath. That is disgraceful. I am not blaming the health boards which advertised the posts. Are people not getting enough pay or are the work conditions unsatisfactory? What is special about the mental health services that we cannot get occupational therapists to work in them? I ask the Minister of State to carry out and publish a survey on the occupational therapy services in the mental health area in all our health board regions. This area needs special care and attention. Perhaps we need to pay people significantly more to work in the mental health areas. I would be happy to do that to get it right. The current situation is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the importance the Department and the Minister are attaching to the mental health services. I hope my contribution will ensure there is an immediate and serious examination of this issue and a recommendation and result as quickly as possible to ensure those in institutions covered by the mental health services get the attention and care to which they are entitled and deserve.</P>
    <P>According to figures the spend per head in the mental hospitals in each of the health board regions is disproportionate. While I accept that some regions contain more hospitals, the spend per county indicates that the spend in County Louth is much less than in others. There is a need to look at spending on the mental hospital services on a <i>per capita</i> basis to see the reason there is such a disparity at regional and county level.</P>
    <P>In the North Eastern Health Board the trend in recent years has been not to visit the hospitals. Hospital committee meetings and community care committee meetings are held but visits to hospitals have been stopped. I am unhappy with this. The Minister should ascertain if this applies throughout the country or only to the North Eastern Health Board area. Visiting committees should continue to visit, meet and speak to patients in the hospitals. It would at least improve our knowledge of what is happening. I acknowledge the dedication and professionalism of all the caring staff in the hospitals to which there is a need to add.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure and a difficulty to follow Senator Fitzpatrick and Senator Henry on matters like this because they bring so much direct knowledge to the House. Senator Henry cheered me by referring to the Northern Ireland 1986 Mental Health Order because I recall giving instructions to the draftsmen for that legislation. I am glad the Senator thinks it has stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> These are very difficult balances to hold. Previously people were incarcerated far too easily in the old mental hospitals. This was followed by a trend where it became virtually impossible, even in the most difficult situations, to secure an involuntary admission. The 1986 order was intended to deal with this in a way that at the same time asserted and protected the human rights of the patient.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily concerned with protecting and asserting the rights of the patient which I favour. Like other speakers I regard it as nothing more than a building block towards a more fully developed legislative approach to mental health and mental health services. We would have expected a response to other parts of the White Paper but while it would not be helpful to recast the Bill so as to make it encyclopaedic, I hope the Minister does not regard it as the last word on the issue.</P>
    <P>I am less worried than Senator Fitzpatrick or Senator Henry about section 8. It is a question of definitions and exclusions to be read in the context of section 3. However, while I welcome the Mental Health Commission as a wonderful development &ndash; I hope it is given full support, resources and powers &ndash; I am concerned that the commission and the tribunal will be established virtually side by side. That may cause difficulty in European legislation. European courts increasingly insist that those who make quasi-judicial findings should be separate from those who make executive decisions. It may be possible to proceed by ensuring there are different personnel in each of the two structures.</P>
    <P>The commission should be viewed as an important instrument for driving up standards, ensuring registration and that patients and staff are properly looked after and trained and that modern standards of care and treatment apply. The tribunal is somewhat different. It protects the human rights of the patient. It is more judicial in scope and I am less worried than Senator Henry about it becoming some kind of monster staffed by predatory barristers and others. That has not been the experience in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>More attention should be given to adolescent psychiatry. When children are being seen it should be specified that those who express views on them should be qualified in adolescent psychiatry. In this regard I reiterate the importance other Senators have attached to the community psychiatric nurse as a resource.</P>
    <P>It might be worthwhile to sometimes think in terms of the potential for cross-Border co-operation. It may be that in aspects such as the provision of secure accommodation, especially provision for adolescents who need psychiatric care, there should be at least one place on the island. Services are deficient, both North and South, and there is much to be said for aligning the legislation to ensure patients can be admitted to the most convenient facility or location to them.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there has not been greater provision for the question of diversion, the treatment <Col N="1462" /> of people from prisons and keeping those out of prisons who should not be there. Perhaps it is an issue for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am sure the Minister and other Senators have received, as I have, representations from the Irish Prison Reform Group which I commend. Prison is not the place for many of those who are there.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the higher levels of involuntary admission in Ireland than elsewhere. This is largely true. However I advise against regarding Italy as a desirable place to emulate because it is still suffering from the disastrous results of a radical programme, <i>Psychiatrica Domestica,</i> introduced some years ago.</P>
    <P>It is ultimately a question of resources. It is hugely important that we do not finish up with nothing other than what may be described as a nice Act. If these provisions are to be carried out, they will require considerable resources. I hope they will be available. However I commend the Minister and his Department on introducing the Bill. It is a very good model in terms of what it sets out to do. It may be improved on Committee Stage but we would all like to think it is not the Minster's last word on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but the congratulations are a little over-emphasised because it is minimalist and also a reaction to two significant factors. The first factor was the decision in the Croke case in the European Court of Human Rights recently where the Government conceded that existing mental health legislation did not provide an independent formal review of involuntary detentions, contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. It also had to pay a substantial sum of cash to Mr. Croke in the case.</P>
      <P>The second factor is the criticism of the Government by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva for providing for involuntary detention for up to 28 days before the review became necessary. The Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, said another look would be taken at that provision.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes tribunals that will consist of a psychiatrist who will sit with a legal assessor, but there is no provision for a lay person, a move that was sought. One must wonder from where the members of the tribunal will come and how they will be financed. The solicitor who took the case to Europe is on record as saying that they will need to recruit and train solicitors, paid for by the public purse, as each patient will be entitled to be represented by a solicitor. The real question is not when the legislation will be passed &ndash; that will be soon &ndash; but when it will be brought into full operation and properly financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the many submissions made. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties made a pointed submission in which it stated that the Bill deals solely with involuntary admissions which can, because of the circumstances in hospitals, occasionally become a blurred matter. The provision for a review of detention within 28 <Col N="1463" /> days is meaningless and falls significantly short of the seven day period recommended in the White Paper on Mental Health. If one looks at the figures for 1997, they indicate that 71% of voluntary patients were released within a month. A 28 day review period means nothing. The Bill is not as comprehensive as one might have assumed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that Members on the Government side of the House, particularly Senator Fitzpatrick, who has a clear professional acquaintance with this area, and Senator Quill welcomed the Bill but said it did not go far enough. I also want information on why such a high proportion of admissions in Ireland are of an involuntary nature, which is uncharacteristic of the rest of the European Union. This aspect concerns many of us. However, I welcome the establishment of the commission and the review.</P>
    <P>One point may be considered minor, but it should be considered, particularly in the light of recent court cases. The Government has rejected amendments that would lead to the possibility of treatment for patients in the Gaeltacht in the Irish language. Is the Government serious about this matter because somebody who is unwell needs to be able to deal with medical practitioners in the language with which he or she is most familiar, particularly if it involves a mental illness which may include communication difficulties?</P>
    <P>Another problem relates to the definition of a child. We are told that a child is anybody under the age of 18 years unless he or she is married. Apparently, the act of marriage immediately transforms one into an adult. This is a slightly bizarre proposition, particularly from my point of view, and it is a pity.</P>
    <P>A further issue relates to children refusing to give consent and what can be done in such a dangerous situation. Section 25 radically changes the application procedure that was proposed in the White Paper. There is no reference to the need for a medical psychiatric assessment prior to the health board applying to the court for an order to detain a child in an approved centre. It states that if it appears to a health board that a child has a mental disorder and one or both parents fail to consent to making an application under section 8 in respect of the child, the board can go ahead. On the recommendation of the consultant psychiatrist, the child can be detained in an approved centre for 28 days with extensions by three, six and 12 months. However, there is also provision for an <i>ex parte</i> application to be made where the court could direct the admission on an interim basis of a child without any prior medical or psychiatric opinion.</P>
    <P>There are specific concerns with regard to people under 18 years of age. They could find themselves detained in a psychiatric unit, in either an adult or an age appropriate facility, without a prior medical or psychiatric assessment. They are denied an automatic right to have a voice in the process of their admission and detention. They <Col N="1464" /> are also denied access to a tribunal, a member of which will be a consultant psychiatrist who provides an independent psychiatric opinion. There is no automatic provision for them to have legal representation and they are denied the opportunity afforded to adult patients under section 59 to participate in decisions about their treatment beyond the initial three months detention.</P>
    <P>I referred to the issue of consent during the debate on another Bill yesterday. This legislation indicates that my concern was correct. There should be an examination of the principle of consent rather than the arbitrary age related provision. There has been a major debate in Britain about this issue as a result of a series of cases in the courts. They have been in favour of supporting parental authority to override the child's refusal of consent for essential treatment. At least there has been a debate in England; there has not been such a debate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mental health legislation should be used irrespective of age. Conduct disorders should be included in section 7(2) to ensure that children and adolescents who are out of control are not inappropriately detained in psychiatric facilities. It should not be an absolute requirement that both parents should give consent. The exclusion of young people from the safeguards which are central to the proposed legislation must be in conflict with the United Nations principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>There are many problems with the legislation in terms of aspects that are not covered, for example, diversionary schemes. It was stated in the White Paper that there would be diversionary schemes for mentally ill people who, by virtue of their illness, would otherwise be put in prison for relatively minor public order offences. If this had been included, it would have brought Irish legislation into conformity with the European convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, recognised this problem in a reply to an Adjournment debate. He accepted there were indications that an increasing number of vulnerable and mentally disordered people were being committed to prison. He continued that, in this regard, there is a risk that prison may be used as a refuge of last resort by the courts for some mentally disordered people who may be charged with public order offences that are by-products of their illness.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would be beneficial if such minor offenders could be given medical treatment either on an out patient basis in the community or, <i>in extremis</i>, in a hospital until their condition stabilised. However, there is no provision for this in the Bill. Such a provision was contained in chapter 7 of the White Paper. The paper suggested that judges should accept medical opinion from the health board before sentencing and, where possible, divert to the community services. In the Bill, the screening process by the <Col N="1465" /> Judiciary no longer exists. Furthermore, section 12 appears to place undue reliance on the decisions of the Garda in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record a statement from a distinguished child psychiatrist who contacted me. On the issue of prisons as an answer to the problem she stated:</P>
    <P>Mentally dysfunctional people who end up in prison tend to act even more dysfunctionally in prison. Prison life perpetuates a cycle of trouble-making from which a mentally ill prisoner cannot escape because there is not the appropriate medical treatment. There is now evidence that instead of proper treatment in prison, a prisoner is likely to be put in solitary confinement. The recent Penal Reform Trust report, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, revealed that the medical services are so inadequate that prison staff have no option but to put sick prisoners in solitary confinement for an inordinate length of time &ndash; one prisoner for as long as 20 days out of 33.</P>
    <P>It is bizarre that society would respond to somebody who is mentally unwell by jamming him or her into prison but, because of a lack of facilities, not provide any treatment. This aspect needs to be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are also problems with the definitions, for example, the definitions of parents and spouse. It includes cohabitees of longer than three years duration, but it excludes cohabitees of the same sex. This is probably contrary to Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights which will soon be incorporated into Irish law. There are a number of difficulties in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Schizophrenia Society of Ireland briefed many Members and indicated that there are difficulties with the 28 day review proposal. It has particular concerns about prisoners with mental health problems who are not covered properly by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I received a communication from a qualified social worker who pointed out that in Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland, professional social workers are employed as authorised officers. Intensive training is given before these workers are legally empowered to make arrangements for involuntary admission. In the Bill, community welfare officers are being allowed to make these applications. Social workers should be properly trained and appointed in this respect.</P>
    <P>I echo the concerns about the involvement of the Garda Síochána. I have the height of regard for the Garda Síochána, but they are simply not trained in this regard. If they are to be involved, the State has an obligation to provide them with training that would make them capable of making such decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It has taken a long time but is worthwhile. There are a number of aspects to it that must be improved, even after its passage through the Dáil. In section 8, those suffering from personality disorders, the socially deviant, and those addicted to drugs or intoxicants are referred to. The term &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; needs to be defined if it is to be used. Depending on which psychiatric textbook one reads, the number of personality disorders varies. Are borderline personality disorders included? This must be clarified.</P>
      <P>The reason that personality disorders are included at all is that it is so difficult to treat them. I think psychiatrists have shoved the problem aside. I have seen cases over 30 years in which psychopaths have been cured, not merely helped. Some may have argued that this was not possible.</P>
      <P>There is a very successful programme running at the moment in Cluain Mhuire Family Centre, run by psychologist Liz Lawlor, who is helping people with personality disorders. There are also a few more psychiatrists in Dublin who treat such disorders successfully. The problem is that the work is so intensive and unrewarding. This refers to cases of admission to hospital. I can think of one case pertaining to a woman who suffered from a paranoid personality &ndash; she did not have paranoid psychosis but suffered from morbid jealousy. Her health deteriorated, as did that of her family, to the extent that she had to be hospitalised. She might have had to be hospitalised for depression or anxiety, but she was hospitalised because of a personality disorder. That must be made clear.</P>
      <P>There are many issues in the Bill that will have to be discussed further on Committee Stage. Let us look at section 48, which deals with tribunals. There is nothing wrong as such, but one must know if the decision of a tribunal has to be unanimous. How are differences of opinion resolved? Does one member have a deciding vote? If a barrister or solicitor has the deciding vote, the psychiatrist becomes an adviser to a tribunal, one whose opinion may or may not be considered. The psychiatrist's opinion could coincide with that of a treating psychiatrist, but both could be over-ruled by a barrister or solicitor. Tribunals in other jurisdictions allow for more than two members, in which case a majority opinion can obtain. We must examine this more closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider section 49(20). Many patients are detained under the Mental Health Act solely for the purpose of crisis intervention. The certificate is often lifted after a few days when the patient agrees to stay in hospital as a voluntary patient. Other patients may be discharged before a tribunal can review their retention. In such cases, <Col N="1467" /> the treating psychiatrist has no authority to compel the patient's attendance. I may be wrong.</P>
    <P>Section 59 alludes to a second consultant not being allowed to review the choice of medication. Suppose a second consultant cannot review the choice of medication and that the first one is a world authority. Certain legal and ethical problems arise. If a colleague were to refuse to authorise a particular medication, should the first consultant continue to treat the patient?</P>
    <P>The guidelines of the Medical Council are very pertinent in this regard. What happens if the second opinion is contrary to the first and the patient proceeds to commit suicide or homicide? Is the second opinion open to a suit of negligence? Would any self-respecting consultant undertake this role? The medical legal position on a consultant refusing to carry out treatment is that it is an unprofessional act. Will the ultimate outcome be the suffering of the patients involved? The section does not answer these questions adequately.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have to say has been said by the Minister of State. The rest will have to be considered on Committee Stage. It is a very important Bill and I would hate to see it being passed without due consideration because it has so many implications for treating psychiatrists and other health professionals, as well as for patients.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; is too broad and requires definition. Remember that it is only a few years since homosexuals were regarded as psychiatrically ill. Fortunately, we have abandoned this perspective. There are other provisions in the Bill that are delicate, to say the least. We are not dealing with clear-cut matters in some areas, but the definitions need to be clear because the mental health and well-being of people is at stake. The Bill represents a step forward, but many questions still have to be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill's late arrival to the House. Despite its narrow scope and many shortcomings, I hope it will be speedily passed and, more importantly, that the various sections will be brought into effect by the Minister without undue delay. Legislation on this subject seems to proceed at a snail's pace and some may think my wish unrealistic.</P>
      <P>I am not an expert on mental health, unlike some Members. I was delighted to hear Senator Maurice Hayes relating his experiences in the North of Ireland. I freely admit that most of what I know about the subject I have learned from debates in this House and from the annual reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Senator Henry has requested on many occasions that the latter be debated more thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector's reports have made me increasingly uneasy, not only because of the truly dreadful conditions and the inadequate level of care in the mental health system. Terrifying as those <Col N="1468" /> matters are, they are merely symptomatic of a wider problem. Put crudely, the problem is that there are no votes to be gained from addressing the issue of mental health. I listened to Senator Henry today, who gave the impression that only European demands and the demands of the European Commissioner are pushing forward our legislation. This is why mental health is the Cinderella of our health system, as someone said recently.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks, we have been given a glimpse behind the scenes. I find very credible the judgments of the top civil servants in the Department of Health and Children, which claim the service is chronically under-funded and has been in the past. In such a context, what gets done is what people scream loudest about. Very few scream about mental health, with some exceptions in this House, despite the work of some lobby groups and a few dedicated legislators. Their voices are simply drowned out in the general clamour from the public about the widespread inadequacies in the health service. That makes me very uneasy.</P>
    <P>The test of a democracy, especially a republic where the people are sovereign, should not be about who can shout loudest but about looking after as best it can the needs of all its people. A democracy should give special priority to those who, through no fault of their own, are not properly able to look after themselves and their own needs or to care for themselves. If we were being truly democratic and republican, we would put the needs of mental health patients first, instead of letting them trail in last, as we have done for many years. Our national priorities on mental health are upside down.</P>
    <P>There is one reason I deplore the narrow scope of the Bill which is framed and focused almost entirely on the issue of involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals. Given that the main existing legislation affecting this area is, I was amazed to see, 56 years on the Statute Book and given that the White Paper on mental health was published as far back as 1995 the Bill is hardly an adequate response to a very real and pressing need.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tackle the issue from two angles. We need to clean up our act and review the whole issue of mental health, to start from scratch as it were, in creating a healthcare system for this area. The need for such a root and branch look at the way in which we deal with mental health is borne out by two recent statements, both of which require our special attention.</P>
    <P>The first was by the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, who said that in his estimation up to half of the inmates of Mountjoy Prison should not be there at all but were in need of psychiatric care. A total of 5%, 10% or 15% would have been serious but he said 50%. To say that half of all Mountjoy inmates are basically in the wrong place is a shocking indictment of how we approach the question of mental health.</P>
    <P>The second statement was made in recent days by Mr. Greg Maxwell of the Simon Community. <Col N="1469" /> He had another startling figure to offer. He estimated that fully a quarter of homeless people using the Simon hostels were suffering from serious psychiatric problems, serious enough to warrant their receiving continuous care in a psychiatric hospital but that is not all, he also said that when all the cases of mental problems among the homeless were taken into account the proportion of those affected would probably rise to about one half. It seems that this shows the downside to the popular phrase, &ldquo;care in the community&rdquo;. If &ldquo;care in the community&rdquo; literally means throwing people out on the streets, perhaps the time has come for us to rethink our approach. If &ldquo;care in the community&rdquo; is simply a cloak for the State washing its hands of those who need its services most of all, that time has certainly come.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by what I received &ndash; I am sure a number of others also received it &ndash; from the Schizophrenia Ireland group. It used a term which rang a bell in my mind with regard to the environment. We use the term &ldquo;the polluter should pay&rdquo;, it uses the term &ldquo;the detainer should prove that there is a need to detain somebody who is involuntarily locked up&rdquo;. From that point of view it seems that there is a very strong case to be made to do so at the earliest possible date. I welcome as it does the fact that the Minister in the other House reduced the length of time where a review has to take place from 28 days to 21. Will the Minister consider reviewing his thoughts on the matter at this stage and reduce it to seven days for somebody involuntarily held? In other words, the detainer should have to prove that a person has to be detained and they should do so in seven days rather than 21.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill on the understanding that it represents a small step forward but our focus now needs to turn to the rest of the journey. We have a long way to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate. It is fair to say that there is broad agreement that the Bill marks an improvement on what is already there. There are lacunae and much more to be done. The Minister said in the Dáil that he will be coming back to this issue again and that there will be a review within five years of the whole Bill.</P>
      <P>There are recurring issues that came up with most speakers, of which child and adolescent psychiatry is one of the major ones. This is an area that needs more attention. A lot of money is being put into the sector but it will take some time to deliver a good system. Each of the health boards received money recently to improve this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that psychiatry of old age was also mentioned. It is a very important area, one in which I have an interest. We are appointing more psychiatrists of old age throughout the <Col N="1470" /> country, at least one in every health board. We will have more than this as time passes.</P>
    <P>Suicide prevention was mentioned by Senator Jackman. Since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998 there has been a positive and committed response in the statutory and voluntary sectors on ways of tackling the problem which is multi-focal and one that we need to address. I am sure it has been dealt with previously in the House on numerous occasions. It is one to which more attention is being devoted and on which I hope there will be progress.</P>
    <P>Attention deficit disorder was also alluded to. The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry was published in March 2001. It contains proposals for the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hyperactivity kinetic disorders. It is therefore another area that is receiving attention.</P>
    <P>Everybody brought up the issue of services for prisoners. I agree that the most appropriate place in which to treat prisoners with psychiatric problems is in the setting of the prison. Many speakers said many people in prison should not be there in the first place because it is mainly psychiatric problems that they have and that we should be treating their psychiatric problems, not just dumping them in prison. I am sure the matter will come up again on Committee Stage when there will be a major discussion on it.</P>
    <P>Homelessness was another issue raised. A large number of people who are homeless have psychiatric disorders. We must remember with regard to the changeover in our psychiatric services and the improvement in community services that those who did go out into the community did not give rise to the same problems as in the United Kingdom with regard to homelessness among those who had been discharged from psychiatric hospitals. The problem here is primarily one of people who are homeless having psychiatric problems. They have not been in psychiatric institutions and discharged later into the community.</P>
    <P>Many other issues were raised, especially by Senator Maurice Hayes who brought up the interesting point of further co-operation, North and South, with which I agree. I agree with the Senator when he says that we do not have to be unduly worried about the tribunals, as Senator Henry appeared to be. Adolescent psychiatry services need much improvement. Senator Norris brought up some points about the Irish language which he said should be brought up again on Committee Stages regarding the terms in regard to consent. The Senator highlighted some interesting points in regard to children and consent.</P>
    <P>Most speakers were happy enough that for the first time something was being done in regard to mental health to which Senator Quinn alluded to as the Cinderella of the healthcare system as it has been for years. More attention has been paid to mental illness in recent years. I thank <Col N="1471" /> Dr. Walsh who has done tremendous work for the psychiatric services during the years in highlighting deficiencies in the system.</P>
    <P>For the first time we are taking the issue of mental illness very seriously. As the Senator said, it should be at the top instead of the bottom of the list. It has also been pointed out that it is not sensible to discuss mental health services if we do not allocate the resources to them. I am pleased that an enormous amount of additional resources have been put in over the past three years in comparison with previous years.</P>
    <P>Services in the community are constantly improving. The way forward in the long term is to improve psychiatric health services in the community and the basic structure of our psychiatric hospitals.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) The Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts, 1979 to 1999 and this Act in so far as they relate to Údarás elections may be cited together as the Údarás na Gaeltachta Elections Acts, 1979 to 2001 and shall be read together as one.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This a straightforward, self-explanatory amendment. It is designed to ensure that Údarás elections are covered by this legislation and its provisions and that the Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts, 1979 to 1999, and this Act be cited together and should be read together as one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to include a reference to the Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts, 1979 to 1999, in section 1, which provides for collective citations. There is a number of references in the Bill to Údarás na Gaeltachta elections but none of the Údarás Acts is to be amended in this case. The Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts form a separate legislative code and while they are referred to in the Electoral Act, 1992, a citation is not included in that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> This is not a matter over which we should fall out. If the Senator agrees to withdraw this amendment, I will raise the matter again with the parliamentary counsel to be absolutely certain and, if necessary, I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage. The advice I have received is that the amendment is not necessary as we are not amending the Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts.</P>
    <P>I should explain the situation concerning the number of official amendments to the Bill. They fall broadly into three categories. There are normal drafting amendments which are to improve or to clarify the text. There are 53 amendments to Part 3, which has to do with electronic voting etc. These are mostly very minor drafting amendments. There is a large number because the Bill was drafted before the tendering procedures were finalised in relation to the electronic voting system and before the preferred supplier was chosen. The type of system chosen gives rise to changes and modifications in some sections of the Bill. There are also amendments to Part 4 of the Bill dealing with new limits on political donations and related matters. I hope to circulate these latter amendments early next week. We will discuss them in detail when we get to Part 4 of the Bill in two weeks' time.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, but in Part 1 of the Bill, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. A political party, the President, a member of either House of the Oireachtas, of the European Parliament, of a local authority or of Údarás na Gaeltachta, or a candidate for any of the said offices, shall not directly or indirectly accept a donation for political (including electoral) purposes from any person (including a body corporate) other than a Dáil elector.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has explained the grouping of his amendments and I must comment on the manner in which we are dealing with Committee Stage and the amendments. It is appropriate to do so in the context of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 as they refer to the issue of political donations.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to Part 4 of the Bill and particularly to the issue of new limits on political donations. That is at the heart of this legislation. It is not right for us to split Committee Stage of the Bill as we are doing. My complaint is not about time factors, it is that we do not have the full list of what are substantial amendments on a major section of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 would probably be grouped with amendments in Part 4 of the Bill if we had those amendments. We are to have a debate now on political donations, but we will have to return to the same matter after the Government has published its amendments.</P>
      <P>This is not the right way to deal with legislation. We should see the Bill as a whole and debate it in that fashion. A Committee Stage with a large number of amendments can lead to a fractured debate. Members on this side of the House are blind to the views of the Government on this central issue. We cannot have a proper, comprehensive debate on this issue without reference to the thinking of the Government.</P>
      <P>There has been agreement on approaching Committee Stage in this way but I have reservations about it. I do not think this is the right way to proceed. However, at this stage, I will confine my remarks to the issue of political donations and to the amendment which the Labour Senators have tabled.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of corporate donations to political parties, and to individuals in parties, is one which currently dominates political discourse. I do not have to point out that it has done so for the past couple of years. Revelations have come to us by way of the tribunals. This week further revelations point out to us as politicians what we clearly know, that the issue of corporate donations to individuals and political parties must be dealt with. Unresolved, the issue hangs like a black cloud over politics. It continues to undermine public confidence in politics and politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party, having received its strongest ever mandate, entered government in 1992 and brought with it a programme of reform. The programme was supported by our partners in <Col N="1474" /> Government, Fianna Fáil and in the latter part of that Administration by Fine Gael and Democratic Left. The elements of the programme sought to reform Irish politics and to bring about a degree of modernisation. It also sought to bring to the fore the very important issue of the separation of business and politics. Thus, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was enacted, despite much resistance. I was working as a political adviser at the time and I remember that some individuals, now no longer Members of the Oireachtas, had particular difficulty with the idea of the public having access to and knowledge of a politician's business affairs. To some extent, and although thinking has changed considerably on this matter, one could understand where that came from. The thinking was that politicians could separate their business and political lives and that the public could see that separation. That was based on a high degree of trust, not only in the individual but also in the party they represented and that party's other members. As we know, that trust is broken. It has been blown apart by the activities of a small number of politicians.</P>
    <P>It is well established that the need to separate business and politics is of paramount importance. It has been done in other democracies and it is being done here. We are still going through the process, the first element of which was the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Other elements have been electoral Acts, agreed by all parties in previous Administrations. It has led to not only the register of Members' interests but also to a declaration of spending at elections and, for the first time, a limit on the amount which can be spent in general or by-elections. We have come to the point of accepting that in principle. The issue of corporate donations to political parties remains to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that trust has been broken. There is no need to recite the long list of reasons that is the case. The acceptance of donations by a small number of politicians and the perception in the public mind that that was inevitably and potentially linked to decisions made by them must be tackled. I will comment no further on that because I believe it is quite rightly in the realm of the tribunals. The tribunals have asked the media not to make judgments before they have fully reported and we should also adhere to that. In the public mind there have been occasions in political life where money bought influence. As well as taking that into account we must also act on it.</P>
    <P>In the 1997 general election, when I stood for the first time as a Labour Party candidate, I proposed that the party should support a complete ban on political donations and advocate the idea of State funding for political parties, that we should support the entire separation of business and politics. At that time the idea was considered to be radical and unlikely to gain public support. Since then the public, and most members of political parties, have gradually and inevitably come <Col N="1475" /> around to the view that it is necessary to end the practice of corporate donations and address the issue of State funding for parties. While there is a suggestion that a donation made to a candidate, politician or party could be seen to have bought influence, public trust cannot be restored.</P>
    <P>We must go as far as we can to ensure that there is a full separation of business and politics. The only way to do that is to end the practice of corporate donations, to severely limit the practice of personal donations and to have full transparency and accountability on spending by parties and candidates. In addition, the limits on election time spending should be relatively low. The Labour Party is anxious that this legislation specifically incorporates our views on this issue. This amendment is the first of several on political donations which we shall table.</P>
    <P>This debate is being held, in effect, in a vacuum. We do not know the Government's thinking on this. Presumably the Minister will tell me that he will publish amendments next week. I have no way of responding to that and therefore we cannot have the full Committee Stage debate &ndash; unless, that is, the Minister gives us an indication today what Government thinking is on this matter. If he does, I will very much welcome it. We cannot move forward without a full view of the Government's thinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little bit of history as to why we are here this afternoon. Last Friday I discovered there were in the region of 90 Government amendments to this Bill. I objected to the proposal to discuss the Bill on Tuesday without giving the Opposition an opportunity to look at the amendments. At that stage I thought we would be looking at the entire Bill, not three-quarters of it. The debate was changed to today to allow time to look at those amendments. I thought we would be dealing with all the amendments. Since that is not the case, my colleagues in the Labour Party and I availed of the opportunity to focus on the highlight of the Bill, namely, the part to which members of the public will pay most attention. While the concept of electronic voting and tallying is attractive to the public and the media, the reality is that people are more interested in considering political donations as a form of undue influence. That is the pivotal point of the Bill. It is a pity we do not have the opportunity today to consider all aspects of this matter and to discover the Minister's thinking in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 3 is not structured in nature. It could not be structured because it cannot respond unless there is something in place to which it can respond. Like Senator O'Meara, I hope that by next week, if he does not inform us about it today, we will have a good indication of the nature of the Minister's thinking. By the following week we will, at least, be able to table amendments or adjust those put down. We may not have to table amendments if the Minister <Col N="1476" /> comes around to our way of thinking, which, we believe, is the right way.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the American system in which recognised professional lobby groups operate. In the US House of Representatives and Senate, there are Congressmen and Senators who represent particular companies or industries. For example, some of these representatives are strong supporters of the tobacco industry and arms manufacturers. One might say that surely this practice should be condemned, but it is somewhat more honest because people know exactly what and whom these individuals represent. I am not saying that is good practice, but it is more honest than not knowing the origin of donations or the purposes, political or personal, for which they will be used.</P>
    <P>We know the current position in respect of this matter and Senator O'Meara outlined how we have reached this point. Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party and, subsequently, Fine Gael and the Labour Party made moves towards ensuring that the public's view of politics would change. As this was happening, further revelations emerged. These revelations have had such an impact that there is a great deal of fear in local government circles about making amendments to zonings etc. because people do not want to be accused of being on the take. I recently attended a local authority meeting at which a member of one party pointed at a group of other politicians and said, &ldquo;I know why you are recommending those changes, I know what is in it for you.&rdquo; If members of the public do not believe anything to be amiss, they will certainly change their minds when politicians make accusations against each other. It is sad it has come to that.</P>
    <P>As a trade or profession, politics has not been held in high regard throughout history. Considering what has happened in recent years, however, I did not know its stock would fall so low. We are responsible for bringing it down to its current level. The attachment to big business is part of the problem. The sooner we detach ourselves from big business the better things will be for everyone because the accusations will cease. I accept it is impossible to legislate for all matters, but it should be possible to legislate to prevent political donations of the type to which I refer. Such donations may be made behind closed doors and there is nothing we can do about that other than to hope that those involved will be caught.</P>
    <P>We must enshrine in legislation that those involved in big business, large corporations with their own agendas and viewpoints, builders or developers do not run the country and are not responsible for the decisions taken by these Houses or by any local authority throughout the country. The representatives of the people are responsible for doing so and they are guided in their judgment by what they believe to be right. It is for that reason I tabled my amendment, which is being taken in conjunction with the Labour Party's amendment. It is sad that these amendments are being taken now, out of context. <Col N="1477" /> Will the Minister provide an indication of his thinking in respect of donations from corporate bodies or any large group seeking to exercise undue influence? Will he also indicate whether he agrees with the two amendments that have been tabled and state whether he will support them? If he does so, we will know what we must do next week with regard to the most substantial aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The motivation behind the amendments and the stated objective of both Senators is to try to see if politics can be restored to a higher level of regard. Democracy in general is a tender flower and requires to be constantly nourished. Where it has failed or been replaced by some other form of Government, the unfortunate consequences have been all too apparent. Everyone in the Chamber shares the Senators' objective.</P>
      <P>The two amendments deal specifically with how the political system should be funded in the future. There is a number of issues which arise in respect of this important matter. Both amendments seem to make a distinction between corporate donations and individual donations. I have great difficulty comprehending what is that distinction. In general, corporate Ireland is governed by the boards and shareholders of companies, many of them private. Regardless of whether a company or a director makes a contribution, it is difficult to separate or make a distinction between the two. There was a recent example at one of the tribunals regarding individual donations. I believe that all the parties in this House received contributions from Denis O'Brien. It does not matter whether the donation was made by him or one of his companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, there is a danger that we can make political footballs out of issues of this nature. That is regrettable because this is an issue in respect of which we must work together to find a solution. I do not believe it applies to Members of this House, but some of the party leaders in the Dáil have tended to try to engage in a purely political campaign in respect of this matter. It would be better if people engaged in a process to reach a consensus on what is best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined to attribute a great deal of the public's disenchantment with politics to what is emerging from the tribunals. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in the western hemisphere. For example, people's reaction to the general election campaign and politicians in Britain is no different from what is happening here. This debate boils down to whether taxpayers should fund the entire political system or whether the base should be broadened beyond that. It would not be good, either for the system or taxpayers, if we found ourselves in the former scenario. Taxpayers have suffered enough and have had to pick <Col N="1478" /> up the tab for many things. I do not necessarily deny that they should, through the Exchequer, make some contribution to the political system, but the level of that contribution should not be 100%.</P>
    <P>Corporate Ireland has been doing exceptionally well as a result of the enlightened economic policies that have been followed for the past 14 or 15 years. I see nothing wrong with corporate Ireland engaging in some form of pay-back to the political system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation in place requires individuals and parties to make annual declarations. Companies are also obliged to make declarations of any contributions made. That ultimately is the real safeguard. Perhaps there is a need to place a limit on individual and corporate donations, of which I argue strongly in favour. The amendment in the name of Senator Coogan excludes trade unions to which I have no doubt Senator O'Meara would strongly object.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>She would not. She agrees with it. However the Labour Party has objected to it until now and its leader is on record as doing so. The issue should be examined on the basis of full transparency, something I believe to be in place.</P>
      <P>I would make one distinction where corporate donations are concerned, that is, that it is an entitlement of members of the public, be they individual or corporate, to make a contribution where they believe the general policies being pursued are good practice and create the culture and climate for business to succeed and prosper. There is nothing wrong with this. It generates employment and creates jobs. We have a good record in Ireland of doing this.</P>
      <P>Our economy is the role model for many emerging east European democracies to develop their economies. Much of this is to the credit of those in Government who ensured various incentives and policies encouraged investment and job creation to the point where we have reached the position of full employment and a labour shortage. The opposite was the case 15 or 16 years ago. In such a climate there is nothing wrong with allowing people who are of a mind to do so to make contributions to the political system on an individual or corporate basis. Perhaps the limits should be examined before they are put in place.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments. Senator Walsh made the case for supporting them. There is no such thing as a free lunch. If we are into pay back time, what will the public say about this? If the corporations which have benefited from the successful economy in Ireland are to pay back for the economic climate which has developed in the past 14 years, could they not make donations to teachers, for example? Some say the corporations made their money because of the education their employees received. What about their paying teachers?</P>

      <P>It is a flawed argument that we must run our democracy by shaping it to suit the better-off.</P>
      <P>I, above all others, could do with donations from organisations but, alas, none has ever approached me with any. This proves that donations are only given to those who are seen to have political power and not to those who merely criticise. Donations are made to those who are in a position to do something for the donor by changing legislation, introducing regulations or allowing certain tax exemptions.</P>
      <P>I do not know if other Senators have attended the Moriarty or Flood tribunals but I attended them last year. The public galleries for both tribunals were packed with ordinary citizens who had grim faces because they were not pleased with what was being exposed. What has been shown to have happened in the various revelations made before both tribunals in the interim must make them look even more cross.</P>
      <P>All countries are trying to clean up their act in order that there will be a definite division between the promotion of political agendas and the business community. There is no such thing as a free lunch and there is always a pay back time, as Senator Walsh said. It appears to be constantly pay back time in Ireland as we discover that huge amounts were given to politicians by persons and corporations. I would love to know if the shareholders of those corporations knew this was happening and, if they did, what they thought about it. Now is the time to strike a blow for democracy and, for example, insist that much more limited amounts be spent on elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has ever had it said to him but I have had it frequently said to me by Americans, both politicians and members of the public, that we should try not to let matters go the way of American elections where the richest person wins. That is deplorable. They even <Col N="1480" /> have elections for the local dog catcher. It has reached the stage of financially run elections rather than elections on the policies put forward. I hope the Minister accepts one or other of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The two amendments propose to ban political donations to parties, public representatives and candidates at elections. There is nothing in them to ban political donations to other groups which might decide they want to influence elections, referendums or other matters. That is one serious flaw in the amendments.</P>
      <P>We are all involved in politics and believe in it as an important public service. In the regrettable times in which we live given the revelations coming from tribunals, it is always important to try to maintain a balance in how we deal with what has happened. I am sure no one would disagree with me in the context of what is happening and what has been revealed by the tribunals that we are talking about individuals within the political system who have abused their position of trust. No one has yet levelled an accusation, other than for political reasons, that the political system is corrupt. This is an important distinction. The revelations coming from the tribunals horrify the public, as Senator Henry said, and people are not happy. However I am sure the Senator would agree with me when I say that the looks on the faces of people in both Houses of the Oireachtas as these revelations came out were even more shocked than those on the faces of members of the public. It is important we maintain a sense of proportion.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that all of us in public life should try to ensure any wrongdoing is revealed and that people are punished for this but that we should not feed the group which wants to tar every politician and all politics with the same brush. That would be unfair to the vast majority of Members of both Houses. It is not a political point to say &ndash; it would be the case if the political boot switched foot &ndash; that unfortunately we tend to try to make political capital from these revelations and in so doing lose sight of the damage we do to the political system and people on all sides of both Houses who do not condone the type of activity which took place.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of the amendments will be discussed in conjunction with Part 4 of the Bill. They deal with amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997. I have made my views on the issue known on a number of occasions, including the occasion of the debate on Second Stage in this House. When the Bill was published in December 2000 I promised new controls on political donations and provision for the opening of special donations accounts by public representatives. I will be publishing amendments to give effect to this commitment in the course of the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Meara and Coogan have asked me to give the House information on these amendments. Some Senators may be aware that discussions have taken place between political <Col N="1481" /> leaders on this question. These discussions are continuing and I do not wish to give absolute details regarding them. They refer to a limit on the size of corporate and all other donations. Amendments will require every public representative to deposit donations received for political purposes in a special donations account. If, five or ten years later, a public representative claims that money received was a political donation, that money will have been declared when it was received. It will be an offence not to have declared such a donation.</P>
    <P>The requirement of having a special donations account will apply to political parties at all levels and campaign groups which accept donations for political purposes. If political parties are to be restricted in their expenditure, it is important that campaign groups and those who involve themselves in the political system be limited in their expenditure also. That is only fair, from a constitutional point of view. Public representatives, political parties and campaign groups will have to certify on an annual basis that all donations were lodged in the special donations accounts and there will be a limit on those donations.</P>
    <P>This afternoon's discussion concerns the distinction between corporate and non-corporate donations. Most of the arguments regarding this question have been made many times. I have invited many people to come up with a definition of a corporate donation but no one has done so. Does it mean that anyone who is associated with a company should be precluded from making a donation to a political party? I do not think that is what the amendment says. If a company filters money through its ten directors and they make political donations, would these be corporate or individual donations? The definition of corporate and individual donations is a difficult matter. It is much more effective to limit all donations to a level which would not be perceived by the public as placing undue influence on a political party or individual politician. Senator Henry made this point, if I understood her correctly.</P>
    <P>The other side of this argument, which is not being sufficiently addressed, is the effect on the political system of a total ban on funding from private sources. Senator O'Meara said she perceives a public acceptance of full taxpayers' funding of the political system which did not exist when she first made the suggestion three or four years ago. The last opinion poll I saw on this issue showed that approximately 75% of those surveyed thought the taxpayer should not pay for the political system. That is not a reason for not doing so.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that. I merely say that there is not a public acceptance of State funding for political parties. This is probably a reflection of the public's perception of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we adopt a system of public funding of the political system, we will soon hear members of <Col N="1482" /> the public objecting to the spending of money on posters, literature and other campaign costs. There will then be repeated calls for reductions in the amount spent on political campaigns. We will eventually have a political system in which we will be unable to make our views known to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a full separation of business from politics, trade unions from politics, farmers from politics and eventually, people from politics.</P>
      <P>We must address this issue. The McKenna judgment forbids State funding of electoral campaigns. If corporate and individual donations are banned, no money will be available for election campaigns. My party has erected posters calling for a yes vote in the forthcoming referendum. I have seen Fine Gael posters showing the name of each of its public representatives, although I am not sure if the posters are saying yes to the Nice treaty or the public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The posters will probably be useful during the general election campaign. The political system is subject to expenditure limits. Corporate donations have certainly dried up in the last two or three years and political parties are facing into a general election, yet groups which appear with post office box numbers seem to be able to put up more posters than every single political party. Is this the kind of democracy with which we want to finish up? We have to maintain a sense of balance.</P>
      <P>If we ban private donations, we must also consider the effect this will have on new political parties entering the system. Most of the funding currently made available for political parties is made available on the basis of the previous election. If donations are banned and people are barred from contributing to the political system and parties, one is saying in effect that there shall be no new political parties. The alternative is to say that anybody who can get 300 people together at any one time, draft a constitution and hold an annual general meeting will be entitled to State funding at the same level as a political party which has 20, 30, 40, 60 or 70 Members in the Dáil. These issues have to be addressed. The mantras of &ldquo;ban corporate donations&rdquo; and &ldquo;ban people's right to subscribe to the political system&rdquo; are not as simple as some are trying to make out and that realisation is dawning on people at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle of putting in place a system whereby there can be no reasonable perception that business has any more influence over politics or politicians than social welfare recipients, the unemployed, the poor or anybody else. An objective examination of the history of this State, looking at where we came from and taking into account the establishment of our health and <Col N="1483" /> social welfare systems, would conclude that while there have been aberrations in the past, the system, by and large, has served us pretty well.</P>
    <P>I will not be accepting the amendments but I certainly think this matter is worthy of being teased out in greater detail. My only concern is that we have limited time in which to go through many technical amendments. If we spend the remainder of the time discussing this issue in a vacuum, without my amendments being brought forward, we will not serve our purposes very well. I would like to spend as much time as possible the next day on these and associated issues that have to be addressed as a result of the limits we propose to put on corporate funding and private funding generally.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will agree that I am being reasonable. I am being very balanced and reasonable on this matter and appreciate that the Minister is also given his position. Nevertheless I have some fundamental disagreements with him and wish to respond to a number of points he mentioned. It is not my intention to hold up the moving of technical amendments.</P>

      <P>I am a strong supporter of electronic voting and was hoping the Minister would have had it in place for the by-election. I certainly hope he will have it in place in time for the general election. He might start by putting it into operation in the constituency of Tipperary North. It is not my intention to delay the technical amendments. I appreciate that this legislation is important and there is much in it with which we want to deal. This issue is not only at the heart of the legislation but also at the heart of politics.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to discussions between political parties in which there has been a failure to reach agreement so far. There have been a number of problems, specifically with the fact that we in the Labour Party cannot reach agreement with the Government parties on this matter. I am not sure that such an agreement will be reached between now and next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to campaign groups which, strictly speaking, are not political parties but which could easily become involved in a general election, a referendum campaign or other issues. The Minister has a legitimate point and I agree with him. A framework could be constructed for limiting political donations, thus causing individuals in political parties to be hamstrung, while, on the other hand, campaign groups &ndash; outside but parallel to the political process &ndash; which have no such limits on their donations could have a huge impact. I agree with the Minister that any position that is arrived at will have to incorporate this eventuality. It will also have to incorporate donations from outside the State and foreign groups seeking to influence our elec<Col N="1484" /> tions and referenda. I would support the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us his view on what the limit should be, although the Tánaiste has spoken about a limit of £4,000. In the same interview the Tánaiste also talked about the right that businesses should have to make contributions or donations to political parties. That phrase has stuck in my mind ever since because I fundamentally disagree with the position. Similarly, I disagree with the comment by Senator Walsh that because we now have economic prosperity and businesses are doing well they have some obligation to pay back the political parties. That is so utterly wrong and designed to undermine confidence in our political system. Political parties have absolutely no right to expect a pay-back from businesses and neither should businesses expect to have to make a contribution to political parties. It is so important to make the separation between the two, otherwise allegations of wrongdoing, corruption and influence &ndash; the kind of things we are currently surrounded by &ndash; will arise immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we can set a limit which is not perceived by the public to be an undue influence on an individual or political party but I do not know what that limit is. The sum of £150 might be a considerable amount for a candidate in a tight corner running a strictly budgeted campaign, yet for another candidate £100,000 may not be a huge amount. I do not know how the public will make that distinction or how we can read the public mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>In recent times large figures have been bandied about in the media and by tribunals. As to some extent our tolerance has been dulled, I really do not know where the limit can be set. Nor do I know what the limit is beyond which a reasonable member of the public would take the view that somebody had been unduly influenced. We should also look at it from the other point of view. The point is constantly being made that only a very small number of politicians are involved but unfortunately the fact of the matter is that we are all tainted. The vast majority of politicians and others in public service are honest, decent, right-thinking people who want to do the correct thing. However, whether we like it, we are all tainted because this business has gone on for so long and we have not tackled it sufficiently. It is similar to the planning issue as people openly say they are sure brown envelopes were used, even though there is no evidence to support this. Unfortunately that is the position in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>There must be State funding but I disagree with the Minister that the public does not support such funding as the issue has not been properly debated. As Senator Henry said, he or she who pays the piper calls the tune and in that context the ordinary voter should call the tune. Corporations and wealthy individuals should not do so. The Labour Party's proposed framework provides that the <Col N="1485" /> definition of &ldquo;private donors&rdquo; is those who are on the register of electors. The voter should be seen to be the only person who calls the tune and that is the reason the issue comes down to State funding.</P>
    <P>If the taxpayer funds politics, he or she calls the tune. That is right and the public wants such a system because it provides complete accountability. This may be considered an extreme position but inevitably we will have to move towards that position. The taxpayer already funds politics to a considerable extent. For instance, a legislative decision was taken, supported by all parties, that election candidates who achieve a certain percentage of the vote will retain their deposits and get back £5,000. That effectively amounts to State funding.</P>
    <P>My only resource as a full-time politician is my salary and expenses from the State and I also run a part-time office. The taxpayer funds my political and public service. I do not have a difficulty with this and do not know of anyone who does. I do not seek outside support other than the small amounts I receive from time to time for my party for elections and so on. At the end of the day the public would not have a problem with this if the choice is between complete accountability and the taxpayer supporting the political system or a system which is still open to potential influence by the corporate sector, big businessmen or others.</P>
    <P>We must go further than is necessary to restore confidence in the political system, of which we have many reasons to be proud, including the economic prosperity we are enjoying. The vast majority are working and Ireland is turning into a modern economy. Good political leadership by successive Governments, Ministers, able public servants and full-time public representatives is one of the primary reasons for this. However the primary issue being discussed by the public is how tainted is politics. It is time to restore confidence in politics and to do something for the majority of politicians who are honest by restoring good politics to the heart of public discourse and getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>The Minster has not said anything new on this issue. We must wait until next week to discover what is his thinking in regard to the limit on donations. That is the critical point. Given the Minister's appeal the issue will be discussed again. We should move on and discuss it again when his amendments are before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister touched on a number of issues which are extremely sensitive and difficult to resolve. One is the concept of a group which is formed to fight a single issue such as a road development and disappears immediately afterwards but is not a political party. That is a straightforward concept but he referred to groups which sustain themselves and perhaps change their names but are run by the same individuals and involved in politics. He wondered how these groups are funded, how they could be compared <Col N="1486" /> to political parties and how they would declare from where their funding came. The answer may lie in the registration of political parties. If a group decides to erect posters, it should automatically be required to obtain a licence to do so and pay whatever fee is due and then provide details of its members and from where it has obtained its funding. This could resolve some issues raised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to resolve all the issues and the Minister will not be able to tie everything down. However it is easier to draw the distinction between corporate and private donations than the Minister and Senator Walsh pretend. If an individual makes a donation out of his or her own bank account, that is his or her private business. There is a possibility that a businessman could give himself a raise of £4,000 in any given year and put this through his personal account before making a donation. It is not possible to tie the issue down but the inability to make watertight laws should not mean that we do not make any law.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh referred to pay-back. Corporate Ireland benefits from growth in the economy, whether by virtue of a good education system or proper political structures, and its purpose is not to pay back politicians. Businesses pay back through taxes. The more they benefit, the more taxes they pay and the better the Government does as a result. The concept of a business paying back because it does well under a particular Government or certain Ministers is terrible. I am sure Senator Walsh will reflect on that comment and say that is not what he meant. &ldquo;Pay-back&rdquo; was a terrible term to use.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Senator Walsh stated the issue was being turned into a political football. At no stage in my earlier contribution did I refer to a political party or individual party members. I referred to the principle behind the amendments which is the concept of the relationship between corporate bodies funding a Government in such a way that it has undue influence. We want to remove such influence or reduce it so substantially that it would be almost insignificant. If individuals believe strongly enough in the principles enunciated by a political party, I have no doubt they will subscribe to them and help the party to operate as a political entity.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he was meeting various groups and could not outline what his amendments would contain next week until a decision had been made. However he said the groups wanted to limit corporate donations. Fine Gael has stated it wants a ban on corporate donations. Has there been a change about which I have not heard? My party has not changed its position. Perhaps the Minister will explain that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment has been tabled because we believe it is worth discussing now. It is important and pivotal to the good name of politics. If the Minister wishes to put a value on politics where the public perception of politicians is that they are not on the make, he must distinguish between <Col N="1487" /> corporate donations and influence and the voting structure.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take our views into account when he introduces his amendments next week. That would mean there would be cross-party agreement about the way forward. This is the way to clean up the act and put politics back on a podium. It is also the way to make politics a career choice for people rather than one from which they must run away. It is becoming more difficult to get young people involved in politics. Much cynicism is generated by what is going on around us.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the tribunals but accusations have not yet been made. Money trails have been found but no one has yet been accused of wrongdoing. What they will lead to is someone else's business. However it would be unfair if this Chamber gave the impression that we have already condemned people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution, particularly his undertaking that future contributions will be placed in special donation accounts. That is part of the transparency I mentioned. The Opposition parties have turned the debate into a battle between corporate and private donations. It is disingenuous to suggest there is a difference between them. Corporations are run by individuals and the beneficiaries of those companies will make contributions on an individual basis. It is the same thing whether they make such contributions from a corporate or an individual pot. The public perception is that there is a difference but that is not valid.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to whether we should ban all private sourced funding to political parties. Revelations at the tribunals related to secret payments, not to payments in the public domain, of which people were aware and which were revealed through the activities of the tribunal or other sources which led to the tribunals. It is a complex issue which this debate highlights. If we ban all contributions, there is a danger that secret payments will be made. If we ban contributions, it does not mean they will not be made, even if it is illegal and wrong to do so. However it is healthier to make it above board and declarable. According to the Minister, if secret payments are made and not declared, an annual certification must be done by the parties or individuals. It will be an offence not to do so and I presume commensurate penalties will be imposed.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara or Senator Henry made an analogy with the United States. However it does not fully stand up because the system of government in the United States which is based on the presidency and governors of state means that executive power is vested in an elected individual. We have a corporate approach to government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1488" />
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there are many members of a council or Cabinet and many are involved in a party it is not possible to attach the same level of influence to a payment as one could in a system which elects one decision-maker who has more power. The potential to unduly and wrongly influence people is not as great in our system.</P>
      <P>Much comment was made by Opposition Senators about my suggestion that because corporate Ireland is doing well it is time to pay back some of the profits to the political system. Perhaps it was wrong to suggest that it was pay-back time. However I am sure Senators understood what I was saying, namely, that contributions could be made from the profits. I am involved in a number of corporations which only make payments when they are making profits. They will not make unnecessary payments out of their corporate accounts if they are making a loss. Because companies are doing better they are making contributions to charities, health research and local community activities, sporting clubs and groups. I make no bones about the fact that there is a moral obligation on corporations to make contributions in their communities. The political system and the political parties make a tremendous contribution to the fabric of society both locally and nationally. The system will be good, healthy and strong if the level of the contribution is declared by the recipient, whether that is a politician or a political party. There is nothing wrong with this.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with asking taxpayers to provide 100% funding because that means they will subscribe to the full limit of what is allowed to be spent at election time. If we do not go to the limit, people who are wealthy will be able to use their own resources which will give them an unfair advantage, which is wrong. We must have a system such as we have at present. People organise all types of fund-raisers in politics such as golf classics with which there is nothing wrong.</P>
      <P>SIPTU made a contribution of £27,000 to the Labour Party in 1998. I have no difficulty with the principle of such an action, although the amount is too high. The limit should not be that high. The same should apply to corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for her support for the concept of applying the same limits to campaign groups as will apply to political parties in the next election. The electoral Acts do not allow for this at present. This is part of the reform we mentioned. The Senator is probably aware that the only stipulation for any group which participates in a general election and spends money is that it must register with the Public Offices Commission. However it can spend as much as it likes. One could see a situation arising where in the last weekend of an election campaign a group which took a dislike to an individual candidate or party could spend huge sums of money if it so wished to try to counteract a campaign. Because of the limits we are putting on political parties the politician would not be in a <Col N="1489" /> position to respond. If this went to court, a serious problem could arise. I welcome the support for this and we will deal with it during the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste spoke about a right to contribute to support the political system, to which Senator O'Meara adverted. The right to free speech and the right to free association are in the Constitution. We can talk about corporate or individual donations but if we ban individual donations to political parties, we will encroach on constitutional issues. It is not as simple and straightforward as it might seem.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara is right in so far as we all consider that no limit should apply in that no matter how much we receive we would not be influenced in what we do. This may not be the perception outside the House. We must try to gauge opinion but I doubt if we will get agreement.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately we have all to an extent been tainted by what happened in the past. How much was our own fault, even if it was not because of things we did?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not remind people that the vast majority of Members are here because of a sense of public service and not for private gain, including supporting one another across party lines, we will be tainted. Senator Walsh referred to political footballs. I was not referring to this debate but a political football has been made of this issue elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Mention of corporate and individual donations and the Labour Party proposal on electors would run into constitutional difficulties because not all citizens are on the register of electors. Unfortunately the trend in some areas is that increasing numbers are not going on the register for a variety of reasons. Confining eligibility for making contributions to electors only would not be possible. All citizens would have to be included and not only citizens resident in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Meara and Coogan referred to State funding. There should be more State funding for which I will be providing in the Bill as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for restrictions on donations and so on. There is a constitutional difficulty, based on the McKenna judgment etc., about confining the funding of elections to taxpayers. Limiting expenditure on elections helps in so far as we are all limited to what we can spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the background of the tribunals has generated a huge amount of heat and not enough light. If political parties are restricted in what they can spend, they will not get their message across directly to the public and hand over to the media the role of deciding who to support. This will enhance the influence of the media which tend to consider my party to be paranoid. Prior to the last general election we had good reason to be concerned. Other parties cannot complain about favouritism towards Fianna Fáil in the media. It may be argued that the media <Col N="1490" /> are fair and unbiased, although nobody said this about one newspaper group after the last general election. While RTÉ has a remit to be fair and balanced, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, which generally secures 40% of public support, I could argue for 40% of RTÉ's coverage. However RTÉ has legal advice on the matter and I do not question its decision to allow three people from the Opposition to appear on programmes for the sake of balance.</P>
    <P>I am not overly critical of the media but all political parties have the right, duty and obligation to get their message directly to the public between and during elections and not have it mediated by anybody else. This will happen if we are restricted too much. It would be a danger to democracy. This is a philosophical issue. I asked Senator O'Meara to withdraw these amendments to enable us discuss the technical amendments.</P>

      <P>Contributions by SIPTU and trade unions to the Labour Party amount to a political fund by them to the political party closest to their ideological position. With a ban on corporate funding I would have no difficulty with the ending of trade union support for the Labour Party because I believe in a level playing pitch. At present the playing pitch is not level in relation to the different political parties.</P>
      <P>It is no accident that the vast majority of corporate donations have gone to what would be perceived to be pro-business parties, the large parties in the State. This is because the predominant ideological position in the country would be that what is good for business is good for politics is good for the country. The Progressive Democrats, a pro-business party, never had difficulty in getting corporate donations. That is the context in which we are operating.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a journalist and also have close connections with a journalist. However I do not accept <Col N="1491" /> that we should ever allow the media to mediate our message. We have direct contact with the people on the doorstep, particularly at election time. There is no more direct contact with people than that, although I do not underestimate the power of television or the media in general. I agree they are becoming more powerful by the day, probably because of the undermining of the influence of others which had been centres of authority, including the church and politicians. However there is no more direct contact with the people than politicians on doorsteps in an election campaign. We should not allow a situation where the media mediate our message because communication skills are attached to our work.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Minister that technology is now available that gives us direct contact with the people through e-mail. We should use these broadband technologies that are relatively cheap to the best possible extent. I do not accept the Minister's argument that political parties need funding between elections to ensure their message gets across. I could argue this point at great length but will resist the temptation. We have considered the issue in detail and I look forward to the Minister's announcement next week regarding his amendments and a low limit on corporate donations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator's point about direct contact on the doorsteps during elections. However that is only possible because everything else is abandoned. The House is in recess and Ministers tend to clear their diaries to enable them to campaign on the doorsteps. This is not possible on a daily basis and in between elections the media can have a huge influence. Corporations would not spend such huge sums of money on advertising if they did not think it had some effect.</P>

I will not labour the point but it is unfortunate that the Minister does not share the view of my party and the Labour Party that the relationship between big business and politics must be broken. It is that simple.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 3, but in Part I of the Bill, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;(1)The Referendum Commission is hereby renamed <i>An Coimisiún Toghcháin</i> or <Col N="1492" /> in the English language the Electoral Commission.</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister may by order assign to the said commission such of his or her functions under the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2001 as he or she considers fit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment is self-evident. It gives prominence to the Irish version of the name of the electoral commission, An Coimisiún Toghcháin. This is consistent with the approach adopted in other legislation and I am sure the Minister is not surprised by the amendment. The Irish version of the name of a board, agency or similar body established under legislation is usually favoured. The second part of the amendment is technical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to change the name of the Referendum Commission to the electoral commission and that the Minister would assign functions under the Electoral Act to it. While I agree with the concept of an electoral commission &ndash; we are rapidly reaching the stage where we should have one &ndash; the amendment is not appropriate to the Bill. The provisions in relation to the Referendum Commission are set out in the Referendum Act, 1998, and any changes would be more appropriately made to that Act.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Senator's desire to ensure the names of bodies or institutions are in Irish. I will consider the matter again for Report Stage. However the issue raised in the amendment is very broad and we do not have sufficient time to give to it now. The Referendum Commission is not a full-time body but we are rapidly reaching the stage where an electoral commission is necessary to deal with some of the points mentioned by the Senator and others issues.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) An edited register published by the registration authority under subsection (1) <Col N="1493" /> shall be deemed, for the purposes of section 20, to be part of the register of electors.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 8 will clarify in case in doubt how the edited register and the national register and the preparation and maintenance of the register of electors by a body other than a registration authority will be financed. In the case of the edited register, the cost will be part of the cost of preparing the register. The additional cost should not be as large as the computer programme for the register of electors will be amended to print out the edited register automatically.</P>
      <P>An elector's preference for non-disclosure of information will have to be noted on the computer record from the form used by the elector. However the authorities will have three years to cover their functional areas. The extra cost of compiling a national register will be approximately £50,000. It is necessary to enable individual registers to be updated on line which will increase efficiency in updating the register. It will also facilitate Internet or telephone voting if such voting methods were introduced.</P>
      <P>The third amendment concerns the cost of compiling a register of electors by a body other than a registration authority. In such cases the registration authority for each area will be responsible for the cost which is already met by it from existing funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The keeping of a register of electors both locally and nationally is an important issue and I welcome the general principle in the legislation in that regard. There is a need to ensure the register is maintained at all times because not enough attention is given to updating it at present. I undertook a small exercise recently when I asked my 17 year old son to ask his 18 year old friends how many of them are on the register. Within two days I learned that 25 of them were not on the register. If this exercise was repeated in every leaving certificate class in the constituency, a substantial number would be involved. We must work harder at maintaining the register and ensuring it is an accurate representation of the voting list. We cannot have a person discovering he or she is not on the electoral list on voting day. The use of electronic media is critical for gaining access to the register for those who are entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;11.&ndash;Section 21 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(6)No order for costs may be made against an applicant in an application pursuant to this section.'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is self-evident and I would like to hear the Minister's response to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes that no order for costs may be made against an applicant in relation to proceedings under section 21 of the Electoral Act, 1992. Section 21 provides for the right to appeal to the Circuit Court against any decision of a county registrar in a claim relating to the register of electors. Provision is made for an appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Circuit Court on a point of law. It is a normal part of legal procedure in court that a person initiating an action or lodging an appeal against a court decision may be awarded costs or have costs awarded against him or her. I do not see why an exception should be made in the case of appeals to the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court regarding a revision court decision.</P>
      <P>A claimant for entry on the register who decides to appeal to the Circuit Court and possibly the Supreme Court should, if the claim succeeds, be eligible to have his or her costs paid by the respondent to the proceedings. Similarly, it is reasonable that a person who, having gone through the full procedure laid down in the electoral Acts for the registration of electors, fails to establish his entitlement to be registered should be liable to have costs incurred by other parties to the proceedings awarded against him. This should apply particularly where the original claim is been frivolous.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the courts to decide in any case whether an order for costs should be made, and it is reasonable to assume that the courts should have regard to all relevant facts in considering each case. The same applies to other parties to the proceedings. The courts are always anxious to ensure a person whose case is genuine will not be deterred from pursuing it on account of costs. When a private citizen takes action to establish a constitutional or other right, and the case has some reasonable base, the courts will often allow the costs, even if the judgment goes against the citizen.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 22 to 30.</P>
      <P>Lines 22 to 30 are part of a description of a political party or party organised within the State. The section to be deleted describes a party as having:</P>
      <P>. . . not less than 300 recorded members or, in the case of a party applying for registration as a party organised to contest elections in part of the State or local elections or Údarás na Gaeltachta elections only, 100 recorded members, each of whom (in any of the foregoing cases) has reached the age of 18 years . . . .</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The electoral Acts and the funding arrangements that are in place have brought us into a new era. This Bill will bring about further advances. In this section we are providing for a number of new requirements with regard to the registration of political parties. A number of the amendments has been suggested to us by the registrar of political parties. I do not believe it is unduly onerous to ask political parties, or those aspiring to that status, to meet these requirements. The requirements under subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) mirror the requirement under the Referendum Act, 1998, where a body is seeking approved status under that Act.</P>
      <P>The remaining requirements are sufficiently flexible to allow a body to demonstrate its bona fides in applying for registration. They will only apply to the registration of parties post this Bill &ndash; those which are already registered will retain their registration. It is necessary to introduce this kind of legislation to clarify the position. Given that political parties are to get increased State funding, the limit that applies currently and that we intend to stick with is 2% of first preference votes. Based on the last election, this would work out at about 18,000 votes. It is necessary that we have this stipulation with regard to membership, particularly registered members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I agree with the Minister. We are constantly adding to the framework which we have begun to build. Unlike members of the public, we are almost full-time practitioners of politics and understand the system from the inside out. We are involved in political parties and that may colour our view. There is no doubt that politics is changing and in ten or 15 years' time, or even less, the structure and type of political parties may be very different. We could have a plethora of small parties &ndash; larger parties might not like that, but it could well happen. I do not think we should put anything in the way of that happening, neither should we create the perception that we, the existing political parties, particularly the larger political parties of the Govern<Col N="1498" /> ment, want to prevent the evolution of smaller parties. For instance, there could be a Munster-based, environmental-style party or&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the potential for amalgamation of the various anti-dump campaigns around the country, for the purpose of a general election. A decision could be made to stand candidates in five, six or seven different constituencies. The limit of 18,000 votes would not be an unrealistic or unattainable figure to reach, given the number of candidates who could run, although individually they might not gain a large number of votes. We should not be seen to be unnecessarily restrictive in our approach to the evolution of political parties, nor should we be seen to be afraid of change or diversity. In the Constitution we recognise the importance of smaller political parties in particular, and the use of proportional representation was designed to ensure that the voice of minorities is heard.</P>
      <P>Given the rate of change which we are experiencing, minorities could be of a very different colour in the future, potentially even skin colour, depending on how our economy, immigration and the labour force evolves. We should try to be as flexible as possible because we do not know what is coming down the line. The perception of the legislation as we pass it is of paramount importance. I welcome in general the framework the Minister is proposing and I entirely accept his point about the advice coming from the registrar of political parties, but I ask him to be as flexible as possible in his approach.</P>

If one wants to set up the monster raving loony party, <i>as gaeilge</i>, and go forward on the basis of a very modest cost in terms of running in the election, one should be able to do that, but there is a separate issue involved here. It is reasonable to have a standard, and I do not think the standard is a very onerous one, even for a smaller party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People should have to prove their bona fides in terms of their determination to organise and be an active political force, and for that reason the <Col N="1499" /> figure of 300 members is a reasonable one.

We should not demean the registration process so much that a registered political party means little or nothing. It is necessary to strike a balance and that is what we are trying to do.</P>
