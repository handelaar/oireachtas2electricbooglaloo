      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re fourth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty regarding a European judicial area to be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 19, motion No. 23, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business, if not previously concluded, to resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  </P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for supplying me with the background to No. 1. It is useful to have it. In future we might consider the practice of reading the type of note he gave into the record when the motion is being taken to ensure Members are aware of what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I have two routine questions for the Leader on the Order of Business. Could he indicate what exact legislation he expects to take between now and the end of this session? By now he must have a fairly clear idea of what is realistic and what he hopes to take. It is asking a bit much of the Opposition to be ready to take quite a number of Bills if it does not have adequate prior warning.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader update us on the information given to the House yesterday by the Acting Leader on the status of the reports from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General on the arms affair and if he will try to ensure we can have a debate on those reports before the end of this session?</P>
      <P>Has the Leader been able to make arrangements to have a debate on the post Nice position before the end of the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On business matters, I agree that we need to have a clear indication of what will happen between the now and the end of the session. I would like to make two suggestions to the <Col N="746" /> Leader on the ordering of our business. The last thing we need is a push next week to get everything out of the way and dealt with. People need to have the time to deal with matters and if we need to sit a few days the following week, we should be prepared to do that. That would lead to fewer problems and less tension in the House. On the basis of the business that was concluded yesterday, it would be possible to transfer Friday morning's business to Thursday afternoon to save a Friday sitting. I ask the Leader and the Government Whip to consider doing that to move business forward. Sitting the week after next would also allow a debate on the post Nice position.</P>
      <P>It is probable the US authorities will again decide to reduce interest rates down to nearly 3% today because they wish to inject more money into the economy at a time of a downturn. I asked yesterday and I ask again now for the Leader to call on the Minister for Finance to come in here and give us his views on that, particularly at a time when the Central Bank's response to a possible downturn in the economy is to talk about budgetary restraint and taking money out of the economy. We are under the influence of the US, Europe and the Central Bank and the Minister needs to run a budget. We need to engage in these issues now rather than at the time of the budget. It would be useful to have a significant debate on finance before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the circulation of a memo on the first item on the agenda. It is becoming increasingly common to have a motion on the Order of Business which we are asked to approve or to refer to one of the committees. It should be practice that an information memo is circulated with the agenda for the day's Order of Business so Members would have an opportunity to examine the information on the motion and to assess the relevance of the motion and whether a debate is required on it.</P>
      <P>Obviously we need to know what legislation has to be dealt with between now and the recess. There have also been calls for a number of debates to be held in that period. The Leader of the House should present to Members tomorrow a list of the matters he considers to be a priority, on the basis of what has been requested by Members and what can be dealt with between now and the end of the session. There should be a debate on Northern Ireland, where the situation is critical at present, and all Members have sought a debate on the Nice treaty to see how we will proceed.</P>
      <P>There should also be an opportunity to discuss the four years in office of this coalition Government. It has already been discussed in the other House and it is appropriate that this House should be given the opportunity to discuss the delivery or otherwise of the budget, education, health services or public services under this Government in the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to hold an immediate debate on the failure for the second year running of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> to leave Fenit Harbour. It is a serious matter. The project is badly needed in Kerry and about £10 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in it. The tourism industry in Kerry also needs the project. There is only something small wrong but the Minister should come to the House to debate it. If the people involved in the project wish to carry out trial runs, they should bring the ship to all the ports around Ireland and give the taxpayers who paid for it an opportunity to see this gorgeous vessel. With proper planning it could be sent abroad next year. It is a good job this problem did not happen during the Famine because a lot of Kerry people would never have got out of the country. It is a pity we cannot resurrect the engineers who originally built the ship.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House for an immediate debate on funding from her Department? The arts centre in Ballybunion was fully backed&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>A lady from Cork has been imprisoned for her stance against service charges. Politically, it is a non-event but I fear we have been too heavy handed in imprisoning this person. It is most unfair. Will the Leader ask the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to intervene? It is a sad situation. We should not imprison people like this. The point has been made and the woman has been fined.</P>
      <P>This stance on service charges has been taken by a certain group but it is really a non-event in our city and, indeed, throughout the country. It is sad that we are taking matters to this level. Our priorities are wrong. The lady is in Limerick prison and there is no need for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that item 24 be taken at the start of today's business. The motion deals with the fall-out from the Nice treaty referendum. We <Col N="748" /> were given an undertaking yesterday that we would be given a definite date for this debate and I will suspend my judgment on it until I hear the Leader's response.</P>
      <P>Can we hold a debate on AIDS, not just worldwide but in view of the troubling increases that have been reported in heterosexual transmission? This was the first of the Houses of the Oireachtas to have a debate on this important subject. At the time, some irresponsible media people, a small minority, suggested that the disease would not affect heterosexual people but the highest rate of transmission in this country, according to this year's statistics, is through heterosexuals. We need to warn young people and we could use the debate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader impress on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the importance of intervening in a major dispute that has engulfed the country between farmers and the National Roads Authority with regard to the siting of certain strategic super highways and the payment of adequate compensation to farmers? The fabric of rural Ireland will disintegrate and there will be an exodus from the countryside unless something is done. Tonight, for example, hundreds of farmers will converge, more in hope than confidence, on Hayden's Hotel in Ballinasloe to hear the IFA explain what they might be able to get. The NRA is not listening to them and it is time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government intervened before we have another land war on our hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate before the end of this session on reforming the nursing homes legislation, particularly with regard to having a transparent, independent and open inspectorate whose reports will be published as soon as they are available and appointing an ombudsman for senior citizens in long-term care institutions, including health board and private nursing homes?</P>

      <P>In reply to Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello, I hope, after the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this morning, to have the proposed legislation the Seanad will debate in the present session available for discussion with the leaders and the Whips to secure final agreement on it. The Senators also sought debates on the Nice treaty, finance and the four years of achievement by the present Government. As I pointed out last week, I intend to allocate a full day for statements and debates on the various matters which have been brought up on the Order of Business. All other business will comprise legislation. We can discuss that further at the meeting of the leaders and Whips this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Senator Manning asked about the arms crisis report. An update of this will be available tomorrow morning and I will inform the House then about it.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Kiely's views to the Minister regarding the <i>Jeanie Johnston.</i> I am aware of the importance of the project to Kerry. I will also convey the Senator's views on funding for the arts to the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>I will inform the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of Senator Cregan's concerns about the imprisoned person he mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is definitely not possible to take No. 19, motion 24 this week. Perhaps the Whips and I can include it in our considerations when we meet this morning. Senator Norris also called for a debate on AIDS and I certainly will provide for this, possibly not during this session but early in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh called for a debate in the House with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the impact on the farming community of the proposed new national routes of the NRA. This issue is of major concern in the midlands region. On the one hand, it is a sign of <Col N="750" /> progress and on the other hand everyone wants to see the farmers getting their fair share. I certainly agree the matter should be included in the day long debate to which I referred and I will make sure this is one of the items taken. It is one of the most pressing issues at present, where only 5% of the total investment involved is for the cost of the land being acquired. There is room for consultation and negotiation and I hope that will happen. I wish everyone well in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called for a debate on reform of the nursing homes Act. I certainly will have a look at that to see when it will be possible.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are alternatives to amendment No. 1, while amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 3 and all may be discussed together by agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 18, before &ldquo;(1)&rdquo;, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section, this Act, to the extent that the provisions thereof do not involve a charge on public funds, shall come into operation one calendar month following its enactment.</P>
      <P>(2)<i>Part 3</i>, to the extent that the provisions thereof do not involve a charge on public funds, shall come into operation upon the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is straightforward. The Bill has been in circulation since 1999 while a previous Children Bill was introduced in 1996. The general concept of the Bill has been in the Department for almost five years. This legislation has been in circulation for over two years so one assumes the necessary preparatory work has been ongoing in the various Department over that time in terms of the implementation of the various sections.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to Part 2 dealing with family welfare conferences and Part 3 dealing with children in need of special care and protection. The amendment is vital because, as it stands, the Bill does not have a specific enactment date. Certain sections need specific enactment dates. The amendment is straightforward because it relates to provisions that do not involve a charge on the public funds coming into operation. In light of all the information available to the Minister of State and the Department and the plight of many children, particularly in this city, who are in serious circumstances, I hope the Minister will accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> Part of the amendment suggests that provisions should come into operation one month after the enactment of the legislation. I cannot foresee any problem with that proposal. There is great concern about children who are in difficulty. Parents have taken cases to court to ensure necessary attention is given to their children. Some children are out of control and parents cannot manage. They do not have the resources or the ability to cope with their disturbed children. Such children need specific psychological support and assistance. In some cases, they need psychiatric care. Unfortunately, despite the Celtic tiger, the State has dramatically let down such children. They are a vulnerable group in society and umpteen cases have gone to the courts. These cases have been taken by parents and other individuals to force the State to provide the necessary and urgent attention the children involved require.</P>
    <P>There is no point making laws that are then put on a shelf and left to gather dust. The Bill should be put into operation immediately. There are many examples throughout the country of children who have been badly failed by the Government and society. In common with the position of the handicapped and the elderly, it is an indictment of us as a community that we are not in a position to deal with these children in a civilised, consideration and humane way that involves a level of sympathy and sincerity. Unfortunately, they have been treated as pariahs in society. However, as the Minister of State accepted on Second Stage, each child is a victim and a product of our society. We have a responsibility to respond to them and to put them on the right road. This can only be done if specific elements of the Bill are put into operation.</P>
    <P>I hope the amendments will receive the full support of the Minister of State because an enactment date is required. The Minister of State recognises that fact and I know she will do everything she can to further implementation of the Bill. However, unless a timetable is included, the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children will lag behind. They need to be put on alert and given a specific date by which they must deliver. This is the purpose of the amendments and I hope they are supported by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendments. We all realise her commitment to children and to improve the conditions of those who are in care or have run into trouble with the law. As I said on Second Stage, this is a good Bill, but Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendments would strengthen the Minister of State's hand in insisting that the required facilities for children are put in place. Judges repeatedly say that there is nowhere to put children. The Bill would be improved if some force was put on the Department of Finance in particular to produce funds to enable units to be built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senators and I share the view that as much of the Bill as possible should be implemented as quickly as possible in the interests of the children we want to serve. Senators will accept that after many years the legal vacuum in relation to children and the deficit in funding are being addressed.</P>
      <P>Recognising that these children are products of our society, the Bill goes a long way towards ensuring that we deal with children as individuals and citizens in their own right while involving their families and the community. I accept that we need to implement much of the legislation quickly. It is also important that the resources be in place to implement the Bill properly and the Government is committed to ensuring that.</P>
      <P>While accepting in principle the need to move forward on the Bill, I regret that I cannot accept the amendments, for various reasons some of which are technical and some practical. The first of the amendments would cause an element of confusion about what would and would not come into operation at the time of the signing of the legislation. Some sections of the Bill are dependent on others and it would be necessary to ensure that each comes into place at the right time. There are also implications with regard to funding. In an integrated Bill such as this, some sections would impose no charge on the public funds but would be dependent on sections which would involve such a charge. In practice, this would be extremely difficult to implement.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4, which places a definite timescale on implementation, confuses the legislative process with the administrative provisions to be put in place. This amendment would place a burden on the Minister to accept responsibility for matters which are completely outside his control. Notwithstanding this, efforts have been made since the publication of the Bill to facilitate the speedy implementation of the Bill. The Garda community relations section has been operating pilot schemes on restorative conferencing and restorative cautioning for well over a year. About 40 such conferences have been held and the reports are very encouraging. Most of the juvenile liaison officers have been trained in mediation and other relevant skills by the Mediation Council of Ireland or by a company called Real Justice. Experts from New Zealand came here in September last to train probation officers on family conferencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been planning on the provision of places of detention for 16 and 17 year old detainees separate from others. On 16 January 2001, the Minister announced the commencement of a major programme of redevelopment at Cork prison. It will take three years to complete, will cost £35 million and will have a separate facility for 16 and 17 year olds in a 40 place unit with full support facilities. Sites are at present being examined in the Dublin area for an extra 110 <Col N="754" /> places. We all recognise the serious lack of provision for young girls who, unfortunately, are becoming more and more involved in the juvenile justice system. A site is also being sought to accommodate secure detention for up to 20 females.</P>
    <P>Part 2 provides for the Special Residential Services Board which I appointed last year on an interim basis. The board's membership is already working on that basis and has been very helpful in our condideration of the Bill. It is crucial that this part of the Bill be implemented before others, which is why I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Education and Science a capital development programme for the children's detention schools has been agreed. Plans are being prepared and £9 million has been allocated this year to implement the programme. Priority is being given to the provision in Lusk of a specialised high security unit to cater for depraved and unruly children who would previously have gone to prison and for children with particular specialised needs.</P>
    <P>Section 101 provides for day assessment of children found guilty. We are all anxious that alternative provisions be used for children who come before the courts. Plans for the provision of the first such place at an existing probation office ran into planning difficulties regarding a simple change of use. The unfortunate consequence of that planning objection was that it was well over 12 months before a building which was already in use could have a mere change of use. I am glad to say the place is now open for referrals from the courts. However, this example serves to show how difficulties and delays can occur which would make these amendments impossible to accept. It also shows that as well as commitment from the Government and various Departments we must also have commitment from society if we are to respond to the needs of these young people.</P>
    <P>Much preparation has been done and many provisions will come into operation immediately on the enactment of the Bill and thereafter as quickly as possible. Parts 2, 3, and 11, which relate to children who have particular behavioural difficulties and are before the courts, will be proceeded with as quickly as possible and I hope to have them in place by the end of the year. Substantial investment is needed and staffing difficulties must be overcome. Because of the integrated nature of the Bill, the fact that sections are dependent one on the other, the fact that some sections may involve a cost on the Exchequer and are dependent on others which do not and the fact that there are elements outside the Government's control, including objections from the public, I cannot accept the amendments. I ask Senators to accept my assurance and that of the Government that we intend to proceed with this major legislation and to implement it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister of State's response. I understand some of the difficulties she has mentioned, particularly those which relate to planning. However, I am disappointed to hear her say she cannot take full responsibility for things which are outside her control. The Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science bear ultimate responsibility for the issues dealt with in this Bill. I do not underestimate the commitment of the Minister of State but if there is not an overall Government commitment to putting the provisions of the Bill in place it will not happen. That is why my amendments propose that time limits be put in place. Obstacles will always be found and Departments will always find it impossible to move this way or that. However, if they are statutorily required to act they will do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the difficulties she faces but I do not accept what she says. I accept that money has been committed for the purchase and improvement of various properties. The Minister of State acknowledges that there are staffing difficulties. Why have those difficulties not been addressed in the past two years? Special incentives, special training and proper remuneration should have been put in place to overcome staffing difficulties. This could have been done during the past two years.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that misfortunate children, whose families have lost control of them and cannot take care of them, are not being taken care of by the State. Week after week we hear judges calling Ministers and Departments to account. This is unsatisfactory, particularly when the children in question are among the most deprived in the country. It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to say that bureaucracy and admistrative difficulties will be an impediment to delivering the service.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Government to overcome these difficulties. The Government is elected to govern. It has a specific obligation to the most deprived members of our community. I invite the Minister of State to urge her senior Ministers, the Cabinet and the Taoiseach to deliver the provisions of this Bill. I accept her own commitment, goodwill and intentions.  </P>
      <P>It would be to the Minister's advantage as Minister of State to have a date set because there would then have to be a delivery time. It would make the Minister's life much easier if that were put into the legislation. I invite the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I remind Senators that three <Col N="756" /> different Departments have responsibility for children, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children. The idea behind that is to ensure that there is co-ordination between the three Departments. I meet with those three Departments regularly to ensure that we can progress all those issues which are cross-departmental. This Bill is a perfect example of this, being a result of co-operation between the Departments. Even though responsibility rests with three Ministers, co-ordination is the responsibility of the Minister of State with special responsibility for children.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the issue of the special care of those children who are coming before the courts with behavioural difficulties. It is only in recent years that the responsibility of the State has been recognised as a result of a High Court case. From a situation where there were just 17 places for these children in 1997, we are now well on the way to providing 110 extra places. There are now 84 places and by this time next year we will have a total of 160 places for special care in high support units to facilitate these young people. I acknowledge that staffing is a difficulty but equally tremendous efforts have been made by the health boards in trying to recruit staff. They have gone as far as South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Scandinavia, all the English-speaking countries, in their search for suitably qualified staff to work in residential care. Salaries and remuneration were issues but Senators may have noted that in recent months a very substantial increase was approved and agreed for these workers to encourage people into the profession, to give them a proper sense of vocation and to recognise the work they do. I hope this will serve to involve more people in this career area.</P>
      <P>As late as yesterday I briefed the Northern Ireland Office on our national children's strategy. I took the opportunity when in Belfast to visit some of the projects there. Some of their groups have been very helpful to us in assisting with particularly difficult cases. I have been looking to see how we can further develop that cross-Border work. I reassure Senators that everything possible is being done in relation to staffing, salaries, the development of the service and the provision of extra places and ensuring that the three Departments responsible work together to ensure its implementation. For practical reasons and because of the technical difficulties that would arise, I cannot accept these amendments but I accept that this Bill needs to be implemented.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended dealing with this matter on the amendments but I was attending a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at that time. This is an important section. I compliment Senator Taylor-Quinn on putting down a series of amendments and she was right in putting them to a vote.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State has given assurances in relation to the implementation of the Act. Section 2 comprises what I would describe as opt-out clauses. In paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>), inclusive, the Minister reserves the right to make a decision on implementation of the various stages of the Act, almost at total discretion. The agreement of the Minister for Health and Children is required in relation to section 77, the Minister for Education and Science has to make a decision in relation to the junior remand centres and consultation with the Minister for Health and Children is also required on other matters. It is an extremely cumbersome provision.</P>
      <P>This is a substantial Bill which the Minister delayed for the past 18 months to two years to try to get it right. I would have expected adequate work to have been done during that time to put in place the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the speedy implementation of this legislation. It now appears, with these opt-out clauses, that we may or may not see the legislation implemented within the current decade. What assurances have we got on when the family welfare conferences will operate? When will the new court proceedings, which are mooted strongly in this Bill, be up and running? What consultation has taken place with the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children to ensure that they sing from the same hymn sheet in relation to the speedy implementation of this legislation?</P>
      <P>I am concerned that if the Bill completes its passage through the Oireachtas today and becomes law within a short time, it will be out of our hands and back in the hands of the Minister or, more correctly, the three Ministers concerned. Whatever may be said about a couple of cooks spoiling things, three Ministers could have an unhappy knack of not making decisions in unison. We should have a very firm timescale or the Minister should come back to this House within the next 12 months to report on how the Act has been implemented during that period. No element of the Act should be left unimplemented within the next 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, who has special responsibility for children, has given a very clear and unequivocal undertaking to this House about the implementation of this very important legislation. As has been pointed out, this was first mooted during the term of the last Government in 1996 and the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has taken considerable time to trawl through it. The systems in Australia and New Zealand were looked at and expert advice was sought to ensure that this Bill would be as correct as possible in legislative terms. The Minister of State made it clear that a commitment of several million pounds was being given. I have the utmost confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who has brought a breath of fresh air to her office. Such an undertaking and commitment is unparalleled. She is the Minister of State with responsibility for children, she has a <Col N="759" /> focus on this legislation and she is enthusiastic about it.</P>
      <P>As has been mentioned previously in the House, a High Court judge has strongly emphasised on a number of occasions the importance of implementing this legislation without delay, particularly in relation to the detention of disturbed children. I have no doubt whatsoever that when this Bill is enacted into law, far from the opt-out clauses to which Senator O'Toole has referred, there will be a full focus by the Minister and the Minister of State on implementing the measures contained in it, particularly those in section 2. In the eyes of the public, there is a clear moral compulsion to do this. A great deal of time has elapsed. This Bill has been progressed gradually over a period of almost five years. I am confident the new provisions of the Bill will be implemented swiftly and the required finance will be made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has pointed out that there were only about 17 places available two or three years ago for disturbed children. We must do everything possible to avoid imprisoning such youngsters. Now, there are 84 places and I hope that figure will have doubled before the end of this year so there will be places to hold &ndash; I do not want to say incarcerate or imprison &ndash; and protect disturbed children in a safe place of custody rather than in an adult prison with serious criminals.</P>
      <P>I have the utmost faith in the Minister of State in pursuit of her responsibility for children. I hope I can allay the fears of my colleagues about implementation of this Bill. There is an unparalleled public focus on this legislation and I am confident there will be no delay on the part of the Government in forging ahead with the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Nobody in this House would underestimate the personal commitment of the Minister of State and I agree, to a certain point, with Senator O'Donovan's comments. However, a general election could be called at any time and there could be a new Minister in charge of this brief who might not have the same level of commitment as the current holder. We have to legislate for those circumstances, leaving aside the personality of the individual. It is unfortunate that this Bill is going through without taking on board the actual proposals in relation to specific implementation dates.</P>
      <P>In a previous response, the Minister of State said there were certain aspects that could be implemented sooner. Maybe she could come to the House on Report Stage and give specific dates as to when certain specific aspects can be implemented. If she is not prepared to accept the amendment she might as least advise the House on delivery dates for certain aspects. This is absolutely necessary otherwise the section is a farce.</P>

      <P>While I do not want to reiterate everything that was said when the amendments were discussed, it is important to clarify for Senator Costello that much preparation has gone into the Bill. This is the most major overhaul of the juvenile justice system since 1908. Obviously, much preparation is necessary, and that does not mean it can be implemented very quickly. It should also be seen in the context of Government policies supporting families, early intervention and protection, capital investment and the work of the different Departments. The fact this legislation is the result of co-operation between three Departments is in itself a major advance. I know of no other legislation in which three Departments have co-operated so well. I believe there is a commitment &ndash; I take no credit, but thank Senators for their kind comments &ndash; in the three Departments to move forward.</P>
      <P>The preparatory work includes the interim Special Residential Services Board, the piloting of the family conferences and the family welfare conferences, the piloting of the alternatives to detention, the restorative cautioning, the development of day centres, the capital programme for provision of places for offenders and non-offenders and the regular meetings between the different Departments to ensure we see this in the context of the wider issues with a view to moving forward. As I already indicated, I intend moving forward very quickly with Parts 2, 3 and 11, which refer to children in need of special care and attention but who are non-offenders. Each of those Parts is interlinked, and we will be finalising regulations in that regard and moving forward very quickly. Each of the three Departments and Ministers is committed to moving forward with as much of the Bill as quickly as possible, and we will be looking at setting out a time plan.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 18, to delete &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;group&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments, which propose a change in the nomenclature of &ldquo;family welfare conference&rdquo; to &ldquo;family group conference&rdquo;, were brought to me by those working in the area. I know from the Minister's earlier replies that she is well aware of the work which is taking place in the context of family welfare group conferences and the input those from New Zealand, where these con<Col N="761" /> ferences were initiated, have had on the development of the service in Ireland. A family group conference has been described to me as a structured decision making meeting made up of family members. Family is determined broadly to include the children or child, parents, extended family and even significant friends and neighbours to the family who may not be actually blood related. This group of people is given private time to reach a plan to facilitate the safe care and protection of a child or children in need. There is a professional involved in information giving at the beginning of the process and in the assessment of the plan following a decision. He or she is otherwise excluded from the process unless specifically requested to do otherwise. The family group conference meeting is facilitated by an independent co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>Some 80% of children who have to be taken into special care units will eventually be returned to their families, thank goodness, making this is a very important aspect of the Bill. I ask the Minister to change the nomenclature from &ldquo;family welfare conference&rdquo; to &ldquo;family group conference&rdquo; as that, apparently, is how these conferences are described internationally. The request was initiated by those who work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. As Senator Henry said, it originates in a request from the people who work in the area and it should be taken seriously. There are certain connotations to &ldquo;welfare conference&rdquo; which may not necessarily be desirable. Section 77 relates to court proceedings and referral of a person in the context of care or supervision to a conference. A &ldquo;family care conference&rdquo; or a &ldquo;family group conference&rdquo; would be better than a &ldquo;family welfare conference&rdquo;. Welfare has all sorts of connotations going back to the last century, some of which are dubious and some acceptable. A neutral word such as group or a very sympathetic word such as care would be preferable.</P>
      <P>The work of these conferences will be crucial for young people referred by the courts, and the wider as well as the immediate family should have a role. This is an extremely important provision and is a key section in terms of the operation of the general care system for young people. This term will come into normal parlance very quickly and we should be very careful in the word we choose to ensure it is sympathetic or neutral with no connotations or implications which might not suggest the best meaning we want in terms of conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The term &ldquo;group conference&rdquo; has a softer connotation than &ldquo;welfare conference&rdquo;. Senator Henry said it would involve members of the extended family, which could be of assistance to the child. It would be evident to him or her that the extended family was concerned and involved, which could be deemed a support mechanism for <Col N="762" /> the child. I commend this and ask the Minister to look upon it favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting amendment and I am sure the Minister will give a very logical explanation regarding the wording. I do not know why &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is used as opposed to &ldquo;group&rdquo;, but I will await the Minister's explanation. However, it is very important to note the Minister and her officials have examined the issue in a global context, particularly in New Zealand and Australia which are viewed as a model in terms of the concept of conferencing. I am quite sure that whatever adjective is used in the description of these conferences, be it group, care or welfare, the concept of conferences is innovative and I am sure it will work wonders for the juvenile justice system. That said, I await the Minister's explanation as to the choice of adjective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing the Bill a very deliberate effort was made to avoid using the generic term &ldquo;family group conference&rdquo;. This term is used in other countries and that is not sufficient reason to use it here, though we can of course learn from each other. Where it originated it referred to justice conferences for young offenders &ndash; I believe the term originally came from New Zealand. However, this Bill proposes three different types of conference, the first being the family welfare conference. This is provided for in Part 2 which deals with young people who are not offenders but whose behaviour poses a serious risk either to themselves or others, to their health, safety, development and welfare. It involves referral to the child welfare system. That is why the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is used and why it is appropriate that it should be used.</P>
      <P>The second type of conference is part of the Garda diversion programme to assist young offenders who are being diverted away from the courts. The third type of conference is the family welfare conference for young offenders who have been charged with offences. This will be convened by the probation and welfare service under the direction of the courts and involves the introduction of the restorative justice provisions into the juvenile justice system.</P>
      <P>There are three different types of conference, the family welfare conference in which the child will be involved with the child welfare system, the conference of the Garda diversion programme and the family welfare conference for young offenders. It is important to maintain the distinctions between the three, because they have different purposes and to ensure that we recognise that children have the same needs but for different reasons. For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Bill carefully and am well aware of the different types of conference being set up. I agree it is good to maintain the distinction between those to do with the juv<Col N="763" /> enile liaison scheme and children involved in it. However, I would not agree that family group conferences in New Zealand were set up specifically to deal with children who are involved in crime. My reading of the work on the development of family group conferences in New Zealand, where these originated, is that they were to safeguard children and promote their welfare; to try to encourage the taking of parental responsibility and the taking into account of race, culture, class, language, religion and disability; to work in partnership with the family and support the children's contact with the family; to provide services for children in need and to be helpful in reuniting children with their families whenever possible. The emphasis was not on children in detention but on children who were in need, no matter what the need. The child's interests were paramount.</P>
      <P>I am interested in this section because, as Senator Costello said, the term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is sometimes seen as slightly pejorative. It is similar to referring to a lady almoner at a hospital rather than a social worker. I hoped the Minister would accept these amendments since it was those who work in this area who encouraged me to put them forward.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="764" />&ldquo;(f2&gt;d) the legal representatives, if any, of the child,</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;e) the legal representative, if any, of the parents or guardian of the child,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is not included in the Bill as it stands. It is important that the child or the parent of the child should have the right to have a legal representative present because there may be aspects of children's and care law that a legal representative could explain that others present at the conference are not in a position to elucidate. It is important that the legal and constitutional rights of the child are protected at all times. That is not to suggest that any of those present would do other than that. However, in the interests of natural justice and of protecting the rights of parent and child, it would be no harm to include this in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment, given that in reply to my amendment the Minister stressed the importance of this in relation to children who are being detained. It would be a useful addition in respect of those who attend a family welfare conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that in this scenario it is primarily and more or less exclusively up to the family to decide what to do when a child is unruly or misbehaves. The purpose of this Bill is to move away from the system of justice and the courtroom and into a room where a family can decide among themselves what is best for the child. While I understand why Senator Taylor-Quinn proposed the amendment, it would defeat the purpose of the section if it were accepted. However, I will await the Minister's response. It is important where somebody of 14, 15 or 16 years of age misbehaves or faces court charges that the family should decide on the best way of dealing with the matter rather than bringing in legal representatives, solicitors or barristers. That might be a step in the wrong direction and might send out the wrong signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would be totally at odds with the purpose and ethos of the family welfare conference. The purpose of such a conference is to produce a plan for the future care, protection and development of the child. A vitally important part of that process is that the family should take responsibility for the child and come up with proposals or a plan and get whatever assistance is necessary from the professionals at the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such conferences and projects have been piloted over the past year in the east coast area. Their piloting suggests that within the structure followed by all family conferences, it is essential to have as informal an atmosphere as possible to give the family an opportunity to discuss and develop, sign up to and commit themselves to a plan which is in the interests of their child. It <Col N="765" /> would not be in their interests nor could this objective be served by introducing the formality of having a legal representative as of right.</P>
    <P>In convening a conference the co-ordinator will, in accordance with good practice, discuss with all the parties the persons they believe should be able to participate in this conference. If the child or the family insist that their legal representative be there, the co-ordinator could invite that representative on the basis that this person could make a positive contribution to the conference. However, it is often felt that a conference held under such circumstances is less likely to succeed because it removes the responsibility from the family to come up with a plan in the interests of their child. Because it is at odds with the whole ethos of the family welfare conference, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. The co-ordinator has the right to invite the legal representative if he or she deems it appropriate and deems that the legal representative has something positive and helpful to contribute. By including this amendment in the section, all one is saying is that the following persons shall be entitled to attend a family welfare conference. The legal representative of the child or of the parents of the child would have that right. By not including it, it means in a sense that they do not have that right.</P>
      <P>It does not necessarily mean they have to attend. If the parents felt sufficiently vulnerable or incompetent and felt the need to bring somebody with them, the insertion of this paragraph in this section would be of assistance to them. It would not be the intention to make it mandatory but to assist people who may feel somewhat vulnerable in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the pilot scheme being run in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am sure she knows that the people running the pilot scheme use the description family group conferences, not family welfare conferences. It is unfortunate that we are bringing in legislation which describes these conferences as family welfare conferences when a pilot project, which has been up and running for a year and is going very well, describes them as family group conferences.</P>

      <P>The report of the pilot project is entitled Group Conferencing, but they are not the only pilot projects that have been undertaken. The Garda also had pilot conferences. That is why they are distinguished within the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the presence of legal people as of right at these family conferences, they could be covered under section 9(<i>f</i>) which refers to &ldquo;any other person who, in the opinion of the coordinator. . . .&rdquo; could make a positive contribution. If the co-ordinator wants to seek legal advice and <Col N="766" /> information, that too can be made available to the conference.</P>
    <P>Lessons learned from the pilot projects would show that where families do not feel confident enough to progress the conference, the challenge is for the professionals to be able to deal with them. A lot has been learned already from the pilot projects by way of the type of language and process used and the type of people who are best at these conferences. I am afraid it does not include legal people.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the conferences set up by the health boards. A pilot project began in May 1999. The Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Fahey, went to New Zealand to see what they were doing there. It is specifically those sorts of conferences which I thought we were talking about in this section and not the police ones which come much later. I have not asked for a change in the name there. I only asked for a name change to family group conferences in the sections which apply to these conferences which are the same as the pilot project which is running for two years. I am sure the Minister of State will think about it between now and Report Stage. We are running family group conferences, yet the Bill brings forward family welfare conferences which seem to be the same thing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)Where a health board decides not to apply for an order under this Part following receipt by it of a request from a child's parent or guardian that it does so, or unreasonably delays in making such an application, the parent or guardian may make application to the court under this Part.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 30 states:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;c) an application under subsection (1) of this section may be made by a child's parent or guardian in the circumstances prescribed by section 23A(4).</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled these amendments is that the Bill does not envisage a situation where a health board decides not to apply for a special care order as requested by parents. There are circumstances in which parents can request the health board to seek a special care order in the courts. In the event of the health board deciding not to do this, no route is open to the parents under the Bill. It is vitally important that parents have the opportunity under the legislation to proceed to seek a special care order in the courts. This amendment proposes to give that right to the parents in the event of the failure of the health board to seek a special care order.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the constitutional rights of parents are protected in this legislation. This amendment is an attempt to do that. If this amendment is not made to the Bill, it will be seriously deficient in relation to the rights of parents and children. Parents have the primary responsibility and in the event of other authorities not taking the responsibility, this amendment, if accepted, will enable the parent to proceed to seek a court order for a special care order in respect of the child.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendments. During debate on the Mental Health Bill, I spoke about the difficulties families can have with troublesome adolescents especially. Sometimes they have felt there has been a slow reaction by the various authorities. It has been put to me that the reaction of the medical profession has been very slow. Senator Taylor-Quinn has a very good point in tabling these amendments to allow the parents to act if they feel the situation is moving to slowly. After all, they are the people with total responsibility for the child <Col N="768" /> and should be able to apply for special care orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The detention of a child in a special care unit should be a very last resort. It is a route we would not encourage until all other options have been exhausted. I do not propose to accept these amendments. It is correct that the health boards, which have the statutory responsibility for dealing with children, should apply to the courts for the special care order. As it stands in the Bill, the courts can grant to the health boards the power to detain a child.</P>
      <P>A child whose behaviour would suggest there is a real and substantial risk to their health, safety, development and welfare will need special care and protection. Because these children are not criminals, they do not have the same protection of the courts as young offenders or people before the courts on criminal charges.</P>
      <P>It is a serious matter to take away a child's liberty and it is important that the checks and balances provided for in the Bill be enforced. If a health board wishes to apply for a special care order, it must first hold a family welfare conference to ensure a family's participation in the process. If, on completion of its deliberations, a health board wishes to proceed with an application, it must then seek the views of the special residential services board. Where a health board seeks an interim care order, it is bound to arrange a family welfare conference if such a conference is not already in place and due to seek the views of the special residential services board. These checks and balances are critically important in ensuring that a child's rights and liberties are protected.</P>
      <P>It is neither sufficient nor acceptable, where parents feel they cannot cope, to merely lock up a child. Special secure care is the ultimate level of care provided for a child and other measures can be availed of prior to resorting to special care. A child may first be taken into foster care, ordinary residential care or a high support unit &ndash; residential care with an intense level of staffing and therapy. It is vital that the provision of special secure care is left to those who have statutory responsibility in this area. A child's rights must be recognised and his or her liberty must not be taken away lightly. I accept that where special care orders are required, it would be undesirable for delays to arise in obtaining them but the provision of additional places through the building programme should ensure that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice in this area varies significantly from the position outlined by the Minister. I acknowledge that the Bill provides for checks and balances such as the family conference and consultation with the residential services board but we must deal with realities. The Minister envisages that the accommodation problem will be addressed and this will happen at some future date. However, a health board, on <Col N="769" /> consulting the residential services board, is likely to be informed that accommodation is packed beyond capacity, that places do not exist for children in these circumstances and that there is a backlog of children in need of accommodation. In an effort to cover their own backs, bureaucrats and administrators will decide they cannot proceed with applications for special care orders because the necessary accommodation and facilities are simply not available.</P>
      <P>A vacuum will be created in this area. A child in serious need of care may not receive it because a health board decides for a variety of reasons not to apply for special care orders. I accept that the health boards have a statutory responsibility in regard to these children but the primary, constitutional responsibility rests with parents and it would be very wrong to exclude them by the terms of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards must at all times act in a child's best interests. If they feel a child is in need of services, health boards are obliged to provide such services. That is why services at various levels are being funded and supported. In the past three years, an extra £90 million was provided for such services in addition to capital expenditure on places. It is envisaged that health boards would first put in place all of the other services, such as family support, foster care, ordinary residential care, high support care and that special care would only be availed of as a last resort. I would not like to see a situation arising in which health boards charged with looking after a child's best interests and welfare would be guided by administrative concerns. That is why we have made provision for additional places. The principle of ensuring that detention is only availed of as a last resort rather than a quick solution is very important.</P>

      <P>It is important to distinguish between offenders and non-offenders. Unfortunately, situations have arisen in which young people charged before the courts have, by virtue of the fact that accommodation was not available in Oberstown or Trinity on a particular night, had to spend the night in a Garda station. These are not the children to whom we refer here. We are discussing special care orders for non-offenders whose behaviour puts them at risk.</P>

The phased implementation of the Bill's provisions is crucial in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)A notice containing an abridged version of the rules of the special care unit shall be displayed in a conspicuous place in each unit and a child on admission to such a unit shall be given a document which contains information relating to the rules and the daily routine in the unit and is written in language appropriate to the age of the children catered for in the unit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed the difference between offenders and non-offenders during the debate on the Bill. It strikes me as odd that children in schools of detention may, in some respects, be in a better position than children taken into special care units. Amendment No. 31 is more or less a repetition of the terms of section 179(3) and amendment No. 32 is essentially a restatement of section 201(2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 179(3) provides that children in places of detention will be familiarised with an institution's rules and routines on admission. However, the same does not seem to apply to children admitted to special care units. Neither is any description provided in regard to the disciplining of such children. I would welcome the inclusion of the proposed subsection (6) in amendment No. 32 which seeks the prohibition of corporal punishment or any other form of physical violence, deprivation of food or drink, <Col N="771" /> treatment that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to physical, psychological or emotional well being or treatment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading. These provisions apply to children in places of detention but do not appear to apply to children in special care units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support Senator Henry's amendment. It is highly commendable and necessary because those who will given the responsibility of administering these units will have specific responsibilities and will be dealing with difficult situations. It is important to ensure absolutely by statute that nothing untoward is done in those units and that specific direction is given in legislation, and not only by way of guidelines from the Department, in the interests of protecting these children. That is vital. I commend Senator on tabling the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 31, this is an operational matter best addressed in the regulations and the standards of practice that are being developed for special care units. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the establishment of these units, the circumstances in which they should be used and to impose an obligation to have them inspected. This is the appropriate level of detail that should be put in primary legislation regarding these units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware the establishment of these types of units is a new development here. In order to ensure they are subject to the proper level of accountability, the Social Services Inspectorate set up in 1999 has drawn up draft national standards for special care units. These standards will provide the basis on which inspectors will form judgments about the quality of care provided in the units. The standards cover the following areas: the purpose and functioning of the units; management and staffing; planning for the young people in the units; the care of the young people; their education and the safety; and security of the premises. They include detailed directions on the rights of the children to have access to information, to be consulted in matters affecting them and respect for their privacy, dignity and individuality. They also deal in detail with issues regarding discipline, restraint if absolutely necessary, complaints procedures and absences without authority. These are the first sets of standards and <Col N="772" /> it is certain they will be updated as all concerned in the provision of the service and the inspectorate gain more experience. It is, therefore, important to maintain this level of flexibility to ensure the services can be continually monitored and improved when necessary.</P>
    <P>The standards will be enforceable as this Part is an amendment to the Child Care Act, 1991, under which the Minister has the power to give general directions to health boards on the services provided under the Act. In addition, detailed regulations will be made under this Part regarding the establishment and operation of these units, similar to those already in force in relation to mainstream residential care. They will deal with the additional issues that specifically arise in special care units. The regulations and standards together will help to ensure the children placed in the units will receive the proper care and protection they need.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 32, I have already pointed out that the regulations and standards will deal in detail with the issue of appropriate discipline. I do not believe that the proposed subsection (6) adds anything significant to the Bill, as the points raised are adequately dealt with in section 246, which makes it an offence for any person having custody, charge or care of a child to wilfully assault, ill treat or neglect a child. As we are dealing with a new development in special care and the Social Services Inspectorate has drawn up draft guidelines, it would be best to consider what Senator Henry suggested when the Social Services Inspectorate is placed on a statutory footing, which we intend, rather than in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This will not do. The Laffoy commission was set up because children in units were abused over years. This is not good enough. These are the people who we have to make certain are protected from a statutory point of view. Amazingly, children who have committed crimes are in a better position than those who may have been neglected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 24, line 3, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to a parent or guardian of a child&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If these amendments are accepted the proposed new section 23B(5) of the Act of 1991 would state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> If, while a special care order is in force in respect of a child, it appears to the health board concerned or to a parent or guardian of a child that the circumstances which led to the making of the order no longer exists with respect to the child, the board shall, as soon as practicable, or a parent or guardian may apply to the court which made the order to have the order discharged.</P>
    <P>This is similar to an earlier proposal. It seeks to allow a parent or guardian to apply to the court in the event of the health board not proceeding to seek a court or care order. I earlier outlined the reasons for this. It is vital that it should be done. It is in the interests of the constitutional protection that exists for children and their parents.</P>
    <P>Circumstances can arise where a health board may decide not to seek a court order. Should that happen and the parent or guardian is dissatisfied with the decision because they consider there is an absolute necessity for an order, they should have the right to seek one. I hope the Minster will agree to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new section 23B(5) to the Act of 1991 imposes on a health board the obligation to go back to the court and seek a discharge of the special care order in respect of a child where the circumstances which led to the making of the order no longer obtain. Under the proposed amendments, a parent or guardian will also be obliged to apply for the discharge of the order where the circumstances which have led to the making of the order no longer obtain.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to include this amendment in this subsection. The subsection clearly relates to the obligations of the health boards in the context of their powers and obligations in relation to a special care order as set out in the section. It is the responsibility of the health board to provide or arrange to provide the appropriate services and provide the necessary care and protection for children in special care units. The health boards, therefore, are the bodies which are in the best position to determine if the circumstances which gave rise to the order in the first place have ceased to exist. It is appropriate that it should remain the obligation of the health boards to seek a discharge under these circumstances and that the obligation should not be imposed on parents or guardians.</P>
      <P>Senators may be concerned about the rights of parents or guardians in these circumstances. This is properly addressed in section 23F, which allows a court on its own motion or on the application of any person to vary or discharge a special care order. This will allow a parent or guardian to seek the discharge of a special care order if they so wish.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 28, line 47, to delete &ldquo;periodic inspection&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;inspection every six months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendments were not discussed in the Lower House. If I am dealing with a Dáil Bill, I examine the legislation as passed by that House. I do not only read the Second Stage contributions so none of the amendments I tabled was discussed in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment for the same reason that I tabled amendments Nos. 31 and 32. Children in detention units are being given extra statutory rights, which they should have, compared to those in special care units. Under amendment No. 31, I referred to section 179(3) while under amendment No. 32 I referred to section 201(2). This amendment seeks to take account of section 186 which relates to the functions of the inspector.</P>
      <P>Section 186 states that an inspector shall carry out regular inspections which should take place at least once every six months of each children detention school and place provided under section 161. This is satisfactory, but the Bill states in relation to special care units that regulations shall be made for inspection by the Minister. Section 16(7) refers to a periodic inspection of these units by authorised persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned that many institutions run by the State were not properly inspected. This is why the Laffoy commission was set up, although I wonder if it was worth establishing it because no notice has been taken of the history of such units. The least that can be done for children in such units is to ensure that the supervision is as good as for those in detention units. This is why inspections should take place every six months rather <Col N="777" /> than at least every six months as the Bill states in relation to detention units.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Inspections every six months should be a minimum requirement in special care units. I assume it is an omission on the part of the Minister and the Department because it would be consistent to have the same supervisory role and inspection routines in special care units as in detention centres. Given the history in this area and the facts that have emerged in recent years in relation to care and detention units in the State, it is vital that, at a minimum, the same rules apply. I have qualms about inspections only being carried out every six months, but I support the amendment. I presume its exclusion is an oversight on the part of the Department.</P>

      <P>I do not recommend acceptance of the amendment because it is too prescriptive. Under the amendment, the regulations would provide for inspections every six months. As Senators will be aware, the social services inspectorate has been established on an administrative basis; it is still at the development stage. It has already carried out excellent work in its inspections on residential homes and it has pub<Col N="778" /> lished a report of findings on inspections of children's residential homes. This has provided invaluable guidance for the management of these homes.</P>
      <P>However, the inspectorate is still a small organisation and it would not be wise at this stage to impose such a strict timetable on inspections. It is proposed to establish the inspectorate on a statutory basis. When the legislation is being drafted, it is likely that the SSI will be more experienced in its operations and it may be appropriate to consider such an amendment at that stage. The inspector of children detention schools essentially will only have schools on two campuses to inspect. The social services inspectorate will have a much wider remit. At this stage, six monthly inspections would not be feasible.</P>

      <P>The problem is that the lowest common denominator is being used. The Bill does not even say it would be desirable. Some of the children involved may not even have visitors. As it stands, they are not in a position to complain to a visiting committee. Children are being badly treated in some of the legislation going through the Houses at present. For example, under the Mental Health Bill, children cannot go to tribunals. Under this Bill, special care units do not have to be inspected as frequently as detention units. The Bill should point to what is considered right. People who are stretched for funds and staff should not be told that they have a right to say they cannot run places because they must get more staff. The amendment is the least that could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend this amendment to the House. The provisions of the Bill in relation to private foster are intended to update the legislation in this area. They are designed to exclude normal arrangements that are made by parents and guardians on a regular basis regarding the care of their children. It is intended to ensure that, whether there is a reward, the health boards should be notified of a private foster care arrangement. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be that only arrangements made for reward would be governed by the legislation. As I pointed out in the other House when this amendment was put forward in that House, there would be considerable difficulty in defining where an arrangement was for reward if payments of any sort, for instance for expenses, were made. I am aware that provisions were proposed in the Child Care (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, in relation to private foster care and that it did contain this distinction. It did, however, qualify it by stating that &ldquo;a person undertaking the care and maintenance of a child shall be deemed to do so for reward if he receives any payment or gift of money or money's worth or any promise of such a payment or gift in connection therewith, irrespective of whether he makes a profit or intends to make a profit&rdquo;. Under the Senator's amendment even this qualification would not apply.</P>
      <P>In any event, to ensure that no obstacle can be put in the health boards' way in fulfilling their obligations, I feel that it is preferable to adopt the straightforward approach and impose the obligation on all persons arranging or undertaking foster care arrangements, as defined in section 23O, regardless of whether there is a reward. I am therefore recommending that this amendment be rejected. When this amendment was put before the Dáil, concerns were raised that the definition would preclude parents or guardians from placing their children with friends. The Government took these concerns on board and amended the definition appropriately. This was accepted by the Dáil on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 32, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)that the person or persons who arranged the foster care arrangement and the person or persons undertaking such arrangement co-operate with the health board in assessing whether it is in the interests of the child's welfare that the arrangement continue or be terminated,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that this subsection is included at this point. There is a number of other conditions included here where the health board may apply to the District Court for specified orders. It is in the interests of the child's welfare and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms. Hanafin Ms. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend that this amendment be accepted. The purpose of section 23U(<i>b</i>) is to allow the health boards to apply to the court for any one of a number of remedies where the board is of the opinion that a person has made or undertaken a private foster care arrangement without notifying the board or is not taking all reasonable steps to ensure the child's health, safety and welfare. These remedies are so that the board may obtain from the District Court under the Child Care Act, 1991, either a supervision order, an emergency care order, an interim care order or a care order. Alternatively the health board can apply to have the arrangement terminated and the child returned to his or her parents or guardian.</P>
      <P>Under the Senator's amendment it is proposed to add as a further option that a health board apply for an order obliging the persons concerned and the health boards to co-operate in assessing whether it is in the interests of the child to continue or terminate the arrangement. It seems impossible to have a court order making somebody co-operate on a matter. Senators should note that the amendments on private foster care are being inserted into the Child Care Act, 1991, and are therefore governed by the principles set out in section 3 of that Act. It would therefore always be an obligation on the health board to act in a manner that regards the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a health board considered it appropriate to monitor and supervise the situation voluntarily in co-operation with the private foster carers, it is open to the board to make that arrangement, without recourse to the courts. This is the situation in relation to many vulnerable children where the health boards work with the families <Col N="781" /> to ensure their protection without taking the child into care. Trying to oblige the health boards or people to co-operate by court order is an impossibility.</P>

      <P>No. The Minister's response is not very satisfactory. What the Minister is asking here is that the persons directly involved in making the arrangements for the foster care of the child or those involved in the foster care are ready to co-operate. These are people who would have very close contact with the child. If these people are not prepared to co-operate, there is something wrong. It is absolutely vital that there would be co-operation. To include this amendment would protect the interests of the child further. I am disappointed the Minister does not see fit to include the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 23V is to prohibit people from using the mechanism of private fos<Col N="782" /> ter care to circumvent adoption procedures under the Adoption Acts. Under the provisions of section 23V(1) arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement for the purpose of adopting a child is prohibited. Subsection (2) is designed to accommodate bona fide situations where a child is in private foster care and a genuine relationship has developed between the foster carers and the child. It allows carers to adopt the child subject to the condition that the child is eligible.</P>
    <P>Under the Adoption Acts the prospective carers would also have to undergo an assessment. Subsection (2)<i>(b)</i> allows the private foster care arrangement to continue pending the completion of the assessment if the health board consents. This is an important protection for the child. If this subsection was deleted it would undermine that protection and the intent of subsections (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 42 has a further amendment to that section. It would allow the health boards to apply to the court for the various remedies which come under the Child Care Act, 1991. The health board must understand that at all times the interest of the child is paramount. This Part is deliberately incorporated into the 1991 Act to ensure the legal protections exist for children. Therefore, this Part is not designed to reinvent the child care legislation. No new procedures are being proposed in relation to the provisions governing taking children into care.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on what she has done to improve the position of foster care. Those recent changes were very good and the increase in the amount of money being paid to foster parents is about 20 years overdue. It can be an onerous task, especially with older children.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point on the reason for not accepting Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendments. If foster parents tried to adopt the child and failed, for whatever reason, I assume the foster child would not necessarily be taken from them. This is probably what is behind Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment. If an attempt is made to adopt the child, will that mean that the child will be removed from them? They have at heart the best interests of the child, who may have developed a satisfactory relationship with them or the family.</P>

They are that the child is available and eligible for adoption and that the parents are suitable. It is not intended to split up a foster arrangement. We are talking only about private foster care arrangements which involve a small number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Part of the Child Care Act was being changed it was put to me that it was a pity sections 25 and 26 were not changed. Section 25 provides that if a child is joined as a party in proceedings before the courts the child is given legal representation. That is absolutely right. Section 26 provides that if a child is not a party to the proceedings, a guardian <i>ad litem </i>is appointed for the child. In neither case can the child have both. Both may be desirable. For example, the guardian <i>ad litem</i> may have built up a relationship with the child but if the child is then joined as a party in the proceedings the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is dismissed and legal aid is applied to the case. It was put to me by those who work in the field that it is a pity the child is not given both legal aid, if it is a party to the proceedings, and a guardian <i>ad litem,</i> if that is considered necessary. If the child is made a party to the proceedings and is then given legal aid the child loses the guardian <i>ad litem.</i>While the Minister of State cannot do anything about it today she could do it on Report Stage. This is the type of practical point that is brought to our attention from time to time. I cannot do anything about it because it incurs costs, though not that much. I hope the Minister of State will consider it and I would like to hear her views.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Taylor-Quinn's concern with regard to the best interests of the child. When one is dealing with children in this context, there is a balance of rights involved, including those of the child, society and the victims. All of their concerns need to be taken on board. In order to address the issues raised by the Senator, an amendment was put into section 23(2), which covers those issues. This provides as follows: &ldquo;The director shall be satisfied that the admission of the child to the programme would be appropriate in the best interests of the child and not inconsistent with the interests of society and any victim&rdquo;. That covers the point raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn while recognising that there are a number of interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>For both technical and policy reasons, I do not propose to accept this amendment. On policy, the final report of the expert group of the probation and welfare service made recommendations concerning changes to the operation of the community service order scheme. As that report is currently being examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would be inappropriate to give any undertakings on the operation of the 1993 Act until that examination is completed later this year. On the technical aspect, the Community Services Act provides for the imposition of community service by the courts and only by the courts. It can only be imposed as an alternative to a custodial sentence, it has to be for young people who are 16 years or over and the minimum number of hours provided for is 40. The amendment suggests community service, arising out of an action plan formulated at a Garda conference, for 24 hours for a child aged 12 years upwards. That would be in conflict with the existing legislation. Because of that &ndash; and I am not saying that Senator Taylor-Quinn's proposal does not have merit &ndash; the Minister has undertaken to refer this amendment to the group which is looking at the final report of the expert group already <Col N="786" /> referred to. While not accepting it now, it will be followed up in the context of the community service scheme.</P>

      <P>In page 51, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;member in charge of the station&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the child, being an adult relative or other adult reasonably named by him or her&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been agreeable for a very long time, agreeing to many sections. Perhaps the Minister of State has a good explanation but I find the provisions of the Bill odd in this regard. It is a sad reflection on society that section 58 provides that &ldquo;where a member in charge of the station is unable to communicate with the parent or guardian of the child, or the parent or guardian indicates that he or she cannot or will not attend the station within a reasonable time, the member may inform the child or cause the child to be informed, without delay, of that fact and of the child's entitlement to have an adult relative or other adult reasonably named by him or her given the information specified and requested to attend at the station without delay.&rdquo; That seems a very good idea. Under section 63(3), a child who cannot get hold of a parent or guardian can name another adult, not being a member of the Garda Síochána, in relation to notifying a solicitor. That all seems very good. The same applies again in section 62(2)(f2&gt;b)(iv). The name of any adult who attended at the station at the request of the child is also to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 65 again refers to an adult who attends at the request of the child. However, there is a change in the section dealing with the interviewing of children, namely, that the child can ask to have the parent of guardian present, or, in his or her absence, another adult, not being a member of the Garda Síochána, nominated by the member in charge of the station. Why has there been this change? The person named by the child, <Col N="787" /> who is <i>in loco parentis</i>, may have been available. It seems strange to suddenly decide that person will not do in terms of being present in the interview, and I would like to know why this change in policy was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 61 the interview will normally be in the presence of the parent or guardian of the children, under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>). I draw Senator Henry's attention to section 61(7) which says that references to a parent or guardian include references to an adult relative of the child, an adult reasonably named by the child or the other adult named in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>). Therefore, while it is not clear technically, from a policy point of view, the section sets out to achieve exactly what is intended. The Parliamentary Counsel wanted to avoid unnecessary repetition but the meaning is still absolutely clear. In other words, the child is entitled to have present at the interview a parent or a guardian, an adult relative, another adult reasonably named by the child or in their absence an adult nominated by the member in charge. Therefore, the meaning is the same as it is defined in subsection (7).</P>

      <P>(2) Any information obtained by the Garda Síochána pursuant to <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be inadmissible as evidence in the absence of a video recording of the obtaining of such information.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a follow on to Senator Henry's amendment. This is a protection element which would be important for both parties, namely, the child and a member of the Garda Síochána. In an era of modern technology it would be most appropriate in these instances for this provision to be included as it would protect all parties in terms of various accusations which could be levelled at a future date. The existence of a video to which reference could be made to provide clear evidence and show exactly the manner in which the interview was conducted and the written statement made would provide ample evidence and proof that everything was 100% above board and that the child was in a reasonable and proper frame of mind at that time, was fully aware of his <Col N="788" /> or her rights and was properly notified of his or her entitlements. This would work to the advantage of all the parties and should be part of every questioning situation, not just in relation to children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, particularly the section relating to videoing interviews. I know we are trying to promote this in all Garda stations and it is worthwhile starting it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would imply that every Garda station would at all times have available to it the equipment and facilities to enable video recording of all interviews with children. Currently, statements made in the course of Garda interviews with suspects are video recorded in a limited number of refurbished stations which have been equipped for that purpose. Work is also well advanced in terms of a nationwide scheme which will cover approximately 150 stations and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Currently, Garda video recording is carried out under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and Electronic Recording of Interviews Regulations, 1997. These regulations provide for the recording of interviews in respect of detained persons. This is subject to the availability of the equipment and other circumstances. Therefore, it is not the case that all the relevant interviews are recorded, even in stations where the cameras have been installed. The 1997 regulations do not make specific provision for a situation where the person being interviewed is a child, but they were drafted to operate in conjunction with the 1987 custody regulations which cater for interviews with persons under the age of 17.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment appears to be that all interviews involving the questioning of children as suspects should be recorded on video. Frankly, this would be impractical as the recording equipment will not be available in every Garda station. The costs are substantial, and apart from that each interview room, apart from having the recording equipment, would also have to be specifically fitted out for lighting and other purposes. The estimated cost of providing the facilities, training and storage for the 150 stations which will be equipped by the end of this year is £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the amendment makes no distinction between the offences covered for the various interviews. It would be inevitable that the number of recording units would be limited. It would be unrealistic to expect the recording of an interview with an adult in a very serious case should be brought to an end because it was necessary to make the equipment available to do an interview with a child charged with a minor offence. Because it is impractical and unrealistic to expect this to be done, I cannot accept the amendment, bearing in mind the requirement in section 61 that the interview with the child should always <Col N="789" /> take place in the presence of their parent or guardian, or an adult reasonably named by them. This provides protection for the child in the absence of cameras.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would at least consider some attempt being made to interview the children in some of the 150 Garda stations which will have this equipment and to a direction being given that where practicable or possible, a video recording of interviews be done. I recognise the realities in relation to some Garda stations, which do not have the facilities, but this is the 21st century and we should be aspiring to having that equipment in place. It would be particularly useful and helpful in the case of children, recognising that the child may have a parent, guardian or other adult present during the course of the interview. On balance the matter must be seriously considered by the Department so such facilities are put in place soon.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) For the purposes of this section a parent or guardian shall not be regarded as obstructing the course of justice where he or she advises a child of his or her right to remain silent.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fundamental principle of our democracy and of civil rights. It can be treated otherwise only under the various Offences Against the State Acts. I am seeking to reinstate a fundamental principle in the Bill. Children often automatically answer immediately when questioned. The type <Col N="790" /> of constitutional protection that applies to an adult should also apply to a child and a parent advising a child of his or her right to remain silent until he or she gets legal advice should not be deemed to be obstructing the course of justice. It would be a simple matter to put that into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section authorises a member in charge of a station to remove an adult from where a child is being questioned or from where a written statement is being taken where he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the conduct of the adult amounts to an obstruction of the course of justice. The amendment seeks to offer a partial guideline to the meaning of obstruction by excluding from it advice given by the adult to the child to remain silent. Much thought was given to this amendment and the conclusion arrived at was that it would not be in the best interests of the child or the parent or other adult to accept this amendment for a couple of reasons.</P>
      <P>The first is the question of whether giving legal advice could be regarded as obstruction, and it seems that obstruction could never be caused by a parent taking reasonable precautions to safeguard the rights of his or her child. If anything, it could be described as furthering the course of justice. Advising a person of a legal right is not an obstruction, no matter what the circumstances in which the advice is given. The problem with the amendment is that it might result in parents perceiving that they are, by means of a legislative provision, being encouraged to offer legal advice which they are singularly unqualified to give. No reference should, therefore, be made to their giving such advice, no matter what the context. Obstruction is not defined either here or in other comparable legislation. Giving it a partial meaning or providing a guideline towards its meaning could do more damage than good by introducing uncertainty.</P>
      <P>Advising a child of his or her right to remain silent amounts to legal advice. In most cases the child will already have received legal advice from his or her solicitor, and a solicitor is qualified to give legal advice. In the vast majority of cases, however, the parent or other adult would not be appropriate persons to give legal advice &ndash; their amateur advice could conflict with professional advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a question of telling a child to keep quiet and that all will be well. A decision to remain silent could have major implications in any subsequent criminal trial and any advice to that effect could only properly be given by a solicitor armed with the facts of the case. For example, inferences can be drawn from an accused person's decision, when being questioned or charged by the Garda in relation to a drug trafficking offence or an offence contemplated by the Offences Against the State Acts, to remain silent and not to mention facts which he or she later relies upon at trial. That is covered under other <Col N="791" /> legislation, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently preparing further legislation which proposes to apply to other serious offences provisions similar to those in section 7, in other words, that inferences can be drawn from an accused person's decision to remain silent. In such cases advice to remain silent could have implications later.</P>
    <P>This amendment also raises the question of the precise role of parents or other adults when present at the questioning of their children. There is power under section 70 for the Minister to make regulations on that role. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister of State would justify the denial of a fundamental legal and democratic right and suggest that parents are not in a position to advise children of a basic civil right. It is common knowledge that one has a right to remain silent until one obtains legal advice. The same rights that apply to an adult should apply to a child who is in custody. A parent should be entitled to tell their child what their rights are and not be deemed to be obstructing the course of justice by so doing.</P>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Minister of State are totally unacceptable and erroneous, and would not stand up to legal scrutiny. People are competent to do lots of things. One does not have to be a solicitor or a barrister to know what a basic civil democratic right is or to tell somebody what their basic rights are. As to the long-term implications in terms of further examination or trial, I do not accept what the Minister of State said and I am surprised that such a statement should issue from her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that parents taking reasonable precautions to protect their child would never be deemed to be obstructing the course of justice. That would be the duty and responsibility of the parent. Parents can give whatever advice they want in the best interests of their child, but it would be inappropriate to put that on a statutory basis. That is the fundamental reason for the objection. The child's civil rights are not interfered with in any way.</P>

    <P>I tabled this amendment because I have many constituents who work in these areas and they put it to me that, from a practical point of view, it would be worth including that the court should try to set up a family welfare conference only if it was satisfied that the parties were open to such a procedure and that there would be no point in trying to set it up if it was obvious that the parties were not interested in becoming involved in the procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to amend section 77 of the Bill. This section allows the court, where the child is brought forward on a criminal charge, to adjourn proceedings and refer the matter to the health board where it deems it appropriate. The Senator will appreciate that any child referred to the health board under this procedure is likely to have exhibited serious behavioural difficulties or anti-social behaviour and in such cases the board may have to consider initiating the process of applying for a special care order which could lead to a child's detention in a special care unit.</P>
      <P>The purpose of convening the family welfare conference is to ensure that the child does not become the subject of a special care order application without serious consideration of the alternative options being undertaken. We discussed this morning the number of checks and balances which are in place to ensure that, even if it is proposed to go ahead and seek a special care order, the best interests of the child are paramount and that detention, in whatever form, will be used only as a last resort. That is the philosophy behind it. It is the Government's belief that the family welfare conference is the best forum in which to explore all the different options for the child before reaching the stage of looking for a special care order.</P>
      <P>I can accept that the Senator's constituents probably feel that therapeutic solutions cannot be imposed on people who are not willing to accept them. It is not proposed to do that, nor would it be feasible to do so. However, the family welfare conference empowers families to come up with solutions to the problems which have led to the child becoming vulnerable and being at risk, and such conferences have a high success rate. It can only be ensured if there is a high level of consensus arising out of it, and the Bill provides for that. If the family cannot come to an agreement, the Bill also provides for that. The co-ordinator can refer the matter back to the health board for further consideration. With those types of checks and balances etc., the issues the Senators have raised would not arise under the legislation.</P>

      <P>The sections before this are really admirable and a huge improvement on what we had before. However, we have run into so much trouble in the past with various places of detention being mix'em gather'ems that I query the wisdom of allowing private institutions, which do not exclusively cater for one child or other, to set up again. This was exactly the type of problem we had in the past where children under special care, truancy and detention orders and orphans were all sent to the same place. We have repeatedly talked about the shortage of facilities and I am afraid a lot of these places will emerge again. I will not name the ones that have been in trouble in the recent past where the activities and lack of training of the staff have been most undesirable. I would have thought that these private institutions should opt to be one sort of institution or other. That is why I believed this section was undesirable, that is, because these institutions need not cater exclusively for children found guilty of offences.</P>

      <P>It is not expected that this section would be used very often. Part X gives the Minister for Education and Science power to designate places as children detention schools. These schools would cater for children aged 12 to 16 who are guilty of offences where the court is satisfied there is no alternative to them being in detention. Section 161 gives the Minister power to enter into arrangements with persons to provide other facilities for the detention of the same age group of young offenders. Any such place need not cater exclusively for young offenders.</P>
      <P>I know the situations about which Senator Henry is talking and we would not like to return to such situations. Indeed, throughout this Bill one will find there is a separation of offenders and children who have behavioural difficulties but who are not offenders. Although this section may not be used very often, it is an important provision to have on stand-by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science would have to provide therapeutic care and treatment in the schools for young offenders who require it. Some of that treatment might be very <Col N="794" /> specialised and it might not be possible to provide it in the schools. The Senator may well have come across colleagues dealing with people who are now presenting with very different types of problems, almost unique to a child or a very small group of children, and who need very specialised treatment. In circumstances where it might not be possible to provide that within the school, section 161 would be invoked. It is anticipated that any such place would almost certainly provide similar treatment for non-offending children. While one might be mixing non-offenders with offenders, it would be for the purpose of receiving the specialised treatment needed. If that subsection was deleted, that route would be cut off and the opening would not be there for the specialised treatment as it might not be available in the school in which they are present. It is a safeguard in the interests of the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>There is a concern among the public about places of detention being provided by private organisations or companies. I am aware that in recent years a number of interested parties from England have attempted to set up such centres in Ireland. The recent history of places of detention that were not in State ownership or under State control has surfaced and some of the things, and atrocities, that took place there were appalling. We need to do everything to ensure there is not a repeat of that.</P>
      <P>As regards private individuals, or companies, who get involved in providing this type of care and service, primarily companies operate to make a profit. The interests of the child need to be the priority at all times. I am concerned that private companies and organisations could set up facilities, which could occur under this Bill and European legislation. A hallmark of the discussion we have had on this Bill has been the lack of facilities and personnel. If these types of facilities mushroom, there will automatically be a move in that direction. That is something about which we need to be very careful and which is not desirable. The Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform must take the initiative in this area and must be to the forefront in the provision of the service. We must not allow a development of this nature to occur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed by Senator Taylor-Quinn. The section does not refer to specialised treatment. I would be the last person to prevent a young offender with specific problems from being moved to a centre in which there were non-offenders to avail of specialised treatment. However, the Bill does not refer to such specialised treatment. The Minister may recall Mr. Justice Peter Kelly saying some weeks ago that he found out by accident that a certain unit from which a young offender came before him was one of the types of establishments to which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred. Private <Col N="795" /> detention centres are flourishing in the UK and the US and they also exist in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about this section. I know the Minister cannot ban such centres but I would like to think they would at least be required to provide specialised services or treatment, not least from the point of view of protecting those children who may not be offenders. Some young offenders will be involved in serious drug offences or may have serious drug problems. Peer pressure may result in other young people who have not committed offences being exposed to or becoming experienced in these matters if they attend detention centres in which young offenders are placed. I am very unhappy with this section.</P>

      <P>I assure Senators it is not our intention to allow private operators to provide places of detention. That is not the purpose of this section. Where non-governmental organisations, such as voluntary organisations, provide places for children in terms of residential and high support care, they must be registered with and inspected by the relevant health board. Health board facilities are inspected by the social services inspectorate. Any non-governmental facility which may be established under this section would be subject to the same strict inspection criteria. We do not intend to open the doors to private operators, we merely want to ensure that where it is necessary to place children together for specialised treatment etc., the Bill facilitates this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the Minister's intentions in this area. However, English companies have attempted to secure properties and planning permission in remote areas of rural Ireland for this type of facility. I was particularly concerned in one case by the isolated nature of the location in which a company sought property. I am fearful that this section will enable such companies to establish centres here, although I acknowledge that is not the Minister's intention. While the same regulations and inspection requirements may apply to such centres, we must be far-sighted and vigilant. I urge the Minister and the Department to ensure that health boards will be very alert to any proposals in this area as we must protect our children at all costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On an earlier section in which I sought to ensure institutions would be inspected at a minimum interval of six months, the Minister stated that sufficient inspectorate staff did not <Col N="796" /> exist to facilitate this and that inspections could only be carried out periodically. These detention centres could be very isolated and uncontrolled. I reiterate that I do not believe this is the Minister's intention, but this section is far too loose and may result in difficulties on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>These institutions could be used for purposes other than specialised therapy, such as half-way houses for people leaving young offenders' units who need to be reintegrated into society. Such half-way houses could either be run by or subject to inspection by the probation and welfare service. The necessary safeguards are provided for in the Bill and all institutions, which may be put to a number of uses in children's interests, will be subject to all the Bill's provisions. It is not intended that this section will be widely used but I felt it was necessary to make provision in this area.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and her officials on this Bill. Generations of people must almost have come before her, as this is a mammoth Bill. It has been a worthwhile task. It is a major improvement, particularly in the area of children in detention who come before the courts. I expressed my concerns about various areas. I hope that in practice the necessary resources will be provided to put into action what is intended in the Bill. I know the Minister of <Col N="797" /> State's heart is in this and that was obvious the whole way through when we was dealing with it. I thank her and her officials for carefully explaining matters.</P>
      <P>While some people may think the Bill has come up here for rubberstamping, there are those of us who believe that what happens in the Upper House is also of importance.

      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through this House. As I stated on Second Stage, having regard historically to the Succession Act and the Companies Act, 1963, this is major legislation that is more than welcome. It has taken both Houses and different Governments to tease out this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a user friendly Bill to provide for the safeguarding and protection of children. It is a reforming Bill and its approach is extremely innovative. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, the Minister and all the officials concerned on the great work that was put into it. Since I started studying law 25 to 30 years ago, I would rate this as one of the Bills that will go down in history as a major milestone in legislation and it is most welcome.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister of State is committed to ensuring the necessary resources will be put in place to implement the provisions in the Bill, including the placing of children who are unruly in safe houses, etc. That must be welcome.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Henry and Taylor-Quinn, who made some excellent points, although I had to leave the House for three-quarters of an hour during the debate. Some of their amendments were not far off the mark, although I suppose the Minister of State and her officials have to take a certain line and overall her response to the various amendments was prudent and well thought out. It is a great day for this House that this Bill has been passed.</P>

      <P>I join Senators Henry and O'Donovan in complimenting the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on steering this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is progressive legislation relative to the legislation that was previously in place. The Minister of State and her Department officials must be complimented on the extensive work and research in compiling the extensive sections of this Bill in an attempt to promote and advance the protection of children, particularly the reorientation of children who have specific difficulties back into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the points raised on this side of the House will be considered by the Department. We were disappointed that some of our amendments could not have been accepted, as they were tabled in good faith and because of concern regarding particular areas. Our main concern still <Col N="798" /> remains the operation dates of the various sections and putting those in place.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence the Minister of State is fully committed to the Bill, but it is vital to secure the necessary resources from Cabinet to implement various sections. I urge her and her senior colleague to ensure that is done. This is fine legislation, but it is no good unless the necessary resources are provided to implement it. I wish the Minister of State every success in securing the necessary resources to make this legislation effective.</P>

      <P>The passage of this Bill is completed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and Senators have raised some valuable points that will be taken on board in our consideration of other issues that refer directly to this legislation. On behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is the Minister sponsoring and responsible for this legislation, I thank everyone involved for their interest and the thorough debate that has taken place on various aspects of it.</P>
      <P>As has been said, this is historic legislation. It is the greatest change in children's legislation since the 1908 Act. That is nearly 100 years old, but it has now been completely revamped. To go forward on the principle that we are working in the best interests of the child and that detention is used only as a last resort can only be for the good of the child. The way in which this Bill also recognises the responsibilities of the individual, the family and society makes us all face up to the fact that this is about our children and their lives and that we all have a part to play in that, particularly in regard to children who are offenders and those who have special needs in terms of having behavioural difficulties.</P>
      <P>I particularly wish to mention the officials of the three Departments involved, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children, who have been working on this legislation for many years. I assure the Senators that this is not legislation that will be left on the shelf. The Government is totally committed to ensuring this Bill will be enacted with the proper provisions and necessary investment. While much of this work has started and I thank the Senator for recognising that, much more needs to be done. Having this legislation on the Statute Book will mean we can move forward in the best interests of children, their families and society.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000, to this House. I will take a few moments to describe an outline of some of the key provisions of the Bill. In doing so, it is worth reflecting on the historic importance the VEC sector has played in the education of generations of Irish students.</P>
      <P>In 1924, the then Minister for Education requested a committee on technical education to report to him on the provision of technical education. It was the recommendations of this report, published in 1927, that would lead in 1930 to the first Vocational Education Act. Our vocational education sector, therefore, can be counted among the longest standing sectors in the Irish State, predating even the Constitution and, by extension, this House. In that time, the sector has played a pivotal role in the organisation, management and provision of second level education to Irish students. In recent years vocational education committees have gone beyond this role and are now engaged in the provision of wider educational services, including the critically important and developing area of adult education.</P>
      <P>I will touch briefly on some of the key aspects of the legislation today but we will have an opportunity to discuss the details in more depth on Committee Stage. The need for reforming legislation for the VEC sector has been evident for some time. At the time of the publication of the Green Paper on education in 1992, the wide ranging role of the VEC sector, covering vocational education and training, second level education, youth work and adult education was highlighted. It was recognised that the VEC structure continued to be a core feature of Irish education. However, at the same time it was recognised that there was a clear need to ensure that the sector was equipped to recognise the many and dramatic changes in the Irish education sector which have occurred in recent years. Successive policy documents confirmed this stance and set the scene for the current reform the Minister proposes to undertake with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the Minister's proposals lie the students. Today's students face an increasingly competitive and complex environment. We are all familiar with the development of the knowledge based society and the rise of a globalised econ<Col N="800" /> omy. We know from experience that these changes offer many opportunities. We have benefited significantly from the development of the hi-tech industry in Ireland, both through the involvement of foreign corporations and the development of our own indigenous sector in this area. We have seen the rewards and prospects that this offers our students. We must also recognise that to seize these opportunities, our students will need to have access to a world class education system.</P>
    <P>The new VEC legislation cannot in itself provide for world class education. At root, the educational experience is something unique to each individual student. It will be shaped by a range of factors, including the knowledge and expertise of their teachers, the support of their family, their peers and each student's own sense of ambition. No legislation of itself can seek to deal with the complexities of such issues. However, what this legislation can and must do is create the legal environment to give vocational education committees the means to plan their own operation so as to ensure that, through their schools and their other centres for education, they can deploy their resources in a way that is sensitive to the needs of their students and their communities. It also sets out to provide vocational education committees, as is proper for autonomous bodies, with the flexibility to enable them to respond to uncertainty and the authority to put in place effective and appropriate educational services for the needs of those they serve.</P>
    <P>To achieve these aims, the Minister proposes a number of changes to four key areas of the current VEC legislation. This legislation will provide for a revision of the functions of vocational education committees, for more inclusive membership in vocational education committees, for more effective reporting arrangements within vocational education committees and between vocational education committees and the Minister and for an updated financial structure for the operation of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The functions of vocational education committees have remained largely unchanged since the founding legislation of 1930. However, legislation developed at a time when school attendance was compulsory only up to 14 years of age and when a general second level education was the privilege of a relatively small fraction of the population is inadequate today. The authors of the legislation identified a relatively narrow role for those schools set up under the auspices of vocational education committees. The role of these schools would be to provide &ldquo;continuation education&rdquo;, which would supplement existing elementary education, and &ldquo;technical education&rdquo;, which would assist in the development of the trade and craft skills required by local industry.</P>
    <P>The modern reality of vocational education committees is radically different. VEC schools are now an integral part of our second level edu<Col N="801" /> cation system, providing schooling for almost 100,000 second level students &ndash; nearly 30% of all second level students. VEC centres are actively engaged in the provision of a wide range of adult education services, from basic literacy to certificate courses. Indeed, the Government White Paper on adult education earmarked the sector as the home for the development of a resourced and comprehensive adult education service.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's view, it is now appropriate and timely that the VEC legislation should reflect the changed reality of VEC operation. The existing functions of the vocational education committees set out in the 1930 Act will be retained. However, section 9 of this Bill sets out a more complete description of the functions of vocational education committees, capturing the reality of their role in Irish education today. The section provides that each VEC will now have a general responsibility to continually review, plan and co-ordinate the provision of education in its area. These changes, together with other changes to the way in which vocational education committees will plan their activities, particularly the education plan and service plan, are designed to change the basis for the operation of vocational education committees. The Minister's intention in these changes is to ensure that vocational education committees are in a position to structure their activities to meet the educational needs of the students they serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing certain important changes to the manner in which the VEC will be constituted. The 1930 Act provided that the membership of the VEC would be drawn from the corresponding local authority. Of these members, not fewer than six had to be persons who were not members of the local authority but drawn from the wider community of the local business or commercial fields. It is not the Minister's intention to diminish the role of the local authority in the operation of the VEC. Local authorities have been centrally involved with the VEC sector since its establishment. Their contribution has been one of the strengths of the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today proposes certain other changes to the model of representation. The Minister proposes to provide for statutory recognition for the partners in education to become formally involved in vocational education committees. Accordingly, the Bill provides that in addition to local authority representation, there will now be a statutory right of representation on committees for both parents of students attending vocational education committees and the staff employed by vocational education committees, including teachers. The Bill also provides that further categories of persons will also be considered for membership of each VEC, including students, representatives of voluntary bodies and local business interests.</P>
    <P>Following the debate in the Dáil, the Minister introduced amendments to extend these categories so as to ensure that consideration will also be <Col N="802" /> given to classes of staff who may not be represented following the election of staff members to the VEC. This might include representatives of the administrative staff of a VEC. The Minister has also made provision for representatives of religious trustees who may be trustees of schools which are operated under the auspices of a VEC. Typically, these schools would be the result of a merger between a VEC school and a local voluntary secondary school. These broad categories will allow vocational education committees to continue to involve a breadth of interests from each local community in the operation of the VEC.</P>
    <P>The Education Act, 1998, has already given the principle of partnership a statutory footing in the education system. That Act has given parents a new range of statutory responsibilities and rights, ranging from the recognition of local parents' associations in each primary and post-primary school to their formal involvement in the preparation of new models for boards of management at national level. Parents have long sought that this principle of recognition should also extend to the VEC sector. The Minister fully subscribes to that view and is happy to make this provision in this Bill. The parents of students attending VEC schools will, therefore, be able to elect two representatives to become full members of each VEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister also considers it appropriate that the staff of the VEC should also be entitled to membership of the committee. The single most important attribute of any organisation is its staff and it is appropriate that their involvement should be formalised by distinct provision in the membership of the VEC. Therefore, in the same way as parents, the staff of each VEC will be entitled to elect two representatives to sit on the VEC. The Minister has made provision that where a class of staff proves not to be represented in this formula, consideration must be given to including such staff as a member of the four extra persons to be nominated to the VEC.</P>
    <P>In relation to the changes the Minister is proposing to reform the planning structures within vocational education committees, the Minister considers it to be desirable to take account of the changes which have developed in other spheres of local government in recent years. The health boards have, for example, undertaken a new method for the organisation of their work through the use of an annual service plan. Local authorities have adopted a somewhat more long-term framework for their operation, which allows for the identification of the needs of their local communities and the preparation of plans to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers it essential that vocational education committees should have the tools to allow them to undertake their work in a targeted and focused manner. Vocational education committees today have responsibility for a wide range of educational needs, ranging from <Col N="803" /> the new entrant to second level education and students undertaking post-leaving certificate courses to obtain specific job relevant skills to the adult learner who is undertaking further study in any one of a range of areas. These needs are met through numerous schools and centres for education, with services provided daily by teachers and administrative staff.</P>
    <P>The role of the VEC is not limited to the present; it is equally important to anticipate the needs of tomorrow's students. In the Minister's view the techniques of annual and medium-term planning offer vocational education committees excellent opportunities to approach these challenges in a structured way. Indeed, most vocational education committees have built such principles into their planning process. This legislation will place these principles on a legal basis.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill will require that each VEC prepare a service plan. The legislation provides that it will be prepared each year immediately after the allocation of resources by the Minister for Education and Science, an allocation which will be made after the budget. The plan will set out the income the VEC expects to receive that year and how it proposes to allocate that expenditure. The service plan will also set out broad categories of service which each VEC will provide and the estimated expenditure it will incur in providing that service. The service plan thus provides a complete picture of how a VEC intends to carry out its functions in the coming year. The Bill further provides that each VEC will at the end of the year prepare a report on how it has carried out the objectives it has set for itself in the service plan the previous year. This will allow for full accountability in the operation of the VEC. Its operations and activities will be open to outside scrutiny. This accountability will give the local community a greater understanding of the role and activities of the VEC. Where those activities might be enhanced or redirected, they will be able to so inform the VEC, thus creating a virtuous cycle of enhanced services.</P>
    <P>At a longer-term level, section 30 of the Bill requires vocational education committees to create an education plan. The function of this plan will be to set out a broad vision of the future activity of the VEC. It is intended that this plan will comprehend the next five years of operation of the VEC. It allows the committee an opportunity to focus its attention on the overall development of its services, a focus which might on occasion be sacrificed to the needs of the instant. Issues such as demographics, population shifts, changing economic circumstances or patterns of employment can feed into the thinking of the committee to inform it in its plans for the future development of the VEC.</P>
    <P>It will be the role of the chief executive officer to prepare a draft education plan at the direction of the VEC. In so doing, the chief executive officer will consult such persons or organisations <Col N="804" /> as the VEC itself considers appropriate. It will be the final responsibility of the VEC to consider the plan as prepared by the chief executive officer, to make such amendments as it sees fit and to formally adopt the final plan. In each subsequent year thereafter the chief executive officer shall prepare a report for the VEC on the operation of the plan. This will provide a useful opportunity for the VEC to consider the operation of the VEC in the context of the identified needs and objectives of the VEC. The VEC may also at this stage take the opportunity to amend the plan in light of unanticipated events.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also made provision in this Bill for the introduction of the reserved executive model into the VEC sector. This model, which is in widespread use throughout the other spheres of local government, provides for a division of the policy and executive responsibilities of each VEC. The policy functions, which are known as reserved functions, are assigned as the responsibility of the committee of the VEC. Thus the preparation of both the service plan and the education plan will fall within the scope of the committee. While the officials of the VEC may assist in the preparation or compilation of information, the formal adoption of these plans will be the responsibility of the committee alone.</P>
    <P>The Bill assigns executive functions to the chief executive officer. In bringing forward this reserved executive model the Minister is conscious of its proven success throughout local government. It acknowledges the role which should be accorded to the elected and appointed members of the vocational education committees. It is proper that these representatives are charged with the role and responsibility for the overall direction of the VEC. The officials of the organisation are in their turn responsible for the effective implementation of those policies and are accountable to the representatives for failure to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to point out some of the more recent amendments made to this Bill in the other House which also affect the issue of reporting arrangements. In line with the recent trends towards enhanced accountability of public bodies, particularly to the Oireachtas, the Minister has made provision to ensure the right of any committee of either House of the Oireachtas to be able to summon the chief executive officer of a VEC to such committee to allow for that committee to consider such aspects of the operation of the VEC as it deems appropriate. Vocational education committees will now have a statutory duty to comply with such requests. In many ways this merely provides a legislative basis for common practice among vocational education committees in recent years. For example, it has long been the practice for vocational education committees to attend the Committee of Public Accounts to respond to queries on their financial operation. Sections 17 to 19 will provide a legislative basis for the maintenance of this practice and its exten<Col N="805" /> sion to include other committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A further element of the Bill provides for the regularisation of the position of County Dublin VEC. The legal basis for that VEC is currently governed in a somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> manner by the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology legislation. This arose due to a redesign of the local authority borders in the Dublin area, which has led to some departure from the traditional local authority-VEC area alignment. County Dublin VEC now extends to cover three local authority areas. The Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act, 1999, made an interim provision for these three local authorities to elect the members of that VEC. It has been the view of the Minister for some time that it is necessary to ensure that this provision is replaced and the activities of County Dublin VEC, one of the biggest VEC schemes in the country, placed on a more secure footing. Indeed the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act requires this as the provision in that law expires this year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Bill provides for such a basis for the operation of the County Dublin VEC. The Bill also provides that the Minister may, by order, following consultation with the groups involved, provide for a realignment of the Dún Laoghaire VEC border, to become conterminous with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The Minister is aware that there has been some discontinuity in this area since the recent reforms to local government. However, he is also conscious of the need to consult fully with all the affected parties before taking any decisions in this area. Accordingly, the Minister has provided that any such order must be preceded by the appropriate and proper consultation to ensure that the ultimate outcome will reflect the needs and wishes of the affected communities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before this House today. The provisions of this Bill set out the most noteworthy reforms of the VEC sector since its establishment in 1930. Both the Minister and I believe that these reforms will significantly enhance the operation of the VEC sector and, in so doing, enhance the quality of education being provided through this sector. In making his proposals, the Minister is conscious of the need to ensure that the essential strengths of the VEC sector &ndash; local involvement and devolved decision-making &ndash; are retained. The Minister is confident that they have not only been retained, but enhanced. The inclusion of parents and staff in a formal manner on vocational education committees recognises the important role of both these partners in education. The new procedures for the nomination of four further members to the VEC from the wider community sector will ensure that vocational education committees can continue to draw upon the talents and resources of their local communities.</P>
    <P>In terms of the internal operation of vocational education committees, this Bill has significantly <Col N="806" /> revised the old financial and reporting structures set out in the 1930 VEC legislation. The Minister believes that these changes are necessary to allow vocational education committees to plan and structure their work in today's environment. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on this Bill and a chance to consider the details of the Bill on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is largely non-contentious. Its purpose is to provide for new structures and procedures so that individual vocational education committees can meet the needs of the vocational education in their areas in as effective and efficient a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill's principal aim is the revision of the composition of the vocational education committees to include representation on the committees of parents of students registered in VEC institutions and VEC staff, including teachers. This is one of the more interesting aspects of the Bill. It is an area at which the Minister should look closely before the final conclusion of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The other provisions in the Bill, such as the classification of the functions exercised by the vocational education committees into reserved and executive functions, are basically what have operated in local authorities and health boards for a long time. The Bill also provides for additional functions for vocational education committees and revised reporting, accounting and financial procedures. Implicit in this is that the Department has learned from the misdemeanours and shortcomings highlighted in some vocational education committees in the past, with people being hauled before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain their actions. I welcome such new procedures.</P>
      <P>While the Bill, in itself, is not offensive, the explanatory memorandum states that the Bill's purpose is the provision of new structures to meet the needs of vocational education in the areas in which vocational education committees serve. These can vary from county to county or from one VEC area to another. For instance, Mayo VEC, the chairman of which is a Member of the Seanad, has been successful in administering vocational education needs and facilities throughout County Mayo. By contrast, some other vocational education committees are not so successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of vocational education set out in the original 1930s legislation establishing vocational education committees is very dated. Some committees are very progressive providers of academic and vocational education. However, it must be asked if there is a need for an overview of the Department of Education and Science and <Col N="807" /> the possibility that it might divest itself of some of its functions. That could result in the enhancement of the delivery of education at local level.</P>
    <P>It was a pity that the former Minister, Deputy Martin, decided not to proceed with the proposed regional education boards. While they were not an ideal solution they could have become a successful mechanism for the delivery of education. They offer the possibility of greater democracy and accountability in education at local level and a greater capacity to respond to local needs. This would have worked well in certain areas which are bogged down in bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The Department recently commissioned the Cromien report to review its operations. It should be debated in the House and on several occasions we have asked the Leader to arrange one. I hope a debate will be held in the early part of the next session. The report made some very worthwhile suggestions in regard to the Department divesting itself of the responsibility for organising State examinations. No doubt it will be one of the recommendations to be fast tracked following the debacle of the ASTI dispute.</P>
    <P>The Department is undertaking responsibility for all issues and is not delegating at local level. There are ongoing difficulties in various schools which, if left to the staff and locally elected and unelected representatives, would have been resolved long ago. Such procedures would allow the Department more scope to apply itself to policy issues. As an example of what is involved, the principal of a primary or post-primary school must seek departmental permission for new windows, doors and other maintenance work. This centralised practice is outdated. There should be a localised contact point and in this regard the process of communication between Athlone, Tullamore and local school management should be changed as quickly as possible. School principals should be able to contract work from local plumbers, electricians, etc., without having to obtain sanction from Athlone or Tullamore. While the Bill is welcome the Minister should indicate when some of the Department's functions will be delegated. Dealing with ongoing problems on a daily basis hinders its ability to be an effective agent of policy change in education.</P>
    <P>There is a need to cement a relationship in education between the interested parties, including parents and their children, teaching staff and elected representatives. Those outside the VEC sector react when any attempt is made to consider an outside democratic structure in education embracing both the VEC and non-VEC sectors. There is a reluctance to proceed on this basis because of perceived and real evidence of political interference. The provision to which I referred earlier will only give the opponents of democratisation and accountability a further stick to beat us with.</P>
    <P>Local elected members constitute a legitimate voice and they are directly accountable to the <Col N="808" /> public they serve. The provision for the vetting of members will do them a disservice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Later. If we are serious about partnership the partners in education should be given an automatic nominating right, otherwise there will be a politically driven vocational education committee system with all of the worst consequences. Without a commitment to progressing the agenda of greater democratisation and accountability those outside the VEC will use this aspect as a means to criticise.</P>
      <P>There is nothing very contentious in the Bill, which is broadly welcome. The Department of Education and Science should examine placing further democratic accountability in the delivery of education at local level outside VEC structures and the Minister should let us know of any plans in this regard. Members regularly encounter the cumbersome process involved in a school seeking an extension or securing a grant aid. If these matters were dealt with at local level they would be handled more efficiently in terms of finance and time.</P>
      <P>The Department indicated that it takes six years for sanction in principle to be given to the building of a new school or the extension of an old one. For a post-primary school that means a body of students will have started and finished their education before any new provisions are made. They are often educated in inappropriate and unsuitable accommodation, such as prefab or overcrowded classrooms. These issues could be best dealt with at local level, either by expanding the remit of vocational education committees to cover voluntary schools or by establishing parallel institutions.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the regional education boards were rejected. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what has been identified in the Cromien report. The Murray report, a review of vocational education committees, has gathered dust in that the politically difficult issues it raised were fudged.</P>
      <P>It is time we paid heed to putting in place an accountable structure for education to provide a forum for the partners outside the VEC sector to have a say in the running of education. That would leave the Minister more time to deal with the policy issues. There is merit in the view that the ASTI dispute may not have reached its current impasse if the Department had been in a position to concentrate on the issues best dealt with nationally while divesting itself of local issues which clog up the system and lead to inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable potential for streamlining the VEC sector and rationalising the system generally. The opportunity has been missed in that no attempt has been made in the Bill to deal with this matter. It must be asked why some vocational <Col N="809" /> education committees are running more efficiently than others and why some have been more successful than others.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions to broaden the base of VEC members and the move to provide on a statutory basis for the greater involvement of parents, staff and students. The Bill provides for new procedures, now commonplace in local authorities and health boards, to cover the definition of functions and the distinction between reserved and executive functions. It should be welcomed and I hope it will provide for better accounting and reporting procedures, services and education plans. These are standard practice in other local bodies, such as the local authorities, and it is long overdue that the same requirements be made of the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>Many vocational education committees have shown themselves to be extremely innovative and have been to the fore in providing new programmes in the second level system. That type of enthusiasm has been important from the point of view of the general well being of the sector. There is a vibrancy, especially among teachers, who have been very keen to make tailor-made programmes, services and courses to meet the needs of local catchment areas. The vocational education committees have played a very successful and useful role in this. They have also encouraged people to attend their schools.</P>
    <P>However, there are weaknesses which must be recognised, one of the principal being that they have been over-politicised. This has led to a certain amount of cynicism on the part of teachers and other stakeholders in education. The role of and the provision made for vocational education committees in this legislation is progressive in their representation of a range of community interests and their assessment of education in a local catchment area.</P>
    <P>There are good principles in the legislation, including the need to draw up education and service plans, the need to co-operate with other vocational education committees and the need to consult and work widely with parents and students within the catchment area. Many of the principles in the Bill should be applied to the entire education system. They make a good argument for a devolved system and local education structures.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the function of the chief executive officer and executive functions. Concern has been expressed in vocational education circles that during industrial relations difficulties, those directly involved would have had access to board members and independent arbitration. Will the Minister elaborate on the consequences of the section dealing with industrial relations disputes? What elements of the State's industrial relations machinery will be available? Certain provisions in previous vocational education committees Acts make specific avenues available to VEC employees to resolve disputes. Will unhindered access to arbitration be guaranteed?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The Bill also deals with the composition of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, which involves three local authorities and one vocational education committee. The Minister should reconsider the section with a view to broadening the representation for the other nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>I thank all the educational bodies and teachers, brothers and nuns who have contributed greatly to the educational process throughout the country. I welcome the Bill and will deal with it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in contributing to the debate because I spent much of my working life as a teacher and guidance counsellor. I also served as a member of the County Dublin VEC and I have an understanding of its functions and success over the years. The Vocational Education Act, 1930, has stood the test of time and it has enabled vocational education committees to reflect changes over the years. As the Minister said, under the 1930 Act, school attendance was up to the age of 14 years only and second level education in those years was the preserve of the few. The purpose of technical education was to supplement elementary education. As the Minister said, the landscape today is very different from that of the 1930s. Society has become more complex and legislation must reflect these changes. It must create a legal environment to give vocational education committees flexibility to enable them to respond to uncertainty and give them the authority to put in place effective and appropriate educational services for the people they serve.</P>
      <P>VECs are responsible for students with a wide range of educational needs, dealing with people from the age of 12 years through second level to adult education. They have the options of transition year, the academic leaving certificate, the vocational leaving certificate, the applied leaving certificate, post-leaving certificate programmes, VTOS and adult education, giving all groups an opportunity to stay in the education system. To meet these needs, vocational education committees have responsibility for schools, centres of education, employees, teachers and administrative staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill plans for the future needs of students, reflecting the changing needs of education and the local community. It proposes two important changes. It will require a VEC to prepare a service plan, which is a statement of its income and expenditure for the year, and how it proposes to allocate expenditure. It will also give a picture of how the VEC intends to carry out its functions in the coming year and report on how it carried out its objectives and financial responsibilities. The presentation of accounts will also have to be modernised to give a greater understanding at local level in terms of how the VEC operates. This is welcome because the financial arrangements were complex in the past. I worked there, but I <Col N="811" /> never understood them during the nine years I dealt with the County Dublin VEC.</P>
    <P>The second important change is the need for an education plan. Each VEC must implement a five year plan which reflects a broad vision of the future and all the activities of the VEC. It will be a framework with regard to how the VEC will operate following a process of consultation. The education plan will enable vocational education committees to focus their attention on the overall development of their services. Population shifts, changing economic circumstances and patterns of employment will be incorporated into the thinking of the committee. The chief executive officer must consult teachers, parents and other interested persons and there will be an annual review of the plan and its implementation. When will the five year plan start? Will it begin as soon as the legislation is enacted or will it start after the next local authority elections? It is an important issue and the vocational education committees want to know if it will start immediately. Will there be continuity of thinking or will there be a new composition after the next local elections?</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7 and the composition of the vocational education committees, the Minister has provided for wider membership and for putting it on a statutory basis. The committee will represent a wide range of interests, including local authority representatives, teachers and parents, with the balance provided by local employees, employers and the community. This shows that vocational education has always been vested at local level and it maintains a link between the VEC and the local community.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill is the revised reporting arrangements. The new model that will be applied to vocational education committees involves a division of policy between reserved and executive functions. Reserved functions are proposed for management regarding the overall policy direction. It will deal with the service and education plans adopted by the committee. The executive function, under the chief executive officer's stewardship, will be responsible for the management of the VEC's activities. The chief executive officer will be accountable to the committee at all times. I welcome this change, which is based on the model of local government and health boards.</P>
    <P>Elected members are responsible for setting out the policies and principles which should guide the organisation for which they are responsible. Will the five year plan start when a new committee is established after the election of a new local authority? This important issue is repeatedly raised by members of vocational education committees. The policies will refer to population shifts in areas where numbers are dropping, disadvantaged areas, literacy problems and special needs issues, which have been streamlined. It is important to recognise that the committee will <Col N="812" /> have a major responsibility in relation to planning for the future needs of the VEC.</P>
    <P>VECs are noted for their training in the skills area, such as carpentry, plumbing, brick-laying etc. Vocational training should not be forgotten. Over the years, it has shifted to the academic model of secondary voluntary schools, losing sight of its real objective. The core values associated with VEC training that started with the group certificate and moved on towards apprenticeships have slipped away. In the past, vocational education committees focused on the skills area, taking in those who were more practically orientated. There was a definite divide between those who were academically inclined and those who aimed towards practical subjects.</P>
    <P>All the vocational education committees reflected the employment trends and adapted their courses accordingly. They opened their doors to students who were prepared to move towards skilled areas. They prepared students for secretarial skills, office work, home economics, cookery, dress making, art, engineering and woodwork. They always maintained a link with the weakest students. Having worked with the City of Dublin VEC for many years, I experienced the contribution made by vocational education committees, the expertise of teachers in dealing with many problems and how the vocational education committees set up structures to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin VEC set up the first pilot scheme called the psychological service. This model should be used by other vocational education committees. Psychologists, guidance counsellors, remedial teachers and home-school liaison teachers worked together on difficult cases as they arose. I compliment the City of Dublin VEC on its Trojan work and innovative thinking in dealing with such issues. I also compliment the vocational education committees on meeting the demands of local areas for second chance education, post-leaving certificate opportunities and preparation for third level.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee was responsible for providing regional colleges, 23 second level schools and the six third level colleges which are now the Dublin Institute of Technology. Many colleges, such as those in Rathmines, Bolton Street, Mountjoy Square and Ballyfermot, stemmed from local VEC schools and have become constituent colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology. VEC third level institutions gave opportunities to people to participate in third level education. They created the career path of certificate, diploma and degree for those who might not have had a chance of such a career but for the innovative structures provided by vocational education committees. They were ahead of their time in acknowledging the needs of communities and in providing courses to fit into the needs of their areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> Post-leaving certificate courses were developed by vocational education committees at a time of great unemployment to keep students in education. New initiatives and courses were devised and validated to cater for local demands. Pre-nursing, business, catering, computer and physical education courses are among those which were introduced to prepare students for third level education or for work. I compliment previous Ministers for Education who allowed the visionary people within the vocational education committees the flexibility to serve their communities. Having been involved in this area and in VTOS schemes, I compliment vocational education committees throughout the country which were innovative in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill will place on a statutory basis what has been practised down through the years by the Dublin city and county vocational education committees and by vocational education committees throughout the country. I acknowledge the work which has been done in bringing students onto the path of education and into the world of work who might otherwise not have succeeded. At a time of high unemployment vocational education committees were pioneers in devising programmes for early school leavers, second chance education and back-to-work programmes to give those who had no chance an opportunity to get into the education world.</P>
    <P>Adult education and leisure programmes also helped those who had time on their hands or who wished to avail of a second chance at education in retirement. Vocational education committees have been a pioneering force in adult education. The White Paper on adult education shows the Government's commitment to furthering adult education and to putting it on a proper footing with a new structure. Several Bills will have an impact on the implementation of VEC policies. The Education (Welfare) Bill, the promised youth work Bill, the Teaching Council Bill, the Children Bill and the legislation to enact the contents of the White Paper on adult education will have an impact on the workings of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Our resources need a new structure. We speak of the inter-agency and departmental co-ordination. I hope this idea will work in practice. The City of Dublin VEC has implemented such a structure for many years but its work was hampered because the structure was not placed on a statutory basis. If we are to make this structure work, resources must be provided for the work which is being done by vocational education committees. We need greater co-ordination between inter-agency programmes.</P>
    <P>In the past vocational education committees have been noted for dealing with children at risk and have, for many years, handled the question of children at risk very well. Resources are needed to facilitate children in the move from primary to second level schools. Very often the supports, such as resource teachers and remedial <Col N="814" /> teachers, which are in place in primary schools are not available in secondary and vocational schools. Vocational education committees have done much to help children who need special help but much remains to be done. Personnel, expertise and financial resources must be made available to do the necessary work to deal with problems of innumeracy and illiteracy and with problem children.</P>
    <P>I compliment all teachers who work in the Dublin city and county vocational education committees, where I have most knowledge, and in the VEC system throughout the country. Teachers who have been employed by vocational education committees are first class. Not alone are they subject teachers but they deal with all aspects of children's welfare and with whatever problems they may have. They go beyond the call of duty and they deserve to be supported in the work they do.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the view of the Minister of State on the system of appointing teachers to VEC schools. We all know of the degrading practice of teaching appointments being made on a political basis when a teacher would not be appointed if he or she was not the right political colour. I am glad to see this practice is slowly disappearing. I have some experience of this practice because I, who was known to be politically involved, did not get a position for which I applied because I was not of the right political colour. All parties were guilty of this practice because they considered it important to maintain their political networks. Appointments are now made by a select interview board but, judging from the number of appeals made against the interview boards, I feel the system and the interview tecniques of the boards should be examined more closely. The question of appointments to teaching posts is still a controversial issue. It does not come within the remit of this Bill but it should be investigated, nonetheless. Now that we are tidying up the 1930 Act, our new regulations might also tidy up this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill upgrades the Vocational Education Act, 1930, which was first class legislation. It has stood the test of time and no new legislation could match it. It encompassed a wide range of education services and we have heard success stories of committees working with local people throughout their counties. More detailed aspects of the Bill will be teased out on Committee Stage. The Bill will tidy up loose ends, complement the work of VEC members and continue the link between the democratic process and local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, limited in scope though it is. It is a joy to hear someone such as Senator Ormonde speak with such enthusiasm and knowledge of her subject. Senator Quill would have wished to be here today but she is unable to attend because of illness. She spoke to me about her wish to be here to say the sorts of things Senator Ormonde has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> Senator Quill would have been particularly impressed by the sentence in the Minister's speech which stated that the students are at the core of the Minister's proposals. That is the point being made in the Bill. The core of the Bill being the students is also an essential part of the 1930 Act. Some years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Howard Gardiner, the expert in education who talked about the seven different intelligences and who commented that in the past we only measured some of those intelligences. The traditional leaving certificate syllabus and academic education did not recognise the other intelligences that exist. Charles Handy, the Irish expert in this area, added to that and said that there are ten different intelligences. If a youngster starts and feels that he is not succeeding, he will continue to go down and down and end up at the back of the class. If they find they are good at something, it gives them courage, enthusiasm and confidence to be good at other things. This is the great success story of the VEC system. It finds something that people are good at and enables them to hold their heads high and so gain confidence in other things.</P>
    <P>This morning I attended the Small Firms Association conference in Dublin Castle to hear Deirdre Purcell speak. She said that she had never spoken at a conference before but she spoke on a subject not far removed from that, about the need to get up in the morning looking forward to the day. She has had 13 different jobs, different occupations, in her working life. She spoke about teachers at school not praising some children. The great success of the VEC system is that it identifies the abilities, skills and talents of the pupils. The traditional education system measured only the ability to communicate in written form. We have now begun to realise that some of the great success stories result from the ability to communicate in spoken form. That was not measured in the past. The VEC system has been able to identify the other intelligences.</P>
    <P>The Bill is limited in scope. It will help to equip the vocational education sector for its role in a world that is changing fast in education, a role that is developing and expanding all the time. We have every reason to be proud of our vocational education sector, not least because it is the one part of the entire education system that was created by the independent State and not inherited from the British. When one considers the world as it was in 1930 when the original legislation was passed, it was very different from that in which we live now. It is remarkable how the vocational education sector has managed to adapt itself over those years to cater for the changing needs of the citizens of Ireland. In many ways it has been the cradle of innovation in our education system.</P>
    <P>This openness towards change is part of the culture of the sector. I experienced it for myself at first hand when I was involved in the develop<Col N="816" /> ment of the leaving certificate applied programme from 1993 to 1998. To say that the vocational sector welcomed the leaving certificate applied with open arms would be a considerable understatement. It regarded it as manna from heaven and its enthusiasm and energy played a large part in the eventual success of the effort.</P>
    <P>The sector has been in the front line of developing schemes like the VTOS and Youthreach, and perhaps most dramatically of all, it has pioneered the way in the long-neglected area of adult education. Indeed, when we look at the question of future needs, it is in the area of adult education that the greatest development will take place over the next decade. The problem of adult literacy is only now being recognised as a serious issue. The value of the vocational education system as one where people can have a second chance at education cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>Our present educational system has the unfortunate side-effect of leaving an unacceptable number of students by the wayside, as for one reason or other, they fail to connect with the educational train as it rushes past them. They do not manage to get on board. One of the functions of adult education is to repair and overcome that deficiency and it has not been paid enough attention up to now. This is only one of the functions of adult education. Just as important is the concept of lifelong learning, made necessary by the speed at which the world is changing around us. The notion that education is something that people finish with when they are young and never revisit during their adult lives is gone forever, and we must adapt to that reality.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should adjust the legislative framework of the vocational education sector to reflect this changing world. We should expand the membership of the vocational education committees to include representatives of the teachers and parents of the students. I am a great believer in looking after the customer and here the customer is the student. We must focus the work of the committees by distinguishing clearly between the executive function that should be the business of the professional administrators and the policy issues that are the proper business of the committee as such. It is a good idea to introduce the concept of strategic planning so that each committee works towards agreed goals over a five-year period. Planning can be overdone as a discipline but I know from my business experience that without planning one staggers from one crisis to the next rather than setting out to meet the future in a rational and structured way.</P>
    <P>I confess to a sense of disappointment with the Bill. The changes it proposes, while worthy in themselves, are little more than tinkering around the edges of the system. The Minister has opted for a minimalist approach and while I accept his reluctance to interfere with what is clearly a winning formula, I regret there has not been a root and branch examination of the structure of the sector. One nettle that has not been grasped is <Col N="817" /> the varying size of the vocational education committees throughout the country &ndash; the smallest county has its own committee just as the largest county has one committee. There is at least an argument that in the largest counties the VEC is too big to keep closely in touch with local needs and a corresponding argument that in the smallest counties the VEC simply is not big enough to command sufficient resources to do the job properly in today's world.</P>
    <P>It is a political challenge to face up to that. I do not think the problem of the smaller vocational education committees is sufficiently addressed by the provisions in this Bill for the committees to co-operate with each other. I suggest the nettle which has not been grasped is that the county is no longer the best framework on which to organise education. The reluctance to attack this issue is bound up with the control of vocational education committees by political parties through their membership of local authorities. That feeling is strengthened by the way in which local authority members will still have a majority on each committee under the new structure set out under the Bill. I am saying that in this House which has a very large number of local authority members and it may not be received with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The irony is that continuing with the present structure will have the effect of perpetuating the centralised control of education by the Department of Education and Science, something that everybody agrees is a bad thing, but about which nobody seems to be prepared to do anything. One could even see the emphasis on strategic plans in the Bill as a means of tightening that departmental control, not of loosening it which I think is the objective.</P>
    <P>Whatever about that, the fact remains that some intermediate structure is needed if the Department is ever to cede control from the centre, to decentralise and to empower others. Sooner or later we will have to revisit the question of regional structures in education, if we are ever to break away from over-centralisation.</P>
    <P>I recognise that such a re-organisation must involve the whole educational system and not just the vocational education sector, but I find it discouraging that in this Bill we are copper-fastening one type of structure when what we should really be doing is considering whether we need a totally different type altogether. I say that in the knowledge that in my few years' involvement with the Council for Curriculum and Assessment and with the Department of Education and Science I was highly impressed at the talent inside the Department and the council. I was impressed by the commitment, dedication and enthusiasm of the people there and their determination to make the new system succeed. They have done that. We have heard in the past year how teachers and the education system have grasped a hold of that. Let us make sure that those in the system are given <Col N="818" /> the tools to do the job through a structure that is geared to help them and not to hamper them in that effort.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is going in the right direction. It could be improved and, as Senator Ormonde has said, perhaps we will have an opportunity to do so in some form or other on Committee Stage. We can be proud of the system we have had since the 1930s. Let us make sure in the future to grasp the nettles that are not politically easy to grasp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and thank him for coming in to listen to our views on this important Bill. I am happy to add my voice to those in favour of the Bill, which replaces many of the provisions of the ground-breaking Vocational Education Act, 1930. This Bill has a much clearer definition of responsibilities and demonstrates the democratic representation in its structures, while at the same time confirming and affirming the basic principles of the vocational education system. It offers a seamless ring of lifetime learning from the early teenage years to the harsh examination period, to retraining and upskilling and into the golden years of retirement when many people decide to educate themselves. This latter group may not have been in a position to do so in their younger days although they had the capacity.</P>
      <P>The aims and objectives which the vocational education system sets are ambitious and comprehensive. The range and depth of the educational menu which it offers is worthwhile and the responsibilities and services it offers on a day to day basis, throughout the length and breadth of the country, are praiseworthy. It is an Irish creation of which we should be justly proud, combining as it does, in a unique way, appropriate educational courses for a wide diversity of people through its democratic structures which will be representative of parents, teachers, students, members of staff, voluntary organisations and all others closely associated with its establishment and ongoing work.</P>
      <P>The provision of quality education and ancillary services in institutions in every community is an obligation which the vocational education committees set themselves and took seriously at all times. We have heard about the democratic deficit. We should also look at the democratic benefits which the vocational education committees have brought to many communities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional functions set down in section 9 for the vocational education committees under the Vocational Education Acts bring home vividly the great burden of responsibility placed on them. It behoves all of us to ensure that all the financial provisions required to make the system work are made available. Many of the new provisions merely restate what the vocational education committees have been doing for many years. I welcome the broad emphasis being placed on democratic consultation with all the relevant sec<Col N="819" /> tors throughout the communities and the deepening of democratic representation that is now being brought about. They are timely and appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the confirmation in law of the responsibilities which the vocational education committees have willingly and without question taken on board down through the years. The great work they have been doing will have to be sufficiently resourced. We must ensure there is no fallback from that position.</P>
    <P>The planning and co-ordination of educational and ancillary services in each community will be tailor made. This is welcome because each community is different. There is a diversity of people and different things work in different areas. It is one of the core obligations at the heart of the work of the VEC and from that all other obligations can flow.</P>
    <P>The VEC is statutorily tasked in the Bill with the review of vocational education provisions in its own areas. It is clear that in many areas, particularly in Dublin City &ndash; the area which Senator Costello and I represent &ndash; there is a need for such a review. The influx of asylum seekers and refugees seeking a haven for their families means that in the capital city there is a large cadre of people whose first language is not English and whose traditions and concepts regarding education and the passing on of their cultural values is different from ours. This means the vocational education committees must begin to map out a new way forward to allow these people access to the necessary consultation process that others will enjoy. This is something in which they must engage, taking into account the many layers of language and cultural diversity that exist within these groups.</P>
    <P>Another key element which must be considered in such a review is the lack of impact of technology training in inner city families. While there have been excellent pilot programmes and while FÁS has endeavoured to include a module of technology training in many of its personal and community development programmes, a more organised campaign is needed to ensure adequate resources are made available with a view to bringing technology skills to young and old in inner city areas. They should be taken in and should receive the benefits of the information society. I urge the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to make this a priority in its review of educational services within the Dublin City region. Just as we in Ireland have led the way in software development, we have an opportunity to lead the way in personal development, particularly in the areas I have mentioned. These are areas that would otherwise be seen as disadvantaged or deprived. There could not be a more appropriate time to invest substantially in bringing the skills and benefits of the information society to these citizens. We could even hold them up as a model of upskilling and education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I welcome the strong and democratic representation for which this Bill legislates and I am sure it will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that citizens are represented properly, not only in the structures of vocational education but also in their educational and cultural needs. I wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and, to a large extent, I welcome the Bill which he has brought before us. It is long promised legislation, being one of the early Bills which we were led to expect. When we discussed the Education Bill in 1999, we expected that the Vocational Education Bill would be before us that summer. Accordingly, we did not spend much time on certain elements which we expected to deal with in the subsequent Bill. Some of those elements are in the present Bill and some are not.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we are updating the old 1930 legislation, which has stood the test of time very well. The idea and principle of vocational education was a wonderful innovation. The legislation under which it was established is just as relevant now, in terms of its intent, as it was originally.</P>
      <P>In a sense, it happened by chance. Back in 1919, we could not even have a Department of Education. The feeling at that time was that education should be left to the Catholic Church and the other denominations on the basis that it was their preserve, they could best deliver and education was not a fit subject for State involvement. For that reason, the first Dáil, in 1919, did not establish a Department of Education. A Department of Irish was established because the State had a particular brief to ensure that Irish became the official language. In an informal sense, education was left to the existing religious denominations. That explains, to some extent, the lacuna which existed whereby none of the churches was keen on providing technical education, training or apprenticeships. That was not seen as part and parcel of the religious perception of education as academic and classical but not including the technical side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By default, therefore, because nobody else wanted it, the State found itself in the situation of bringing in the 1930 Act and being allowed to deal exclusively with this area of education. It is noteworthy that a caveat was introduced that technical education was not to encroach on the voluntary secondary education sector. Its pupils were not allowed to take the leaving certificate, only the intermediate certificate. This was education for the poorer classes, for those who would not aspire to the heights of proper second level education. That is the lowly context in which the vocational education system was introduced, not that great work was not done in preparation for it but the <i>imprimatur</i> of the churches had to be obtained and that was granted on the condition that it would not interfere with anything which <Col N="821" /> the churches were providing. That was something of a disgrace.</P>
    <P>From those very humble beginnings, I am delighted the actual remit was one of inclusivity by the vocational education committees at the time, trying to reach out to all and sundry. The vocational education committees have developed as the most flexible mechanism in education since that time. That can be contrasted very starkly with the rigidity of practically all the rest of the educational system. It is the only truly democratic institution in the area of education. It may be said that, over the years, it became a puppet, to some extent, in the hands of certain political parties &ndash; one in particular which shall not be mentioned within these hallowed halls. Vocational education committees became discredited to some extent because they were tainted by politics.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the vocational education committees have such a preponderance of people appointed on a political basis from the local authorities. I do not disagree with the principle but I would like to see a better balance. In the standard VEC, all but four people out of 17 will be, more or less, political appointments. That is probably not healthy, considering the present public scepticism in relation to the political system. This should be looked at again with a view to providing a better balance between those from the political arena and those from other sectors. I ask the Minister of State to address that in his response.</P>
    <P>VECs have done sterling work in providing education, training and the apprenticeship system. When free education was introduced and the educational system became more open to new ideas, the vocational education committees were the very first to embrace that approach and to be innovative. They created a great deal of what is now our education system, not just at second level but across a much wider plane. They revamped the junior certificate. They revamped the leaving certificate, of which they are now part and parcel, and created greater flexibility in courses and accreditation. In both certificates, there were options within categories for the first time. The vocational education committees developed a huge range of other courses dealing with young people at risk, Youthreach and outreach, unemployed people and those with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is well aware, the vocational education committees were the only people who actually delivered in the area of adult literacy. They were the ones charged with delivery, they recruited the volunteers, provided the outreach programmes and did a tremendous job on a shoestring budget. They produced the post-leaving certificate courses when it was seen that university education was not the only third level system of education appropriate to many people, particularly with the flexibility of society in terms of globalisation, information technology and so on. They responded in all those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> In a changing society, the vocational education committees were the first in any area of education to go to the community and the marketplace to see what was appropriate and to devise courses to meet particular needs. They did that, with minimal resources, through the work of the teachers in the various subjects. By and large, they were the people who developed those courses with some assistance from the curriculum development unit, an admirable body with links to Trinity College. There is no doubt that in any assessment of education, vocational education committees must be treated with respect and given kudos for the enormous amount of good work they achieved. For that reason I am very reluctant to see them being done away with as a structure. They have received much criticism from some quarters in terms of their constitution and the overall nature of education.</P>
    <P>An idea I had in the past was that all second level education should be united under a single umbrella, and for that purpose vocational education committees and religious orders should no longer have their areas of responsibility and control. I would like to see the second level education system more united than at present. I am not sure the plethora of educational establishments, with their different structures, boards, committees, etc., is the best structure. It is very much a stand alone system, and I am not sure that is what we require.</P>
    <P>A number of things are missing from the Bill. There is no examination of the broader structure of vocational education committees. We are largely concentrating on the committee structure and the service and education plans, accountability, etc. However, it does not look at the role of vocational education committees in education and whether we can deliver a service under the current structures. We have many stories and reports about the levels of literacy and numeracy and the level of drop out from the education system at all three levels. We do not have a coherent education system. The Minister may say it is not the function of the Bill to provide that, but the Minister for Education in the last Government, Niamh Bhreathnach, attempted to put in place regional authorities. That was probably trying to do too much too quickly in the area of education, and it fell by the wayside. However, the idea and principle are totally valid.</P>
    <P>We need some devolved, localised cluster system of education which is able to interact between the different providers at local level. The Department of Education and Science needs sufficient flexibility so it can have people on the ground who can respond to educational and other needs at local level. No Department is so bad at linking up with local communities. The Department of Education and Science should be best in this regard as education begins at such an early stage and is a life long experience. Yet there is no structure or personnel allocated for community based activities. I cannot point to anybody in my community and say there is the local education <Col N="823" /> officer. There is nobody to co-ordinate an area in terms of primary schools, secondary schools and other areas of education, which is a lack in the system. There are too many stand alone schools with no linkage. That problem is not addressed in this Bill or in the previous education legislation and it remains the biggest defect facing our education system.</P>
    <P>Our education system is excellent and runs on automatic pilot for 80% of our students, but it has no resources in place to deal with the 20% of students who need support. That is where we fall down as that issue is not addressed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that while the Bill goes into considerable detail about the constitution of the committee, there is no detail whatever whether there will be committees or boards of management in the schools. Somebody has taken their eye off the ball in this respect. How can we possibly provide for structures for the committee, including accountability, the education plan and the level of interaction between parents, students, committee members, the chief executive officer, etc., when there is only one mention of a board of management? There are references to sub-committees, but they seem to have totally different roles from those of existing sub-committees. What will happen to existing sub-committees under the Bill? Will they go out of existence? Will there be a board of management which will have the same responsibilities as boards of management in secondary schools in terms of hiring staff, discipline, expulsion, etc.? Will there still be a totally centralised system where everything takes place in the head office of the VEC and nothing takes place at school level?</P>
    <P>Where is the section dealing with the local school board? Will there be a further Bill to introduce it? Who will be on the board and from where will the membership be drawn? Will it be a board or a committee? How in God's name can we have legislation which does not provide for the structure of the school board or the education centre? If memory serves correctly, we were told under the previous education legislation that we could not touch the VEC school structure as it would be dealt with in the pending Bill. What has happened? How are we going to put together a VEC system which leaves out one of the major key elements which allows it run at local level? I have checked through the Bill and such provision is not included. Section 9 deals with boards of management, the only reference to them in the Bill. Section 31 refers to sub-committees, but those envisaged are not those which exist but relate to sub-committees on finance, curriculum, etc., with totally different functions. This is a very serious if not a fatal flaw in the Bill and I do not know what the Minister intends doing about it.</P>
    <P>There are many problems to be addressed. For example, how will we address the complex problem of discipline in schools? It is one of the key issues being raised by teachers, parents and students and there is not a mention of it in the <Col N="824" /> Bill. Will a structure be put in place to deal with it? Will it be done at local school level or VEC level? These matters must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done since we last dealt with education legislation, and I suppose central to that has been the Cromien report which found the Department of Education and Science, like most Departments, has a high level of bureaucracy and a low level of decentralised and local action and responsibility. These are the key areas which must be addressed. No scheme in the education system addressed them more than the VEC structure. This Bill falls short in this respect. I do not see how the upgrading of the system as proposed in this Bill will do much to improve retention rates in the educational system, ensure that decisions that should be taken at local level can be taken at local level, or make provision for an inter-agency activity, which is the norm in every problem area throughout society, whether it involves local partnerships, the local drugs task force or whatever.</P>
    <P>All the agencies should be expected to pull their weight and play their part, but this Bill has not progressed the vocational sector along the path of the principles that were inherent in the old 1930 legislation. That is why I am disappointed with the Bill. It does not give the boost to legislation that would enable us to deal with the problems we are experiencing in the more disadvantaged areas in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the vocational education sector and to raise a few issues. This debate is timely. It is important to recognise the contribution of the vocational education sector to the development of the State. At a time when there was no free post-primary education, when students were segregated at the end of their primary education and many had to remain in the primary education sector until their mid-teens and even later because they could not afford post-primary education, the vocational education sector stepped into the breach and did an extraordinary job against all the odds on behalf of generations, particularly the very neglected generation of Irish young people of the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
      <P>At that time also the vocational sector, the technical schools as they were then called, often received the pupils who were least academically progressed. Despite that and many other disadvantages they managed to establish themselves and make a vital contribution which has progressed through to third level with the development of the same philosophy in the institutes of technology and various other aspects of third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Minister not take the opportunity to get rid of the title &ldquo;vocational education&rdquo;? I do not know what it means. I am not sure that I could set about defining education, but I do not know what vocational education means. I do not know what signal it is meant to give out. This is a post-primary or second level education sector <Col N="825" /> and it would be better to call it that. Senator Costello's point that there is no reason there should be various sectors within a sector is an important one. This was an opportunity to grasp the nettle and simply refer to the sector as post-primary education or second level education. I am tempted to table an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill to examine that possibility. While there is nothing wrong with the Title there is nothing right with it, I believe it is being used to in some way segregate this aspect of post-primary education, and that should not be done.</P>
    <P>On a minor related point, I am intrigued by the Minister's statement that a report published in 1927 led in 1930 to the first Vocational Education Act and that our vocational education sector could, therefore, be counted among the longest standing sectors in the State, predating even the Constitution and, by extension, this House. Primary education was established in the late 1830s or 1840s. My union has organised in the primary sector since 1868 and we set up the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland in 1913 or 1914 when we paid its rent. I am aware of post-primary legislation dealing with secondary education prior to the foundation of the State, not that that is important, it takes nothing from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to deal seriously with the issue of regionalisation which was referred to by Senator Costello. The whole system has lost in the philosophical debate between various political parties on regionalisation. Fianna Fáil came to power absolutely opposed to regionalisation and the best argument it had for its opposition was that it was being proposed by the other parties. We should examine the issue in a much more practical way. As somebody who has a disinterested view on it, I said at the time of the introduction of that Act by the former Minister for Education, Niamh Breathneach, and again at the time the Education Act was introduced later by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, that it is not really a question of regionalisation or centralisation, it is a question of the need for local distribution of the resources in education. There was a very strong argument that the structure envisaged in the Labour Party Bill of some years ago on education and regionalisation was far too bureaucratic. On the other hand, it is wrong to say that it can be dealt with totally centrally. This Bill indicates that the delivery of a service at local level is the best way to deal with the sector.</P>
    <P>Let me give a few indications of what the Minister might take from this Bill, why he might look to the broader development of education in the other sectors. What was most wrong with Niamh Breathnach's Bill was that it did not include third level or vocational education, not for educational reasons but for political reasons. If there was to be regional distribution or co-ordination of education, it should have applied to all three levels, and to adult education and pre-school or early childhood education. However, the political clout of the universities kept them out of it. Not only <Col N="826" /> did it keep them out of it but when they got a Bill of their own the political clout of one of them, Trinity College Dublin, kept it out of that and it got a Bill of its own. The political clout of the vocational education committees kept them out of that sector because they were run by politicians, as many speakers said today. Everybody was guarding their own empire. I am not sure that education got a great hearing in all of that. That is a point we might keep in mind. The INTO is the only group in the educational sector which supported the idea of and indeed proposed that there should be public representation at local level in primary education. We proposed that on a number of occasions, particularly to the New Ireland Forum. That was the main place in 1984 to put something publicly on the record. It is good that there should be political representation in the delivery of education. That is not my issue here &ndash; decisions should be taken for educational rather than political reasons.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example from the primary sector where there is no form of regionalisation and we are facing a big change in the delivery of the service. Until a number of years ago, at primary level and at secondary school level &ndash; that is, secondary schools as opposed to vocational schools &ndash; there was a very simple delivery of the service. The school was paid for teachers and that was more or less it. The vocational sector had a much better arrangement with all sorts of back-up services, to which I will return in a moment. We are facing into a series of problems at primary level which could be dealt with by addressing it in the same way as the vocational education committees did because nowadays, with the delivery of education to a whole variety of small primary schools dotted around every parish and half parish throughout the country, we need to be able to look after the needs at local level.</P>
    <P>If one wants remediation in a two teacher school, one cannot appoint a remedial teacher. One has to have a shared service. In the delivery of caretaking, educational psychologists, secretarial services, cover for absent teachers and a substitution and supply service to small or even middle sized schools, it would best be done through some local administrative structure, not necessarily a huge structure. We could deliver at primary level a very good service based on the model of the vocational education committees. That is why the VEC has been so successful. We, in the secondary and primary school sectors, have looked across the wall at our vocational colleagues for 30 years, at well heated and decorated schools and at schools with good caretaking, secretarial and back-up services, which very often were not there in primary and secondary schools. We can learn that much from it. The real answer here is to look at the post primary sector and to deal with it as a sector.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see some sort of administrative arrangement which would look at all the educational needs of an area. Previously, I proposed that there should be one administrative structure <Col N="827" /> for the delivery of education in Gaeltacht areas and that it would be done at pre-school, first, second and third levels. That would be hugely important.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the Bill &ndash; not about anything that is in it, but about what is not in it. We should look at this issue in a much wider context and we should force the politicians and others to take note of the educational needs in an area and to focus and build a structure on that basis. I welcome the Bill and will consider tabling an amendment to the Long Title on Committee Stage to change the word &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; to &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; or &ldquo;post primary&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their very stimulating contributions. We will have a robust debate on Committee Stage in view of the points raised.</P>
      <P>A number of references were made by Senators on both sides to the Cromien report. On foot of that report, several important developments are under way to change the nature of the Department. These changes include the establishment of a special education council, an examinations agency and a regional structure to provide information and other services to local communities. I welcome the implementation of these recommendations which will address a number of weaknesses in the current education system and provide an enhanced service to schools, students and their parents. They are only some of the changes that are under way.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke mentioned staff and industrial relations issues. Existing protections for teaching staff are set out in the Vocational Education Act, 1944. This is set out again in section 15 of the Bill. In addition, the Bill now places a clear duty on the chief executive officer of each VEC to manage all issues relating to the staff of the VEC. This will ensure that adequate appeal functions must be in place for all staff. The Bill does not prescribe specific procedures. These procedures will be developed by the chief executive officer in consultation with staff and their representative bodies. In the broader area of industrial relations, all staff unions and associations will continue to have access to the conciliation and arbitration scheme run by my Department as well as the service offered by the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in respect of industrial relations disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ormonde inquired about the timetable for the introduction of the legislation and about how the education plan might be aligned with the vocational education committees' present terms of office. It is intended that in the future the term of office of vocational education committees will be the same as those of local authorities. The education plan will also cover the same period. In regard to the commencement of the Bill, as the Senator will be aware, the legislation proposes some major changes to the vocational education <Col N="828" /> committees and to the relationship between vocational education committees and the Department. In this context, it is the Minister's intention that his Department will work with vocational education committees to make the preparations to allow for the commencement of this Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde also raised the question of the appointment of staff. I share her concern that this should not be subject to inappropriate political influence. This Bill changes the previous position. It provides that, henceforth, it will be the responsibility of the chief executive officer to manage all personnel issues, including the appointment of staff. This function is classified as an executive function. This change will provide a protection to all current and future staff that appointment procedures will be established and operated in a fair and impartial manner &ndash; it will guarantee that.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Quinn's point in regard to the size of some vocational education committees as opposed to others. The link with a county structure means that some vocational education committees are inevitably smaller than others. However, as the Senator pointed out, this Bill creates a new and stronger structure for VEC co-operation covering all aspects of their operation, even up to the purchase of property. This is a desirable approach. It ensures vocational education committees will continue to have close links with their communities &ndash; links that are long established and deeply valued. It also allows vocational education committees to co-operate to carry out their functions in the most effective manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised the question of the involvement of local authorities in the VEC sector. Local authorities have been an integral part of the VEC sector since its establishment. Their involvement has been a critical success factor in the wider success of vocational education committees, bringing a genuine democratic input into the work of vocational education committees. As such, I consider it appropriate that this position be maintained. However, I should also point out that this Bill provides for the first time a guaranteed right of representation for parents and staff bringing the partners in education to the very centre of VEC decision making. I note what Senator Costello said but in my view &ndash; I have heard members of his party echo this view &ndash; it is wrong that all politicians be tainted because of the actions of a minority. However, one will not counter that incorrect perception of politics and politicians by feeding the cynicism and by more or less saying in legislation that we are all a bunch of gangsters who cannot be trusted to do anything.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Senator Costello said about the boards of management, the structure for the establishment of boards of management in first and second level schools is set out in section 14 of the Education Act, 1998. That section provides that each school will have a board, the compo<Col N="829" /> sition of which will be agreed by the patrons of schools, teacher representatives, national associations of parents and the Minister for Education and Science. Agreement has already been reached at primary level to establish such boards. I understand work is already under way in respect of community and comprehensive schools. I look forward to the establishment of boards in all first and second level schools. The structure set out in the Education Act, 1998, is designed to provide for such an outcome with the agreement of all the affected parties.</P>
    <P>Again I thank Senators who have contributed and look forward to an interesting debate on Committee Stage. It is important that in a changing world, our institutions should also change, reflecting new emphases and ways of doing traditional tasks. This legislation seeks to provide that change for the VEC sector. I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce, as a matter of urgency, legislation banning the use of genetic information by insurance companies or employers particularly in view of the fact that the Government has signed the European Committees (Legal Protection of Bio-Technological Inventions) Regulations, 2000; and in view of the importance of the bio-technology industry in Ireland to outline the Government's policy on the patenting of genes.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, to the House as he witnessed some of my anger about this topic when he addressed a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business yesterday. I am very impressed at the size of the team which accompanies him as it must indicate this matter is being taken very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was extremely pleased to be sent last week by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to a meeting in Brussels of the temporary committee on human genetics established by the European Parliament. However, I was rather depressed to discover that round table discussions in this area have been ongoing for almost six months although we have had little input into them. Senator Avril Doyle attended part of the meeting although she was also obliged to attend another committee meeting <Col N="830" /> on the issue of water. Many of the meetings held within the European Parliament are not simply for the benefit of MEPs; members of national parliaments are also encouraged to attend these meetings.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister who was recently obliged to travel to Madrid where Ireland became the 51st country to sign up to a very important trademark directive to which other EU countries signed up years ago. We must take EU directives more seriously in this country at the time of their introduction rather than moaning and groaning about their provisions at a later date. It is a great pity that we do not enthusiastically engage in debate on EU directives. If sufficient staff are not currently available in various Departments to deal with these directives and to facilitate people travelling to Europe, additional staff must be appointed. The civil servants present will be delighted to hear that I cannot wait for the introduction of benchmarking which will confer a real sense of importance and value on some Civil Service and public service positions.</P>
    <P>The temporary committee on human genetics was established as a result of the perception that directives on bio-ethics are becoming outdated at a rapid rate. The committee members asked whether a public debate had occurred in Ireland on this topic to which I was obliged to answer in the negative. Would we find ourselves in our current predicament about genetically modified organisms in plants if the matter had been properly debated when it first came to light?</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the manner in which the insurance industry may use genetic testing. A 1995 paper published in America, the land of the free market, states:</P>
    <P>To the extent that insurance is a business, insurance companies will be duty bound to use genetic screening to exclude affected families from the insurance pool but, in so far as insurance is a communal, moral enterprise, the exclusion of the ill from the insurance pool is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>All of us are used to being asked various questions about illness in our family and so forth when we take out insurance and we are able to reply to them, but when we are asked about genetic testing, it is a different matter. The fact that a person's mother or father died of heart disease may not mean that a person has a genetic predisposition to it. It may mean that person's parents smoked, drank, stayed up all night and did not go to bed early like that person does. The implications of having to ask someone for a test might mean that the person concerned will not take it if he or she has a genetic disposition to cardiac disease. Because that person does not want an insurance company to know that is definitely what happened to his or her parents, that person may not make the lifestyle changes which could affect his or her life in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> We have a large number of diseases with a genetic base because we were pushed to the edge of Europe and until recently there was not much immigration. We all come from very much the same genetic pool. There is a problem in that there is a basic consanguinity among a very large number of us.</P>
    <P>The insurance business is entitled to have a basic level of knowledge about us, but for it to provide a basic level of cover, it is not entitled to look for our genetic make-up. There must be solidarity between those whose genes may not be as glamorous as others. We need rapidly to develop a debate on this subject.</P>
    <P>The Government is one of the only governments in Europe that does not have legislation regarding the use of genetic tests and the insurance industry. Even the United States introduced legislation on genetics and the ethics of genetic counselling and I have the debate on that US Senate Bill. The United Kingdom does not have legislation banning genetic testing. It has had a voluntary code on genetic testing in place for some years, but that has not proved to be satisfactory. This is important to us because the parent companies of most of our insurance companies are United Kingdom companies. We should introduce our own legislation on this area immediately. The British will introduce legislation, but that will only affect the companies in Britain.</P>
    <P>If people take out expensive insurance to insure themselves for £1 million or £2 million rather than, say, a life assurance policy one must take out to buy a house, the position must be fair to the insured and the insurer and we can consider that in a different manner.</P>
    <P>We must remember that genetics is in its infancy. We do not even have standards regarding laboratories that might be set up to carry out genetic testing. This reminds me very much of a Bill I tried to bring in setting up a register of institutes that were giving <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation advice or therapy. We do not even have that. That was a Bill I introduced four years ago, an area on which we were told legislation was to was to be enacted shortly. &ldquo;Shortly&rdquo; can mean four years.</P>
    <P>Home kits are being produced which people can use to do gene testing on themselves. I could not vouch for the accuracy of them. If people feel they will be driven to do this regarding genetic testing, one can imagine the great worry that could be caused and the many mistakes that could be made. Insurance staff may also have a great deal of trouble interpreting the test results they are given. This is particularly important in America where sickle-cell anaemia is quite common. Sickle-cell anaemia only develops if one inherits the gene from one's father and mother. Insurance company staff were loading people who had only a sickle-cell trait. In other words, they only had one parent with the trait, and not necessarily the disease. There is also not widespread availability <Col N="832" /> of testing here. It would be a grave imposition to allow this to progress.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that genetic information is not totally about one person alone. If it is discovered that a person has one gene that is considered unacceptable to an insurance provider, it may also ask about the person's parents, siblings and children. That data could be used to spread loading on other members of the person's family.</P>
    <P>The situation in the United Kingdom got unpleasant at a certain stage where, for example, people were asked to have tests for hereditary kidney disease, breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Is it right to ask people to have a test for something for which there is no known cure, for example, Alzheimer's disease or Huntingdon's disease, both of which result in the early deterioration mentally and physically of the person and for which there is no known cure? Should one be obliged at the age of 30 to take such a test? People should have the right not to know such information as well as the right to know. Our genetic counselling services are also very shaky. There are many ethical issues to be examined in this area. It is far too sensitive to be let into the hands of a commercial concern such as an insurance company.</P>
    <P>The progress made in research on the human gene has been fantastic and much more rapid than we expected, thanks in the main to the collaboration of various laboratories on an international scale who disclosed the information as soon as they had it, but if that had been kept to one private laboratory, one does not know whether that information might have been disclosed. A situation could develop where persons would agree to be tested for one disease and a gene chip could be produced, which would allow a person to seek information on a sequence of DNA, and another faulty gene could be discovered that the person did not want to know about or did not agree to let information be known about. That is also a major ethical issue.</P>
    <P>All this is of major importance in setting ourselves up properly in the genetic area and the area of genetic patenting. The Environmental Protection Agency looks after everything regarding patenting within laboratories to make sure that is all right. We have not made any effort to set up a central commission or council on genetic patenting, not only human but all genetic patenting. It is important to remember that while the last century might have been the century of physics, the one before that the century of chemistry, without a shadow of a doubt this will the century of biology and bio-technology </P>
    <P>I commend the intergovernmental report on modern biotechnology which is superbly written. A great deal of trouble was gone to in the writing of it. It points out the consequences of public hostility to bio-technology. It is most important we try to do something about that. It also refers to the medicinal products of genetically modified medicines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> We have a large pharmaceutical industry, which is very lucrative. Forfás is working on various projects and BioResearch Ireland is helping to translate the university ideas and projects into commercial companies. Elan, Intergen, Genzyme, Schering Plough, Eli Lilly and many others are operating on a smaller scale. All of them are heavily involved in innovations which have been brought forward due to the discovery of different genes and their properties.</P>
    <P>A major debate is taking place within the World Trade Organisation regarding whether a gene is a discovery or an invention. One has to come down on the side that the properties of the gene are the invention because the gene is common to our ancestral heritage. We should try to get more involved in that debate at a local level. I have heard very little about it.</P>
    <P>The money being put into research here is staggering compared to what it was a few years ago but it it important to remember that the money put into research in Europe by various governments and corporations is only about one-third of the amount of money put into it in the United States. It is suggested that their patent law means they have been able to forge ahead but those involved in the research do not subscribe to that view. They believe what is more important is the fact that more money is being put into it.</P>
    <P>Part of the meeting dealt with trying to encourage European Union companies to invest more money in current research in genetics. If novel patents are found for various diseases, it is the various governments who will have to buy back those novel drugs so if they were involved with a good share in the beginning, it might be financially worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I asked about the Government's policy on genetic engineering because I could find little documentation on genetics apart from the Fianna Fáil position paper on the genetic engineering of food which was published in 1997. However, I am sure that Fianna Fáil, being a modern political party, has substantially updated its position since then. I look forward to hearing the Government's policy on patenting. I considered using the word &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; but then thought I might be going a bit far, so I used the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;. I am sure the Minister will enlighten me this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support this motion. It is exactly what Private Members' Business in the Seanad is geared for, to debate topics such as this that are not sufficiently debated. I was impressed by Senator Henry's reference to the age of biotechnology. I am familiar with genetics only in the area of genetically modified foods and genetically modified organisms. The lack of information on the subject is striking. I found the report Senator Henry referred to fascinating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been too much emotion and too little scientific expertise in debate on this subject. Even with regard to the scientific expertise, we are not sure if the scientists are in the pockets of somebody or other, given than so many of them are <Col N="834" /> either working for people who are in the business or they have a background of opposing developments in the area. Therefore, I find a debate such as this fascinating.</P>
    <P>In general, I am a champion of competition in business but the insurance industry is one in which unbridled competition can do more harm than good and can sometimes work against the public interest. This topic is, therefore, of particular interest. If there are no restrictions on how insurance companies compete, they will inevitably seek to maximise their profits by excluding bad risks from cover and concentrate their business only on low risk customers. To be truthful, I support that approach up to a point. It makes sense. However, it might be useful to define what that point is because we might arrive at a useful principle as a result. Hopefully, the result of this debate will be that we arrive at some principles in this area.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies should have the freedom to refuse risks if the risk is due to an action taken by the customer or arises from a choice made by the customer. Take as an example a person who is such a bad driver that he or she is repeatedly involved in accidents. It is right that such a driver should have to pay more for insurance or even be refused insurance so that those who behave themselves on the roads will get the benefit of a lower rate. While insurance is a way of spreading risk among the community of the insured, it is not a licence to behave as one wishes and have other people pick up the bill for the consequences.</P>
    <P>If a person makes a lifestyle decision which makes him or her a better risk from the point of view of insurance, there is nothing wrong with an insurance company targeting that type of person as a customer or giving them financial incentives or benefits to put their business with its company rather than with another. I have in mind somebody who decides not to drink alcohol or to smoke. They could be considered a better insurance risk. It is a decision made by the individual; a lifestyle decision that is within the power of the person to make.</P>
    <P>Where we need to draw the line is in allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people for reasons that are outside the control of the customer. This is the argument against allowing insurance companies to use genetic testing in either deciding whether to accept a customer or what they will charge a customer on the basis of their genetic history. One could say that if somebody has a pre-existing medical condition when they apply for insurance, they have no control over it but it is accepted practice for insurance companies to take it into account. That is understandable because if there was no such escape, nobody would apply for insurance until they became ill. There would be no such thing as insurance. One would wait until one was ill to take out insurance because the insurance companies would not be allowed to take it into account. That would be an impossible situation. <Col N="835" /> One could not run an insurance scheme on that basis.</P>
    <P>However, the future is the point of insurance and the essential quality of the future is that it is unknowable. This is crucial to the question Senator Henry poses this evening. A genetic test cannot forecast with certainty what will happen. All it can do is show that there is a higher likelihood of a particular disease occurring in a person and we are not even sure it can say that without contradiction.</P>
    <P>There is a difference of kind and not just of degree between a pre-existing medical condition and the finding of a genetic test. When Senator Henry outlined the motion to me a few days ago I gave it a great deal of thought. If we accept this as the principle for establishing the cut off point, it might also affect existing practices of insurance companies that, so far, have survived without any criticism. It always seemed unfair, when I sought insurance, that the company asked what ages my father and mother were when they died. That is not something I can control. Is the insurance company blaming me or taking it into account? That is the unscientific precursor, as it were, of the genetic test. It is an attempt to draw a conclusion about what will happen to somebody on the assumption that an early death reflects a condition that can be inherited. I believe asking such questions should be banned as well. The debate should at least take account of whether it is a legitimate way of doing business.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be brief and put my points clearly. Senator Henry gave the House a vast range of information from around the world but this is a specific issue. If we believe that insurance companies are going to survive and that they serve a purpose, they must take account of existing illnesses. However, can they take into account something that is not under the person's control or even within their knowledge and is not based on good science? If so, are we in a position to open the debate and to consider on what principle legislation should be based? I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to continue to monitor closely developments in the field of bio-technology to ensure that the Government reacts appropriately to those developments, having regard to the speed of developments in the area of bio-technology, having regard to the structures at present being put in place for a Bioethics Council under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy, having regard to the insurance industry's Code of Conduct, which imposes a five year moratorium on use of genetic test results by insurers in respect of life assurance policies up to £300,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Henry in initiating this important debate but I take issue with one of her comments. I believe there has been an ongoing debate in this country. In 1998, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government issued a document on genetically modified food. There have been several letters to <i>The Irish Times</i> from a wide variety of sources in the medical and scientific professions. I have them all here and they date back over the past couple of years. The debate may not have been broadened to the extent Senator Henry would wish in that it is not in the public domain in the same way as GM foods, but we are on the cusp of a major debate in this area.</P>
    <P>It is rather interesting to go through the various statistics relating to it. For example, one report states that biotechnology is one of the most rapidly developing technologies of our time, with worldwide annual sales estimated to be in excess of $100 billion this year, and it currently employees 300,000 people in Europe alone. Obviously there is a great deal at stake.</P>
    <P>Another element of it, in the context of the amendment to this motion about the area of the developments in biotechnology, is that, once again, the disadvantaged in the world seem to be at the mercy of the multinationals. For example, in the context of the report to which Senator Henry referred of the ongoing debate in the European Parliament and of the directive relating to gene line therapy and many others, opponents state that the draft directive fails to make restrictions sufficiently explicit. Third World NGOs and Governments are opposed to this directive because of what they refer to as bio-piracy, the appropriation by multinationals of the genetic inheritance and knowledge of developing communities with no return to them. Oxfam says that therapeutic techniques or new plant varieties developed by biotech companies are often based on old wisdom handed down through generations in a developing country. That knowledge is then privatised and sold back to the same community. It is an area in which Ireland would have a particular interest because of our strong credibility due to Ireland Aid in Third World countries, especially in Africa, where there is already ongoing biotechnological processes being put in place to extract various ingredients out of natural resources in Third World countries for sale on the open market. It seems to me that we could end up in a situation such as that which developed recently in South Africa about the AIDS vaccines, where major multinationals could extract the base ingredient and then sell it back to them at such an exorbitant price that the people who would benefit would be unable to purchase it.</P>
    <P>However, the thrust of Senator Henry's motion is about the insurance industry. The insurance industry is testing the water on this and it should not be allowed to get away with it. I have come to that view having studied much of the available evidence and the various reports of committees sitting to address this matter. What they are look<Col N="837" /> ing for are the rights to future genetic test results rather than current practice in this area. The main reason I suggest is that they are defending the current testing procedures without there being any scientific reliability placed on those tests or, indeed, their relevance to insurance certificate applications. How, for example, can insurance companies justify the inclusion of genetic test results which are unreliable? I would suggest that they would have to publish more data. They must be more publicly accountable. They cannot just insert a line and leave it at that. How does the insurance industry take account in its actuarial calculations of such factors as early diagnosis and treatment for genetic disorders? Can they come out and be a little more publicly accountable about how they determine the actuarial figures regarding insurance premiums?</P>
    <P>In addition, as I am sure Senator Henry would agree, there is a very small number of cases involving genetic test results and, therefore, I would submit, as the UK House of Commons committee on this matter has suggested, that they should be ignored by the insurance industry until such time as their scientific relevance is established. It will not cost them anything. Financially they are not losing anything by it because of the small numbers involved. In fact, I understand that three insurance companies in the UK which practice in this country are ignoring the tests. Their current policy is also to take account of negative tests only in the calculation of premiums which, I believe, is an important consumer protection. I say this because while Senator Henry correctly says that there are those who may not wish to take the test because they would be afraid they would be prevented by it, those who have taken it &ndash; particularly in the case of Huntington's disease which affects over 300 families in this country &ndash; and were found to be negative, have found it to be a plus when they then applied for insurance.</P>
    <P>Concern is being expressed at the rapid developments in biotechnology. There may come a time when there will be screening of employees for genetic defects. This may be just around the corner. The state of Iowa in the US has passed legislation to limit the use of such screening.</P>
    <P>Dr. Michael Clarke, who is a Member of Parliament and chairman of the Science and Technology Committee in the House of Commons, in publishing the report recently stated that the use of these tests by insurance companies raises significant moral and ethical concerns and will have a significant impact upon all those involved in the field of human genetics, patients, researchers, industry and clinicians, and that they question the predictive significance of positive genetic test results and their actuarial relevance at such an early stage in the development of genetic science.</P>
    <P>I also want to acknowledge that a group has been or will be set up to monitor and advise on genetic innovations. This is in response to public concerns over the ethical questions raised by scientific advances. I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, amplifying on the <Col N="838" /> Government's proposal in this regard. I understand that Ireland is one of the last EU member states without a bio-ethics advisory body and I hope this group will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>In Ireland a huge number of issues need to be considered, particularly genetic discrimination in gene patenting. It seems that what is going on in the US &ndash; Senator Henry alluded to this and to the US Senate legislation &ndash; is creating a wake-up call in the EU. The EU is trying to play catch-up on this issue and I hope it will move in that direction. Certainly the committee Senator Henry attended, if it is the same committee, was set up not that long ago in response to concerns in this area.</P>
    <P>The great majority of geneticists worldwide are fundamentally opposed to genetic information being used by insurance companies. This has become an issue because many more genetic tests are being developed and, as I said earlier, the people who suffer from Huntington's disease have great concerns that discrimination is practised against the relatives of people with Huntington's disease and other genetic diseases when they go to buy life assurance.</P>
    <P>Of course I welcome the code of conduct produced by the Insurance Federation of Ireland which came into effect on 1 May. A cursory reading of it would seem to suggest that anybody applying for insurance cover of up to £300,000 would not be subject to these genetic tests. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, however, it seems to me that the insurance industry is effectively just responding to public concern. In fact, it suggested that the UK industry's code of conduct, on which, I would say, the Irish one is based, is out of line with practice in 18 US states and with that in many EU countries. In those jurisdictions legislation has already been introduced to exclude the use of genetic information in obtaining insurance. Furthermore, the UK code was introduced against the advice of an expert UK Government commission on genetic testing.</P>
    <P>The Government has a unique opportunity to affect the long-term quality of life of its citizens by enacting suitable legislation. In fact, my research indicates that all those who are watching and monitoring the developments in this area wish the Government to take action rather than allow a voluntary code of conduct operate among the insurance companies. There are much wider issues with which the amendment deals in the context of the developments of biotechnology, and I hope the Minister of State might address some of them. As Senator Quinn stated, it is not so much genetic testing in the insurance industry which is exercising the minds of the populus but the GM area and the area of consumer foods and of the food chain in general. They need to be reassured and any other fears in that area need to be allayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a few points generally about the vast difference between life insurance and business insurance. It is worrying <Col N="839" /> to hear what Senator Henry said. There is a vast difference between life and business insurance. Senator Quinn referred to the way in which insurance companies can treat people. Some time ago I was involved in expanding my business. It is a tidy little business but is now expanding well. Given the moneys I was drawing from banks, insurance cover was required. I was subjected to numerous tests to ensure I was healthy and suitable for cover. Fortunately, I passed them and my family will do very well if I pass away. Nothing will be owed because the insurance companies will cover it.</P>
      <P>Bad drivers should suffer the consequences of their driving and insurance companies should have the right to make that a condition of cover. However, they should not have the right to impose tests before granting financial cover. Within the past five years I was required to undergo testing for AIDS by the insurance companies on three occasions. It was disturbing but thank God I had no problems. However, I would not like to be told that genetic testing on me indicated I was in the early stages of senile decay. Applicants for insurance should not be subjected to this.</P>
      <P>According to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 May 1998, life assurance becomes difficult and expensive if an applicant is found to be at risk from a genetic illness. Failure to disclose a family history may result in a policy being invalidated and the dependants left in poverty. That is very serious. Does it mean, for example, that if a person failed to tell an insurance company 40 years ago that a parent had a bad heart his cover could be invalidated? If so, that would mean the insurance company would have the benefit of premium income for 40 years but the family would not benefit if the person died in his 41st year. That needs to be looked at.</P>
      <P>I have all my businesses insured through the one broker and last week he told me he no longer considers it worth his while to sell cover to any member of my family because the Central Bank imposes so many controls. Given my standing with him he will deal with my family members for business but what about the ordinary person who seeks cover? If he discloses that his brother is handicapped will his cover cost him an extra £5 per week? If insurance companies can do that it is very serious.</P>
      <P>I understand the need for testing to ensure that applicants are healthy but what is under way here is very extreme. Does it mean that fewer people are taking out insurance and that, say, only those under the age of 40 years will seek insurance? If so, the State will then have to take the responsibility to ensure that those without cover are well looked after. Given the condition of the health services that will not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the way to proceed if the Government wishes to create the incentive for all members of the public to take out personal insurance and pension policies. If the insurance <Col N="840" /> companies are allowed to do this it will cost the taxpayers. I am proud to say I put a lot of money into my pension schemes but others may not be so inclined. For example, there is insufficient promotion of the benefits of AVCs for pension purposes but these will become less attractive if the insurance companies impose tests of the kind outlined by Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>I understand why insurance companies are concerned with the cost of motor cover but life assurance is a different matter. There is a danger that they may not cover the less healthy and less well off. Genetic illnesses are very serious but applicants for cover should not suffer for it. Yet they do in the form of premium loadings. Given the profits made by these companies, this practice must be questioned.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note Senator Mooney's comments that states in the US have disallowed these practices by insurance companies. The Government should impose controls. In this respect the amendment to the motion does not go far enough. Legislation is required. If the Central Bank has control over how insurance brokers may go about their business there is no reason they cannot take control of the activities of the insurance companies in this area, especially given how well they are doing.</P>
    <P>We must not allow people to be worried that because they have a genetic illness their family may inherit it. If so, they may decide not to apply for life cover or, if they do, they may opt not to disclose the information. That may lead to the invalidation of their insurance, which is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies do not impose the same rigorous tests on 30 year old applicants as they do on 50 year olds because they know they will make more money on the 30 year olds. Their premium income is of great benefit to the companies. Another aspect is the necessity to pay premiums through bank accounts because door collectors are no longer used by the insurance companies. This means that financial institutions, such as banks and building societies, also benefit from premium payments. While we should not be afraid of technology we should ensure that those who need cover most get it. I am referring to the basics here, not to the high flyer who wants to enhance his pension with AVCs. It would at least ensure that people could rest easy in the knowledge that there will be enough money to bury them.</P>
    <P>My mother always said she would live as long as her mother, which was 86 years of age, but she only lived as long as her father. Even my mother thought she was doing better than she was and I keep that in mind. Insurance companies take everything into account but ordinary people do not have sufficient protection and we should not be afraid to provide it. The Central Bank controls brokers and perhaps that is the route that should be taken in ensuring insurance companies are controlled.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate and I congratulate my colleague, Senator Henry, for tabling the motion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the amendment because it refers to the industry's code of conduct, which is not a legal requirement. I will refer to this aspect later because an expert in this area, Professor Andrew Green, has warned precisely against that type of development. The view of the experts should be taken on board. As they would say in England, the reference to the five year moratorium is &ldquo;wet&rdquo;. Nothing is being done with regard to this issue.</P>
      <P>The insurance companies must be monitored in relation to this area. A few years ago I raised the issue of a distasteful and intrusive questionnaire that was being used to discriminate against gay people, but it is still going on. I received an e-mail from a constituent recently who was asked to fill up a form which asked questions such as &ldquo;Are you a homosexual male?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are you a member of any of the following HIV high risk groups.?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is your partner a member of any of these high risk groups?&rdquo; The constituent said he took great exception to it. When he inquired about the form, he was told that all single males over the age of 25 years are required to answer such questions. This is discrimination on the basis of sex alone. The constituent continued:</P>
      <P>Although I am gay and in a relationship (naturally I did not declare this) it is assumed that I am high risk. I have been with the same partner for 10 years and have never once &lsquo;strayed'.</P>
      <P>However, he will be loaded by the insurance companies. If this is what they are doing at present, what will they do in light of the advances in genetic science and understanding?</P>
      <P>On 19 October 2000, Dick Ahlstrom had an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about this matter. He pointed out that a British court ruled that insurers may demand the result of genetic tests from clients. Britain is our nearest neighbour and we often pattern ourselves on it. Various genes have been identified in the comparatively recent history of science, such as those for cystic fibrosis, Huntington's chorea, sickle-cell anaemia, retinitus pigmentosa and Tay-Sachs disease. They could be the type of tests insurance companies may require their clients to reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance companies are open about this matter. The article quotes Ms Jennifer Hoban, life assurance manager with the Irish Insurance Fed<Col N="842" /> eration, as saying that &ldquo;As things stand there is nothing preventing us looking for the results of genetic tests.&rdquo; This is from a representative of the insurance industry. The article continued that, during October, the genetics and insurance committee, an advisory committee reporting to the UK Department of Health, gave insurers the legal permission to ask new policy holders whether they had taken a gene test for an invariably fatal degenerative disorder, Huntington's chorea, and to acquire the results of the test. Two years ago, another UK advisory body, the Human Genetics Advisory Commission, recommended a moratorium on the use of information from such tests. However, this view was rejected by the British Government. There is very little protection in Britain.</P>
    <P>Professor Andrew Green is the director of the National Centre for Medical Genetics at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. He is a substantial authority in this area and he was quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>I think the Government should introduce regulations. The insurance companies shouldn't regulate themselves in this matter. I don't think people should be in a position to coerce people into tests.</P>
    <P>This is the view of the country's leading expert in this area, but the amendment proposes exactly what he says should not be done.</P>
    <P>The issue is more complex because there is a certain legislative context in England. As I noted, despite the fact that we are much vaunted as a Republic, we still tend to behave as if we were part of the British Empire. We look to the United Kingdom for legislative models and much of the insurance in Ireland is underwritten by companies that are based in London or Edinburgh. BUPA is a big company, but Ireland is one of its outposts. Its main policy is directed from London. England takes a much more company based approach than other European Union states. Professor Green said: &ldquo;I think that some countries have actually taken practical steps and the UK is out of line.&rdquo; Ireland is not only out of line, but we are once again slavishly following the United Kingdom which is out of line with its European partners.</P>
    <P>There are tests for a variety of diseases, including Huntington's chorea, sickle-cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs, and there is a parallel with the gay issue because Tay-Sachs disease almost exclusively affects members of the Ashkenazi Jewish community while sickle anaemia only affects American negroes. Therefore, specific groups are targeted. From April 1999, in the United States of America, more than 550 different genetic tests were being used to diagnose disease. This has a direct implication in terms of employment. The Americans are great at using statistics, for example, according to a 1998 survey carried out by the American Management Association, approximately 10% of employers &ndash; the number <Col N="843" /> is growing &ndash; routinely test employees for genetic predisposition to disease. People in the civil liberties area have warned that these results may be misused to target and fire employees who may run up company health insurance costs because they appear as a negative indicator on the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>This is not an abstract fear because the Americans have produced surveys in this area. It is an indicator of what the future could hold for people in employment in Ireland. According to a 1996 Georgetown University poll of 332 families with perceived genetic risks, 22% reported that they had been refused health insurance while 13% had been fired from their jobs based on their perceived risks. This information is being used in America at present to dismiss people from employment. About half the states now have laws that either protect against genetic discrimination or prohibit testing in employment or insurance decisions. More Bills are pending in other states, but we are doing exactly what Professor Green said should not be done.</P>
    <P>The amendment states that the insurance industry should be allowed to regulate itself. I remind the House of the trouble we had with the industry before. When Senator Henry and I raised the Insurance Ombudsman's report and the valiant woman involved was put to the pin of her collar to defend the individual against the might of the corporation, it got rid of her. Citizens look to us as legislators to protect their rights.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies operate in the market and they must survive in commercial terms. Products are developed to provide the individual with financial protection against unanticipated loss, illness, early death, which people do not anticipate, and disablement of various kinds. Standard premia are calculated on the expected outcome for large numbers of individuals &ndash; a control group. There is community based insurance rather than cherry-picking. I recall dealing with these aspects when we considered the legislation to liberate the insurance environment.</P>
    <P>The ideal situation is where the companies spread the risks over a large community while still allowing the industry to earn a profit. When insurance policies rely more on risks of only a few individuals or small groups &ndash; this is cherry-picking &ndash; this social function is lost. The ability to identify and exclude high risk individuals can result in the paradoxical situation of insurance being most easily available to those who are least at risk. With regard to health insurance, this problem is accentuated when the cost of insurance is borne primarily by employers and it is particularly so in small businesses whose profits and even survival may be threatened by the serious illness of employees.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry is far more well versed and better able to give an opinion on the problem of <Col N="844" /> scientific definition than I. However, even I can take a brief and I read that even scientists realise there is a grey area in terms of what constitutes a genetic test. Definitions can become important when insurance policies and laws distinguish genetic conditions and genetic tests from other medical conditions and tests. While some conditions, for example the Tay-Sachs syndrome which I have mentioned, have a virtually purely genetic basis, most genetic disorders involve an interaction between a genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Even single gene disorders, for example sickle-cell anaemia and cystic fibrosis, have variable expression, depending in part on such environmental factors as oxygen tension in the former and nutritional factors in the latter. In other words, there is no clear boundary between strict genetic testing and other medical tests.</P>
    <P>In America, where genetic testing is carried out, there is provision for counselling before and after the test. This is paid for by the insurance companies. There is no provision for this in this country although, in human terms, it is very necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. There is a considerable ambiguity in characterising an individual who has been found, for example, to have the allele, which is the symptomatic cluster for Huntington's chorea. Some people argue that he or she only has a predisposition to develop the condition at a later time. Insurers, however, might argue that the condition is present, albeit in latent form, as soon as the individual acquires the abnormal gene. A person could be penalised for having a predisposition rather than the disease. Distinguishing and classifying individuals with different risks is at the heart of commercial insurance, particularly when individual and small group policies are involved. Insurers do not believe that genetic tests which predict illness, death and disability should be excluded from this traditional practice. Differentiation of applicants on the basis of health risk is legal and should be distinguished from discrimination which is illegal if based on race, gender or sexual orientation. Insurance companies have not called for genetic testing but in the light of what I have said, it is only a matter of time before they do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I thank Senator Henry for placing the issue of the agenda of the House. I thank Senators Quinn, Mooney, Cregan and Norris for their contributions. There has been much talk since the Nice treaty referendum about the need for more transparency regarding the many issues being discussed at EU level and this is one of those issues. There have been major advances in this area and I will try to deal with the points raised by Senators. We must address these issues and, if they are being discussed at EU level, we should bring them back home and sift through them in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, is responsible for the area of insurance but our Department is also responsible for issues relating to biotechnology and patents. Senator Mooney raised the international dimension and I will refer to that briefly because I have an interest in that area as Minister of State with responsibility for international trade.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government's counter motion calling on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to continue to monitor closely developments in the field of biotechnology to ensure that the Government reacts appropriately to those developments, having regard to the speed of developments in the area of biotechnology, having regard to the structures at present being put in place for a bio-ethics council under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy and having regard to the insurance industry's code of conduct, which imposes a five year moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurers in respect of life assurance policies up to £300,000.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to us all that the area of genetic testing is one in which developments are taking place at a very rapid rate. There are many broad issues involved, including public health, protection of personal data, insurance solvency and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>I am aware that many people are concerned about genetic test results and how they might impact on the availability to them of life insurance cover in general. I also understand the concerns of insurance companies, particularly in relation to cover provided by them for critical or serious illness and for permanent health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation has recently introduced a code of practice on genetic testing <Col N="846" /> for its members. The code sets out the conduct to be followed by the industry in Ireland regarding the use of genetic tests. It seeks to balance the legitimate interests of insurers and of the totality of policy holders with the concerns of individual consumers.</P>
    <P>The IIF engaged in consultations on the code, prior to its formal introduction, with our Department. The IIF also participated in discussions organised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with representatives of that Department, the Department of Health and Children, the National Centre for Medical Genetics at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland and the Inherited Disorders Organisation. I understand that those consultations were regarded by the IIF as very productive and influenced the content of the code which was subsequently introduced.</P>
    <P>The code is a reasonable attempt by the industry to introduce a large measure of control in an area that is relatively new to everyone. Effectively, there is a moratorium on the use of genetic test results, except in a small number of specified cases. There is no intention that anyone will be required by an insurance company to undergo a genetic test. The most important aspect of the code is that, for life assurance policies, genetic test results will be irrelevant for cover up to £300,000. This limit can be used for life cover in connection with a mortgage or otherwise &ndash; or both &ndash; and should ensure that most people seeking life cover, including cover for mortgage protection, need not disclose the results of genetic tests. I regard this as a very welcome inclusion in the code.</P>
    <P>For cover in excess of £300,000 genetic test results may only be sought in restricted circumstances, that is, companies may only seek the results of tests which have been specifically approved as being reliable and relevant to the underwriting process and even then, only where they have been taken prior to the policy being sought. Results of tests taken after a policy is in place will not be requested by companies.</P>
    <P>Decisions on whether insurance companies should be allowed make use of genetic test results could have a bearing on how the insurance market develops. For example, critical illness cover is relatively new and companies have been very prudent in their approach to this type of product. Companies might be reluctant to continue to offer this product if underwriting is restricted.</P>
    <P>In addition, companies at present tend to look at the market in terms of largely similar segments, each with a different risk factor and with product prices being set according to the risk. If they became unable to assess the risk for segments with reasonable accuracy they might begin to consider the market as a single unit, thereby necessitating the setting of an average premium which each consumer would have to pay. While this average premium would be lower than what would be normally applicable to certain segments of the market, it would be higher for other seg<Col N="847" /> ments and could result in an individual whose risk would normally justify a lower premium deciding not to buy cover. Thus, the best risks would leave the pool, almost certainly resulting in higher premiums for everyone.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possible use of genetic results by employers, the use of all personal data is covered by the provisions of the Data Protection Act and I understand that in the employer/employee relationship, personal data may only be used in so far as it is relevant to the particular employment. A recent EU directive imposes restrictions on the legitimacy of holding sensitive personal data. I assure the House that the views of the Members present will be conveyed to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the biotechnology area. In March 1999, the Government noted the range of concerns raised by genetic modification and established an interdepartmental group &ndash; IDG. The group is chaired at assistant secretary level by my Department and comprises senior officials of five other Departments, as well as representatives from the Food Safety Authority, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, Teagasc, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás. The group has examined a wide range of biotechnology related issues and developments, including particularly those raised by the genetic modification of crops and foods. It issued a report in October of last year.</P>
    <P>The group concluded that public policy should reflect a positive acceptance of the potential benefits of biotechnology, tempered with a precautionary approach to the potential risks. The recommendations contained in the report are intended to ensure that, as far as possible, the benefits of biotechnology are maximised and the risks minimised without compromising on safety for people and the environment. What was needed were provisions in areas such as regulation, research and public communication and consultation that would be responsive and adaptable to changing conditions. A balance needed to be struck between benefits and risks, long and short-term needs and the varying interests of different groups such as producers and consumers. In doing so, it was necessary to take four main considerations into account, an appreciation of the long-term strategic importance of biotechnology, acceptance of the need for a precautionary approach, a commitment to an independent, well resourced regulatory system and acknowledgement of the need for more effective mechanisms of public information, communication and consultation on biotechnology.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a recommendation of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology that the Royal Irish Academy be invited to establish a forum to consider the ethical issues raised by biotechnology in an informed, dispassionate and independent way. Discussions between my Department and the academy on the matter are nearing completion and I hope shortly <Col N="848" /> to be in a position to announce the establishment of a national bio-ethics council. The proposed council will be a broadly-based forum which will include representatives of all the main relevant disciplines. It will have two main, related functions, to identify, consider, interpret and elucidate the ethical questions and issues raised by biological and medical research and to promote public awareness and debate of these issues.</P>
    <P>The council will determine its own work programme, but the interdepartmental group will be entitled to refer issues to it for consideration. Though I do not wish to pre-empt consideration of the council's work programme, the use of genetic data for insurance purposes is certainly an issue which a body with its remit could at some point beneficially examine.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions) Regulations, 2000, have no relevance to the possible use of genetic information by insurance companies or employers. They transpose into Irish law the provisions of an EU directive which was approved by the Council of Ministers and by the European Parliament in July 1998. The directive concerned patent issues only. As Senators will appreciate, patents provide an incentive to innovation. Without the safeguard provided by patents, inventors and industry would be unwilling to invest their time and money in research and development. A fundamental requirement of the patent system is that the invention must be new, must involve an inventive step and must be capable of industrial application.</P>
    <P>A discovery of an element of the human body cannot be patented, while an invention relating to an element of the human body may be considered patentable. Under conventional principles of patent law, only inventions, not discoveries, are patentable. The term &ldquo;invention&rdquo; applies to something that is artificial in the sense that it is a technical solution provided by man to a technical problem; on the other hand, a discovery concerns something natural.</P>
    <P>I will expand on the whole question of patents for the benefit of the House. I will give some examples. It is possible to patent biotechnological inventions concerning biological material, plants or animals in certain circumstances, and a microbiological or other technical process &ndash; an element isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene in an invention. It is not possible to patent biotechnological inventions whose commercial exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality. Examples of such biotechnological inventions are: any process for cloning human beings; any process for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; the use of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; any process for modifying the genetic identity of animals which is likely to cause them suffering without substantial medical benefit to man or animal. It is not possible to patent the <Col N="849" /> human body at the various stages of its formation and development or the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on the patenting of genes is governed by the Patents Act, 1992, and the regulations which I have outlined. A number of important issues in relation to patents, the TRIPs agreement and intellectual property rights in general, have been raised by a range of interested parties in recent times and by Senator Mooney this evening. These include representatives of the developing world and NGOs, and among the issues of concern to them are those relating to international developments in the field of intellectual property rights. As the Minister with specific responsibility for international trade and intellectual property rights, I believe that we must, of course, listen carefully to these concerns and endeavour to address them in the context of our ongoing international discussions and negotiations on these matters.</P>
    <P>In the context of my open agenda on the subject of patenting, intellectual property issues and the developing world, I met a large number of people from the NGO community in preparation for the next round of the world trade talks in Qatar in November. The last talks, which were a shambles, took place in Seattle. On behalf of the Government I made it clear that we want a development round. We want the concerns of the developing world to be a priority. I have initiated a series of communications with NGOs and we had a very extensive discussion today. Intellectual property rights is a key issue for them, and Senator Mooney referred to this. If this is to be a development round, we must take on board their concerns about the TRIPs agreement and how developments in the area of patents will impact on the developing world. There is an excellent article in a recent issue of <i>The Economist</i> which deals with this issue in a balanced way. I will ensure that we communicate closely with our own NGOs. They have tremendous expertise and they liaise closely with their sister organisations in other countries, especially in the EU. We will listen to their concerns in preparation for the next round of WTO talks on the question of intellectual property rights. I will keep the House informed and I hope we can have more of this type of debate.</P>
    <P>The use of genetic tests by insurance companies is governed by the code of practice recently introduced by the industry. I will convey the concerns of Senators to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. A national bioethics council is being established to consider the ethical issues raised by biotechnology. I thank Senators for raising these important issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and I thank Senator Mooney in particular for his most supportive speech. It is no wonder he had to be reminded to move the amendment. I cannot <Col N="850" /> understand why the Government puts down amendments to motions such as mine because we were <i>ad idem</i> about it. I was pleased with the Minister of State's contribution apart from a few points. He was too kind to the insurance companies. The insurance companies make plenty of profits. I tried to bring forward an amendment to the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill the other day to deny genetic testing but I did not succeed. We need to start nipping off these areas because £300,000 sounds a lot of money now but maybe they will maintain the £300,000 figure for a while and it will not seem a large amount of money in the not too distant future. Senator Dino Cregan spoke about the importance of insurance in the field of business.</P>
      <P>The great and the good are certainly in the Royal Irish Academy. It is a tremendous institution but I am a great believer in humbler folks having an input into this area. Society has to have a great input to this debate, not just scientists. That is important. Senator Quinn talked about people who give us their opinions about how safe such and such a product is and that there will never be a problem with it. We never know with whom they are connected. To get money for research in Ireland, a large number of people have to go to the pharmaceutical companies. There are marvellous employers here but we have to keep our wits about us. I am delighted with the Minister of State's comments about the TRIPs agreement. It was so easy for them to give in on something like the provision of anti-AIDS drugs for South Africa, Brazil, etc., because, for Heaven's sake, they will not have the infrastructure to supply the needs of the people. Companies which are making the drugs are the only ones who will make anything out of that.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the amendment was tabled. I presume the Government does not want to amend it. I note the all powerful figure, Senator Fitzgerald, has arrived.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment. I wish the Minister of State good luck in Qatar. They are brave to have a meeting there. I suppose the regime is a little firmer than Gothenburg and there may not be as many troubles. The lack of information on biotechnology has driven them to taking this type of action when we badly need more discussions. I hold the Minister of State to his promise that he will organise the next discussion on this topic long before he goes to Qatar so that we can give him pointers because this House sometimes has useful information and ideas. Given our large biotechnology industry we should take a serious interest in patenting. Of course, I realise that the convention has nothing to do with insurance. I apologise that the semi-colon got in the wrong place.</P>
