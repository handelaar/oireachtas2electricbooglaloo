    <Title>Business of Seanad.</Title>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I have received notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to approve the Midland Health Board's brief regarding the development of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital which was submitted to his Department in October 2000.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to investigate the dumping of a particular substance in a quarry in Montpelier, County Limerick, and the subsequent storage of the said substance at Marrow Meats facility in Dromkeen, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Glynn as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule Senator Jackman's matter out on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I start the Order of Business I refer to a matter that arose yesterday when Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello requested a review regarding a Friday sitting. I am pleased to inform the House that due to the rescheduling of Dáil business late last Thursday evening, the Bill from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that was to be taken in that House is not ready and therefore Committee and Remaining Stages of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, has been scheduled for Tuesday of next week. Senator Manning will recall I indicated to him last week that it was <Col N="74" /> our intention to deal with the Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, next Tuesday but, as this Bill is not finished in the Dáil, that day is now available for the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001. The House will not now be sitting on Friday as was originally intended.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re sub-committee on the mini-CTC signalling project, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re sub-committee on the Abbeylara incident, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989 (Section 57) (TSB Bank) Order, 2001, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 4, Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. Business is to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. No. 19, motion No. 28, is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for agreeing to the request from this side of the House not to take all Stages of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, on Friday. Now there will be a decent interval between Second and Committee Stages. However, I ask the Leader to reconsider his intention to take Remaining Stages on Tuesday because there is a deep-seated objection, from all parts of the House, to taking Report Stage immediately after Committee Stage. It would be acceptable to have a break so that if there are changes that the Minister is agreeable to making, there is an interval for the amendments to be framed. Perhaps we could review that later in the day. We certainly will not impede the passage of this Bill, we want to accommodate it, but as I said yesterday, apart from rushing the Bill over three days, there should be a break between Committee and Report Stages. I thank the Leader for accepting the points made yesterday in the spirit they were put and for agreeing to alter the schedule.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an opportunity, some time after Easter, to discuss the Flynn report on the future of rural post offices. The House should debate this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also relieved that the Leader has moved on the issue raised yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the growing tension between the US and China. It is time for other governments to take positions on this issue. The situation is totally unnecessary and simply needs an honest broker to move in and indicate a way out of the mess. Ireland now has representation on the UN Security Council, where this matter may well arise. Our Government should play a role in trying to ease the tension, which seems to be growing by the day. The situation can have an <Col N="75" /> impact across a wide field, including the World Trade Organisation discussions and other global agreements, as well as creating instability in terms of international peace. I ask that our Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the Security Council, should indicate how the situation might be moved forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in complimenting the Leader on agreeing to take the other Stages of the Waste Management Bill next week, rather than on Friday next, and for agreeing to take No. 3 with debate. However, I am not at all happy with the reasons given by the Leader for withdrawing the business which had been proposed for Friday next. The change was entirely related to the ordering of Dáil business. Senators have always agreed that this House should regulate its own business in its own fashion, its own time and with its own sense of urgency. I do not see why this House should change its schedule solely because there is a hiccup in the Dáil schedule. We should change only if this is the right thing to do and we should not take all Stages of a Bill on the one day.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Manning's request for a debate on the Flynn report on rural post offices. What has been revealed in newspaper reports makes very grim reading, including reference to the closure of 100 sub-post offices, a further 1,500 under threat and predictions of a huge debt by the year 2004. A real opportunity is provided for the post offices to take over where the banking system is closing 20% to 25% of its branches and withdrawing service from local communities. An Post should modernise its services, take over that banking business and ensure that communities have the necessary facilities.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this House. I am concerned by reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday and today, by Seán MacConnell, about smuggling activities. Factual information, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, shows that in November of 1998, 20,000 lambs per week were coming into the country and there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of corruption, right down along the entire line. The Minister should outline to the House what progress is being made in the investigations by the Gárda Síochána into the source of the one outbreak of foot and mouth disease which occurred in this jurisdiction and the resulting threat to our economy and our animal health status from the activities of a small irresponsible element in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I know we had statements yesterday on the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis on tourism, I wish to refer to some disturbing reports this morning, from a number of large companies based in Galway, that suppliers to canteens and similar outlets are increas<Col N="76" /> ing the price of meat products by some 45% to 50%. I do not understand how the present crisis could have such a huge impact on the price of food and food products. I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on Tuesday of next week with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, or other appropriate Minister with responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has just published a Bill dealing with the early release of prisoners. When is that Bill expected to come before this House? We need to have a wide-ranging discussion on justice issues, including some of the prison sentences which are being handed down, such as an eight year sentence in one case where a woman's life was taken. The debate on that Bill would provide an appropriate forum to discuss such issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on the stand-off between the US and Chinese authorities. Ireland could usefully intervene by suggesting an independent international inquiry into the incident. That might let both countries off the hook, in terms of saving face.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or other appropriate Minister, a matter which has been brought to my attention by a constituent. He discovered that the Ancient Order of Hibernians has an Internet web-site which has a link, whether officially or otherwise, to the Irish Government web-site, with side links to Catholic and republican sites. As an Irish citizen, my constituent is concerned that an organisation with a record of highly discriminatory attitudes towards Irish citizens should have an apparently official link to the Government web-site. I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should look into this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House of a letter which I received from Lord Alderdice, the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, offering Members of the Seanad who are resident in Northern Ireland the full courtesy and facilities of the Stormont building. I have accepted that invitation and, as a courtesy to this House, I thought I should inform my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I again ask the Leader to have a debate as soon as possible on the changeover to the euro currency, which will take place 271 days from now. The EU Commission issued a report yesterday, which is quite frightening in overall terms. It showed that one in every three small businesses is unaware of the changeover on 1 January 2002. If the same situation applies in Ireland as in the rest of Europe, we need urgent action to draw attention to it. The changeover board is doing a good job, but much more can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of yesterday's events on world markets, is it possible to have a debate on the econ<Col N="77" /> omy? I know we had the Minister for Finance in this House last week on the Finance Bill. However, there seems to be almost a belief in our immunity from world events in this regard. We need a debate now, to dispel any impression that if we just ignore events in the world economy, we will be immune from any effects. There is almost an air of over-confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the future of post offices. The post office has always been a core feature of society in rural areas and small towns. Local planning and infrastructural development should take account of community requirements in that regard. A co-ordinated effort is required and this House could usefully debate the issue, with a view to putting forward suggestions to change the thinking which is presented in the Flynn report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Post offices are such an essential part of rural life, the rural village scene and, perhaps, even in the suburbs of our towns and cities, that more must be done to ensure their continued viability. Accordingly, I too support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Flynn report.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Leader a question about section 135 of the new Planning and Development Act and he omitted to reply, perhaps inadvertently. I ask the question again. That section of the Act requires councils to implement a code of practice or conduct for its members in the performance of their duties. However, as the Kerry county manager pointed out in his report yesterday, that section of the Act has not yet been brought into operation. Will the Government provide for uniformity, which one would have thought might be best given the size of the country? Will it provide for a free for all, or what will be the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the situation between China and America. It is very serious and is escalating at an alarming rate. While we have very strong ties with America, we have also developed ties with China. The Taoiseach and many Ministers have visited China and there is a very large Chinese community here who are making an important contribution to commercial life. It is important to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>We should also have a debate on North Korea. I am very sorry to note that under the Bush administration, there seems to be a change of policy. Under the Clinton administration, there had been huge strides to open up the border and bring the two parts of Korea together again. We could play an important role in debating these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Quinn said. There is an air of complacency about the economy, which is obvious in the comments and attitudes of many of the politicians in this House and <Col N="78" /> elsewhere. The Exchequer figures issued yesterday were bad. They were below the targets set by the Department of Finance. Markets around the world are falling and the US recession is obviously affecting this economy. We should inject some urgency into this rather than having this sense of complacency. A debate in this House on the economy, not on the Finance Bill, which is completely different, would set the ball rolling. We have had a wonderful ride here. The economy has been booming for seven years, but it would be a great pity if, in the belief that this will continue forever, we did not recognise the danger signals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on post offices. I suggest that it should cover financial services, which would include banking and the euro, on which Senator Quinn requested a debate, as they are all intertwined. There is much complacency about the euro changeover, particularly among small firms, and a debate here would be helpful.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Cox regarding the massive increase in the price of meat products. I have been approached by a number of hotels and restaurants about this matter. They are flabbergasted that, in some cases, the price of meat has doubled in recent weeks. This does not measure up to the supply. I believe that there is a rip-off in this area. The Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs should come in here so that we can debate the matter. There is goodwill towards the farming community and the fact that excessive profits are gained by some people &ndash; not farmers but others &ndash; could reduce that goodwill, and that is not desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from all sides of the House for a debate on the Flynn report about post offices, particularly sub-post offices. As other Members have pointed out, the post office is the heart of many rural communities and their decline is symptomatic of a number of difficulties faced by rural communities. The Minister should, at an early stage, give her response to the report.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before us to respond to issues relating to child care. Over £40 million was allocated to child care provision. My information is that that money is not being spent and there are problems in the system. It appears that allocation is now being reduced in light of the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to respond to a comment I heard that the Electoral Bill has been postponed until after Easter. Will he confirm that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will indulge me for one moment. While coming into the House this morning I learnt with great regret of the death of Butch Moore. The link to this <Col N="79" /> House is that his late father served with great distinction as a head usher for many years until his retirement. Those of you who remember Butch Moore will know that he had the distinction of representing Ireland in its first participation in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965. He brought great distinction, not only to himself but also to Ireland because it was an outstanding achievement at that time. It is important that the House record the passing of somebody whom I found extremely difficult to understand. As one who comes from that generation, it reminds us of our mortality.

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House after Easter to give us an update on the issue of refugees. I am particularly concerned about a number of Nigerian refugees who have been in Limerick for ten months. These are skilled professionals who would love to work and are most upset at not knowing what will happen to them. Given that there is a skills shortage, with a number of people being brought into the Limerick area from abroad, it is shameful that they are sitting there with the appropriate skills uncertain of their future. It is time for us to come to grips with the problem. For a number of months we have heard nothing regarding the refugee issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he has information yet on the timescale under which he proposes to take the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, which will introduce a major change in our legislative practice. Committee Stage of the Labour Party's Registration of Lobbyists Bill has been on the Order Paper for some time. When will this be taken? The Taoiseach is very keen on regulating lobbyists. He has made this clear on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>Following on what Senator Jackman said, today's newspapers report an EU proposal to allow asylum seekers to work after six months. I ask the Leader for a debate on that issue and a statement of the Government's view on the EU position. As a member of the European Affairs Committee, I am aware that many of its members are tired of finding out about the Government's position on EU legislation only after it has been agreed. It would be a good start if this issue was debated before a decision was taken.</P>
      <P>In the light of what my colleagues have said about the apparent dramatic increases in meat prices, I ask the Leader to request the Minister to inform us whether the market support mechanisms that were introduced because of the BSE crisis, particularly the destruction scheme, are still continuing when apparently beef prices are rising dramatically. It seems ridiculous to be running a market support mechanism to sustain a price, which is apparently running away with itself.</P>

      <P>I ask for the agreement of the House that the motion on the TSB conclude after one hour.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Ormonde, Coghlan, Finneran and O'Meara called for a debate on the Flynn report on post offices. I agree with the view that the post offices have an important role to play, particularly in rural Ireland, if the long-term plans of the banks to reduce the number of branches by up to 25% materialise. This will be a great opportunity to invest in the post offices. As a former employee of An Post, I see a major opportunity for post offices. I will allow the longest time possible for this matter to be debated in the House.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the Minister the views expressed by Senators O'Toole and Ó Murchu regarding the US and China and Senator Ó Murchu's views on North Korea. Senator Costello called for the Minister of Justice to come into the House for a debate on the high rate of smuggling that has been divulged in recent days. I will allocate time for this. I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senator O'Meara on the allocation of spending for child care.</P>
      <P>Senators Cox, Finneran and Ryan called for a debate on the increases in prices for meat products in recent days. I will pass on the Senators' views to the Minister. We cannot discuss the matter in the House unless one of the parties puts it down for Private Members' Business next week. I will pass on Senator Norris's views on the Ancient Order of Hibernians to the Minister. I too welcome the news announced by Senator Hayes this morning that Members of the Seanad can make use of the facilities at Stormont for the purposes of carrying out their duties.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the euro changeover and the fact that one in three companies is still not fully aware of what it will entail. I intend to have an all-day debate on the economy, banking, financial matters and the euro changeover. This can be agreed among the party leaders and the Whips, perhaps at our Thursday meeting. I will get back to Senator Coghlan later on in the week concerning the matter he raised. Senator O'Meara raised the matter of the electoral bill. I will make inquiries about it.</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the sentiments expressed by Senator Mooney. I am very sorry to hear of the death of Butch Moore, whom I spoke to only three months ago. He was a great friend and a legend in the business. &ldquo;Walking the Streets in the Rain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Born to be with you&rdquo; were the two big songs at the time. He and the Royal Showband started a business that created 800 groups who were able to make a living from it for many years. I also note that his dad worked here for many years and has passed on to his eternal reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Ryan called for a debate on refugees. Senator Ryan also made a point about asylum seekers. I will pass on the Senator's <Col N="81" /> views to the Minister and the House can debate the matter after Easter. I will make inquiries regarding the timeframe for bringing before the House the two Bills about which Senator Ryan inquired and I will get back to the Senator at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last December the trustees of TSB Bank formally requested the Minister for Finance to authorise the reorganisation of TSB Bank. Following consultation with his advisers, the Minister agreed to their request and published the Trustee <Col N="82" /> Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which amended the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, to provide explicitly for the sale mechanism as proposed. The amending Bill was enacted on 28 March last and in accordance with its provisions the Minister is now seeking the approval of this House for the draft order. Section 57(15) of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, as amended, requires the Minister for Finance to secure a motion of approval for the draft order from both Houses of the Oireachtas before making an order under section 57 authorising the reorganisation of a trustee savings bank.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the detail of the trustees' proposal and the draft order, it is important to explain that, under the 1989 Act, as it stood and following amendment, the Minister's powers allow him to authorise a reorganisation. However, the Minister cannot initiate a reorganisation as that right lies solely with the trustees of TSB Bank.</P>
      <P>The proposal from the trustees, which was made following a fully competitive sale process, involves selling the assets and transferring the liabilities of the bank to the Irish Life and Permanent Group. The employees of TSB Bank are to benefit from an employee share ownership trust that was agreed along the lines of the ESOTs in both Eircom and ICC Bank. The offer from Irish Life and Permanent valued the bank at £339 million.</P>
      <P>The trustees' request and accompanying documentation was examined by Arthur Andersen, the Minister's financial advisers, who advised him that the sale process had been carried out by the trustees and their advisers in an open, transparent and fair manner. Arthur Andersen further advised the Minister that the bid from Irish Life and Permanent plc represented full value for the bank and recommended that the reorganisation should be authorised. The Minister also benefited from the legal advice of Arthur Cox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TSB Bank was created by the amalgamation of Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and TSB Dublin in 1992. TSBs had been severely restricted in their range of activities prior to 1989. They were required to maintain at least 80% of their customers' deposits with the Exchequer and could only lend to personal customers. In response to the changing situation in the financial sector and in order to deal with the fact that the original purpose of TSBs was no longer widely relevant, the Dáil provided in the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, for a broadening of the range of activities of TSBs. The trustees have, with the agreement of the staff, reached the conclusion that the interests of all stakeholders in the bank will be best served by now moving on to the next stage of the process by changing the status of the TSB and merging with the Irish Permanent. This change will give the bank access to the capital markets, a wider product range and a broader set of delivery and distribution channels, which are <Col N="83" /> all necessary if the bank is to continue to grow and prosper. Most significantly, it will provide continuity for staff and customers so that they can benefit from ongoing developments in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>This merger is to be welcomed from a competition viewpoint because it will result in a very strong third force in the Irish retail banking market. The merged institution, which will trade as Permanent TSB, will have a 25% share of the mortgage market, 20% of the car finance market, 20% of life and pensions, 12% of the savings market and 10% of the current account market. Irish Life and Permanent plc informed the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who confirmed that regulatory clearance for the acquisition was not required under merger law.</P>
    <P>In reaching his decision to authorise the reorganisation, the Minister considered the issue of branch restructuring which will clearly follow the merger of the operations of two domestic financial institutions. The policy outlined to the Minister by the trustees was that the merged bank would not close both branches in a single location and that it would continue to serve all the communities served by either branch. On Second Stage in the House, I quoted the following public statement by Mr. David Went, group chief executive of Irish Life and Permanent plc:</P>
    <P>Let me start by stating quite emphatically that, as a group, Irish Life and Permanent is committed to maintaining a strong branch network and Permanent TSB will have that. Our plans envisage a combined branch network of approximately 110 branches. In a simple combination of the existing networks of TSB and Irish Permanent, there is clearly an overlap of as many as 45 branches. To deal with this, Permanent TSB will initiate a comprehensive and objective evaluation of all the branches of the combined entity. This will identify those which, in terms of design, size and location, will be best suited to offering the combined customer base the full breadth of products in the most convenient and comfortable locations possible. And let me add, there will be no town which currently enjoys the services of either Irish Permanent or TSB Bank which will be left without banking services as a result of this exercise. And indeed we'll continue to review opportunities to open new branches.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, was amended because the section, as it stood, was not suitable for the proposed reorganisation. This is hardly surprising as events had moved on in the past decade and new elements were introduced to sales of this type, notably employee share ownership plans.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the 1989 Act provided for the reorganisation of trustee savings banks into either a company controlled by the Minister for Finance <Col N="84" /> or one not controlled by the Minister. The latter option is being adopted for the current process but, under section 57 as it stood, it was not possible to establish an ESOP in the TSB prior to the reorganisation as it does not have any shares. It is also impossible to establish an ESOP following the merger of TSB's operations with Irish Permanent because it is not possible to establish an employee share ownership trust for a particular group of employees within one company. Therefore, it has proved necessary to have an intermediate step. The assets and liabilities are being transferred to Kencarol Limited, a subsidiary of Irish Life and Permanent, at which point the ESOT will be established and then immediately transferred on, with the ESOT in place, to Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>Even using this mechanism required an amendment of the legislation governing ESOPs because the existing legislation did not permit the establishment of an ESOP by a company while it is controlled by another company. This is the situation in Kencarol which will be controlled by Irish Life and Permanent at the time the ESOP is established. Accordingly, section 3 of the Act allows for the establishment of the ESOT in Kencarol Limited while it is controlled by another company. This exception is limited to companies resulting from a reorganisation under section 57 of the 1989 Act.</P>
    <P>The employees are in favour of the transaction. Their employee rights, including conditions of employment, are protected by employee rights legislation, especially the provisions of the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on a Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 (SI 306 of 1980). This means that the employment of all employees of TSB Bank immediately prior to the sale is automatically transferred to the purchaser and that the same terms and conditions as they enjoyed with TSB will apply. This is expressly acknowledged in the business sale agreement between TSB Bank, Irish Life and Permanent plc and Kencarol Limited.</P>
    <P>Pension arrangements fall outside the scope of transfer of undertakings regulations and, therefore, the business sale agreement provides for Irish Life and Permanent to continue the pension schemes in place in TSB prior to the sale. Accordingly, the draft order does not refer to the rights of employees, although reference is made to the employee share ownership trust.</P>
    <P>Under that trust, 5% of the shares in Kencarol Limited will be transferred by the trustees to the ESOT in return for agreement to the flexibility agreement, and the ESOT is purchasing a further 9.9% stake in Kencarol Limited for £19.8 million. On completion of the reorganisation, the ESOT's Kencarol shares will be swapped for shares in Irish Life and Permanent plc worth £50.5 million. As with all other ESOTs, the ESOT must hold the shares for a period of three years before it can allocate shares to employees through an <Col N="85" /> approved profit sharing scheme. The maximum tax efficient allocation by the APSS is £10,000 per annum per employee. Senators should note that while the flexibility agreement envisages redundancies, it is a requirement of the agreement that all redundancies arising from the transaction must be on a voluntary basis only.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the articles of the order, I wish to outline what will happen to the proceeds arising from the transaction. I will not address the issue of giving some of the proceeds to customers because it was dealt with comprehensively when the Bill was before both Houses. On the transfer day, which will happen this month but the date has yet to be confirmed, Irish Life and Permanent will pay the trustees £288.5 million and transfer 14.9% of the shares in Kencarol Limited to the trustees. The trustees will transfer 5% of the shares in Kencarol to the employee share ownership trust in return for the unions' agreement to abide by the terms of the flexibility agreement. The trustees will sell the remaining 9.9% stake in Kencarol Limited for £19.8 million to the ESOT. Following these transactions, the trustees will have £308.3 million.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the business sale agreement, the consideration paid by Irish Life and Permanent can be subject to adjustment depending on the net assets of the bank in the completion accounts. It is the Minister's intention to direct the trustees to pay about 80% of the proceeds, £247 million, into the Exchequer on the transfer day or as soon as possible thereafter. Following the final sign-off of the completion accounts and the payment or receipt of any adjustment to the proceeds, the trustees will discharge any outstanding liabilities arising from the sale process, mainly payments to their advisers, and pay the balance plus any interest arising on the sum to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Regarding the articles of the draft order, the preamble sets out the legislative basis for the order and also stipulates what consultation was carried out in accordance with the legislation. Article 1 is a standard citation article. Article 2 defines certain terms used in the order. Article 3 (1) authorises the reorganisation of TSB Bank into Kencarol Limited. Article 3(2) provides that all assets and liabilities, including deposits, transfer to Kencarol Limited. Article 3(3) permits the trustees to sell shares received by them as consideration to the ESOT. This refers to the 14.9% stake in Kencarol which will be received by the trustees from Irish Life and Permanent as part of the consideration. Article 3(4) provides that the trustees shall make an interim payment to the Minister of such amount as the Minister directs in writing. The Minister will also direct when the balance of the money is to paid. I have already discussed this matter.</P>
    <P>Article 3(5) provides that the trustees shall prepare and submit audited financial statements for the final period of TSB Bank as a trustee savings <Col N="86" /> bank. Article 3(6) requires the trustees to provide audited accounts for the period between the transfer date and the final payment provided for in article 3(4) within 45 days of the payment. Article 3(7) provides that the trustees shall vacate office on a date to be determined by the Minister following the payment of all moneys received by them and the submission of audited financial statements as provided for in article 3(6).</P>
    <P>Article 3(8) permits the use of &ldquo;TSB&rdquo; or &ldquo;TSB Bank&rdquo; by Kencarol Limited, Irish Life and Permanent plc and any of its subsidiaries subject to the Central Bank Acts and the conditions set out in the schedule to the order. Article 3(9) provides for the supervision by the Central Bank of Kencarol Limited following the transfer of TSB Bank to it and prior to its transfer to Irish Life and Permanent plc. The assets and liabilities of TSB Bank will only be vested in Kencarol for a very short period to facilitate the establishment of the employee share ownership plan. Despite the shortness of the period, it is clearly important to have continuity of supervision by the regulator.</P>
    <P>Article 4(1) authorises the reorganisation of Kencarol Limited into Irish Life and Permanent with effect from the completion of the agreement to do so dated 1 February 2001. Article 4(2) provides for the transfer of all assets and liabilities, including accounts from Kencarol Limited, to Irish Life and Permanent plc. Article 5 deals with all the consequential provisions of both transfers. I draw the attention of Senators to the definition of transferee in article 2(1) which defines it as Kencarol Limited in the first instance but &ldquo;on and from completion&rdquo; defines it as the holding company, Irish Life and Permanent. Article 5, therefore, covers the transfer from TSB into Kencarol Limited and the transfer from Kencarol Limited into Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the sub-articles of article 5. They have been included so as to provide legal certainty on matters arising under these transactions, including contracts, agreement, accounts, securities held by the bank, property of the bank, legal proceedings for or against the bank and such other matters as have been considered necessary by the parties to these transactions.</P>
    <P>The schedule to the order stipulates the conditions attaching to the use of TSB or TSB Bank by the Irish Life and Permanent Group as provided for in article 3(8). The 1989 Act prohibits the use of the words &ldquo;trustee savings bank&rdquo; or its derivatives by any body other than a trustee savings bank. Section 57(11) of the 1989 Act, as amended, permits the use of TSB or TSB Bank, subject to conditions stipulated by the Minister after consultation with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Condition 1 allows the use of either in conjunction with one or other words, excluding the words set out in parentheses. This is the course being followed by the purchaser which will trade as Permanent TSB. Condition 2 allows the use of either TSB or TSB Bank on their own, provided it is <Col N="87" /> accompanied by the words &ldquo;a subsidiary of ..&rdquo; in legible characters and in a reasonably prominent position.  Condition 3 limits the right to register TSB or TSB Bank as a trade mark, design or intellectual property to the Irish Life and Permanent Group, and it requires them to obtain the prior consent of the Minister before disposing of or licensing the use of the name to another party. Condition 4 requires Irish Life and Permanent plc to obtain the consent of the Minister before selling a subsidiary which bears and would continue to bear a name including TSB or TSB Bank. This does not apply to Irish Life and Permanent plc which is a publicly traded stock and is therefore subject to the rules of the Takeover Panel.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the trustees of TSB Bank and their predecessors who have done this country and many of its people a great service over the years in providing financial services that were accessible to everyone. I also thank the staff and the management for their commitment and professionalism over the years and wish them and the Irish Life and Permanent Group every success going forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the issues about which the Minister spoke this morning were raised on Second and Committee Stages which took place here recently and I do not intend to revisit them.</P>
      <P>Section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, provided for the reorganisation of trustee savings banks into companies. This section was included because of the widely held view that the trustee savings banks should be formed into companies in order to enable them to adjust to the financial markets. Section 57 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, empowers the Minister for Finance to authorise the reorganisation of the Trustee Savings Bank into a company the composition of whose board of directors would be controlled by the Minister, or into a company the composition of whose board of directors would be controlled by a person other than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Trustee Savings Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2000, the latter option was adopted. Section 57 was restated in that Bill in its entirety but in an amended form because, under section 57 as it currently stands, it was not possible to establish an ESOP in the TSB given that it has no shares. It was also impossible to establish an ESOP following the merger of the TSB and Irish Permanent because it is not possible to establish an ESOP in a particular group of employees within one company. In order to overcome these difficulties, the bank's assets and liabilities were transferred to Kencarol, a subsidiary of Irish Life and Permanent. Kencarol is referred to as the trans<Col N="88" /> feree in the draft before the House. To allow the ESOP to be established and then transferred to Irish Permanent, a holding company had to be established which is referred to as Irish Permanent in the draft.</P>
    <P>The document before the House establishes two requirements &ndash; the reorganisation of the TSB into the transferee and the reorganisation of the transferee into a holding company. In legal terms this accomplishes the aims of the recent Bill. Under section 57 of the 1989 Act it was necessary for the Minister to bring a draft before the Seanad and the Dáil. I am pleased to approve the draft as presented.</P>
    <P>I concur with the final part of the Minister's speech where he pays tribute to the Trustee Savings Bank and its staff. On Committee Stage, Senator Denis Cregan, in his colourful way, paid tribute to the Trustee Savings Bank, especially the one in Cork, when he referred to the fact that it collected the pennies of the people. In our recent discussion on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance said, in dealing with the new savings scheme, that he was anxious to re-establish the culture of saving. The Trustee Savings Bank played a major part in creating that culture in Irish society. I hope that when the new organisation is established it will continue that tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go back over what has already been said. However, there are two issues about which I am concerned. I have reservations about dealing with something of this complexity by way of subsidiary legislation. This is a genuine issue. If this were ever legally challenged, I doubt that the courts would find that dealing with this level of complexity in subsidiary legislation was in accordance with the Constitution. This is extremely complex, and that the Houses of the Oireachtas cannot debate it and amend it section by section is, at the very least, open to question. It is not my intention to be awkward. I would say that about anything as complex as this.</P>
      <P>My other question relates to whether the Minister is aware that the structure of the ESOP is being investigated by the Equality Authority which is satisfied that, <i>prima facie</i>, it discriminates against certain categories of people who are covered by the equality legislation, in particular married women and older people. It is very unsatisfactory that something like this is being processed. It does not matter that the trade unions are in favour of it. They are no more above the law than anybody else. The trade unions may have approved of it, but the Equality Authority is on record &ndash; and I can give the Minister a copy of its letter &ndash; as saying that it feels it is worthy at least of investigation and that there is discrimination in that certain categories of people, against whom discrimination is prohibited, are treated less favourably than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not. However, it would be easier to sort out the problem of the ESOP before this goes through than it will be after. That is common sense. The legalities of it are secondary. That is all I have to say on it, but I invite the Minister to reflect on it. Senators Cregan and Doyle asked who will provide savings facilities for the poor given that the banks are pulling out of poor communities and that the post offices are also in danger of doing so. Only the credit unions are left, and they are under considerable pressure from the banking sector to become like banks, in which case they too will pull out. There is a fundamental issue in terms of the financial services available to poor people, people with small savings, small incomes and, therefore, small transactions. Who will provide for them given that most institutions are competing for the custom of those who, like myself, have plenty of money, and leaving out of their equation the 25-30% of our population who need banking and savings services, who need the security of those services and who soon will not have geographical access to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Doyle and Ryan for agreeing to share time with me. I have a certain amount of doubt about this scheme. I agree with Senator Ryan that it is complex. I have read it, I have listened to the Minister, and I admit I do not understand exactly how it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is along the lines of the ICC and the Eircom employee share option schemes, and the experience of those two companies in having an ESOP of this sort is not a very happy one. It has never been publicly admitted, but it is whispered around the financial institutions that one of the reasons the Government had such incredible difficulty in selling the ICC initially was because of this guaranteed gift of a 14.99% shareholding to employees. It was not all a gift, although some of it was, but the shares were certainly cheap. The problem was that predators and other banks in the market did not like what they saw because they considered the 14.99% ICC employees' holding as a blocking share. They saw a powerful union taking non-commercial decisions which could cause difficulties for them if they took over the company. That is one of the reasons, although not the only one, the ICC had a &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign outside its premises for many years, yet nobody responded. In the end, the Minister did a good deal in selling it to the Bank of Scotland which <Col N="90" /> bit the bullet. Had this particular model of ESOT not been in place, however, that would not have happened; the Minister would have sold the ICC much earlier and would have received more for it.</P>
    <P>In the case of Eircom, a 14.99% shareholding has again been given, or sold at preferential levels, to the workforce but it is doubtful whether the workforce has given anything really tangible in return. We are told that this represents a change in practice but when we ask what the change is, we are expected to accept a lot of blancmange involving rather inexplicit apologies for what virtually amounts to nothing. In order to sell off the TSB, ICC and Eircom, the Government has decided to sacrifice 15% of each company. In other words, it is handing over 15% of what is rightly due to the taxpayer. That may be the price the Government has to pay, but it will not get as much for the company as a result because the 15% just comes off the price the Government receives from the purchaser.</P>
    <P>In the case of Eircom we now have an interesting situation &ndash; although I will not make a judgment on it &ndash; because if the deal with Vodafone goes through there will be a bid for the fixed line business. According to press reports this week, one of the bidders, Mr. Denis O'Brien, is apparently in talks with the ESOT because he has to have its approval in effect, although not in law, in order to take over the fixed line business. This is because to make an offer unconditional one has to have 80% of the shares. The 15% shareholding held by the ESOT does not amount to the extra 20% but it is so close to it that it is inconceivable that Mr. O'Brien could do it without them.</P>
    <P>Is it right that we should base the sales of State assets on this particular model which, after the sale, allows a blocking group of shares to deny the market its natural course? That may or may not be a good thing but it is something we have to consider. We must realise that this will happen because the flotation of Aer Lingus is coming down the line also.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will be difficult to float because of the experiences of some of the other flotations. One of the problems of the Aer Lingus flotation will be this particular model which the Minister is selling to us today. While nobody can blame the workforce or the unions, as sure as night follows day, Aer Lingus staff will receive 14.99% of the shares. Aer Lingus will then go to the market and say, &ldquo;Yes, this is the way we do things in Ireland. We give 14.99% to the workforce.&rdquo; Some of the institutions will freak and will say no. The reality is that anybody who wants to buy the company or a big block of its shares will refuse to do so.</P>
    <P>As long as the Minister is aware of that, that is all right. Personally, however, I think it is too high a price to pay because it is impeding the free market. A special group of companies is being created. Eircom is not like other companies in the <Col N="91" /> telecoms market because 15% of its shares are held by a blocking group which is the workforce. For exactly the same reasons, Aer Lingus, when floated, will not be like other companies of that sort around the world with which it is being compared. ICC has gone now, so that does not apply. If we are always to take this route for short-term gain, we will suffer in the long term because the way the market considers these companies will be totally different from the way it regards other similar companies around the world. It will be the Irish way of doing things. It may be a way of getting the company floated but it will mean that we get less for the company in the end. That is the price the Government has decided to pay because it has decided to give in to union demands on this issue. It is a pity the Government has decided to do so because there are other ways of doing it. The question is one that should be raised but I will leave it there if the Minister is not replying.</P>
    <P>As we have heard in all cases of this sort, the Minister says that in return for this ESOT, the workforce and unions will agree to what he calls a flexibility agreement. I wish to ask the Minister what the reciprocation is, however. I asked this question in the case of Eircom, and will do so in the case of Aer Lingus also. In deals of this sort there should be some material consideration. In the case of ICC some people got £100,000 worth of shares and in the case of Eircom also they received a huge number of shares. In this case they will receive tangible monetary value but I would like to know what is being given by the workforce in return. I suggest that it is very little. This is a bit of camouflage to protect the Government's position and pretend that these work practices, which should have gone out with the Ark, are going to stay there forever. They could not have stayed, however, if a State or semi-State company was to survive. The Government is giving what it had to give anyway, and is getting a large sum of money in every single case.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to give a concrete, material value per employee which can be measured in every case. An arrangement should be made for serious profit sharing. In the case of Eircom, Aer Lingus, ICC, and in this particular case, why can the entire workforce, from top to bottom, not be given share options? That is obviously the most effective way of doing it. It will cost the Government nothing in terms of sale, it will mean that the Government gets more money and that the workforce will have a real stake in the future of the company. The workforce would be given an opportunity to make more money if the company is successful. They would have the potential to make more money, the company would have a greater engine behind it to make more profits, and it would cost the Government nothing. With this model, however, the employees are getting money for nothing, the Government is losing, and the unions have too <Col N="92" /> much blocking power. By championing this model of flotation, the Government has created a company which is not as competitive and not as attractive for anyone to purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion of approval of section 57 of the amended Act of 2000. All we are doing here today is providing the legislative framework for what is the sale of a bank and the arrangement of all the parts of that sale. It is appropriate that this order is in the House today because that is the way legislation should operate.</P>
      <P>The sale of the bank to Irish Life and Permanent was appropriate and opportune because as it stood, the TSB could not lend to anybody except its own customers. It had to invest its money in the Exchequer and it was not really a commercial enterprise that would survive in the commercial markets of the year 2001. It was a proper decision by the Minister for Finance to agree to the sale following the advice of his financial advisers and the knock-on effect is that there will be a windfall of approximately £330 million to the Exchequer. That is an important sum of money because some of the money from similar sales of State assets, including Telecom, was invested in the fund for social welfare and public service pensions. I understand there is approximately £5 billion in that fund currently following legislation passed through this House not long ago. I hope the windfall from this sale will be used wisely to invest in the pensions fund, reduce the national debt or something in that area. The Minister's track record in the management of the country's finances will ensure that this money will be used in the best interests of the citizens.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the employee share ownership trust. That issue was debated on Second and Committee Stages of the Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and in the Finance Bill but it has been explained at all times both by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the debate on the Finance Bill that this arrangement was agreed between the employees and the bank, and it had the full support of the union. It was also explained that for any change in that arrangement to take place, it was not necessary to change the legislation, yet this red herring is introduced on a continuous basis to imply that something has been covered up. We heard it again from Senator Ryan this morning. How many times does the House have to be told that this is a voluntary arrangement entered into by the bank and its employees&mdash;</P>

If he were to do the opposite, I have no doubt that the first people on their feet here would be Senator Ryan and his colleagues to complain that we were not prepared to go along with what the trade unions had agreed with the employees. It appears to be opposition for the sake of it and that it has nothing to do with the reality of what is taking place.</P>
      <P>This is a reorganisation to the transferee and from there to the holding company. That arrangement had to be entered into and it is provided for in legislation and by order today for Permanent TSB to operate and put its house in order. It is nothing more than that and this House should endorse the order. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. We had a lively and interesting debate. When we brought the Bill to the Seanad in recent weeks many important points were made. I hope I have clarified all the matters in some detail for the Members of the House.</P>
      <P>This morning I listened carefully to what the Senators had to say and again emphasis was laid on the fact that people saw the structure of this particular deal as complex. I suppose at first sight it is complex but I have been open and direct in explaining the reason Kencarol Limited had to be used as a vehicle in the first instance to move the TSB Bank into Kencarol before moving on to Irish Life and Permanent plc. While that is complex, the logic and the benefits are clear to the employees, particularly in terms of the ESOT. That is the mechanism we have chosen to ensure that whatever is agreed among the trade unions, the employees and the management structure in the bank, the State would deliver a smooth transition to the company in recognition of all the changes that will be made.</P>
      <P>I would not necessarily agree with everything Senator Ross said. Employees in many of these companies have benefited from these share ownership schemes and they understand that their continued excellent performance is important to ensure that the value of the shares in the company continues to grow and thereby benefit, both individually and collectively, all the employees in the company. There is a direct vested interest here and I would not necessarily agree with what Senator Ross said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been an interesting exercise over the past few weeks and months. It is an interesting time generally with the sale of the TSB, the ICC, the ACC and everything that has been happening in this area. The figures I gave this morning in the context of the structure of the new bank are interesting also. The new bank will be an important third banking force in the country. Permanent TSB will have a 25% share of the mort<Col N="94" /> gage market, a 20% share of the car finance market and 20% of life and pensions. They are serious figures in the marketplace and all of us, both as citizens and customers of various financial institutions, wish the bank well. We all want to see more competition in the marketplace and more and better schemes put before customers to ensure they get best value for their investments or, if they borrow money, that they get the best possible options in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is an important step forward which will singularly benefit people. I wish Irish Permanent plc and TSB well, as I am sure does everybody in the House. This has been a good day's work for all of us involved in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I look forward to the bank's continued growth and success in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal mechanism to bring the current waste management planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion, in accordance with our EU obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This process has actually been under way since 1996 and, while local authorities generally have sought to address their responsibilities in this area, a minority of them throughout much of the country have brought about an impasse. Regional waste management plans have not been adopted by all of the local authorities concerned. As a <Col N="95" /> result, we have not made the progress that we all accept is vitally necessary and long overdue regarding the provision of effective and cost-efficient waste services and infrastructure. All the time, the problems associated with proper waste management continue to grow.</P>
    <P>Action is clearly required to address our current difficulties &ndash; continued debate is not an option, and we have already lost too much time. Accordingly, the Government has decided that immediate legislative measures are necessary to ensure the early completion of the planning process and rapid movement towards the implementation of proposed waste management plans.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward amending legislation, I am also taking the opportunity of providing a statutory basis for a number of other important waste management and anti-litter measures, including the following: a new environmental levy of up to 15 p on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and, potentially, the extension of the levy to other products that are problematic in waste management terms; a levy on the landfill of waste, at an initial rate of not more than £15 per ton; the establishment of an environment fund, through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to financially beneficial environmental initiatives in a range of areas, including waste management, environmental education and awareness; and an increase of the on-the-spot litter fine to £100 and provision for future changes in the level of the fine. I also propose a number of technical amendments to the Waste Management Act, 1996, to bring legal clarity to the licensing, by the Environmental Protection Agency, of certain waste-related activities.</P>
    <P>Strategic waste management planning is the foundation of progress. The failure, until relatively recently, to develop comprehensive strategies for the modernisation of waste management services has left us with an unenviable legacy. We landfill about 90% of our municipal waste, often in small, inadequate landfill facilities. We have a limited recycling infrastructure, almost no biological treatment capability, and no means of recovering energy from waste. Our waste-recycling rate is among the lowest in the EU. This is simply not sustainable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have promoted the concept of a planned integrated approach to waste management, utilising a range of technologies to deliver a more sustainable and effective recycling and recovery performance and significantly reduce our reliance on landfill. My Department and I strongly supported a regional approach to the making and implementation of the necessary waste management plans in our policy document of October 1998. The great majority of local authorities committed to the making of joint or regional plans and considerable financial and human resources, including EU grant assistance, have been allocated to this process, which <Col N="96" /> entailed significant public consultation throughout.</P>
    <P>However, we have encountered ongoing problems and delays in the formal adoption of regional plans. Currently, three out of 15 local authorities in three regional groups have refused to adopt the proposed regional plan that is before them. These authorities are, in effect, obstructing any prospect of progress on the part of the majority and have thrown the overall planning process into disarray. Even in the two regions where all the local authorities concerned decided to adopt their regional plan, some did so subject to potentially significant qualifications.</P>
    <P>The legal advice available to me is extremely clear. A proposed regional waste management plan must be adopted on the same substantive basis by all of the authorities concerned, or none can be considered to have a valid plan. As I stated to this House last week, it would make a mockery of my environmental stewardship to allow the current drift to continue. We have to meet national and EU targets for waste recovery and the diversion of wastes from landfill.</P>
    <P>More immediately, we are seeing pressing waste management problems on the ground &ndash; for example, in Clare and Galway. We must also recognise that the European Commission has taken a case against Ireland to the European Court of Justice because of our ongoing failure to respect our waste planning obligations. A judgment against Ireland seems inevitable and is probably imminent. We have to act now to put a modern and efficient waste management infrastructure and improved waste services in place.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have to act in the overall national interest and take steps that will facilitate the satisfactory completion of this planning process. I have considered the various legal options open to me and have concluded that the existing regulatory powers under the 1996 Act are not in themselves enough to ensure a decisive and satisfactory outcome. Accordingly, the Government has decided that the power to make a waste management plan should be transferred from the elected members of a local authority to the relevant manager, and to make other supporting legislative amendments.</P>
    <P>This move will allow local authority management to conclude the planning process and remove any perceived obstacles to the effective implementation of regional plans. It will clear the way to deliver on all aspects of waste modernisation &ndash; segregated collection services, higher recycling and recovery performance, and a dramatic reduction in disposal to landfill.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of these key proposals was debated in this House last week, and that debate focused on two main issues &ndash; the implications of these proposals for the local decision-making process, and concern regarding thermal treatment, which is an integral part of most of the pro<Col N="97" /> posed regional plans. I want to deal with those two issues.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I do not accept that these proposals undermine local government in any way. I am addressing my responsibilities, as Minister, in the overall local and national interest. A small number of local authorities clearly have difficulty in addressing their planning obligations and I am compelled to respond. The proposed changes will not affect the substance of the waste management plans adopted by the majority of local authorities. I do not consider it democratic that a few authorities can hold up the implementation of important regional plans. Far from eroding local democracy, the proposed Bill will allow the wishes of the majority of local authorities to be implemented. It is telling that, to date, I have heard no practical alternatives being offered to my proposals. Indeed, the thrust of public commentary has been to recognise the inevitability and necessity of these proposals.</P>
    <P>My commitment to a vigorous and more relevant local government system is as strong as ever. I have worked continually to drive forward a major programme of local renewal, which includes my introduction of the Local Government Bill, 2000. My belief in local democracy has not faltered; if anything, the improvements that have been achieved in the local government system since I became Minister have convinced me that we are on the right track. I will not be deterred from this route.</P>
    <P>The second point of contention during last week's debate involved thermal treatment. The proposed regional waste management plans are not just, or even mainly, about thermal treatment; they are concerned with better integrated waste management services for the regions, delivering a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled and using landfill as the last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be treated. Thermal treatment, whether by incineration or other technologies, is envisaged as only one component of an integrated infrastructure, which will facilitate recycling and biological treatment of 40 to 50% of waste.</P>
    <P>Opposition to thermal treatment proposals centres on two issues: perceived risks to public health, and a perceived conflict between incineration and materials recycling. I can only reiterate, for the benefit of those who have an open mind on this matter, that there is an informed consensus that modern municipal waste incinerators, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, do not present a significant risk to the environment or public health. All significant waste facilities are subject to full environmental impact assessment, planning controls and a rigorous environmental licensing system operated by the EPA, which must take the precautionary principle into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The EPA is specifically and legally precluded from licensing a waste facility unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution, that is to say will not, to a significant extent, endanger public health or harm the environment. The EPA, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, considers that municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards and incorporating energy recovery, is preferable to landfill from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>While it is now common to decry the advice of experts, rational decision-making requires that we, as decision-makers, take these expert views into account. However, we must also address the wider public demand for good information and assurance. I accept that there are many people who have real and genuine concerns about perceived health threats from thermal treatment or incineration. These concerns arise, in no small measure, because of misinformation and misrepresentation. We clearly face a challenge in countering negative public perceptions and the need to disseminate reasoned, well-founded information and advice to the general public will be addressed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Incineration and high recycling levels are not mutually exclusive. I accept that they could be, if incineration was prioritised and insufficient effort was put into composting and materials recycling. However, the regional plans clearly do the reverse. They first provide for maximum achievable recycling &ndash; with targets of up to 50% &ndash; and only then do they give consideration to thermal treatment and landfill of the remaining waste. Under these plans, the capacity of the proposed thermal treatment facilities is deliberately limited. The argument that the provision of thermal treatment means incinerators would have to be &ldquo;fed&rdquo;, thereby reducing efforts to recycle, are not valid. We are committed to and must meet specific EU and national recycling targets.</P>
    <P>Throughout the EU, the most environmentally progressive member states combine an impressive recycling performance with a significant reliance on thermal treatment as part of an integrated approach to waste management. Unfortunately, the focus of debate on incineration detracts from the very positive minimisation and recycling elements of the proposed plans. Accordingly, I am asking local authorities, in the regional groups, to prioritise those elements of the plans dealing with public education and awareness, waste minimisation and the delivery of segregated collection services and waste recycling infrastructure, and to prepare a clear programme of action to fast-track the implementation of these aspects of the plans.</P>
    <P>To support these initiatives, I will shortly publish a comprehensive policy statement on waste prevention, recycling and recovery. This will address in detail practical considerations associ<Col N="99" /> ated with the achievement of our policy objectives and targets in this area and will outline specific proposals in relation to waste prevention, market development for recyclables and the provision of greater infrastructural and reprocessing capacity. I will now deal with the substantive provisions of the Bill in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for an amendment of section 22 of the 1996 Act to provide that the making of a waste management plan will become an executive function. Where a local authority manager considers that a waste management plan is invalid because the purported decision of the relevant authority was subject to qualification, the manager shall adopt the said plan. The variation or replacement of a waste management plan will generally remain a reserved function, but a local authority may not, without the consent of the relevant manager, vary or replace a plan within a period of four years its being made. This is to ensure a period of stability during which local authorities can focus on the implementation of plans.</P>
    <P>A local authority will be precluded from making resolutions under sections 3 or 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, or section 179 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, that would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, any provision of a waste management plan or would limit or restrict the proper implementation of such plans. Section 5 provides for a consequential amendment of the definition of waste management plan in section 22(1) of the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for a technical amendment of section 38(5) of the 1996 Act, to remove the perceived legal impediment and allow for the intensification of use of an existing waste facility operated by an urban district council. The 1996 Act empowers only county councils and city corporations to develop waste disposal facilities. However, a unique and problematic situation has arisen in Galway, where the only available landfill is operated by Ballinasloe UDC.</P>
    <P>As this section now stands, the EPA is precluded from granting a waste licence authorising the expansion of this facility to receive waste inputs of the level required in the period to 2005, at which time the landfill will close and be replaced by a new facility within the regional framework. At current intake levels this landfill will reach its authorised capacity next year with no prospect of replacement in that timescale. Accordingly, this provision is a short-term measure to allow the necessary intensification of use of this facility where so provided for in the relevant regional plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 39 of the 1996 Act to allow for a prohibition or limitation of the recovery or disposal of a specified class of waste in specified waste facilities. This is an enabling provision that will facili<Col N="100" /> tate transposition of certain aspects of the EU landfill directive which require certain wastes, such as tyres and liquids, to be prohibited from landfills but may also facilitate measures to support recycling.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the insertion of a new section 72 in the 1996 Act providing for the imposition of an environmental levy of not more than 15p or 19 cents in respect of the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags; the subsequent increase of this amount in accordance with increases in the consumer price index; the possible extension by provisional order of an environmental levy to other products or articles, such order requiring to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas before it has effect and related regulatory powers, including power to require that the net proceeds of the levy be paid into the environment fund.</P>
    <P>Plastic bags are a visible and persistent component of litter pollution in urban, rural and coastal settings. They impact on ecosystems and on habitats and wildlife and they undermine Ireland's clean, green image. It is conservatively estimated that approximately 1.2 billion plastic shopping bags are provided free of charge to consumers at retail outlets annually. This equates to roughly 325 plastic bags per head of population per year, which is excessive and largely unnecessary. The primary purpose of the proposed measure is to directly influence consumer behaviour and to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets. The levy will be imposed as a point of sale levy on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags to customers. It is intended under the proposed regulations that retailers will be required to pass on the full amount of the levy as a charge to customers at the check-out. The responsibility for collecting the charge will rest with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for a consequential technical amendment to section 7 of the 1996 Act in relation to provisional orders made under section 72(12). Section 10 provides for the insertion of a new section, section 73, in the 1996 Act to allow for the imposition of a levy on the landfill of waste at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne or 19 per tonne from 1 January 2002; the subsequent increase of this amount by not more than 5 per tonne annually and related regulatory powers, including powers to require that the proceeds of the levy be paid into the environment fund. The levy will be payable by the person who carries on the waste activity concerned, in most cases local authorities, and regulations made under the section will give local authorities powers to collect the levy from any private operator in whose functional area the waste disposal activity is carried on.</P>
    <P>Historically, the relatively low cost of landfill in Ireland has contributed to an undue reliance on this option and has militated against other <Col N="101" /> more desirable waste recovery options. The intention of a landfill levy is to encourage the diversion of waste away from landfill and generate revenues for the new environment fund that can be applied in support of waste minimisation and recycling initiatives.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the insertion of a new section 74 in the 1996 Act providing for the establishment of an environment fund to be managed and controlled by the Minister and to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Minister may pay money from the fund for a range of measures, including programmes to prevent or reduce waste, the establishment and operation of waste recovery activities, litter prevention, producer responsibility initiatives, environmental partnership projects and environmental awareness, education and training.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the amendment of the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and section 39 of the 1996 Act to provide legal clarity and remove a potential duplication of licensing requirements for certain waste recovery and disposal facilities. A dual licence covering the requirements of both regimes, or two separate but similar licences, would lack the necessary clarity and enforceability. Accordingly, the section provides that waste recovery and disposal facilities will be licensable by the Environmental Protection Agency under the 1996 Act, except where the facilities are connected or associated with an activity which is or will be licensed by the agency under the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for amendments to the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, in relation to on-the-spot fines for litter offences. The section provides for an increase of the fine to £100 or 125 from a future date to be set by ministerial order. Further increases in the fine in the future are not to exceed 25% in any three year period. The section also confirms the Litter Pollution Regulations, 1999, which increased the fine to £50 or 60 from 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill will provide a legal mechanism to satisfactorily conclude the stalled waste management planning process and to facilitate the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste infrastructure. The Bill will also provide for a range of environmentally important and desirable initiatives to be undertaken in the near future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on the Bill which I hope will range across its many full important provisions. I also look forward to taking on board, as far as possible, any suggestions Members might make during the passage of the Bill through the House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Leader is allowing greater debate than what was proposed <Col N="102" /> yesterday on this important Bill. I am glad we will have an opportunity to reflect on it today and next week.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes to the heart of local democracy. It takes a fundamental basic power away from elected members and gives it to an unelected manager. Elected councils throughout the country have read and discussed at great length the waste management proposals. A number of councils, including Louth County Council, rejected the waste management plan because it included a provision for incineration or thermal treatment. By introducing this Bill, the Minister is taking away from the representatives of the local people a democratic right and a reserved function of elected members to decide how their waste will be managed and giving it to a county manager who does not have any knowledge or professional competence in this area, is not responsible to the public and who will not stand for election. Local government is about giving power back to the people through its elected members. The Minister has made significant progress in giving elected members a greater say in what is happening at local level. However, this Bill is a complete reversal of that progress. We in Fine Gael oppose this provision in the Bill which is unacceptable and undemocratic. We will fight it all the way. As a result of what the Minister is doing, the communities will fight incinerators wherever they are proposed, particularly in counties Louth and Meath. An incinerator is proposed two miles from my house. My community and my town, as well as people in Meath, will fight this proposal.</P>
      <P>How did these waste management plans come about? They are the result of consultants employed to develop regional policies. We have regional waste management strategies for the north-east, the south-west and so on, but the elected bodies of those regions did not meet collectively to discuss the plans. That is a critical failure in the waste management strategy. While the consultants were agreed as between the county managers and the councils, the plans were not presented to a joint meeting of the councils. If they had been, there would have been a true regional aspect to them. The councillors, whose reserve function it is to decide these issues, would have discussed, debated and decided them among themselves. Under this Bill, that has not happened. Whatever consultant was appointed &ndash; in most cases it was a well known firm &ndash; dictates to the council what it must do. If we do not do it, the manager will dictate what must be done.</P>
      <P>A study was undertaken into the feasibility of thermal options for waste treatment in the north-east and the mid-west regions and an inception report was published in 1998 before the plans themselves. The consultant professional groups, the Department's representatives, county managers and others drew up this assessment. The infamous company, as I refer to it, Thermal Select, is mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> When we went on the Continent to look at waste incinerators, we were brought to a plant at Karlsruhe which we were told had the most modern, efficient, productive and scientifically advanced way of managing waste. The report states that Thermal Select combines pyrolysis with gasification in a process offering improved recycling possibilities with lower emissions. When we visited the Thermal Select plant, there was no recycling. Everything was being burned. The report states that no other alternative thermal technology is at this stage of development and it is this process which shows most promise.</P>
    <P>We visited the plant as any group would and everything seemed fine. We were to make our decision on a waste management plan at 6 p.m. At 5 p.m. I spoke to the mayor of Karlsruhe on the telephone and he told me, in English, that the Thermal Select plant was closed because it breached regulation emissions. He said that it would be closed for months but would reopen although it had breached the regulations.</P>
    <P>How then could Louth County Council accept that if we passed this plan this company would operate in our town as it did in Germany? A journalist in Puerto Rico, who had read my comments in the international press, told me by telephone that Thermal Select was building a plant in his state, that the people there had the same problem and that there were other significant issues of concern. On the Internet there are details about Thermal Select's activities in northern Italy where there are also questions about it.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the company, when we visited the plant, the technology was not doing the job it was supposed to do. The councillors in Louth voted on the basis of the facts at the time. They were happy to accept the waste management plan, as were the county councils which originally rejected it, except for incineration or thermal treatment. That is the only exception that was made. Everything else, such as recycling, re-use, composting, and anaerobic digestion are acceptable, but incineration is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The people of County Louth support the council in its decision and expect to have the measures in place but without incineration. This Bill takes away that choice and provides for incineration regardless of whether we want it, because it will allow the manager to say that we must accept the waste management plan. I reject that aspect of it the Bill. Its focus is the putting down of local democracy.</P>

      <P>That is fair enough. Professor Schrenk mentioned that the prevalence of certain diseases such as allergic diseases, including allergic asthma, is increasing in Western countries and that major diseases such as lung cancer are more prevalent in highly industrialised zones. In his opinion, modern lifestyle, including changes in the pattern of food consumed, smoking and other individual factors, has a major influence on these increases. Furthermore, according to Professor Schrenk, a certain percentage of cases of lung cancer and chronic diseases of the respiratory tract are related to a spectrum of emissions in urbanised areas, including sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</P>
      <P>The professor went on to refer to municipal solid waste &ndash; MSW &ndash; incineration and mentioned calculations showing that the contribution of a modern waste incinerator to the total emissions of these compounds is in the range of, or below, 1%, depending on the background air quality. In rural areas, the additional emissions of most relevant pollutants related to modern municipal waste incinerators are in the range of a few percentage points, according to the figures cited by Professor Schrenk.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, incineration will add to atmospheric pollution and to ill health. Indisputable facts emerged from a survey recently carried out in County Louth, which found that 20% of children in the county are asthmatic. If incineration is introduced in County Louth, will it increase or decrease the incidence of ill health in our community? I believe that incineration will increase ill health.</P>

      <P>We are told that European directives allow incineration, which is obviously true. The Minister has said that he is prepared to listen to what Senators have to say. In that spirit, I call on him to ask the Health Research Board to carry out a survey of all available national and international literature on this issue to help people make up their minds. It should be a definitive, authoritative and independent report based on the available facts, and it should bear the stamp of the State. The State's final decision on whether to allow incineration under certain conditions would be more acceptable if such a report had been published in advance.</P>
      <P>Who will make the decision on the thermal treatment options in the waste management plan? It appears it will not be made by the people or by elected Members, but by county managers. If such a provision is included in our strategic plan for waste management without taking other issues into account, democracy will be effectively annulled and incineration foisted on us against our total, absolute and implacable opposition.</P>
      <P>The fifth report of the House of Commons cross-party environment, transport and regional affairs committee, published on the Internet, deals solely with arguments in relation to energy from waste. Section Q of that report highlights the health issues in relation to incineration. It states:</P>
      <P>The arguments about the health effects from incinerators are complex and are based on incomplete knowledge. There are, however, some truths which can be drawn from the debate over the health implications of incineration. Firstly, that the health effects which result from an incinerator's emissions are not yet fully known. Secondly, that the regulation of incineration to date has been rather poor and that this has resulted in poor practices developing in some incinerators. This, in turn, has raised the levels of anxiety amongst the public. Regulation must encompass emissions, the handling of the ash and all other aspects of the operation. Lastly, the lack of pre-separation of potentially hazardous materials, such as PVC, treated wood and batteries, increases the risk of emission limit values being exceeded.</P>
      <P>Section R of the report states, in relation to the United Kingdom:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Agency must provide a better standard of inspection of incinerators if <Col N="107" /> the public's confidence is to be regained. The agency will also need to examine a strategy for communicating the risks from incineration to the public. In addition, continuous monitoring of the emissions from all incinerator stacks should be carried out and the data made freely and easily available to the public. Where recurrent breaches of limit values are found to occur, the operator should be fined. If breaches continue to occur, the plant should be closed down.</P>
    <P>This Bill was first published in green, as it was to go to the Dáil. Last week the colour changed when the Bill was published in yellow, as it was to be initiated in the Seanad. In my opinion, this Bill should be printed in red, as it gives a red card to county councillors. They are being told they are not valued and that their voice will not be heard as it will be the manager's decision. The democratic process is overrun and overruled in this Bill, which I reject utterly.</P>
    <P>We will oppose many sections of the Bill on Committee Stage and we will make constructive suggestions as to how the issue of waste management should be dealt with. From Cork to Donegal and from Galway to Kerry, every parish has a sign saying &ldquo;No Dump&rdquo; or &ldquo;No Incinerator&rdquo;, because no investment has been made in recycling, re-use or waste management. The Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has failed utterly, absolutely and completely in this area. People will accept recycling, which they want, but the way must be shown by investing money in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to Nova Scotia where 50% of waste has been recycled for the past four or five years, and that is the only way forward. We should educate and learn, and give money to local authorities for infrastructure. The Minister is taking the wrong road. His proposal is unacceptable and we utterly and absolutely reject it.</P>

      <P>Ar tosach báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil chun ábhair na Bille seo a phlé. I welcome the Minister to the House. In his address, he alluded to the fact that this topic has generated a lot of debate. A lot of heat has been generated too, if the pun can be pardoned. While all this is understandable, we must be conscious of the risk of being brought down a cul-de-sac on one aspect of the proposals with regard to waste management. As the Minister rightly pointed out in his speech, we need to take a more comprehensive and broader look at the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some inescapable facts must be faced. Obviously, excessive amounts of waste are dependent on landfill. It is a shame that 92% of waste should go into landfill at this stage of the country's development. Equally, it is fair to say that the Minister has been pursued by the EU to <Col N="108" /> advance the situation so that we meet the regulations and targets set.</P>
    <P>Over the months I have listened to criticism of the Minister by the Opposition. This is disingenuous because, on the one hand, he is criticised for not taking action and, on the other, he is vilified for the action he takes. As the Minister is aware, I do not subscribe fully to all aspects of the Bill but I wish to consider its positive elements. Undoubtedly, one of the biggest blights on our landscape is litter pollution, although various attempts have been made to tackle this problem. In terms of other European countries, with the possible exception of Italy, Ireland is probably the worst offender in this area. The litter problem in Italy is particularly bad, but Ireland is not far behind in that regard. There is a need for awareness and education in this area. Schools have done tremendous work and my assessment, with which many people agree, is that children are often better at complying with the legislation in this area. They often correct their parents for indiscriminate littering.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the fine to £100 and that it will be index linked subsequently. This is necessary and perhaps it should be mandatory. I am aware of cases taken to court by local authorities where the Judiciary decided to apply the Probation Act or impose paltry fines. This does nothing to deter people or encourage them to be responsible in this area. Local authorities have not always been diligent with regard to the enforcement of the legislation. The Seanad dealt with a Bill recently where county councils were empowered to engage community wardens. It was recognised that part of their responsibility would be the enforcement of by-laws under various legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider if one community warden engaged in each electoral area of the county council could take responsibility for litter in addition to his or her responsibilities in relation to the registration of private rented accommodation about which local authorities are dilatory. Perhaps the provisions on derelict sites could also come within their remit. If local authorities were asked for their derelict sites registers, they probably would be conspicuous by their incompletion. If community wardens had a remit in these areas, they would be effective with regard to litter and improve the current position, but it would also ensure that other areas that are currently neglected would receive attention. This process could be self-financing and I ask the Minister to consider this proposition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions in relation to plastic bags and the application of a levy of up to 15p. The Minister signalled this move some time ago and I am glad it has been introduced. The behaviour of people while shopping has changed over the years and the convenience of plastic bags has been fully embraced. Unfortunately, it creates a pollution legacy. The Minister stated <Col N="109" /> that each person uses 325 bags a year, which is a cumulative total of 1.2 billion bags each year. This tells its own story. The levy and fund that will be created are definite steps in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is an undoubted need to ensure a determined effort is made with regard to landfill. This will require education, leadership and penalties against people who do not comply. The introduction of the landfill levy of up to £15 per tonne is a step in that direction. The objective is to ensure people change their ways in accordance with the policy documents and I welcome that development. However, it is important that it is not used as a mechanism to make the use of landfill prohibitive. As the records of the House and my council show, I share many of the reservations about thermal treatment and incineration. I agree with the Minister &ndash; I do not wish to fall into this trap &ndash; that compilation of the regional plans has generated a debate on thermal treatment to the total obfuscation of the other issues involved such as prevention, minimisation, reuse and recycling. We should be much more determined to achieve progress in those areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the debate has focused too much on incineration and that, accordingly, he intends to ask local authorities in the regional groups to prioritise the elements of the plans dealing with public education and awareness, waste minimisation, the delivery of segregated collection services and waste recycling infrastructure and to prepare a clear programme of action to fast track the implementation of these aspects. This is good and progressive and it needs to be pursued with vigour and diligence. Thermal treatment is only one step above landfill in the hierarchy proposed by the EU and EPA and those steps should be taken.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on the health issues related to thermal treatment but I have serious questions in that regard. There have been many other public health issues such as the problems arising from blood transfusions and the British Department of Agriculture's mishandling of the BSE crisis. The enforcement of environmental controls was lacking in such cases. However, this is not only an Irish phenomenon. Controls have not always been as thorough or good as they should have been throughout Europe and in the United States. The suggestion that the effects of the thermal treatment process in other jurisdictions should be investigated by an authoritative body in Ireland is good. Perhaps the Minister could consider that proposal because people will need reassurance if we are to move in a direction that raises genuine concerns and fears among the public.</P>
    <P>When a decision was made in Wexford in relation to our waste management policy, we opted for landfill over thermal treatment. This was done on the basis of information from Lille in France, Iowa and other places. We also held a meeting with ESB International and Sauer Utilit<Col N="110" /> ies, both of which mentioned an investment of £80 million and a period of 20 to 25 years to underwrite the cost of the project. Any decision to take that route is almost irreversible for a generation and should not be taken lightly. We also considered landfill and we chose that as the preferred route. Our proposals have a 20 year lifespan under a new development that would be undertaken. This decision can be changed at any stage because the landfill can be closed. I am aware of expert opinions that landfill is as great a pollutant as anything else, but I have examined many of them and I was most impressed with the landfill in Kill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of the waste management plan has transferred from being a reserve function to an executive function. I empathise with the Minister's dilemma because waste management from a national perspective was not progressing at a rate that was necessary; therefore he felt it incumbent on him to take steps to enable the plans to be put in place.</P>
      <P>Once all the regions embarked upon a strategy with a regional focus for tackling the issue it was felt that everybody had to sign up to the regional policy. I wonder if that conventional wisdom is soundly based. From my experience in Wexford, the council took a decision that, while it would embrace all aspects of this, thermal treatment would not form part of its strategy and any residues would go into landfill. That seemed to be a logical and reasonable objective for the council to pursue.</P>
      <P>While the hierarchy of waste management is set out by the EU, I know that from talking to senior people in the Commission on this, they would not necessarily disagree with the comment that thermal treatment is perhaps not necessary if we effectively implement the policy on prevention, minimisation, recycling and re-use. I was particularly pleased with the emphasis the Minister laid on introducing policies at council and regional level that will prioritise our efforts and energies in that regard.</P>
      <P>At the outset the Minister came in for some political criticism for not interfering in the process. There were a range of options open to the Department, one of which was to have a waste management authority as has been proposed by the Labour Party. Tonight we will discuss the NRA. Our experience of national bodies has been less than wonderful and they have been less than effective. I am glad that route was not selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion, which I might have favoured, that where waste management plans were not in place, the councils would be revisited with this issue. The Minister has alluded to people adopting what he calls the Paul Daniels <Col N="111" /> solution by hoping that the issue will go away. Obviously that will not happen. However, it is imperative that the <i>sine qua non</i> is that local authorities have the right to make an effective decision that conforms to national and EU policy. Where councils have made the decision to pursue all areas with perhaps one exception, that seems to be a plausible and acceptable position.</P>
    <P>In this instance the Minister has opted for a system where the power is transferred back to the executive and the county manager. I have opposed that for as long as I have been involved in local government. The empowerment of local councillors in addressing the democratic deficit is something that any of us involved as practitioners of local government would advocate. The Minister has been one of the strongest advocates of enhancing local government and empowering local councillors. He has diluted this part of the Bill by ensuring that it has a four year life span. However, in areas where the council has adopted a waste management plan, it should not be necessary for the manager to override that. I hope that no manager would ignore the mandate of elected members despite provisions in this Bill that would give him such powers. There is an onus on the council to have a sensible plan in place and where it has, he should respect the will of the members as the only ones with a democratic mandate. I hope managers will not use this power to fall in line with thermal treatment just for the sake of it.</P>
    <P>The environmental fund is a welcome provision in the Bill. In his speech, the Minister outlined the purpose of this fund. If we try to make this a &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; fund, it will have a seriously diluted impact on the ground. The fund should primarily be geared towards preventive waste measures. We need to be much more progressive in our thinking at authority and individual level because fundamentally responsibility for waste management starts with individual people and their households. It is at that level that significant improvements can be made. That means ensuring that there is awareness and that people buy into the policies that are enunciated here.</P>
    <P>I started by mentioning litter control. That is an area in which we have been aspirational for a long time. We need to be specific on the measures necessary, which should be properly resourced, as should local government. The Bill is like the curate's egg &ndash; good in many places but with areas where it could be improved. Perhaps the Minister of State will take on board what Members have to say on the Bill in order that it may be modified subsequently.</P>

      <P>On the assumption colleagues on both sides of the House will pay adequate atten<Col N="112" /> tion to the proposals regarding waste management plans, I will concentrate my thoughts on plastic bags. I hope the Minister of State and House will excuse me. As a chief executive of a supermarket company, this is something close to my heart, but it is an interest which is not hostile to the Minister's concerns and intentions. Although I plead guilty to being one of the conduits through which customers obtain plastic bags, I cannot claim to be happy with the position. I am sure the Minister of State will not have had the experience I have had of customers catching me by the lapels and saying they hate the way I give away so many plastic bags or that they hate the way I want to charge for plastic bags. On one occasion when we did charge for plastic bags, some people said they would leave never to return if they were charged 8p for eight plastic bags. There is a difference in attitude between different people.</P>
      <P>If it is to work, and I would like to see the Minister's intentions work, we must change attitudes. There are different attitudes in different shops and on the part of different customers. We have 19 shops, in some of which we use very few plastic bags because customers are aware of the environment or what they should be doing while, in others, almost everyone uses plastic bags. There is an education challenge here and I hope the Minister of State will be able to face up to it and ensure it happens.</P>
      <P>The excessive use of plastic bags is bad from an environmental point of view. To take my company as an example, we have engaged in many initiatives over the years to encourage customers to use fewer bags and use more eco-friendly alternatives. Our embarrassment from an environmental point of view is strengthened by the fact that there are commercial realities relating to plastic bags. The cost of each individual bag is insignificant and is probably only about a halfpenny, but the aggregate cost to a supermarket or company is certainly not insignificant. At a rough guess, plastic bags account for about 0.5% of total sales. That may not appear very much, but in the supermarket business, margins are razor-thin. If we did not have that expense, it could be passed on to customers in meaningful savings. There is a benefit to the economy in this.</P>
      <P>We are at one with the Minister in wanting to eliminate plastic bags. Having tried to do so by means of education and persuasion over the years, we must admit the reality that people will probably not change their attitudes and practices until they are given a strong financial incentive to do so. The levy proposed in the Bill is just such an incentive. I mentioned that, in supermarket economics, the cost of the plastic bag of a halfpenny is quite significant. That being so, a levy on each bag of 15p would be devastating. The Minister has obviously aimed the levy at a level where it will have an impact and will be too large to be absorbed by retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> The Minister is rightly interested in changing behaviour rather than raising revenue and a 15p levy will be certain to do just that. It will change behaviour because neither the retailer nor the customer can afford to pay a levy at that level. If the retailer paid the levy at that level, he would typically pay more for each transaction than the profit the company makes from the transaction. There would have to be £10 worth of goods in each bag to break even, and that is clearly over the top. On the other hand, if the customer paid the levy, it would add dramatically to the cost of his or her shopping and to inflation. Even if people were prepared to put up with it, which I doubt, it would have an immediate negative effect on inflation, and a sizeable one at that. Some bags may only contain £1 worth of goods, and paying the 15p levy would add 15% inflation to the cost.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the measure is well designed to create the effect intended by the Minister. I congratulate him on the incentive and wish him success with it. That said, the success of the initiative will depend on certain practicalities being addressed. They fall under two headings. The first practicality is that all retailers and all retail outlets must be treated equally under the law. If the working of the scheme gives a competitive advantage to one retailer over another, that will create an intolerable position which will fatally undermine the scheme. The second practicality is that a line must be drawn correctly and realistically between bags liable for the levy and those which are exempt. Clearly the Bill gives the Minister the right to do this, but I do not know that it has been thought through. The Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations exempting certain classes of bag from the levy. It is critical to the success of the scheme that the line between exemption and non-exemption is drawn correctly and realistically.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the issue of treating all retailers equally. This is important. There are certain retailers who use plastic bags unnecessarily but it does not matter a great deal. I think of shoe retailers, for example. A pair of shoes comes in a box and the box is then placed in a plastic bag for the customer to carry home. In an ideal world, the levy would be slapped on the bag and one would do one's best to collect it. However, in the real and practical world, it does not make much difference if shoe retailers are ignored or are left for another day. There are not that many of them. I would not object if shoe retailers were not subject to the levy.</P>
    <P>However, there is another sense to the wording of the Bill which concerns me. Section 8(2) empowers the Minister to make regulations raising the levy on plastic bags &ldquo;in or at a specified class or classes of supermarket, service station or other sales outlet&rdquo;. The problem is that, as written, the subsection does more than empower the Minister to leave shoe shops out of the equation, which is fine and with which I do not have a prob<Col N="114" /> lem. It also gives the Minister the power to discriminate between different classes of supermarket or different types of grocery shops. That is a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>If the Minister lumps us all into the same boat, we will be happy to knuckle down and get on with the job of making the legislation work but if the effect of the regulations is to burden me with the levy while leaving exempt a smaller grocery outlet or a more specialised one, we are heading into major trouble. Given the financial burden the levy will place on a shop's operations, it would be a major competitive advantage for a shop next door selling the same type of goods to be exempt from the levy. If that position were to apply, there would be immediate implications in terms of competitive legislation. There may also be constitutional implications. It is a law that would clearly discriminate between citizens doing the same type of business. I trust and hope the Minister will be as reluctant as I am to go that route.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem I must highlight before moving on from this issue of inequality between different retailers, and that relates to the collection method. It is clear from the Bill that the Minister has in mind a collection system akin to the manner in which rate collectors work. Collection would be outsourced with payment on a commission basis. That is the way I understand it. We must consider the potential for unequal treatment between retailers arising from such a system. A collector of levies will have a strong incentive to collect from large, highly visible firms and a much weaker incentive to collect much smaller amounts from smaller businesses from which it would be much more difficult to collect. In this way, the collection method could introduce a systematic bias against the larger retailer which could have the same effect as the Minister exempting smaller shops through the regulations he makes. If these measures apply to everyone with no opting out, they will work. It is completely unsustainable for a situation to pertain where the levy will apply only to large shops or certain types of shops.</P>
    <P>On the issue of what bags will be covered by the levy and what bags will be exempt, we must not make the mistake of labelling all plastic bags as environmentally unfriendly. For instance, we sell a thick-gauge bag that is clearly intended for reuse. Encouraging the use of such bags will obviously be part of any strategy we adopt, and one never sees this sort of bag littering bushes and highways. It would be counterproductive to put a levy on such bags, and I assume they would be automatically excluded.</P>
    <P>Let me explain the distinction between bags used to pack goods at the checkout and those used to pack goods inside the shop. Bags packed at the checkout are self-explanatory. I will come back to those. Bags packed inside the shop fall into two different categories. The first is bags used to pack what I call wet fresh foods &ndash; meat, <Col N="115" /> fish, bacon, delicatessen items and a few others. What they have in common is the need to put an effective barrier between them and other goods for health reasons. In the case of some goods there is a major food safety issue involved. For instance, the Food Safety Authority will state that it is of primary importance to keep cooked and uncooked meats strictly apart to avoid cross-contamination between the two. That is a really serious food safety issue. Clearly, packaging plays a key role in avoiding cross-contamination. Hence, the case for exempting the bags needed for that is unanswerable. There is a less strong but still compelling argument in regard to other wet fresh foods. On hygiene grounds, there needs to be a barrier between food that can seep blood, such as fresh meat, and anything else in the shopping bag. The same applies to fish, bacon and delicatessen items such as cheese.</P>
    <P>There is a slightly different situation in relation to what I call dry fresh foods. Food safety is not involved, nor is hygiene. What is involved is a long-standing merchandising practice of allowing people to choose their own fruit and vegetables, put them into a bag, weigh them, have them priced, and bring the sealed bag to the checkout. To change that set-up would cause an enormous amount of disruption to supermarkets and particularly to customers' choice. The disruption caused at checkouts will be more than enough to cope with, at least in the early stages. It would be unrealistic and impractical to expect supermarkets totally to revamp their way of selling fresh fruit and vegetables while they are focusing on the elimination of plastic bags at checkouts. All they would do is put the fruit and vegetables into some form of bag &ndash; it would probably have to be plastic &ndash; and, therefore, it would not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>With this in mind I propose that, at least in the initial stages of implementing the Bill, the Minister should make regulations that impose the levy only on bags that are used to enclose goods that are already inside a package. This would exempt, at least for the moment, all packaging that is used to enclose raw goods of any kind but penalise secondary packaging, that is, bags used to package things that are already packaged. If we can eliminate plastic bags for secondary packaging, we will have removed most of the environmental problem that is the foundation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether I have explained that well enough. Let me touch on the detail. This Bill could be put into operation in such a way that all bags would be levied. That means that if a person buys cooked ham or raw meat, the bag used to pack it will be levied. That would create an impossible burden on inflation, on customers, and on food safety. My proposal is that if the product that is already in a package is put into another bag, tax is levied only on the other bag. I hope that is understood. If I have not explained it well <Col N="116" /> enough I apologise to Members. I apologise also if I have taken too much of the time of the House explaining in such detail a rather technical subject. However, it is important to air these issues because they are the heart of the success or failure of this Bill when it is implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It can be made to work. However, we will have to make sure it is well thought out. This is empowering legislation and, with those objectives, it can achieve what it sets out to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>I want to make two points. The first relates to the Minister's assertion that this Bill does not in any way undermine local government. This is the most important underlying issue in the Bill. He should have said that it does undermine local government. There is no doubt about that. The Minister can interrupt me if I am wrong, but this transfers the waste management plan from local government to the Executive. What we have to decide is whether that is a good or a bad thing. It takes away one of the strongest powers of local government, but that it is a very good thing. The Minister should not have been so disingenuous as to say he was not undermining local government. He should have said he was undermining local government because it has misbehaved in this area.</P>
      <P>As someone who was in local government, I thank God I am out of it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because when I was on Wicklow County Council issues like this were impossible to confront. Any honest local councillor would agree. I represented Bray in local government. If someone had proposed that a landfill site should be put in Bray, it would have been political suicide if I had made an objective decision and agreed that was the place to put it. Nobody has done that. I challenge the Minister or anybody in this House to say they have ever suggested that a landfill site be put in their backyard. The logic of that is that there should be no waste disposal anywhere in country, and that there is nowhere suitable. That is just not the case. It is illogical to suggest that local government county councillors or urban councillors are in any way qualified to make objective decisions of this sort. They are not. They will put themselves straight out of office the moment they make an independent decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for undermining local government. I wish he would say he is doing that and why. He mentioned two cases &ndash; I think they were Clare and Galway &ndash; where local representatives were defying the regional plan. What else does he expect them to do? He would not expect them to destroy special areas of their own counties. It is, therefore, important that we <Col N="117" /> should say that county councillors  &ndash; and I was one and I am exactly the same as everybody else &ndash; have proved themselves totally unfit to deal in this matter because their knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion that a dump be put in their area is to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. They will say their area is unsuitable and invent reasons for not putting it there.</P>
    <P>It is the halting site syndrome all over again. I came across one objector to a halting site who objected to it on behalf of Travellers. He said it was not suitable for them, that they would get cold in winter or wet when it rained and so on. He did not give two hoots about the Travellers. The only thing he cared about was himself and his constituents.</P>
    <P>That is the reality in relation to this kind of issue. There are certain issues on which local politicians should not be asked to judge. It is quite obvious that they cannot judge these issues. I congratulate the Minister for doing this, and make no bones about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing something else which is good, but it is probably not enough. Senator Quinn dealt with it more than adequately. The objective here is to change behaviour patterns. Undoubtedly the Minister's proposal to put levies on plastic bags is an effort to get people and supermarkets not to use them any more, and if they do to pay for them. That is fine in principle. I did not understand the difference between different plastic bags until Senator Quinn made this point, so I am talking only about a general principle. As a general principle, it is very good to guide things in this direction. However, this is probably not moving fast enough.</P>
    <P>What we really need is a radical approach, although I know that will be difficult to achieve at national level. By a radical approach I mean that we will have to make a firm and final decision about recycling and incineration, and we will have to stick to it. There is no great problem about recycling, which should begin at home. Every individual should be given six or seven bins in which to separate waste materials, and it should be an offence not to do so properly. That would be a simple method to adopt and such discipline governing the separation of waste materials would be in the interests of every citizen. Instead, however, we all put our waste into one bin and expect someone else to take it away. Recycling is not a big task and it should be introduced as an initial step.</P>
    <P>I do not know enough about incineration and even though I have listened to the arguments on either side, and have been lobbied by both sides, I cannot make up my mind about it.</P>

      <P>It is unusual for a politician to say that, but I cannot make up my mind whether incineration is a good thing. I really do not know <Col N="118" /> because I do not understand it all, including the final chemical reaction. As a first step, however, we cannot do harm by having a rigid and compulsory recycling system, including fines for offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the final point made by Senator Ross in his estimation of how local councillors function, although I am not quite sure that I agree with all the elements of what he said. When local democracy works well it is efficient, but when it does not, action must be taken. That is what is happening in the context of the Waste Management Bill which became law in 1996. In the intervening four years, local councils have had ample opportunity to respond to the requirements of the Act. Some did so without wasting too much time, some dithered before doing so and others buckled under local pressure and did not do it at all.</P>
      <P>When I hear all the &ldquo;olagón-ing&rdquo; about local democracy, I have to ask what its purpose is. Local democracy is there to serve the citizenry of the community, not its own members. There is a strong self-serving element by members who refuse to promote or adopt waste management plans in their local areas. Local democracy is only as good as the members who exercise their responsibilities through the powers that are granted to them. When people abdicate those responsibilities the issue must be confronted for the greater good which is the public need.</P>
      <P>As a country we are being totally irresponsible in dealing with waste. We are generating more and more of it every day so that mountains of waste are accumulating and multiplying. Yet, when one travels around the country there are signs everywhere stating &ldquo;No Dump Here&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Incinerator Here&rdquo;. Where do people expect the waste to go? In this case, leadership has to come from central Government. If there is a fault to be found in this legislation it is that it is long overdue. It should have been introduced before now because we are dealing with waste in a reckless manner and there will be a price to pay later. For a country that is so dependent on tourism and its image as a producer of healthy food grown in clean soil, we cannot be so cavalier about the quality of our soil and fresh water. Neither can we afford to be cavalier about the damage that inevitably accrues from badly designed and badly managed landfill sites.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate about air emissions from incinerators and I have no quarrel with those who wish to unravel the issue by teasing out all the implications. That is the correct thing to do, but I hear of few equivalent efforts to tease out the damage that is being done to soil and water quality from badly designed and badly managed landfill sites. Waste has to go somewhere and we must apply ourselves to the key principles of the Waste Management Act to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> I have no expert knowledge of the incineration process but I am open-minded about new technology. I am not afraid to introduce change if it is for the overall good of communities and the country at large. A hierarchy of activities were provided for in the legislation, including waste reduction, recycling, re-use and disposal. We have failed miserably to reduce waste, and may not even have attempted to do so. Day after day my office is flooded with paper of all shapes and sizes. Anybody who thinks I have the time to read all this material is overestimating my capacity to deal with such a volume of paper. Even if I had the time, I would not necessarily have the expertise to interpret it in any useful way. We must be serious about waste prevention.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said he was bringing forth a comprehensive policy statement on waste prevention. Nothing works better than good example and the House could set such an example. An annual target ought to be set for every Department for reducing its output of paper by 10%. When computerisation was introduced I thought the flow of paper into our offices would be reduced because we would be able to access information in an environmentally friendly way. However, after going to the trouble of learning how to use a computer, I still find that the same flood of paper comes into my office every day. In conjunction with publishing a policy document, the Minister should set standards for those of us who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas. He should begin by asking Departments to examine their outflow of material, including duplication. They should examine how the computer system, including websites, can be used to reduce paper output, while adhering to annual waste reduction targets which could be monitored and policed on an annual basis. I am certain such steps would yield useful results. By doing that, we would be providing some leadership and setting an example for the rest of the country to follow.</P>
    <P>The Irish Pharmaceutical and Chemical Manufacturers Federation issues a monthly publication called <i>Horizon</i>. In the most recent issue I was advised that the federation would no longer be sending me paper-based copies of the publication because it can now be accessed on a website. I recommend that model to Departments because it would cut down greatly on the amount of waste paper for disposal.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the mania that has come over people in terms of delivering reports, position papers etc. The shelves in my office are clogged up with all sorts of documents that I do not have time to read. I intended to bring samples of those I wanted to speak about but I could not requisition a wheelbarrow. However, I picked the following at random: four reports from the Law Reform Commission, two of which were issued in March of this year and two in December; a report entitled The Variation of Trust; another report <Col N="120" /> entitled The Rules against Perpetuities and Cognate Rules; a consultation paper on homicide, The Mental Elements in Murder &ndash; I wanted to murder whoever sent it to me; and a report on the statutes of limitations, Claims in Contracts and Tort in Respect of Latent Damage. I do not envisage that I will ever have reason to read any of those reports in any greater detail than I would if I had to go to the Library to access specific information about any one of them. That is the way research is done. People who want to do research go to the library.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with cutting down on this flood of paper and transferring information to websites we should seek to develop and expand the Library services in Leinster House. There is no need to send all this detailed information to numbers of people. Perhaps I am the only person in the House who does not read these publications in detail but if I wanted that kind of specialised information when I worked in another discipline, I went to the library to do my research. I did not need to have all these publications on my shelves. We must cut down on the inflow of paper because where does all that waste paper go? Some of it is recycled, some of it is not and far too much of it goes to landfill. I am certain of that.</P>
    <P>Other issues nettle me also. I think I will be a crank in my old age because I have taken to writing about ten letters a week asking people to take me off their mailing list. A huge amount of unsolicited and unwanted circular material comes through my letter box every day which I do not use. It fills up my waste paper basket. I have found out that about three quarters of the contents of my wheelie-bin is made up of paper because there is no recycling service to facilitate me where I live in Cork. I do not need or use most of that paper and nobody has ever consulted me about it. I have taken to writing to these people asking them to take me off their mailing list, and I would recommend every householder to take an hour off every week for the next six weeks to examine the material that is thrust into their letter boxes either by the postman or by people who do the deliveries, and to send it back.</P>
    <P>The Germans are great about these issues. For years they unwrapped the products they bought in supermarkets and left the packaging behind them for the owner to deal with. There was a philosophy behind that. The obligation to dispose of that packaging was put on the person selling the product. When people send me notices about where I can get Chinese food or a cheaper type of Pampers, that is taxing my patience beyond breaking point.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to embark on a major programme of waste reduction and prevention and to start that programme in this House. We should give good example. In politics we always say that votes come one by one but if the Minister starts his programme of waste reduction here he will manage this issue place by place. Certain com<Col N="121" /> panies and industries are good at in-house waste prevention but Departments are not. We ask other people to do it but we are not prepared to do it ourselves. That is a gross lack of leadership and it has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I get the most elaborate, beautifully produced brochures, which I am sure create a great deal of employment, from groups like the Combat Poverty Agency. The Combat Poverty Agency gets taxpayers' money to be put towards the relief of poverty, yet that money is spent on producing these elaborate brochures. They are more elaborate than those produced by some golf clubs. That nettles me and I have written to the agency about that. The production of those brochures is eating up taxpayers' money that is voted for the relief of poverty but that money is not filtering down to those for whom it was intended. I gave the Combat Poverty Agency brochure as an example. I could give 21 examples but I do not have the time. We should tackle the problem of junk mail. We should have the courage to tell these people that we do not want their junk mail. We do not want our bins and our shelves clogged up with these publications and papers which is only putting more waste paper into landfill etc.</P>
    <P>In respect of recycling, we have failed miserably to make inroads into that area. We have not cultivated a culture of recycling. Senator Quinn talked about changing people's attitudes. We have failed to do that but we cannot afford to fail from now on and we must give leadership in that area. I and all my neighbours would gladly present our paper for recycling if the facilities were available and accessible. There has been gross under-investment in the infrastructure to make recycling a reality and that has to be tackled if we are serious about managing our waste intelligently. Putting an aspiration on paper does not make things happen. The money has to be made available and the facilities accessible and then people have to be encouraged and motivated to present material for recycling.</P>
    <P>The price of paper fluctuates and it is not always economical to recycle paper but we need Government intervention. We say recycling is a public good but saying it and supporting it are not always the same. We should put up the money to enable recycling to become habitual in households. As for composting, it intrigues me that intelligent people whose children get numerous points in the leaving certificate and who get the best paid jobs in the country will go to a gardening centre on a Sunday afternoon and buy the most expensive fertiliser to feed their plants and flowers when they could make their own compost. We have to make that practice fashionable. We have not developed a strategy towards the way we manage our waste.</P>
    <P>I am overwhelmed by the spirit shown by people here in tackling foot and mouth disease. I am overwhelmed by the patriotism of people and the way they have made sacrifices at a cost to <Col N="122" /> themselves. If we could generate that kind of spirit in relation to waste prevention and recycling, we would have fewer problems in terms of dealing with waste.</P>
    <P>We have to tackle the scourge of plastic bags up and down the country. On fine days they can be seen caught on the hedges. I was interested in the point made by Senator Quinn, which I expect we will revisit on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a long overdue amendment to the Waste Management Act, 1996, which I fully support. There is also a need for an amendment to the Litter Pollution Act, elements of which are unenforceable and have to be looked at. I will talk to the Minister about that later. On Committee Stage of that Act, which I worked on, many things were let through, such as signposting, putting up notices for meetings etc. These fellows who feel so passionate about Kosovo, Afghanistan, North Korea, South Korea and everywhere else do not give a damn about despoiling their own city, town or village. There is a loophole in the litter law that enables them to do that. In amending the Waste Management Act we have to look at its sister Act, the Litter Pollution Act, in the light of the experience we have gained since it was enacted to make its implementation more practicable on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House and I know he is listening very carefully to what we are saying. I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, did not stay, because I consider this leglislation extremely important in relation to the changed nature of the Minister's stance towards local authorities. I say that because the Minister was secretary of LAMA and he was very proactive in wanting to give more powers to local councillors. As a member of LAMA I heard him state that many times.</P>
      <P>I would like to read from the General Council of County Councils' briefing document on the Local Government Bill. It is very important and I know the Minister will take this on board. It states, as a point of principle, the county is the primary unit of local government but what is more important and relevant to this Bill, the primacy of the elected member. It is stated here that the entire concept of any new leglislation should respect the primacy of the elected member as the representative of the people. All other legislative considerations follow from this starting point. That is where I am starting. I cannot understand the Minister's panic reaction. He is almost at the end of his tenure as Minister for the Environment and he has attacked local councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of Limerick County Council I was responsible with other local authorities within the region for adopting a waste management plan. How do I feel? We have done it, as have other local authorities. Our one proviso was that in two years we would revisit it to review technological advances in relation to gasification <Col N="123" /> and any future technological advances with regard to incineration. This is extremely important in relation to what the Minister said today in response to Senator O'Dowd. We were being very open-minded. We were not saying no to everything but we should not jump at options at this juncture. I do not accept that incineration has to be the be-all and end-all and go back to my premise which I stated the other evening in Private Members' time. If we do not put sufficient resources into reducing, re-use and recycling as Senator Quill said, we can forget about any way of dealing with waste management.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael policy is that the idea of establishing a national waste management authority is extremely positive. I know that the Labour Party also accepts that and has its own policy in relation to it. It is important because that authority would implement a national programme of recycling, re-use and waste management in conjunction with, not independent of, local authorities. It would oversee the development of private sector waste management infrastructure as referred to by Senator Feargal Quinn. There would be full accountability by the authority to the Dáil, which there is not in respect of the National Roads Authority. Senators on both sides have been critical of the independence of the National Roads Authority. In this Fine Gael is being proactive in stating that local authorities who fail to meet their legal obligation under the 1996 Waste Management Act shall be fiscally penalised through the local government fund. We are not telling them to go away and do something about it. We are providing for accountability but we are also insisting that if there is failure action will be taken.</P>
    <P>I would like to give some facts and figures in relation to recycling. In 1998 some two million tonnes of municipal waste were generated, of which 91% went to landfill, with only 9% recovered for recycling, of which the household proportion was just 3.2%. We should have from the Minister at least a three year lead-in period of positive action in relation to recycling as they have had in Denmark. Let us think then of alternative ways of dealing with our waste. Here the Minister is putting the cart before the horse &ndash; incineration and then recycling. This is absolutely crazy.</P>
    <P>I have gone through much documentation, presentations and papers from countries in Europe as well as Canada and the United States and they all have one thing in common, that one starts with reduction, re-use and recycling followed by segregation and then deals with the residue. The Minister is not taking that approach and should not be out of kilter with countries that are already using what I would consider proper ways of disposing of waste.</P>
    <P>I can hear a Senator saying it is an integrated plan, but it is one with the dice loaded on inciner<Col N="124" /> ation with absolutely no debate in relation to health hazards&mdash;</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are here. The national objective is stated as being between 35% and 50%. In order to retain this level of recycling there needs to be a serious business-like response, not words, based on commercial principles of economic viability. That is straightforward. We know the recycling market is subject to fluctuation and instability in prices. The reclaim value will often not be the main factor for funding recycling. That is the kernel of the problem.</P>
      <P>What would Fine Gael do? We would embark on a major capital investment programme in re-cycling infrastructure. Senator after Senator from all sides of the House has stated that the money is not there. Currently there are no bring-back facilities for recycling plastic, which is the biggest enemy. There is little or no newspaper recycling and no plant to recycle metal from cans. At least £80 million would need to be invested in providing the manufacturing capacity and effective collection systems to deal with the recycling process needs of the economy. I could say more on that but I want to get on to other aspects.</P>
      <P>The Minister has looked for co-operation. Another positive Fine Gael proposal is to commission a detailed, definitive international health and environmental study on the impact of an incineration programme in Ireland. The general public is entitled to get the facts. I am weary from listening to one particular consultant, who is the consultant for all the authorities and who is at every conference throughout the country. We are getting a one-sided debate. I could sing the song of that consultant every time I raise the area of health. We are asking for a debate. We are entitled to it. Fine Gael is asking for the commissioning of this detailed, definitive health and environmental international study on the impact of an incineration programme &ndash; that is not too much to ask &ndash; and that a health study be commissioned at the direction of the Minister for Health and Children from the health reseach board, using the best available bio-chemical and toxicological expertise to review the international evidence &ndash; of which I have an enormous amount in my possession &ndash; on the health risks of the dioxins emitted by modern incinerators. That is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a paper from the National Academies &ndash; which comprises the National Academy of Science, the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council &ndash; the executive summary of which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether incineration is an appropriate means of managing waste has been the subject of much debate in this country [the United States]. A major aspect of the debate is the <Col N="125" /> potential risk to human health that might result from the emission of pollutants generated by the incineration process. Some of these pollutants have been found to cause various adverse health effects. Although such effects have generally been observed at much higher ambient concentrations than those usually produced by emissions from an incineration facility, questions persist about the possible effects of smaller amounts of pollutants from incineration facilities, especially when combined with the mix of pollutants emitted from other sources. The possible social, economic and psychological effects associated with living or working near an incineration facility have also been topics of concern.</P>
    <P>We cannot rubbish the contents of reports of this nature and say forget about the United States and Canada, they may have done their research but it is not applicable to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I considered the situation that obtains in one small town in Canada called Guelph, which has a population of 95,000, where local communities successfully set about operating a three way waste separation and recycling system coupled with an advanced system of composting. Those involved discovered that using this method led to a 60% reduction in landfill waste. They began utilising an integrated two-stream wet-dry system on a citywide basis in November 1995 and by 2000, 55% to 60% of dry waste and 60% to 65% of wet waste was being diverted from landfill.</P>
    <P>These are positive developments and the Minister must take them on board. However, the debate has developed in such a way that he is stating we should ignore the research carried out by Europeans, Canadians and Americans. The Minister referred to these people in a quite derogatory fashion. We must be allowed to listen to the evidence they can offer and then decide how to proceed. I suggested that Limerick County Council should invite outside experts to put forward their point of view in order that we might have a balanced debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the establishment of a super-dump at Slieve Feighlim in the mid-west. It is proposed to establish a dump, for which an EPA licence is awaited, in this scenic area which is situated 1,000 feet above sea level, which is seldom visited and which would be a good location for pony trekking and hill-walking. The head waters of the River Mulcair and its tributaries, which flow into the River Shannon, are located in this area. It is no wonder that the people of the mid-west are holding meetings about this matter on a regular basis. I attended a meeting earlier in the week in Castleconnell where people voiced their protests against the ludicrous proposal to establish a super-dump at Slieve Feighlim. The people to whom I refer were not consulted about this matter. It was again a case of the consultant employed by the Department saying, &ldquo;A beautiful site, nobody lives there. To hell with the envir<Col N="126" /> onment, we will put it in place and everyone will be satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been a councillor since 1985 and I have never witnessed such a one-sided debate. The Minister has indicated how he intends to resolve our problems. We are meant to forget local democracy and approach the manager of the county council. The manager of Limerick County Council has decided to take early retirement and I do not know what will be the views of his successor. However, he or she will not be familiar with what has happened in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister is seeking to do. He would have been far better off if he had thought in terms of allocating resources to reduce, re-use and recycle. I sympathise with Senator Quinn because it is not easy to make head or tail of the proposed 15p tax on plastic bags. To what bags will the tax be applicable and will it be collected at the point of exit? Fine Gael councillors and Senators last week received delivery of paper bags they had cause to have produced, at considerable personal expense &ndash; £300 for 1,000 bags &ndash; and I have never seen such a positive response from the general public. People are delighted that someone is seeking to protect the environment and rid us of plastic bags.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have got rid of plastic bags without introducing a 15p tax. What does he intend to do with the money that will be collected? If he intends to allocate it towards reduce, re-use and recycle initiatives, he should have done so four years ago when he entered office. Had he done so, he would have received our full support.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on red alert because he only has a few months in which to have these matters dealt with. I have never &ndash; I am sure Senator Quill will agree with me on this &ndash; received so many glossy brochures from any Department as I have from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, a name which is a contradiction in terms. The Minister is panicking and running for cover. He expects us to pick up the pieces but we will not do so. The general public will not appreciate this Bill which seeks to transfer the powers of county councillors to county managers who, in many instances, do not live locally. I am concerned about what will become of councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In the South Dublin County Council area. The council has introduced green bins and will shortly introduce brown bins. It has also introduced composting.</P>
      <P>The issue at stake in this debate is what to do with residual waste. We have two choices: we either use landfill sites or thermal treatment. I sympathise with those local authorities who are concerned about this matter. However, we must consider where we go from here and put in place a vision for the future. We must show leadership and develop a plan with which we can move forward. A total of £100 million has been allocated in the national development plan for projects involving recycling, composting and re-use. However, the provisions of the NDP cannot be implemented until an action plan is put in motion. Members of the Opposition failed to mention this because to do so would be to give the game away. Matters are being delayed because local authorities, for their own reasons, cannot accept the proposals. What can the Minister do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister since entering office has devoted more time to local authority matters than any of his predecessors. I have been a county councillor since 1985 and I am aware of how the system works. In addition, I know what is the executive function of a county manager and what is his or her reserved function. I am also aware that, when that executive function must be exercised, county <Col N="128" /> managers and councillors often work together to arrive at a satisfactory solution for both the council and local people. It is often the case that the county manager must exert his or her authority in relation to development plans, but it is always done after consultation with the local residents' associations and community councils. We have learned that we cannot introduce any plan unless there is consultation. That is the way a good manager will operate.</P>
    <P>I am a long time in this game as I have been a county councillor for 16 years. Senator O'Meara might have joined this game a little later so she should allow for the fact that I have experience of the process. We are good at our job and we will not let the local people down. We will reflect their views and listen to what they have to say. Perhaps the problem is that we do not start to educate the public early enough about how this should be done and to explain thermal treatment. I have reservations about thermal treatment, but we must move forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like knockers. I like positive contributions and constructive thinking. There are many knockers of this plan. We must move forward and introduce measures to adopt the plan. We can then consider how to recycle goods for compost and thermal treatment. Modern technologies must be introduced. The Environmental Protection Agency must monitor this area and planning laws must be implemented. Licences must be given before modern technology is used. The public must be educated about such measures because this is the way forward. We must do something about the fact that 50% of our waste cannot be reused or recycled.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara may shake her head but I have also read up on this issue. We can carry out a research study on this issue and come up with as many answers as scientific studies have done over the years. I know the Senator is educated and I am sure she will agree these are the philosophies of life. Researchers will come up with different answers. It is not good enough to suggest that one is right and the other is wrong. We should all move forward and see how we can solve this problem and how we can find a means to implement a new waste management plan. The Senator should give it a try because she has knocked everything else so far. We should allow the Minister to spend the money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have problems with charging 15p for every plastic bag. However, perhaps it is an opportunity to focus our minds and for the public to look at <Col N="129" /> alternative ways of collecting shopping in the supermarkets. I represent an area which has a beautiful linear park along the Dodder. However, it is littered with plastic bags every weekend. If the river floods, the plastic bags dot the brambles along the linear line. Something is not right when that happens. People often ask me why the plastic bags are not removed. However, why do they not remove them? We cannot solve this problem alone. We need the combined efforts of communities, residents' associations, the Minister and leaders. If we do not take the lead and educate the public to change their attitudes and behaviour, our beautiful environment will be littered with white plastic bags which will not be easy to remove. If the charge of 15p per bag helps to focus minds, I welcome it. This charge could be linked to inflation, but what is the alternative? How do we educate the public?</P>
    <P>There are three schools in the area I represent. A link was developed between the local authority and the secondary and primary schools. It was decided to hold a lecture before lunchtime so parents and the public could be made aware of how to prevent litter. Within half an hour of that lecture, the area around the schools was covered in litter. Where are we going wrong? Is that also the Minister's fault? What must he do to get the message across that we need a management plan and money for recycling and composting and then a debate on how to eliminate our 50% unavoidable waste? That is the $60 question.</P>
    <P>We should consider the research which has been carried out and examine modern technology to see if thermal treatment is suitable. I am afraid to say incinerator in case it is said I support toxic ash blowing everywhere. I do not want that. I want a plan which will work. The Government is taking the lead and the Opposition should stop knocking it. Why can we not work together? I will not work with a county manager who walks rough shod over me. I, not the manager, will have a voice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the presence of the other members of local authorities in the Gallery today. I am sure they would agree this is a sad day for local democracy. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is asking Members of this House, the majority of whom are elected by members of local authorities, to reduce their paltry powers further. I listened carefully to Senator Walsh and, considering his stewardship of the Local Authority Members Association, hoped he might echo what he said on his local radio station. Then he condemned this legislation. He criticised it because it diminishes the powers of the elected member, the person elected by popular mandate to serve.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace. This is shameful legislation. It is a disgrace that any Minister would stand over a situation where, in a fit of pique, because no local authority members, exercising their democratic voice &ndash; I stress that &ndash; acted in a particular way, he is taking away their powers, taking away everybody's powers and giving them to an unaccountable manager. As Members of Seanad Éireann, we should acknowledge that by stating that this is shameful legislation.</P>
      <P>There are two issues in the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001. One is the way in which it ravages local democracy and the second is that it, once again, fails to deal with the crisis of waste management, to which I will return. I made my view clears on the diminution of local democracy, but I have more to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the manager was pointed out by Senator Ormonde but where in this legislation does it say that the manager has to consult anyone? He does not have to. If Senator Ormonde is lucky enough to have a manager who meets a residents' group, that is wonderful. However, <Col N="131" /> there is no requirement on a manager to do that, and he will not do so in many places. He might delegate an official to meet a residents' association or insist on meeting a small delegation behind closed doors. It is rare in my experience for local authority officials to meet groups in public.</P>
    <P>This not only undermines democracy but it creates an invidious relationship between local authorities and communities. As local authorities, we are being barraged with better local government, strategic policy committees, inclusion of the community, hearing everybody's point of view, transparency and, I forgot, accountability. Where is the accountability in this legislation? There is none.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority which adopted a waste management plan yet I will support to the bitter end the right of any local authority not to adopt such a plan. The last I heard, we live in a democracy, we have choice, but this takes away choice.</P>
    <P>Several Members referred to the many anti-dump, anti-mast and other environmentally related campaigns, and did so in near contemptuous terms. I object to that. They are representative local groups. We live in a democracy where people are entitled to come together and object, to say they have a concern, whether it be about a small landfill, a super dump, a mast or anything else. People have a right to express their concerns about their own health, the environment they live in, the environment their children are being raised in, the water they drink and the air they breathe. These groups come together &ndash; and I am a member of one of the largest &ndash; because they have lost trust in the institutions which are supposed to protect them. They form groups because they do not trust a local authority, unfortunately, nor any other institution. They feel they must protect themselves. That is why these groups are proliferating.</P>
    <P>It is a sad comment on our democracy and on the fact that people believe they are not heard that they feel forced to form these groups. They have every right to do so and, again, I will support their right to do so to the bitter end. I will never speak about them in terms of near contempt, particularly in this House of elected representatives. I want to make that clear.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill generate trust in local government? No, it will not. It will have the opposite effect. I am involved in two issues locally in north Tipperary. Both involve executive decisions by the manager and one relates to waste management. In both cases, it has engendered such distrust between the community and the local authority that it is worrying, so worrying that I raised it at last Monday's local authority meeting. This is a bad road to travel and this legislation will make it worse.</P>
    <P>How does it serve a local authority not to have the trust of the community? It does not. Senator Ormonde can talk about consultation from here <Col N="132" /> until kingdom come but, as we all know, when local authorities are given executive functions they will exercise them and there will be less inclination to consult. This is a sad day because it diminishes the power of the elected members of the authorities and so diminishes local democracy itself and the voice of the people.</P>
    <P>I predict that it will increase the number of groups formed outside the process to object to decisions and who feel that their voice is not heard. Increasingly local authority members cannot say that we represent people, that our voices will be heard in a local authority meeting. It might be reported in the local media but the manager can say it is an executive decision and he is deciding.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented that these groups emerge because this issue is led by misinformation. It is not, because people can get their own information and they do. Fair dues to them for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Administration have failed over waste management. We have heard fine words for years about recycling. Tipperary North Riding County Council, of which I am a member, adopted the waste management plan. When doing so, I specifically asked the consultant from the company which advised a number of local authorities about the targets for recycling, which we all welcomed. I wanted to know how to meet these targets on our own. He answered that we could not. I asked our own engineers the same question. They too said we could not do so. These waste management plans are empty. Local authorities, whether acting regionally or locally, collectively or individually, cannot deliver on the recycling targets, much as they want to.</P>
    <P>People talk about re-education but the public is very well educated. It wants to recycle, to have a kerbside collection system of separated waste. I know that from speaking to people. How many Members of this House have a composting scheme in their own gardens? I would like to know. As Senator Quill pointed out, composting is an effective way of reducing the amount of rubbish going into the bin. So is segregating waste. Senator Quill put it best when she said there has been a gross under-investment in the infrastructure of recycling. The question is, of course, by whom, and she answered that it needs Government intervention.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a Government programme of investment in centres of recycling, private companies involved in waste management will not get involved in recycling. Unless there is genuine recycling at national level, not at a small ring-centre level, we will not reach the required targets. The Minister should initiate such a programme, but more policy statements are not necessary as we have had enough of them. We are up to our ears in recycled paper from policy statements and are sick of them, so we want action instead.</P>
    <P>If we fail to develop a national recycling infrastructure, recycling will not happen. This Bill has reiterated my clear opinion that the current <Col N="133" /> Administration, including the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is determined to proceed with incineration. They will meet huge resistance, which is why they are giving power to county managers. Local representatives will make their resistance known at community level, and rightly so. What should we do except represent people? It is our job as members of local authorities, in case the Minister has forgotten. It is what we were elected to do, and we are failing in our duty if we do not articulate the concerns of local residents. I agree that local authorities must provide leadership. A number of local authorities have swallowed their reservations and accepted waste management plans, even though the plans were presented on a take it or leave it basis. The local authorities decided to move forward and try to meet targets by seeing how they get on, one step at a time. We have effectively not been allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister first spoke of putting a levy on plastic bags three years ago. At that time, the levy was intended to be 2p, a sum which increased to 5p and then 10p, and it is now 15p. I urge the Minister to ban plastic bags instead of introducing this unimplementable levy. Plastic bags should be banned and people urged to use paper bags or boxes instead. Supermarkets are full of cardboard boxes because things are delivered in them, so it would be simple to allow customers to use such boxes to take goods away. Let us have paper bags or reusable bags instead of mountains of plastic ones. The Minister should take his courage in this hands and ban plastic bags, thereby doing the environment a favour.</P>
    <P>I condemn this Bill and I will strenuously object to it at every level. I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his leniency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for sharing her time with me, which was a wonderful example of good management of resources. I could have come in sooner, but Senator O'Meara and I negotiated and found a satisfactory and co-operative method. I will not take the same line as Senator O'Meara, however, as I understand and am sympathetic to the Government's difficulty. Although the question of local democracy is relevant here, the matters of the national good and the importance of the environment also arise.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister made it clear that regional waste management plans have not been adopted uniformly. His legal advice is that these plans must be generally adopted by county councils if they are to be effective and sustainable. Otherwise, they may not be legally valid. All authorities must adopt the plans on the same substantive basis, or none will be considered to have a valid plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made clear that we are being squeezed by Europe, as the Commissioner has taken a case against Ireland. A judgment in that case may shortly be forthcoming, and will not be in Ireland's favour. The Minister was a little disingenuous when he said that the proposed changes <Col N="134" /> will not affect the substance of the waste management plans adopted by the majority of local authorities. Although that may be true, a principle has been breached and a question of judgment and balance hangs over democracy. In my opinion, the future proper management of the waste disposal facilities is a more important priority and must be given precedence.</P>
    <P>The questions of incineration and landfill were raised. Technology is changing all the time and anybody who reads the correspondence to <i>The Irish Times </i>will have been thoroughly confused by the whole business. Experts were quoted and then the experts themselves wrote to qualify or contradict what was said. The average punter simply does not have a chance to understand the matter, and has to rely on the best appropriate advice. The kernel of what I have to say is that we should opt for zero waste, which would require a complete change in our thinking. I will elaborate on this later.</P>
    <P>Plastic bags are a specific and particular problem &ndash; we have said time and again that they are an abomination. Anyone who walks on Bull Island will see them, or along the banks of the Dodder, as Senator Ormonde said. I have seen them in Nuweiba on the Gulf of Aqaba, which shows that even the most isolated places are vulnerable. The Minister says he will extend this measure, which I would like to see and which I would encourage. He should extend it immediately to cover the clearly identifiable styrofoam boxes and wrappings from burger joints like McDonald's, Abrakebabra and Burger King on O'Connell Street in the centre of Dublin. They are a real nuisance and the Minister should extend the capacity of litter authorities to challenge them, as he says he is considering.</P>
    <P>I am interested in sustainable waste management, a topic which is the source of many misunderstandings. I have been briefed extensively by Earthwatch, which I praise for its marvellous work in helping ordinary people to understand what is going on. Sustainability should be our goal, but it is incorrect to suggest that incinerators and landfills are sustainable in normally understood terms. Landfill is not sustainable as it entombs potentially recoverable materials which can be used to the benefit of the whole economy, as has been done in other jurisdictions. A massive cultural shift is needed in terms of the enormous amounts of waste, which have multiplied manifold since I was young, that are being generated. We need to rethink our attitude towards waste and instead of seeing things as needing to be shoved aside and got rid of, we need to see them as resources to be re-exploited.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom it has been calculated that for every tonne of product made, ten tonnes of material have been used to manufacture it. Imagine the amount of waste involved. The world's resources are being over-exploited and materials are not being returned having been used once. The balance between the developed and the developing world is inequitable, as 20% <Col N="135" /> of the world's population uses 80% of the world's resources. The other 80% exploits only 20%, which is a complete inversion. It is like an enormous resource iceberg.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that if all the world was to live in the manner of North Americans, two more planets would be required to sustain everyone, and three more if the population were to double. If worldwide standards of living were to double over the next 40 years, as is possible, 12 more Earths would be needed to sustain us if we lived as North Americans do. We need to very seriously address this matter and look on waste materials not as a problem but as a resource.</P>
    <P>To show that this is not just theory and can be done, let us take the example of Canberra, a major Australian city with a policy of eliminating waste by 2010, which is just nine years away. Canberra is developing an infrastructure to meet this policy and is breaking its waste stream down into resource streams, including building materials, demolition materials, paper, cardboard, organic materials, garden waste, hard and soft plastic, glass and textiles. These resources are then publicised to attract and develop new industry. Canberra has achieved a 66% diversion from landfill of domestic waste, which shows that the targets in this Bill are modest. I notice that an adviser is shaking his head and perhaps the Minister will reply to this point, but this is the information clearly in front of me.</P>
    <P>Those who dismiss this as an idealistic dream are challenged by Michael Whiteman, project officer of the &ldquo;No Waste by 2010&rdquo; programme of the Australian Capital Territory. He says that the goal is achievable as it is unambiguous and clear. He also said that the no waste option is the only option; it is a 100% solution. The development of a secondary materials economy where the materials found in waste and dumps is exploited&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Members referred to compost but newsprint can be used an animal bedding. There are projects in Pennsylvania in the United States in this area and it can also be turned into fertiliser. Brunswick in Australia has turned newsprint into housing insulation. Nova Scotia has used news<Col N="136" /> print to make wall board and a recycling plant there was built from recycled material.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the Bill because action must be taken. Ireland has a legal difficulty with the European Union, but our whole attitude should change. We should start regarding waste as a resource that can be exploited not only in terms of domestic composting but community composting. This has been shown to work for cities and large corporations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister. I have listened with interest to the debate and it is unfortunate that the Bill is necessary. However, action must be taken because some local authorities are unable to bite the bullet and make decisions. This means that other local authorities are held to ransom and this is most unfair. Many local authorities were responsible and took decisions. They were progressing waste management and regional policies, but three other local authorities held them to ransom. This is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>There is much to be done regarding waste management and the removal of waste materials. Many people have come up with solutions, but how was waste disposed of in the past before landfill areas and refuse collections were available? I recall a time when people burned most of their waste in furnaces in their homes and all that remained to be disposed of was the ash. This did not appear to cause any health problems at that time. However, environmentalists and groups now say that ash from incinerators would be dangerous and toxic. I need to see statistics before I am convinced in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for local authorities and the public to be more educated about recycling and separating their refuse. I was in Europe recently where most people have three bins in their homes, one for bottles, a second for paper and a third for other household waste. These bins are collected once a month or every two months. This is the way forward and people should be more conscious about such issues. There should be greater education in the school system because much can be done in this area. I recently separated cardboard materials in my household waste. One would be surprised at how much cardboard is used. The bin was only a quarter full at the end of the week and there is a lesson to be learned in this regard. An enormous amount of paper goes through the system and this should be separated from the ordinary refuse. Much can be done with this paper if it is recycled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the new levies on plastic bags. The statistics he gave earlier highlight the problem. He said it was a conservative estimate that approximately 1.2 billion plastic shopping bags are provided free of charge to consumers at retail outlets annually. This equates to 325 plastic bags per head of population each year, a frightening statistic. If the 15p charge is introduced, message bags will reappear. In the past, the same bag was brought to the grocery store for <Col N="137" /> years and if a hole appeared, it was repaired. We may have to return to using such bags.</P>
    <P>Many speakers complained about thermal treatment and incinerators. However, we are in the good position where we can learn from the experience of other countries that have incinerators and thermal treatment facilities. It is more effective in some countries than in others. Guernsey Island has a very small population and it established recycling operations. It now manufactures more paper and creates more compost than it can use. It has a problem trying to dispose of the compost it produces because the agriculture sector there does not want to use it. It is afraid that it might contain unknown additives. This shows that when one problem is addressed, another is created.</P>
    <P>I have visited incinerating and waste disposal operations where refuse was separated and material composted. As I said previously, my local authority runs such an operation. There is one landfill site but the composting project is working efficiently. We intend to develop a small incinerator and to generate electricity from other waste material. The lifespan of the landfill site in Kerry is only another nine years so we must look forward. It will take four or five years to establish a new landfill area or find ways of disposing of waste. We are already planning for the future in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand the most effective operations in Denmark, Holland, Germany and elsewhere in Europe dispose of up to 16% of total waste through ordinary recycling and means other than incineration. Countries which have incinerators only dispose of 60% of the total amount of waste in that way. This means they must deal with the remaining 40%. I understand the most effective operation is in Nova Scotia. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government which discussed this matter recently. Representatives should visit Nova Scotia. The Minister and departmental officials were meant to go there and I would like to see a report on the operation. I understand it disposes of approximately 92% of its waste. As Senator Norris said, some of the components of the thermal treatment plant were recycled materials.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback today by the Green Party which demonstrated outside Leinster House with massive billboards stating that it is opposed to incineration or the thermal treatment of waste. I would like that party to introduce a policy on how to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in Britain in regard to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. We are lucky we have not the same problem. I compliment the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on their response to this problem. Would we dig massive graves to dispose of animals such as the numbers being slaughtered in the UK? There is now a problem in relation to the waterways there. These mass graves may have to be dug up and the carcases moved elsewhere. Given that we had to slaughter <Col N="138" /> animals with BSE, we should build a massive incinerator close to a power station so that people would benefit from the energy produced. I am reliably informed that these incinerators are quite safe and I would welcome a policy statement from the Green Party on the issue.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of my Labour Party colleagues. I understand they favour MMT or modern metal technology which is used in the United States. I do not know a lot about the method but I believe those using the facility are under investigation for massive fraud. What happened was akin to the three card trick and I would like to obtain more information on the matter. Perhaps that party could bring forward recommendations on the disposal of refuse. I welcome anyone who can put forward solid policies.</P>
    <P>If we decide that landfill sites are the answer, we must worry about our waterways. There are signs in place in every by-road throughout the country stating that landfill sites, refuse dumps and so on are not wanted. If waste is not disposed of it will begin to pile up. This recently happened in Galway where there was a problem with private contractors. Rubbish was piling up on the streets and there was a public outcry about what the Government or local authorities should do.</P>
    <P>There is currently a problem in County Clare where the landfill site will close within months. They must ask a neighbouring county to temporarily take the refuse which would tide them over for up to five years or whatever the case may be until local objections are dealt with. County Kerry was anxious to facilitate west Clare, which is quite close to the Kerry coast, but suddenly a local picket was placed on the landfill site outside Tralee protesting that refuse should not be taken from outside the county. A High Court order was necessary to remove the pickets because refuse was piling up in Tralee, Killarney and so on. Of course, people have a right to protest and walk up and down O'Connell Street, or any other street, because many people fought for the freedom which we now enjoy. However, we must get on with living and disposing of refuse. There is now much more refuse because more people are working, more houses are being built and more people are coming to live in this country.</P>
    <P>People now demand better infrastructure such as roads, water supply and refuse collection, to which they are entitled, but someone must make decisions in this regard. The Minister is biting the bullet because he must comply with EU regulations while dealing with the issue nationally. It is unfortunate that some local authorities did not agree with him. Tough decisions must be made. As a member of a local authority for 21 years, I am aware that no one wants to live near a dump or landfill site. Over the years, I have lived just three, four and ten miles from small refuse sites. There is a dump on the banks of the River Feale, the second best salmon fishing river in the country and fourth or fifth best salmon fishing river in Europe. There was a dump for years on the side <Col N="139" /> of the road just outside Tralee on the way to Dingle. It has been closed down. There were dumps in Killarney and Dingle, which were eyesores, with papers and plastic bags blowing all over the place. My local authority dealt with this problem and it is unfortunate that other local authorities did not do likewise. We put a recycling programme in place and moved in the right direction. The landfill site in Kerry will be filled within a couple of years when we will again go through the same problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in what he is doing because we must look to the next 40, 50 or 60 years and not just four or five years down the road. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should get together with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce a couple of massive thermal plants which will generate electricity and feed it into the grid so that people can benefit from it. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I cannot say I welcome the Bill, which I suppose was a last desperate throw of the dice because something had to be done. It is regrettable that local democracy has to be eroded in this way. However, I do not know what the Minister could have done because some local authorities were not going to adopt a waste management plan. Given that the European Union was about to fine us for our lack of compliance with the various directives, there was nothing the Minister could do but introduce the Bill.</P>
      <P>Executives of local authorities rather than elected members will now make the decisions. Unfortunately, this will not make the objectors go away. They will object just as much to executive decisions as to decisions made by local councillors. Therefore, I do not expect any great improvement in the system in the near future.</P>
      <P>I hope Senators have read the Environmental Protection Agency's millennium report. This is an excellent document which we received at the end of last year. Chapter 6 states:</P>
      <P>Waste Management remains one of the most challenging areas of modern environmental management. The latest figures show clearly that waste quantities are continuing to grow in Ireland. Almost 80 million tonnes of waste were generated in 1998, of which over 64.5 million tonnes originated from agricultural sources, mainly animal manures.</P>
      <P>This means the Bill does not address more than three-quarters of the waste produced. The report goes on:</P>
      <P>Over two million tonnes of municipal waste were generated in the same year. A comparison of waste collected by or on behalf of local authorities between 1984 and 1998 indicates an increase of over 100 per cent in 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> It is fine to say that the increase in waste has taken place at a time when there has been a great increase in economic activity, but this is totally unacceptable. I would not describe the document Changing Our Ways as timely because it is probably ten years late. The report continues:</P>
    <P>Between 1995 and 1998 there was a 47 per cent increase in the amount of industrial waste generated, from 6.2 million tonnes to 9.1 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>While our economic activity has been splendid, it has created another dreadful problem for us. There has been an increase in hazardous waste of 13% between 1996 and 1998. The amount of construction and demolition waste in 1998 was estimated at 2.7 million tonnes. We are very lucky to have these figures from the EPA because in the past we had great problems trying to find out the amount of waste we had, particularly in the construction and demolition area. This report goes on to state that given the unprecedented level of construction activity in Ireland in the past five years and the likelihood that this activity will grow, this waste can be expected to continue to grow. We have a very serious problem. While the EPA is there to fulfil the legislation, it is up to us to say what we want done with the waste. Local authorities in many areas carry out the requirements, but unfortunately some did not bring in a plan.</P>
    <P>In the three areas without a plan, incinerators were suggested. I have some sympathy for those areas in resisting the building of an incinerator in their areas, not because of what I think incinerators will do, but because none of them produced enormous amounts of waste. An incinerator should be built in an area where the most waste is produced.</P>
    <P>The Bill is disappointing in many ways. Under a Waste Management Bill like this we should have gone the whole hog and set up a national waste authority. For the amount of waste here, however bad it might be, it would have been better to address the problem on a whole country basis. The trouble we have had in bringing in the management plans may be replicated in a few years' time if any variation or changes are made, even though it seems that under the Bill councillors will not be allowed to do this. All the technical advice we have been able to get over the years appears to indicate that a national waste authority is needed. I have read speeches by Paddy Purcell, the Director General of the Institute of Engineers in Ireland and Dr. Mary Kelly of IBEC suggesting that a national waste authority would be best.</P>
    <P>The landfill directive requires that we make huge changes in how we deal with waste. There is one thing this Bill does not do, it does not provide for the streaming of waste. I thought that was one of the most important issues regarding waste and one which we should have addressed in this Bill. Maybe this can be done on Commit<Col N="141" /> tee Stage. Landfills need to be made safe. An enormous amount of the municipal waste produced here is biodegradable and I gather that that is considered one of the most unfortunate things to put into landfills because it is responsible for the production of methane and is unstable.</P>
    <P>The construction and demolition industries are huge users of landfill, as outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency's report, and £15 per tonne is not much to ask them to pay. They are making an enormous amount of money and we will not get them to recycle more of the materials that come from demolished buildings unless there is a heavy tax on putting those materials into landfill. Unless the tax on those producing the waste is high, it is no good. We have been talking about the polluter pays policy for about ten years and I have seen little progress on it in the construction and demolition areas.</P>
    <P>Waste prevention and minimisation is the top of the pillar. I strongly support what Senator Quill said about the amount of waste produced in the Houses of the Oireachtas. For example, the speech by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is written on one side of the paper only. Almost all speeches which come into this House are written on one side only. At committee meetings all the information is on one side of the paper only. The Minister's words are there for posterity and are of the greatest value, but they would have been of equal value if they were printed on both sides of the paper. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should take the lead on this issue. I have raised this matter for years and I eventually managed to have recycled paper used for all the photocopying in these Houses. I have asked that Cahills, which prints the Order Papers, Bills etc. should use recycled paper. I am not sure if they have done so.</P>
    <P>Unless we take a lead, we will get nowhere. Do all Members of both Houses have to get all the proceedings of both Houses and of every committee meeting sent to them in bound form? Does every communication from the Houses of the Oireachtas have to come out in an A4 or foolscap envelope? Sometimes one gets a single sheet of paper. I cannot believe that it is those who are administering the system who insist that those enormous envelopes are used. There is a recycling box for large envelopes in the General Office and some of us put envelopes in there. However, I have been told that some Members do not like to receive documentation in reused envelopes. This is patently ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government request the Joint Services Committee or the Ways and Means Committee, or whoever is responsible, to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas make a proper start on this. I hope this is the last time I ever get a Minister's speech produced like this. We are well able to turn over the page and read on the other side. It might be a good idea if speeches were not given out to us because then we would really have to <Col N="142" /> listen to them. Nothing is more irritating than people reading the speech ahead of the speaker.</P>
    <P>Recovery programmes are operating satisfactorily. Corporations are very good at collecting goods &ndash; I do not know what they do with them. Bottle banks are excellent and there has been a huge improvement in the amount of glass that is collected. Waste paper collection has gone down the tubes recently because nobody would use the waste paper. On the Continent, in a country like Italy, for example, in towns and villages there are central points of collection for waste paper, bottles, cans etc. and these are used by the people living in the area. I cannot understand why we cannot do that here.</P>
    <P>We have run into trouble with wheelie-bins in part of the area I live in because people cannot, or do not want to, bring them through their houses and drag them across nice clean kitchen and living room floors. Planning permission is not needed to have them in front of houses. This could be solved by having collection points fairly close to the houses. We should continue to improve the recycling of items other than glass. Although there are bring centres, it can be difficult to find them and better signposting of those is needed.</P>
    <P>Recovery programmes can mean not only an improvement in our environment, but also a reduction in costs of, for example, base metals. The successful continental collection of aluminium has led to a reduction in the price of bauxite.</P>
    <P>Composting will have to be dealt with on a communal basis and this is very important in the separation of our domestic waste. This Bill does not make sufficient provision for the separation of waste and what will be acceptable to go into waste. We need to thrash this out when we get to Committee Stage. For example, the issue of biodegradable waste is very important. We need to have a statement in law about that.</P>
    <P>I am interested to see that the Minister is putting himself in charge of the environment fund. I thought he had plenty to do without being in charge of that. There is provision for the setting up of a committee. I would have preferred a different name, for example, the waste management fund, and for it to be spent in a more direct way on minimising the amount of waste we produce and on meeting the cost of recycling. Calling it the environment fund is not a good idea. It would be better to have this as the fund of a national waste authority.</P>
    <P>The directive that must be fulfilled by the autumn defines the measures we need to take on liquid and hazardous waste. The Bill does not address these. In 1999, the EPA published a proposal for a national hazardous waste management plan. I have seen nothing more of that, but maybe I missed it.</P>
    <P>Waste is a very messy business and a difficult matter to deal with. The plastic bag issue was very well dealt with by Senator Quinn who pointed out that there are different sorts of plastic bags. The <Col N="143" /> plastic bags all of us are talking about are the sort that one is offered in a small retail store for one packet of crisps or a newspaper. The Bill as it is currently framed will not get it through to the consumers of those products that they are the ones paying the tax. It seems to me that either the retailer or the retail staff are responsible for the tax at present. The Bill should stipulate that the cost of the plastic bag tax appears on the customer's bill. This would mean that if one takes three plastic bags, the bill will feature a plastic bag tax of 45p after VAT. It is vital that this message gets through to the person at the end of the chain. The customer must know he is paying the tax so it must not be absorbed in the price of goods.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion regarding incineration. Senators are greatly concerned about the matter. My only concern is that we will build too many incinerators, because they are so handy for burning things. I would like to see only one incinerator built although I do not propose to find the site for the Minister. I suggest, however, that it is located on the east coast so that the prevailing wind will at least blow any emissions out to sea. I also suggest putting it near the area that produces the greatest pollution, which we all know is Dublin. The Dublin area would also produce the greatest number of objections and the greatest electoral effect. I look forward to seeing how that issue is addressed. The big problem with building multiple incinerators is that we will move up a stage from landfill to incineration in the belief that we can burn everything.</P>
    <P>There is great concern about air pollution and much has been said about its role in causing asthma. I recently read an interesting article on asthma comparing 12 year old boys in the Traveller community, many of whom lived in very substandard accommodation on the side of the road or on halting sites, with 12 year old boys in the settled community. It showed a much lower incidence of asthma in the 12 year old boys in the Traveller community. The suggestion was that central heating and too many carpets and curtains were important factors in the development of asthma. Particulate matter in the air from cars may be an even more important factor in the great increase in the incidence of asthma than running a modern incinerator.</P>
    <P>Dioxins can be reduced as well by lowering the amount of chlorine in waste. This would require the separation of the waste and the removal, in particular, of a huge amount of plastic. That might be a good idea. A certain amount of the environmental fund could be used to finance the separation of waste and recycling because these measures will cost us money.</P>

      <P>I am sorry about that. I will add a last few words. People have to pay for my advice a lot of the time, especially about asthma and similar matters.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about generating energy from waste and it does look very attractive. In relation to the production of dioxins from incinerators, I believe that they produce a temperature of between 700º and 1100º degrees Celsius, although I am sure the Minister's officials are much better informed than me on temperatures. The same amount of dioxins is produced during the cooling process when energy is retrieved but if we dispensed with energy retrieval, we could cool the incinerators more quickly and reduce dioxins by half. That needs to be taken into account when consideration is being given to retrieving energy.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the Minister has introduced this Bill, which is both too small and too big. I would like it to have been broader and to have taken the form of a national waste management Bill. It is too big from the point of view that it takes a lot away from local democracy. It will solve the situation for the moment, but I doubt its efficacy further down the line because we will have the same objectors with the same problems. Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for your indulgence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a very contentious Bill. There are two aspects to it, the separation of waste and waste management with all its implications and the separation of powers over waste management with all its implications. I will deal with the latter first.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision to remove local authorities from the decision-making process is a retrograde and autocratic step. Local authorities must strike rates every year and if they do not do so, the Minister has statutory power to abolish them. I understand that only three or four local authorities failed to adopt a waste management plan. In County Mayo where I come from, we adopted a plan after considerable debate. Now we find that the powers over waste management will be taken away from local authorities. I can tell the Minister that irrespective of what it says about the local representatives it elects every few years, the public has no faith or trust in the executive of local authorities. The transfer of powers within local authorities to the executive will create more opposition to proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that we in the local authorities have been debating the erosion of our powers for years. Now we have arrived at the situation where another element of our powers is being taken away in the name of a waste management plan with uncertain prospects of success. If implemented, much of the plan would go a long way towards alleviating current waste management problems. Having said that, I cannot overstate the importance of that aspect of the Bill <Col N="145" /> which erodes the powers of members of local authorities, who have been completely removed from the planning process. The public will soon ask what we are doing as members of local authorities. We do not have any function relating to waste management or planning. What will be the next area in which we will be deprived of power? Those questions are already being asked.</P>
    <P>We are light years behind the rest of Europe in our approach to waste management and the effective disposal of waste. I examined a state of the art complex in Groenigen in Holland dealing with the waste management problem in that province of some 500,000 people. It is very impressive to see state of the art equipment dealing with a modern problem. There was an incinerator there which was silent for the two days I was there. I was told only 9% of waste is incinerated. Their recycling processes are so good and effective that incineration has been reduced to that percentage. We also visited all the recycling and composting systems they had set up. It reinforced my view that we are light years behind and it is from that base we work.</P>
    <P>I visited the site in Kerry three years ago. Kerry County Council was first out of the traps in Ireland with the aid of £1.5 million to £1.6 million from Europe for a pilot scheme. I was impressed by the site and I am sure the council has leaped ahead of the rest of the country since in its approach to waste management. Senator Dan Kiely referred to the progress made in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is a question of starting and finishing. I have no great ideas on incineration because I do not have the technical knowledge nor have I read many of the reports on the pros and cons of incineration, although I have read some. I am sure the country can accommodate one incinerator located somewhere. Seán Dublin Bay Loftus discovered an island or rock adjacent to the coastline, and perhaps an incinerator could be located there. However, it is another matter whether we decide to proceed with an incinerator.</P>
    <P>There is a bad history and record of mismanagement of waste disposal in Ireland which has led to an atrocious mess being made in many counties. Thirty or 40 years ago, local authorities bought stretches of bog outside towns, usually the worst little hole they could find, and dumped rubbish there. No cover was placed on it originally because no topsoil was available. The refuse consequently blew around neighbouring parishes. About 20 years ago, we became conscious of the need to cover the refuse with clay at least to stop it from blowing away. Some of the more progressive local authorities built into their specifications for landfill care and maintenance the requirement that all refuse would be covered. Some operators did that and some did not. I have seen those landfill sites and was on one a few weeks ago. It has improved considerably since it was purchased 30 years ago. Nevertheless, what has built up in the public consciousness is an image of complete neg<Col N="146" /> lect and irresponsibility when it comes to local authorities dealing with waste. It will be difficult to remove that image from the public mind and have to focus it on the new technology and state of the art facilities available and working effectively throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I said previously that I visited Holland and was impressed with the progress they have made and with the attitude of people to recycling and waste disposal. I could not see any major problems. I spoke with people, visited them locally and visited local shops to see if there was any adverse reaction to this state of the art equipment being in their vicinity, and there was none.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a contentious issue on his hands. There is widespread public unease and concern about the direction waste management systems are taking. This may be due to a lack of appreciation of what is available, and the public must be informed, as opposed to educated, as to what is available and what the ultimate result will be. I have reservations about incineration and serious reservations about the separation of powers in implementing these proposals.</P>
    <P>The levy on plastic bags is unworkable. The Minister should have the courage to abolish plastic bags completely and let people and retailers deal with the issue. I can see a myriad of problems with charging 15p per bag. Neither the public nor retailers will accept it. It is not viable for a retailer to buy bags at that cost. The answer is to abolish all plastic bags.</P>
    <P>There are many good elements in the Bill as well as many bad ones. I have dealt with many of the bad ones. The Government has done a poor job of public relations by failing to inform the public, and there is such a legacy of mistrust and neglect in this area that it will take a long time to refocus the public on the new art form of dealing with waste. The Government has a major task on its hands. I, along with my party, will vote against the negative measures in the Bill, especially the removal of powers from local authorities which is a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation, and the Minister and his Department are to be commended on finally tackling a problem which is getting out of hand. The country is being swamped with a mountain of waste, and all our protestations about this being a green and clean island which attracts tourists and produces green and clean food are empty rhetoric in the context of what we see in the countryside and in towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met an American tourist by chance last year when on holiday in the west. He was a senior executive in one of the multinational companies located in Ireland. I asked him his impressions of the country. He was very impressed by Ireland, by our economic performance, the quality of the countryside and the friendliness of the people. However, there were two things he could not come to terms with, the amount of smoke in public houses and the amount of litter in the country<Col N="147" /> side. I told him I did not think there was much I could do about the smoke in public houses because that is almost a cultural institution but that I hoped we could do something about the litter. I have just come back from a weekend trip to the west and there is nowhere, not even the most remote places, where plastic bags are not in evidence, not just black plastic from silage covers, which is plentiful, but the bags from local supermarkets, take-aways and so on. They can be seen in the most beautiful and remote places. Something must be done to deal with that and with how we regulate waste and waste disposal.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for dealing with that and with the question of devolved powers to which many speakers have referred. As a member of a local authority I can say with certainty that, without exception, where powers have been devolved to them, they will not use them. Powers were devolved to local authorities in respect of taxis and hackneys. My local authority considered this for months on end and would not make a decision. No local authority members will say they want an incinerator in their area &ndash; without exception that applies to every local authority. That being the case, and given that this is a national problem, we must have a nationally-based solution. If local authorities are not prepared to take the responsibility and tackle the problem head on, the Minister is right to do what he has done. The problem requires a national response, a national hands-on policy. Our reputation as a tourism centre, as a source of clean food and with a clean environment is at stake and is being irreparably damaged by what is going on at the moment.</P>
    <P>According to what I call Dardis's law, which I have enunciated on several occasions at local authority meetings, the average family travelling in the average motor car at average speed consumes one take-away while travelling a mile and a half. My residence is a mile and half from the town of Newbridge, and I was able to test that hypothesis on Christmas Eve last by collecting from the roadside hedge in a large plastic refuse sack all the waste from the take-away which had been deposited along a stretch of about 150 yards outside my premises. I half-filled the bag with plastic bottles, styrofoam containers, McDonald's drinks containers, cigarette packages and other nondescript items, some of which it would probably be better not to describe.</P>
    <P>There seems to be total rejection of any degree of personal responsibility in this matter. It is regarded as the Government's responsibility to clean up the mess. However, the mess should not be allowed in the first place. That is why the Minister is right to increase fines for litter louts. It would be no harm if litter wardens could go outside the towns and villages where they operate effectively and into the countryside to stop cars and fine people on the spot in the same way as is <Col N="148" /> done in relation to speeding and other motoring offences.</P>
    <P>The so-called tax on plastic bags is a step in the right direction. Rather than banning plastic bags there should be a disincentive to their use that is powerful enough to encourage people to find other ways of carrying their groceries home. It is done in America where paper bags are used. In France it would be very unusual to see anybody using plastic bags. People bring shopping bags to the shop. They do that because there is a compelling reason to do it, a financial incentive or a financial disincentive. I welcome the measures that have been taken in this respect. Every Sunday morning when I go to my local newsagent, the very helpful assistant behind the counter offers me a plastic bag for my newspaper, which I refuse, but when I come back on the following Sunday the same assistant, out of a desire to be helpful, again offers me a plastic bag and, once again, I refuse. What the Minister is proposing is correct.</P>
    <P>No matter what system of waste disposal we have, landfill, incineration or other, there will be pollutants. It is the nature of waste disposal that there will be some side effect. We need to ask ourselves which is the least damaging to the environment. In my experience the most damaging is landfill. There is a large landfill site near the town of Kilcullen, Silliot Hill, which is operated by Kildare County Council. It is within a mile and a half of the River Liffey, which is a source of drinking water. A few years ago people had to be evacuated from houses within a few hundred yards of it because gases being produced by the landfill got into the fissures in the rocks and leaked into the houses. The people in question had to stay out of their homes for a considerable amount of time and, subsequently, the local authority had to buy those houses. Now the gases are flared off and, if the wind is in the right direction, it is possible to smell them from three or four miles away. Are we saying that is a desirable way of disposing of waste? It is not. It would be preferable to do it by incineration.</P>
    <P>Everything I hear about international standards suggests that the degree of harmful emissions from incineration is very low or non-existent and that modern plants can be operated at very high temperatures without serious risk to the environment or to individuals. However, if one tries to sell that message at a public meeting, people are not prepared to listen. They trot out some expert from America or somewhere else, brought in at great expense to make the counter-argument and people who are not technically as expert as they are have difficulty in refuting their argument. It comes back to the precautionary principle. It is easy to claim that there is something in the air that will cause damage, but it is very difficult to rebut that claim. It is similar to the argument about nuclear energy. If it is suggested that nuclear energy is safe, all one needs to do is suggest the possibility that something <Col N="149" /> might go wrong and, automatically, everybody will be against that option. Incidentally, I am not and never have been in favour of nuclear energy. I use the example merely to demonstrate that it is easy to find a vehicle for suggesting that something should not happen. It just goes on and on, the situation gets worse and the waste mounts up.</P>
    <P>A distinction needs to be made between harmful waste and waste in general. I have never heard anybody mention incinerators which were not toxic waste incinerators. To most people, all incinerators are toxic waste incinerators. There is a huge difference between a toxic waste incinerator and a waste incinerator, but that distinction never seems to be made when it comes to an argument about it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the gases that emerge from landfill sites and the groundwater pollution that takes place. We line landfill sites, but it is only recently that we started to do that. Within very close proximity to the Silliot Hill landfill site, there is another which is operated by a private company called KTK. Only commercial waste goes into that, rubble and so on, but not organic matter from households. Nevertheless, it is a model of how such facilities should be run.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the assistant county manager of Kildare County Council what the greatest potential source of foot and mouth disease in the county was, but he could not say. I suggested that it was the landfill site in Silliot Hill because one very stormy day not long ago, the cover of the landfill was not properly put in place overnight and litter and rubbish were blown all over the place. When one thinks of what goes into a landfill site, including waste meat, by-products and other bits and pieces, that was the biggest potential source of a foot and mouth outbreak, yet it never occurred to anybody. Everybody thinks that one has to walk on a farm to spread foot and mouth, but the way in which the landfill site at Silliot Hill in County Kildare was being mismanaged was a potential source of the disease.</P>
    <P>It is a huge disappointment that the recycling of newspapers has been so unsuccessful. As I understand it, by far the largest single element going into landfill, not only in terms of volume but also of waste, are waste paper products, including cartons. If we could tackle that issue it would have a huge impact in reducing the volumes concerned.</P>
    <P>I bring my empty bottles to Kildare County Council's recycling site which is an easy facility to use. Many such recycling facilities are not visible, however. I was coming through Mountbellew the other morning and I saw a good example of how such a facility should be sign-posted. It is located on the side of the main road approaching Mountbellew, so no one entering of leaving the town could be in any doubt as to where the recycling plant is.</P>

      <P>It is an example that such facilities must be visible, readily accessible to the public and properly maintained. One such recycling facility is located in the car park of a local supermarket near my home, but after Christmas one would not want to have dumped waste there because it was overflowing.</P>
      <P>Illegal dumping must be tackled. I could cite several examples where dumps continue to be operated illegally. The local authority and the Environmental Protection Agency seem to bounce the ball back and forth to one another, and probably also to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, yet the dumping goes on and on. Injunctions are served, yet they do not seem to be complied with. The illegal dumping appears to be interminable and I do not understand why that is the case.</P>
      <P>While it is symptomatic of the national disease, the River Liffey is regarded by local authorities, and perhaps even by the Government, as a source of drinking water for Dublin City and a place to dump waste. In other words, we take as much water as we can from the head waters of the Liffey, thus reducing the flow in the river with all the environmental impact that has on natural habitats. We then erect a sewage treatment works and put phosphate-rich effluent from those works into the water. We then take more water out in Leixlip and expect people in Dublin to drink that after the phosphates have been put in at Naas. There may have been a time when there were reasons for doing that, as the population was lower and the loads were fewer, but I do not understand why it happens any more.</P>
      <P>I know where the water can be obtained, and I have said so on many occasions. It was not until the consultants reported on the greater Dublin water supply that it was acknowledged that the water could come from the Shannon. We can at last achieve de Valera's dream by draining the Shannon.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear speakers on the Government side of the House talking about such <Col N="151" /> a positive use for the River Shannon and the cleanliness of its waters. I agree completely with the points Senator Dardis made about the Liffey, and the same things could be said about the River Shannon. These include the lack of waste water treatment plants and the way in which effluent enters the river at one point while drinking water is taken from it elsewhere. It is simply unacceptable and must cause great damage to people's health.</P>
      <P>As a teacher I must say that we have failed as a nation to educate people in managing their own waste. The debate on waste management is the best possible reflection of the lack of personal responsibility, the intrusion of the State in people's affairs and people's inability to take decisions for themselves. I have often asked myself how I would deal with waste management. I would stop all waste collections for six months to make every household responsible for its own waste. In that way we would see how they tackled waste disposal by taking soundings each month. If people recognised the extent of the problem they might also be more amenable to accepting appropriate, practical and healthy methods of dealing with it. There is no completely acceptable method of dealing with waste because it is filthy, and neither is there a culture of dealing with it in this country.</P>
      <P>I could replicate all the examples cited by Senator Dardis. Our house is one and a half miles from the main road. On a recent trip from the local shop to our house, my wife managed to fill a bin-liner bag with 40 bottles, 40 cans and as many discarded food containers from take-away outlets. Our hedges and ditches are weekly recipients of old beds, television sets, chests and cars. On many occasions I have gone through the waste trying to find to whom it belonged. Once I had the great pleasure of loading it all into the boot of my car before dumping it into somebody's front garden whence it had come in the first place. More people should respond like that because illegal dumping is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Politicians, including all of us, have not covered themselves in any great glory in addressing this issue. Local charges have been confused with personal and constitutional rights, and there has been much high minded vocabulary attached to the debate. If something has a price on it, however, it cannot be related to a principle. People who talk on the one hand about a major principle and the cost of it on the other hand are contradicting themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recycling is not impacting on Irish culture. It is not happening because people are not practising it. Some reasons have been advanced as to why this is. Fingal County Council has gone to much trouble to put recycling points in that area but unfortunately they are not used at the busiest times of the year. In the week after Christmas I drove across the country and saw that every recycling point was overcrowded with bottles. <Col N="152" /> Therefore, the recycling service was not matching the peak demands at that period. Schools have tried to get young children interested in recycling and there is no doubt that there is a better recycling culture among youngsters than among older people. It is rare to see older persons taking a strong stand on waste, including cans and plastic bags. We have a huge job before us in making people aware of this.</P>
    <P>Given the choice of an incinerator or a landfill in my back yard, I would opt for an incinerator. I have read all the things that can be done with landfills but I have never seen them in operation. There are occasions during the year when weather conditions will scatter landfill waste to the four winds. This can be seen everywhere and it happens repeatedly. Ideally, I would like to see an incinerator to which waste could be drawn by rail. There would be a dropping off point away from that to where the waste would be brought on covered rail carriages into an incinerator. The facility would be spread out over a number of areas and would be seen to be a clean facility in that way.</P>
    <P>The question of the local authorities is a crucial one. We have to have a national system of waste management. There can be no other way of dealing with this issue. It has to be European but as far as we are concerned the State has to have a national policy which has to be implemented locally. How does that interface with local democracy? Local democracy is about giving people power locally which should be discharged locally and which should be responsible. Everybody will agree on that point but the next point is also important. If the local authority does not discharge its responsibilities, then somebody has to intervene. I disagree with the Minister's approach but I do not disagree with what he is trying to achieve. I ask him to listen carefully to different views.</P>
    <P>I am not 100% sure of the precise interpretation of the legislation as it stands but it appears to me, although I stand to be corrected and I will listen carefully to the Minister's response at the end of Second Stage, the Minister is saying that because a number of local authorities are not taking the decision which they should take, he is intervening in the plan for the whole country and is therefore taking responsibility back from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would accept one of two things. I would accept the Minister intervening to put in place that part of the national plan at a local level on which the local authority has refused to take a decision. In other words, where the local authority has not taken on responsibility and has not put its piece of the jigsaw in place, the Minister should and could intervene at that stage. I do not believe anyone can disagree with that. I would go further and equate the importance of that with the importance of striking a rate. I would even go as far as to say that this is a national issue and where a local authority did not come up with a <Col N="153" /> plan which was compatible with the national policy and which is part of the European plan, it should stand threatened with dissolution. In other words, somebody would have to take control of the authority at that stage. To me the situation is that serious.</P>
    <P>There are people at local level playing the lowest form of politics with this issue. I do not say that about anyone in this House. Listening to the debate I hear absolute conviction on both sides of the House and I do not want anything I say to be a criticism of earlier speakers. I disagree with points that people make but I have heard much passion in the debate. That is good and I hope we can move the argument forward in a democratic way but I ask the Minister to re-examine his proposed method of intervention. Let us see how much consensus we can find and if we can agree that every local authority should take a decision and accept responsibility and, where they do not do that, that the Minister should then intervene. We can then decide on the form of the intervention. If we got to that point we would be disagreeing on much narrower ground. To move the argument along to that point would be a politically responsible approach to try to bring the sides closer together and then argue about the form of intervention. We should also recognise that many local authorities have taken difficult decisions in this area, and they deserve to be singled out and praised for doing what was required of them.</P>
    <P>There is now an opportunity to do that in the few days before Committee Stage is taken. That is one of the reasons we asked for some time between both Stages. I ask the Minister to consider moving forward with cross-party support for intervention but not the form of intervention he has in mind in this legislation. If I have misinterpreted the legislation I look forward to being corrected in his response to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to the argument. We need to have a waste management policy and that policy has to be implemented at local level. There can be many things in between but there has to be a national policy and it has to be implemented locally. Where national policy is implemented locally, it is the best form of participatory democracy. The Minister has responsibilities nationally and they go in two directions. He has to look to Europe in one direction and locally in the other. He has to be the bridge in between. Having done that we then ask the local authorities to put in place their policies. They take the decisions that are required of them and having done that, the pieces of the national plan jigsaw fall into place. We then get to those recalcitrant local authorities which do not discharge their responsibilities, and everyone would agree the Minister should intervene at that stage. That is my point. There surely would be agreement across all parties and Independents on that point.</P>
    <P>How and under what conditions should the Minister intervene? There does not need to be <Col N="154" /> bloodshed but we have to recognise what has been done correctly by those authorities which have taken the decision and then determine how to deal with those who have not done that. The way to deal with them should be to intervene in those authorities and, if necessary, dissolve them because I do not want to give sustenance to elected public representatives who believe they need not take an unpopular decision but who are then rewarded for that. Neither do I want a situation, which I understand is in this legislation, where people who have taken responsible decisions and who will suffer to some extent locally and electorally as a result, have all that hard work and decision making set aside by the Minister. That is not necessary. I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</P>
    <P>The lack of a culture of recycling, the lack of understanding of how we deal with our waste and the lack of personal responsibility need to be tackled. That is not being done. In terms of local authorities, there is a strong case for having charges for the management of waste, otherwise people will believe it is somebody else's problem. That could be done in a fair way. It is not necessary to charge everyone; perhaps every household would be entitled to a certain amount of free collection and pay for anything in addition to that. There are many ways of dealing with this issue but there has to be some element of personal responsibility. There has to be an element of national policy, local implementation and education, all of which would bring some kind of cultural change to our attitude to waste. I look forward to the Minister's response at the end of Second Stage and I hope he will be open to modifications of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation. In one sense it is welcome but there are sections that are most unwelcome. As a member of a local authority I am aware that this is a divisive issue at local level. There are a number of issues on which no political kudos can be gained by anybody in dealing with the questions of waste disposal, landfill sites or halting sites for the travelling community. These issues raise a lot of hackles and cause much contention. Local public representatives, and the majority of local authorities, have taken responsibility and made difficult decisions which in some cases would affect them electorally.</P>
      <P>Unlike some other speakers, I believe that things are not as they are perceived to be. The attitude of the community at large to waste disposal over the past decade or so has improved dramatically. Because of the increases in consumerism and regulations on packaging, often emanating from European, dictating that items be wrapped, most of them in plastic, the amount of waste generated has increased dramatically. Regulations prescribe packaging for hygiene purposes, but its disposal becomes a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> There are different kinds of waste, domestic, commercial and industrial, and these categories have to be dealt with in separate ways. However, the bulk of waste generated is domestic and there is a need for an educative approach to be adopted. Segregation and recycling have not been promoted in any significant way. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is remiss in relation to providing incentives to local authorities to promote and support segregation and recycling.</P>
    <P>I have seen different attitudes to waste disposal, particularly in Europe, and I also have had access to holiday homes which Europeans frequent. It is extraordinary that when a European, particularly from Germany or France, leaves a holiday home they leave very little waste after them. One finds one bag containing nothing but bottles, another containing nothing but papers, and only a small shopping bag of real waste that cannot be recycled. We need to educate and encourage people to segregate their waste in this way in their homes. This could be done very easily because people do appreciate the problem that is arising. Because of the debate on waste disposal, they are conscious of the difficulties they are generating in every county. It is important that this issue is addressed.</P>
    <P>Commercial waste has caused a lot of problems, for retailers in particular, concerning packaging and cardboard and the refusal of local authorities to take this kind of waste from them. A buoyant economy generates this waste but it has to be disposed of. There is a real need for serious policy to be developed on segregation and recycling. We have had a situation where the recycling industry has not found it possible to survive economically. If this is the case, there is an onus on the Department of the Environment and Local Government to provide financial incentives to attract people into this industry so that they can make a living. We have a plastic bottle recycling facility in this country but all the bottles it recycles have to be imported. That is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The issue of industrial waste has to be monitored very closely. We just seem to apply the European regulations, but the reality is that we will have to deal with it at a national level. The Minister and various speakers mentioned incinerators. At this stage, we are so far removed from even considering incineration. We must consider more basic approaches first. An incinerator should only be considered when all other approaches have been examined and utilised. Until this is done, our credibility will be seriously in question. It is imperative that we adopt a proactive approach immediately.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be living in an age in which democracy is being devolved to the people and the powers of local government are being strengthened. This legislation is attempting to reduce the powers of local public representatives. Section 4 is one of the most draconian measures <Col N="156" /> I have ever seen come before either House of the Oireachtas. Not only does it give the Minister specific powers in relation to enhancing executive function concerning the putting in place of a waste management plan, but it will remain a reserved function for four years after being passed, even if the local councillors do not agree that the manager can go ahead with such a plan. This is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Just because a number of local authorities have yet to reach an agreement does not mean that the Minister should come in here with that kind of draconian legislation. I believe it would be more appropriate for the Minister to consult the councillors and management in the local authorities in order to reach a consensus rather than treat the local representatives so badly. Anybody who has served on a local authority recognises the difficulties that public representatives face and the courage that the majority of them require when dealing with these issues. Public representatives recognise that responsibilities come with elections, some of which involve making choices on issues that will actually affect the local community and, in some instances, annoy certain members thereof. The Minister should be condemned for including this section in the Bill and insulting the majority of public representatives who have made decisions and taken on responsibilities. I hope that the Minister will address this issue at Committee Stage and recognise that this is not the ideal solution to the problem. This section gives such power to the manager that local public representatives might as well not exist. That is unacceptable because they represent the community.</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to establish a landfill site, transfer site or whatever, the Minister is going over people's heads and I hope he will see the error in his ways. If he intends to go down this route, the final decision should rest with him following an appeal system in relation to a manager's decision. To give such authority to one manager is extremely questionable, particularly when one realises from whom the manager will obtain directions. I refer here to consultants.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council employed consultants who addressed meetings, presented recommendations about a number of proposed landfill sites, reached conclusions, did wonderful things and were paid, I am sure, handsome fees. I acknowledge that consultants have a certain level of expertise in their chosen areas, but they are not accountable. Consultants will advise managers to take particular courses of action. Therefore, managers will take the advice of faceless people while public representatives will be completely ignored. That is not democracy. Such behaviour runs contrary to the democratic ethos and it does nothing in terms of supporting local democracy or strengthening the role of local public representatives. It is also a serious insult to members of local communities, particularly in terms of making known their views and having them put forward <Col N="157" /> by their local representatives. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and see the error in what he is proposing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the generalities of the Bill, we know that the Minister is accountable to the EU and must comply with various regulations and directives. However, we should not have to wait for the introduction of directives. Taking a common sense approach would provide us with an idea of how to proceed. We should be able to initiate measures without being obliged to wait for the appearance of directives. I hope the Minister will take such an approach in the future.</P>
    <P>Various views have been expressed during this debate. One Member said that waste is a filthy thing with which to deal. I do not believe that is the case. If managed properly, waste is not a filthy thing with which to deal because over 75% to 80% of waste can be recycled. Only 15% of waste is filthy and must be disposed of either at landfill sites or in some other way. We must reconsider the way we view waste. This reconsideration must begin in people's homes and be carried on into schools, factories, industrial estates and so on. That is a fundamental point.</P>
    <P>We do not take a proactive approach in terms of educating people about waste management. However, I take this opportunity to congratulate primary schools, a number of which are situated in my constituency, which have been very active in raising the consciousness of pupils in relation to waste and the environment. As a result, many young people are extremely conscious of the need to protect the environment and manage waste properly. If that was done on a wider basis in secondary schools and beyond, the future citizens of this country will be prepared to address the issue of waste disposal and management in a responsible way and there will be no need for draconian provisions such as those contained in section 4. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and to withdraw that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal one could say about this Bill which would be intensely political in nature and I am sure I will do so later. However, I wish to begin by outlining what I say to students I teach on the issue of the future of our environment. The first question I usually ask is &ldquo;What is waste?&rdquo;  That answer is that, ultimately, everything is waste. In my opinion waste is anything a company or an individual cannot sell. Another definition is that waste is anything one has to pay someone to remove. However, it is worth recalling that recycling or reusing materials merely extends their lifetime. Everything humans eat, drink and use eventually becomes waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most incorrect use of language ever employed by humanity relates to the concept of consumption or consumer goods. We do not consume such goods, we merely consume the service they provide and, when we are finished, <Col N="158" /> dump them. It is the basic law of science &ndash; subject only to the rules of nuclear physics &ndash; that not a microgram of matter can be destroyed. We do not have any option with waste but to accept that it exists and try to do what we can about it. That is an important concept because for many years we were encouraged by economists to live in a world where waste was a free good. We were led to believe that the Earth was an infinite planet which could infinitely absorb everything for which we had no further use. If one reads some of the better and more farsighted economics textbooks, one will discover an admission that conventional economics led us up a false path where we could have infinitely growing consumption at zero cost. However, what no one mentioned was what is referred to in my profession as the &ldquo;mass valence&rdquo;, namely, that everything that is consumed must emerge as waste. Even more waste may be produced than what was consumed, depending on the treatment involved.</P>
    <P>It should, therefore, come as no surprise that we are in the throes of a waste crisis. Affluence, comparative in the past but now absolute by any international standard, brings with it the generation of vast quantities of waste unless a philosophical change takes place in society. Such a change has not yet taken place. Philosophical changes occur in two ways &ndash; either as a result of a grass roots movement or through leadership. The grass roots philosophical change that has happened in this country is an increasing distrust of what people used to refer to as &ldquo;authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The alternative form of leadership occurs at national level. The rhetoric has always been wonderful and everyone is aware of the need to reduce, reuse and recycle, treatment disposal, etc. However, what has been done about the reduction of the generation of waste? For example, there has been a building boom in this country for the past seven years which has led to the generation of vast quantities of rubble. Virtually all of this rubble was dumped at landfill sites. Other civilised countries insist that such material should be reused in subsequent building programmes but we decided that we did not need to follow suit. We were either too rich or too lazy, but we let the building companies off the hook by stating that we would dig large holes into which they could dump their rubble and that they would only be charged a modest fee for this service and not inconvenienced to any great degree. We should have been more attentive, particularly when one realises that 40% of municipal solid waste is produced by the building industry.</P>
    <P>What did we do in past six years in terms of reducing packaging and investigating the composition of consumer goods to make it possible to reuse them? What action did we take in respect of containers? Did we follow the example of our colleagues in Denmark who campaigned for a ban on beer cans and other cans and tried to have them replaced with bottles which could be reused <Col N="159" /> five or six times and in respect of which a significant deposit would be paid on return? The answer is that we did not. Nor did we support our Nordic colleagues when they wanted to take such action. We uttered the rhetoric but we did nothing. We did not do what should have been done when we could see that we were rapidly colliding with the buffers and that the train would come to a sudden and unpleasant halt if we did not take action. This is separate from the Bill to which I will return.</P>
    <P>For a long time at national, industrial and local authority levels we assumed it would wish itself away. There were individuals who believed differently but they believed it was simple. They believed we should build two, three or four huge incinerators and then carry on as before. I do not share many of the hostilities of others to incineration. Perhaps that is because I am a chemical engineer and I believe we can do these things properly. I would not have any problem living beside a properly run incinerator. I would have considerable problems living beside a landfill site because it is not properly run. However, I am sceptical about whether the political climate exists in which the type of trust could be generated and people would accept one. We have not been prepared to argue with the intensity and conviction of those who produce patchy dubious evidence about the risks involved and who do a con job in many cases in using half of a comparative risk. There is nothing without a risk. If someone wants to eliminate the generation of unpleasant toxins, he or she should use a bicycle because the car he or she drives will pump noxious material into the atmosphere, particularly particulate waste which will destroy the lungs of many people over a lifetime. I do not have a problem with incineration, although there is a political problem about it.</P>
    <P>The problem of waste cannot be resolved by ignoring it at national level and either telling local authority members, individually or collectively, they must solve it or handing over the power to people who are not democratically accountable. Many speakers have adverted to the fact that we must have popular consent not for the difficult part of it but for the whole concept of the segregation of waste at source for domestic users, for a redesign of the way in which businesses transfer goods and services to customers and for a re-evaluation of the quantity of packing and packaging we take home from a supermarket every week and in the manufacture of consumer goods so they are maximally capable of being recycled where they cannot be reused. There are EU directives in this regard. However, it is about time we in this country, which will in the next two years become the second richest country in Europe in terms of <i>per capita</i> GDP, realised we can no longer follow the compromise positions of European directives and that we must be leaders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> We must recognise it is not cheap to protect our environment from waste. That is not to advocate huge charges for the disposal of domestic waste but to ensure the enforcement of high standards at every level of the supply chain. Sectors cannot be left out of this process. The two sectors which have done the most damage to our waterways, agriculture and local authorities, cannot be left out. One of the great myths is that industry is the cause of many of our problems. However, that is not the case. If one examines the figures for fish kills year after year, one will discover that local authorities and farmers have killed more fish than industry.</P>
    <P>There is a legitimate fear about what is happening in terms of waste. Good politics would dictate that we try to understand those fears and deal with them rather than saying that because people who are accountable to those who are afraid will not deal with the issue, people who are not accountable to them can be made to deal with it. The fundamental issue is that our citizens are so frightened of what will happen to them they will not accept it. We are saying that because we have failed to convince them this is the correct way to proceed, we will now force it down their throats. However, that will not work because the level of popular resistance would become stronger and many of those to whom these powers are now being given have a patchy record of sensitivity either to environmental concerns or to public opinion. One example is the much discussed holiday home development in Courtown Harbour in Wexford. The local authority now admits it gave planning permission for it knowing that neither the water nor the sewage treatment services was adequate.</P>
    <P>There is a long list of such cases. The Minister of State knows about the resistance of the officials in Cork Corporation to the disclosure of a consultant's report on the operation of the landfill on Kinsale Road. It took a section 4 threat from the members of the corporation before they were told what the consultants had said. One cannot win popular consent within that ethos, which has not gone.</P>
    <P>There is a democratic alternative. The principle about waste has always been that one owns one's own waste. The basic application of that would be that if local authorities, collectively or individually, do not agree a proper waste management plan on a regional basis, each local authority is responsible for the waste within its own boundary and cannot move it outside it. If the Minister told every local authority, including the one in this city which has the convenience of dumping a large proportion of its waste in the neighbouring county, it had to deal with the problem within its own area of responsibility, its constituents would suddenly realise the alternative to dealing with waste is worse than any of the so-called threats of which they are afraid. However, as long as people believe there will be a solution which involves exporting everyone's waste to <Col N="161" /> somewhere else, two-thirds of the people will agree and the people somewhere else will vigorously resist on environmental and transport grounds. There must be a negotiated agreement. Giving excessive or draconian powers, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, to unelected officials will not win consent. This will not work without consent. It is not like Travellers' halting sites because it is too big and expensive and it impacts on too many people. It should be rethought even at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Bill and with the Minister's attitude. I deplore the Minister's decision to take powers away from local authority members and to hand them over to county managers. The Minister said that the &ldquo;failure, until relatively recently, to develop comprehensive strategies for the modernisation of waste management services has left us with an unenviable legacy&rdquo;. The Minister should accept responsibility for what he said in his speech. For years we looked for debate on waste management. The Minister's speech and actions are built around incineration. This is the wrong approach. As a country, we did little or nothing to develop recycling.</P>
      <P>This is proved by the company on the Cavan-Meath border which recycles plastic bottles but must import 95% of them from other European countries. In other words, Ireland is Europe's dumping ground for plastic bottles. The Government turned a blind eye to this.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister is at the end of his term, in his final few months, definitely the final 12 months of office&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;he realises that he did nothing about the biggest problem facing the country, waste management. Local authorities received no funding for it. The Government, year after year, gave nothing to develop recycling, waste management plans or anything else. Regional policies were set up by consultants who said we will have a recycling unit here, an incinerator there and so forth, with no funds and no prospect of them.</P>
      <P>Suddenly, when the Minister realises that his back is against the wall to do something about the waste problem, he drafts a rough Bill, introduces it in the Dáil and tries to rush it through this House. The Bill is to put a waste management plan in place by handing over all the control to county managers and set up incinerators throughout the country. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>If we have incinerators, local authorities will send lorry loads of waste to them. It costs money to keep them going, so there will be no incentive of any kind to recycle. That is the end product. The incinerators must be kept going. This is the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy is to develop around recycling. The Government should establish recycling programmes which are profitably funded. Nobody <Col N="162" /> today will go into recycling because it is not profitable. There is no market for recycled paper products. The only market is for plastic bottles, and 95% have to be imported. The Government developed nothing. Its answer now is a waste management Bill and a policy to hand over power to the county managers and put incinerators in place to burn rubbish. I am disappointed in the Minister.</P>
    <P>In Canada, many provinces over the past five years have achieved 70% recycling. The onus is on local authorities to put charges in place which ring-fences the money to develop small recycling industries. What is left is incinerated. Provinces with bigger populations than here have one incinerator. There is no reason we cannot implement such policies. We did not do so and the Minister is at the back of the field in the race, trying to get to the front before he faces the electorate. That is his problem. This is not the only Bill he is having trouble with. There is the local government Bill also. He does not know what to do with that and he is running out of time. He has promised the sun, moon and stars to us as local authority representatives and elected representatives in the Oireachtas and to the public as well as to local authority representative groups, the Local Authority Members Association and the General Council of County Councils. Yet he has delivered nothing. That is why he is rushing through this Bill to take powers from local authority members and give them to county managers and to build incinerators.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in the Bill and the attitude towards waste management. A lot more could be done. Recycling should be given a proper chance. Incentives should be put in place. Grant aid should be available to recycling businesses. We should have a proper national recycling policy.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I thank Senators for their contributions. The primary objective is to have all the waste management plans made as soon as possible. The process was under way in some cases for over four years. We must implement them quickly to deliver a modern waste management infrastructure and improve services. Our waste arisings grow at a conservatively estimated rate of 3% to 4% annually. At the same time there is an increasing scarcity of disposal options as landfill facilities reach the end of their lifespan.</P>
    <P>The Government is facing its responsibilities in bringing forward this legislation to allow implementation of the plans. The Minister rejects suggestions that the proposals are an attack on local democracy. It is proposed to make the least number of changes necessary to bring the current waste management planning process to a satisfactory conclusion. The changes will affect only the small number of local authorities who failed to make a waste management plan, or which pur<Col N="163" /> ported to make a plan but whose decision was invalid by virtue of qualifications imposed.</P>
    <P>The variation or replacement of a waste management plan remains a reserve function and will revert to the elected members after four years so as to allow a five year review as required. My belief in local democracy is as strong as ever. The Minister worked continually over the past three years to drive forward a major programme of local renewal, including the current Local Government Bill, 2000.</P>
    <P>However, he believes that the role of the modern local council must be one of leadership. Sometimes it is necessary to look beyond the parish horizons and make decisions for the benefit of the broader community. As the Minister with ultimate responsibility for waste policy and sound national waste management, he must take tough decisions to ensure that there are no further delays in the provision of modern national waste management infrastructure. This is essential if we are to meet our national and EU commitments.</P>
    <P>Many of the contributions against the measure centred on the proposals for thermal treatment in the regional plans. The EPA, which is statutory and independent in the performance of its functions, considers that municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards and incorporating energy recovery, is environmentally preferable to landfill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd stated that the Department of the Environment and Local Government paid for a German expert, Professor Dieter Schrenk, to speak to local authorities in the north-east. In fact Louth County Council invited Professor Schrenk to address a workshop for local councillors. Professor Schrenk is a medical doctor, a professor of food chemistry and environmental toxicology, a recognised expert in his field and has previously been involved with the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd referred selectively to a paper given by Professor Schrenk to the effect that there would be emissions by pollutants from an incineration facility. Of course there would be, but the issue is the levels of the emissions and their likely implications. Professor Schrenk pointed out that European authorities, including the national board of physicians in Germany, have addressed this issue. Based on strict regulatory controls that apply and actual emissions data, and taking into account modern incineration and flue-gas cleaning technology, many authorities have come to the conclusion that this type of waste treatment is not harmful to the environment or to those living in the vicinity of a modern incinerator.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd asked the Minister to request the Health Research Board to conduct a desk survey of available data and information regarding the public health implications of incineration and other waste treatment options. The Senator, with Deputy John Bruton, recently asked the Minister <Col N="164" /> for Health and Children to commission such a study through the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was informed that the Health Research Board is an independent statutory body which can promote, commission, assist and conduct research and disperse funds for specific health and epidemiological research projects. The board decides, on the basis of submissions made to it, what projects are to be assisted or funded. The Senator and his party can make a submission to the board if they wish.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government would have no difficulty with the Health Research Board funding or conducting such a study. He is prepared to consider commissioning a report which would attempt to summarise existing literature on the environmental and public health impacts of thermal treatments. I fear that the independence of any such consultants appointed by our Department, and the veracity of their findings, would be inevitably questioned.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd quoted from the fifth report of a House of Commons select committee on the United Kingdom's waste strategy. The report concluded that arguments about the health effects of thermal treatment are complex and based on incomplete knowledge. It criticised past regulatory enforcement and practices which have raised public anxiety levels and pointed out that lack of pre-separation of potentially hazardous materials increases the risk of exceeding emission limits. I do not wish to comment on past regulatory performance in another jurisdiction, but I have confidence in our Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the report accepts that incineration, properly regulated and on a scale which does not limit recycling, has a role to play in the management of post-recycled waste. There will be an increase in the amount of waste incinerated in the United Kingdom, according to the report, so it is important that the implications of incineration are more effectively explained to the public. This is a point that I have already conceded and have indicated will be addressed in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd referred at length to a specific company which is developing gasification technology, and to problems which occurred at its German facility. We hold no brief for this company, but have observed that the technical feasibility study referred to by the Senator indicated that gasification is an emerging technology which may have environmental benefits, as yet unproven. The study stated that incineration was proven to be environmentally acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh observed that an incinerator has a lifespan of about 20 years while a landfill could be closed down at any time if a better alternative came along. I remind him that landfills require a minimum of 30 years of aftercare and monitoring <Col N="165" /> under the landfill directive. The strict control regime in the recently adopted European Council directive on the incineration of waste was largely anticipated under the licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA may not grant a licence unless it is satisfied the activity involved will not jeopardise human health or the environment. Such facilities are also subject to development control under the planning system, which provides a formal procedure for public input into the decision making process.</P>
    <P>The European Commission estimates that the implementation of the new directive will result in 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration relative to the period between 1993 and 1995. The Commission also expects the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to be reduced to 0.03% of overall dioxins in Europe, assuming output from other sources remains unchanged. This is an indication of the significant improvements that have been made in emission control technologies compared with older waste incinerators.</P>
    <P>Thermal treatment plays a significant part in the safe disposal of waste in many European countries, including Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, countries generally recognised as having enlightened and progressive environmental policies. Other methods of waste disposal are necessary even where recycling is maximised. The Minister is satisfied that emissions from any proposed new thermal treatment facility, employing modern technology and complying with strict environmental standards, will not have any appreciable negative environmental impact, locally or nationally.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made of a perceived lack of recycling, lack of funding and the absence of segregated collection services which are commonplace elsewhere. The Minister mentioned that there has been little recognition of the significant measures proposed to deliver a better recycling performance. Ongoing delays in making and implementing these plans is holding up the delivery recycling services, the development of recycling infrastructure and the investment advocated by Senators on both sides of the House. We have proposed integrated waste management services for the regions which will deliver a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled and using landfill as a last resort for residual waste which cannot otherwise be recovered.</P>
    <P>Exchequer and EU funding worth £100 million is available to implement these plans and to give direct support to the development of the requisite recycling and composting infrastructure. The Minister will ask local authorities in regional groups to prioritise the elements of the plans which deal with the delivery of segregated collection services and waste recycling infrastructure. A <Col N="166" /> clear programme of action to bring these aspects forward as soon as possible must also be prepared. Not all waste can be segregated or recycled and there will be residual waste which needs to be thermally treated or put into landfill. No amount of aspiration or pursuit of zero waste strategies will change that.</P>
    <P>Incineration and high levels of recycling are not incompatible. Regional plans prioritise the achievement of the highest recycling targets, typically between 40% and 50%. Only when such targets are met should we consider thermal treatment or landfill to deal with the remaining waste. Under these plans, the capacity of the proposed thermal treatment facilities is deliberately limited. The Minister is pleased that he has a statutory basis for further important waste management and anti-litter measures, including a new environmental levy of up to 15p on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and potentially the extension of the levy to other problematic waste products.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also considering a levy on putting waste into landfill at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne, the establishment of an environmental fund through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to finance beneficial environment initiatives in a range of areas including waste management and environmental education and awareness; an increase in the on-the-spot litter fine to £100 and provision for future changes in the level of the fine; and technical amendments to the Waste Management Act, 1996, to bring legal clarity to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency of certain waste activities.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara proposed a ban on plastic bags. The position in this regard is clear. Under EU law, a member state may not unilaterally ban packaging such as plastic bags which are acceptable throughout the EU. Senator Norris referred to the Canberra zero waste policy and objectives. This is an aspiration and it has not been achieved. While Canberra succeeded in year one in diverting construction waste from landfill, which is a relatively easy matter, the authorities have not succeeded in the same way in relation to municipal and domestic waste. Landfill of these wastes continues at more or less the same level as when the zero waste initiative began.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill will provide a legal mechanism to satisfactorily conclude the stalled waste management process and to facilitate the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste infrastructure. The Bill will also provide for a range of environmentally important and desirable initiatives to be undertaken in the near future. Accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the progress being made in the implementation of the NDP infrastructure investment programmes, particularly in the roads, public transport and water services sectors.</P>
      <P>It is an appropriate time to debate this motion given that the Tánaiste recently said we have a First World economy and a Third World infrastructure. It would be very difficult for anyone to disagree with that statement. Much of our infrastructure is under severe strain because of economic development in recent years, which probably indicates a dearth of investment over many decades.</P>
      <P>It would be fair to the say that the national development plan introduced by the Government is probably the most significant developmental proposal in the lifetime of the State. It involves an investment of more than £40 billion in 1999, excluding a further £6 billion which it is hoped to attract from the private sector. This will be expended over a period of seven years from 2000 to 2006. It is the largest investment plan ever drawn up by the State and unlike previous plans most of the public funding, about 90%, will be provided from domestic sources, mainly the Exchequer. Nevertheless, the contribution from the European Union will still be significant. There will be £3 billion from the Structural and Cohesion Funds and £1.7 billion under the CAP rural development plan. The national development plan has four basic strategic objectives: continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth, consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness, fostering balanced regional development and promoting social inclusion.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that more than half of the national development plan expenditure will be devoted to economic and social infrastructure. The focus will be on transport infrastructure, including road, rail and bus, environmental services, including water, sewerage and waste management, which we talked about earlier, together with housing and health infrastructure. From a national and regional perspective, this expenditure is the most important under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficiencies in our infrastructure, which have been exposed by the rapid economic development of recent years, are now threatening to become an impediment to further economic and social progress. This importance is reflected <Col N="169" /> in the fact that the annual average provision for infrastructure over the planned period represents an increase of 55% over the 1999 baseline figure. Almost 40% of the planned expenditure on infrastructure is earmarked for roads and public transport, reflecting investment needs in these areas. As far as national roads are concerned, the focus is on improving the main corridors. As regards public transport, there is special emphasis in the plan on the Dublin region because of the major transport bottlenecks in the capital, which are an obstacle to national economic progress. This is not to the exclusion of the need for improved provincial bus networks and the enhancement of public transport services in other centres.</P>
    <P>In the area of environmental services, substantial investment in water, sewerage and waste management facilities is planned to comply with EU regulatory requirements and to meet the needs of a buoyant economy and rising population.</P>
    <P>For the first time, there is provision for social infrastructure, and housing is the biggest individual expenditure item. A key housing priority is to increase social housing output in accordance with the increased demands in the community.</P>
    <P>On health infrastructure, the priorities are substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and the equipping of acute hospitals, facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, facilities and services for older persons, mental health services and services for children requiring care and protection. It will also provide for much needed investment in the area of information technology and health research.</P>
    <P>There are significant investments across a wide range of services. Anybody who travels to the UK or Europe will see that we have much catching up to do to provide an infrastructure commensurate with the needs of the economy today. Bearing in mind economic growth, <i>per capita</i> income increases and other economic indicators which put us among world leaders, infrastructure needs to catch up. The challenges are ones that should have been addressed much earlier. The cost to the economy as a whole and the transport sector in particular of having a deficient road network is very significant. As I stated here before, almost all the expenditure, with the exception of labour, in the transport sector is imported. From a balance of payments point of view it is highly desirable, if not essential, that we make the necessary investment. We also need to accelerate the developments taking place. To fully implement the plan and realise the benefits of it requires an emphasis on smoothing the planning regulations and the consultation process.</P>
    <P>In my area there will be a new motorway from Waterford to Dublin. We are led to believe that this will not dilute the emphasis on the eastern corridor where there is substantial development in housing, with people commuting to the capital on a daily basis. It is important that the public transport structure and the road network facili<Col N="170" /> tate the smooth movement of people and goods. There is a significant payback from improvements in our road sector and introducing more motorways with savings in time, fuel costs, and wear and tear on vehicles. It is almost unbelievable that in 2001, having seen rapid economic growth, we have so little motorway here.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection of poor vision that developments have taken place which, within three or four years, will be redundant. I am talking here about the Moone bypass and there are other examples where road improvements are taking place but the increase in traffic and the growth in population are rapidly overtaking those developments. It shows the short-term nature of some of the development. I hope that the Government and the various agencies responsible will ensure that developments will give us value for money and will be planned so that they will be sustainable into the future. Any plan for road infrastructure should be looking to the year 2100 and all development in the interim should be phased in to ensure that at that stage we have a fully developed road network that will be required then.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment to date on the plan, particularly in public transport. There are serious deficiencies in our public transport. As an aside, when I consider industrial relations in the public service, particularly in State companies like Aer Lingus and CIE, I despair as to the ability of these companies to deliver on the required transportation system.</P>
    <P>However, progress has been made in recent years. Bus Átha Cliath purchased 150 buses in 1999 and 225 in 2000, and 56 new buses are planned for this year. That is a significant increase. Amazingly, no new carriages were bought for the DART since its inception in 1984 until recently when 12 new carriages were purchased. Of all the initiatives taken in the public transport sector, the DART is one area that shows good planning and pays dividends. It works extremely well and the Minister is very anxious to ensure that it is extended to complement the Luas and the underground system.</P>
    <P>If we were planning Dublin transport from a blank sheet, we would not dream of doing so without a fully integrated underground rail system. That is not as easy as if we were starting from scratch but it is something which should be pursued with great vigour and enthusiasm. The new investment in the DART service will increase its capacity by almost 50% by the end of 2002, which is significant. Total expenditure on suburban rail development has amounted to 28 billion.</P>
    <P>As regards bus services outside Dublin, 86 new buses were bought in 2000 and 36 in 2001. Mainline rail has seen 200 miles of new rail laid and total expenditure in that area amounted to £235 million in 2000. While there have been improvements in the rail lines between Tralee, Sligo, Cork and Dublin, there is a need &ndash; I am sure the Mini<Col N="171" /> ster of State, Deputy Jacob, will concur fully &ndash; to improve the Dublin to Wexford line. It is an important suburban commuter link to the capital city and there are parts of it where trains must slow to 30 to 40 miles an hour because of the condition of the rails. There is a need for improvement in this area. There are other areas, which I am sure will be mentioned by other speakers, such as waste management and water and sewerage schemes where we must meet EU requirements and the demands of growing urban population centres.</P>
    <P>Overall, the national development plan is well conceived. It is essential that it is well implemented so that its fruits will be evident within as short a space of time as possible and it is important that any bureaucracy impeding it is addressed quickly to ensure its quick and smooth implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to second the motion. We live in extremely exciting times. I remember in 1987 when there were cutbacks in every Department, from Health and Children to Social, Community and Family Affairs to Education and Science and so on. The remark was made in the media at the time, &ldquo;Will the last person to leave the country please turn out the lights.&rdquo;  We all thought doomsday had come. The leadership of the Government has turned the economy around and we are now in a position to spend enormous amounts of money on infrastructure.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Senator Walsh, said, it is time for us to catch up with other European countries, especially where infrastructure is concerned. We live in the past in that regard and if we are to maintain the pace of development in the country, we will have to tackle infrastructure. I am delighted the plan and money for it exist and that all we need do is proceed to implement it. It is time this money was made available. It should be dispersed equally throughout the country so that all development does not occur in one area. I accept that infrastructure in larger centres of population must be developed to get people to and from work. Many avenues are open to us given the state of the economy, the growth in population and people trying to build new houses and provide their own homes. There is a great opportunity to expand water and sewerage schemes and treatment plants to move with the times. Infrastructure will play a vital role.</P>

    <P>When we debated various European Union treaties, such as the Maastricht Treaty, one of the points made was the amount of money which would be made available and whether it would be £6 billion or £7 billion. In the case of the national development plan, we are speaking of £40 billion, which is an enormous amount of money. With that, there will be a huge injection of money from the private sector through the public private partnerships for new schemes of bridges, roads or <Col N="172" /> whatever. There is plenty of private money to be utilised to build up infrastructure.</P>
    <P>One section of the plan involving the National Roads Authority concerns me slightly. The huge plans the authority has for sections of the country appear to fall short when it comes to rural areas where huge areas might not have a national primary route, although they might have a national secondary one. The authority does not appear to spend the same money on national secondary routes as it does on national primary routes. I have raised this with the National Roads Authority on numerous occasions and it is examining the matter. Secondary routes only receive a pittance compared to the millions spent on primary routes. I accept such spending is necessary because people need to get to those areas where business is or will be located. However, it is something which will have to be examined, especially where tourism counties are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the plan because it deals not only with roads and water and sewerage schemes but also with all modes of transport, especially rail transport. That presents a real challenge to people in Iarnród Éireann. One hears every day of trains being overcrowded and, in one sense, it is great to see that. I remember years ago people did not use public transport whereas now it is the way to travel. If it can be modernised, with more money spent on it to bring it up to proper standards, and additional train services provided, people will utilise trains more often and that will alleviate the huge volumes of traffic.</P>
    <P>The road network cannot handle the volumes of traffic, even though huge advances have been made by the National Roads Authority with new bypasses and new stretches of road. If proper autobahns, as they are called in Europe, were built between the major cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Wexford and Sligo, the infrastructure could be built off these major roadways. That must be the way for the future.</P>
    <P>It is an exciting time and a system is in place to debate all the issues in the plan. It is important that, where one programme begins to falter and cannot utilise the moneys made available to it, the funding can be moved to another programme using the various organisations in place. It is an exciting time for the country.</P>
    <P>One area with which the plan will have to deal is the increase in housing. If the proper infrastructure is put in place, it is an ideal opportunity to avoid industries investing in the country locating in the east. The argument has been made repeatedly that if the infrastructure were in place in rural areas, more industry would locate there. At least the money exists to develop that infrastructure and it should be put in place so that all people are treated equally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State whose Department is involved with the national development plan and for which these are exciting times. I look forward to implementation of the plan. I am hon<Col N="173" /> oured to be on two of the committees involved, although I was disappointed Kerry did not achieve Objective One status under the plan. I welcome the Government announcement that there is an equal amount of money for both Departments and I look forward with excitement to huge development here over the next four or five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, in many ways, a self-congratulatory motion. However, the reality is different from what is in the motion because, although progress is being made, in many areas it is neither adequate nor fast enough. I particularly want to address the question of transport, as have other speakers. This Government has been in power for nearly four years and it now takes much longer to get to the office. Commuting times have increased significantly. I left home today at 7.30 a.m. and drove to Dublin by the most direct route, arriving here at about 9.30 a.m. That means it took two hours to get here by road which is absolutely ridiculous. The queues of traffic were never worse. Despite all the investment, the job is not being done. People are unable to get to work on time, their working day is longer and their quality of life and quality time with their families is reduced. The country is literally being choked to death by traffic and not enough is being done.</P>
      <P>If one is lucky enough to live near a railway line, particularly the northern line, the trains are chock-a-block. There is a rush to get on the 5.15 p.m. train at Pearse Station every evening, and that is the first station from which the train leaves. It is impossible to get a seat or even to move on these trains at times. The same is true in the mornings.</P>
      <P>In order to address the issue we could lengthen the trains by putting on more carriages. However, current growth on the eastern seaboard is disproportionate to the carrying capacity of the trains. In the foreseeable future, with all the work on the Dundalk-Dublin line, the increase in its capacity will be 2,500 people. Towns like Balbriggan, Drogheda and Dundalk are growing out of all proportion and the situation can only get significantly worse over the next five years. Where the money was spent by Iarnród Éireann to raise and improve bridges on the route no thought was given to ways of increasing by something like 40% the capacity of the trains. The bridges were not raised sufficiently to allow the passage of double-decker trains similar to those in use on the Continent. We cannot have them on the northern line because the powers that be did not give adequate thought to the problem with the result that people will have to travel by road. However, the roads cannot take the traffic. There is a vicious circle, and the plan is totally inadequate in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to investment in health and hospitals, but queues for services were never longer. Waiting times for significant key oper<Col N="174" /> ations, cardiac operations, orthopaedic operations, ENT operations and so on, have increased significantly. Money is being spent but not quickly enough. The Government, which has been in office for almost four years, has neglected to fully and adequately address the serious shortages that have become evident in the health services since it took office.</P>
    <P>No matter how we talk about our national development plan, the quality of life is worse today than it was four years ago. I was interested to read the comments of a junior Minister in the paper yesterday to the effect that the labour shortage in economy nationally means we will have to take in about 45,000 people per annum, new immigrants or returned emigrants. There are serious structural problems in our economy if we are not able to provide a labour force here. That our economy is growing is welcome. There is a shortage of labour in the general service industries, in shops, hairdressers, hotels and so on, but there are people living here who are capable of working and cannot take up those jobs. How will we deal with an extra 45,000 per annum? That will have a significant knock-on effect on our structures.</P>
    <P>The development of Dublin and the east coast is happening at an extremely fast pace which is disproportionate to development in the rest of the country. Under the national development plan, the Government is failing to provide adequate investment opportunities in other parts of the country. It is an utterly ridiculous policy to put more and more companies into Dublin when there are bottlenecks in the creation of adequate transport systems and a total lack of proper and adequate housing to meet people's needs. Instead of the mad rush into Dublin every morning to work, there should be an equal and opposite rush of people out of the city into the provinces, to places like Counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow to work. Government policy should discriminate in favour of the provinces and not in favour of the city. I am not in favour of jobs going everywhere in the country, but we should have a constructive, dynamic, progressive and aggressive policy in all Departments of Government to make sure that jobs are created in the provinces where there is greater capacity. The working day would then be considerably reduced and the quality of life would be very much better.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister. I regret that I did not hear earlier contributions and that I am, therefore, at a slight disadvantage in regard to point scoring. The national development plan is the key to our future. The industrial revolution in Britain happened during the 19th century. We are having our industrial revolution now. Our country is changing day by day, year by year. There are extreme and very important changes taking place and we are on top of them. That is why this motion should be rejected by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who has important responsibilities <Col N="175" /> in the area of energy needs and development, and the resources that will play an important part in the economic development of the State. I compliment him on dealing with the natural gas finds off the north Mayo coast and the national grid service for the State, and on the progress that has taken place there.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion on the basis that the national development plan is the Government's blueprint. It sets out a strategy of investment for this country from 2000 to 2006 and is a very important aspect of our development. It recognises the great success of our economy, the developments and the resources which have been put together particularly by young working people, and it recognises how the whole momentum within the country has changed. I live on the western seaboard and it is most interesting to see the huge movement of people at 7.30 a.m. in rural Ireland, whether they are working in Westport, Castlebar or elsewhere. The changes occurring along the western seaboard are extremely noticeable. Massive changes have taken place in villages in Roscommon which is the Cathaoirleach's county. Towns have been totally enhanced through the improvement of new lighting systems and tarmacadam streetscapes. Rural areas have been undergoing very positive changes.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Sustainable Development, I attended a meeting in Austria to discuss the Kyoto protocol and various aspects of energy and environmental control with regard to how we will develop and live in the future. An American who was there said &ldquo;You can do nothing without money&rdquo;, and it is as simple as that. This country cannot tackle important issues without the necessary finance which the national development plan is making available in a planned and organised manner. There is a great opportunity to achieve balanced development under the aegis of the national development plan. From the outset, the Government recognised the need for such development and instituted a policy to achieve it by setting up the Objective One area. The Government succeeded in putting this plan through while the Opposition parties had little say about their policies for directing resources to the specific needs of rural areas that had been left behind. While there was some debate about the issue, the Government had the guts to establish such a programme as part of the national development plan. We are now witnessing the benefits throughout the south, west, midlands and Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate some of Senator O'Dowd's comments on how to bring about balanced development. Recently, we had a meeting with IDA Ireland whose officials told us it is not easy to persuade industrialists to operate from certain towns. They like to be near high-tech areas and third level institutions. They also like to see how industrialists from other countries are operating before deciding to locate in a given area. That is <Col N="176" /> a big problem and even though there are incentives to direct industrialists to the BMW region, they may not be enough to effect that change. A greater concentration of effort is required in that area.</P>
    <P>Today I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, at which the National Roads Authority was represented. In fairness, investment in roads will total £4.8 billion for the period 2000-06. Some 20 major road projects are being completed this year, including bypasses and motorways. A further 21 projects will commence this year with a total of £650 million being spent on investment in national roadworks. At today's committee meeting we were assured that the works are on target for completion and we were informed that a number of outside contractors are co-operating with Irish contractors. In addition, up to 14 or 15 foreign contractors have expressed an interest in participating with Irish companies on some of the roadworks under public-private partnership agreements. This situation did not evolve overnight. It needed planned investment to encourage such companies that realise Ireland is a profitable place in which to work and invest.</P>
    <P>The NRA is satisfied it will reach its targets, but also realises that some overruns will occur, particularly because of the recent inflation figures which affect the national development plan. The plan may have to be supported somewhat to maintain overall output and keep targets in line. At today's meeting, the NRA also assured members of the committee that there will be a role for smaller contractors in major schemes on the national roads network. Forthcoming 30, 40 and 50-mile road development projects will attract major companies, but smaller schemes will provide opportunities for Irish contractors to tender for, and participate in, jobs.</P>
    <P>Such developments place a huge emphasis on local authorities whose funding has increased threefold in the past ten years. They have also put much pressure on personnel who are faced with the challenge of meeting existing demands. Some local authorities have been slow to achieve that, while others have been successful. They are beginning to feel the effects of such an adjustment and to recognise the need for change. There was an initial reluctance to accept the changes because for many years local authorities were caretakers of the basic infrastructure that had been there for so long and which lacked real investment. Investment is now forthcoming and local authorities have established contracts for water and sewerage developments. In addition, substantial funding has been made available for the development of secondary roads which is causing local authorities to participate in a more organised and efficient way. Changes are taking place and while the process is in its infancy, local government is playing a part in the process. There is a need to build upon those strengths.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The national development plan represents a great opportunity while placing a firm responsibility on Ministers to fulfil its objectives. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, has specific responsibility for rural development. He should take a focused look at the question of balanced development to target investment at disadvantaged areas with declining population trends to address their specific needs.</P>
    <P>Great improvements have been made for people on the islands, including improved water and electricity supplies. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have changed their style to become focused on regional issues which present major challenges. We will monitor their commitment and the success that will be achieved in the not too distant future. We are living in a time of rapid change. The investment programme of the national development plan will rectify many of the imbalances, thus providing improved regional development in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Government Senators are hopping up and down, the same as we are, with a long shopping list of matters they wish to have discussed in the House. All of them are legitimate concerns, whether they are local, national or international in nature. Government Senators get their two hours to discuss Private Members' business on a Wednesday night, yet they decide to bow collectively before the great god of Government and say, &ldquo;Thank you very much for what you have done so far; whatever it was, it was wonderful.&rdquo;  Could they not have injected even a hint of a question or a change of priorities? Could they not have injected even a hint of the fact that now, a year or 18 months after publication of the national development plan, the priorities could be just a little different? The fact that we have learned something about the hopeless energy structure in the west, which, significantly, was not mentioned in the national development plan, could have been raised.</P>
      <P>The chaotic attempt to develop a telecommunications infrastructure could also have been raised. It was not planned for, although a Bill to regulate it was on the Order Paper before, during and after publication of the national development plan. That Bill was eventually withdrawn, leaving many urban areas under the permanent threat that some new telecommunications provider will decide to exercise its right to dig up the roads yet again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They might have done that but instead we have this motion which states: &ldquo;Seanad Éireann wel<Col N="178" /> comes the progress being made .&rdquo;. If we had stood still and done nothing, that is the type of motion that would be acceptable to everybody but we did not stand still. From the very beginning my party, and for once I was in total unanimity with my party, said that was not a plan but a list of aspirations. There was no plan to implement it and because there was no plan to implement it, the actual plan is what they have been doing for the past 12 months. They have been planning to meet the aspirations in what was called the national development plan. That was actually a set of national development aspirations, few of which one could disagree with, although some of the priorities were distorted and some of the figures were plucked out of hats.</P>
    <P>Everything on which money was being spent was classified as development. For instance, we are being told continuously that £1 billion is being spent on the rail infrastructure but between two-thirds and three-quarters of that amount is being spent on making it minimally safe. That is not development. If there is a big pothole in my road and somebody fills it in, I do not call that development. I call that repairs, and it is not anything that brings us forward. It gets us back from living in the dark ages. It would have been good to have a debate in which we got an up to date report on what is happening.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I had to attend two committees this afternoon so I did not hear the report from the National Roads Authority but I am not surprised to hear that it believes everything is going wonderfully because everything was going wonderfully on the Kildare bypass until they ran into a roadblock in Brussels. Everything was going wonderfully well on many other projects until they ran into various other obstacles. Let us put some facts on the record. In the first three quarters of 1999, according to the Central Bank's quarterly review published last week, there was a 12% decline in social housing constructions in the State. In other words, the number of social housing units being built decreased in 1999 in the middle of the biggest housing crisis this country has faced in 40 years.</P>
    <P>The words in the motion &ldquo;welcoming the progress being made&rdquo; are so sycophantic. Everybody would have to accept that some progress was being made but in regard to housing we are going backwards and newspaper reports today suggest that a similar phenomenon is now occurring in the private housing market. Apparently our builders are not satisfied to accept a lower level of profitability than the excessive ones they were getting so they have moved off to something else. Perhaps they are building the roads the National Roads Authority wants to build.</P>
    <P>We have a railway investment which is desperately trying to catch up before more people are killed. We have a housing position which seems to be going south terrifyingly fast for some reason I do not yet know. I remember hearing the current Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="179" /> Government assure the nation on Raidió na Gaeltachta that all the secondary roads in County Kerry were in great shape as I bounced along from pothole to pothole on what is the main road from the Cork car ferry to Dingle. That is the main road and there are potholes every half mile along large stretches of that road untouched by human hand for 20 years. Who is codding the Minister and where is the progress?</P>
    <P>This country has been afflicted by something that a friend of mine, another engineer, called an edifice complex. We no longer want to build anything any more unless it is huge. The National Roads Authority wants to build a huge road from Portlaoise to Fermoy whereas its priority, for the sake of the misfortunate people of Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Cashel, should be to build by-passes immediately and the bigger roads later. That is true of most of our main roads.</P>
    <P>In my home town of Athy, some genius in the National Roads Authority decided to solve Kildare's traffic problem by diverting people <i>via</i> Athy. There are big signs in both Portlaoise and on the motorway advising people to go through Athy. To keep on the road to Cork one must go through Athy and heavy juggernauts turn on a corner which is hardly the width of the distance between myself and Senator O'Dowd. It is eight metres wide at most and these trucks have to swing around it. They call that progress. In the three year wait for permission to build the motorway through Kildare, nobody thought of planning it so that they could bypass Monasterevan. They are now starting to plan the Monasterevan by-pass and in the meantime we will have an official opening, attended by the Minister, and the bottleneck will move from Kildare to Monasterevan. That is not planning and it is not progress.</P>

      <P>I have a couple of gripes in relation to the actual expenditure on roads. Because he is a distinguished member of Westmeath County Council I asked my friend and colleague, the Leader of the House, about the N4 dual carriageway, which we were all delighted with, being reduced to a single lane past Mullingar by having cones put down on it. I understand a number of remedial works have to be carried out and then hopefully order will be restored on that wonderful section of road. I would suggest that the N4 from Dublin, certainly to my part of the country in Leitrim, is one of the best stretches of motorway. Nearly all of it has come about through the National Roads Authority and the injection of funds by central Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a quibble which allows me the opportunity in this debate once again to nail my colours to the mast. I do not understand why the National Roads Authority refuses to upgrade the N4 from Mullingar to Sligo to motorway status. This is in spite of the lobbying from the coalition that includes the full spectrum of political, commercial, social and economic interests from Mullingar, through Longford into Leitrim and beyond into Sligo. It has set its face against this. It is not included in the national development plan nor in <Col N="182" /> the road needs study. The NRA says its objection is based on traffic flow. I would suggest &ndash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, who is from the west will understand &ndash; that it is as much about the message that is sent out by central Government as it is about the actual expenditure.</P>
    <P>I will readily admit to this House that there is a victim complex in certain parts of the west of Ireland. My wife, who comes from west Cork, said they never had a victim complex even though they still had nothing like the rest of us up in Leitrim. She seems to put it down to the fact that the old Cromwellian cry of &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo; is deeply embedded in the psyche of the west and that we have had that sort of victimhood since the 17th century. We are getting out of it to a large extent mainly because real progress is being made. Roads, water and sewerage are being improved. The entire north Leitrim area is now the subject of expenditure of Government funds of up to £4 million which will develop rural parts of the county where there is widespread population dispersal. The same is happening in north and west Mayo where small water and sewerage schemes and local services are being provided under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to this House and to Senator Ryan in particular &ndash; who I appreciate is living in the urban glory and luxury of Cork City &ndash; that these developments represent very real progress. People do appreciate what is being done. Of course we are not moving fast enough. There has been a suggestion, certainly in the media and Senator Ryan articulated this to some degree, that there has been a possible slow-down in the progress that has been made with the national development plan. I have a serious problem with this but Senator Chambers reassured me to some degree. He is a member of the relevant committee which was assured by the NRA that they were on target with their various projects. I would be very concerned by the obvious worldwide economic downturn. We are being affected by it. The Exchequer returns have indicated consumer spending is down and this will obviously have an effect on Government finances. We cannot ignore the economic reality of that. I hope that the commitments which have been entered into as part of the national development plan will be sacrosanct. Unless we can get a proper infrastructure in place, and that includes not only national primary roads but water and sewerage services, we will have a real difficulty in attracting industry to the areas that need it most.</P>
    <P>In all of this discussion about investment and the national development plan we must not ignore the parallel need for development of our national secondary and local road system. The vast majority of people, apart from those who live along the east coast and down into Cork, live in smaller communities at regional and local level. They are using and perhaps need car transport more than might be needed in an urban environment. I do not wish to open up the debate about the lack of proper public transport in our <Col N="183" /> cities. That is a separate issue. People in country areas need car transport. It is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Some of the roads are still in an outrageous state, even some portions of the N5 with which the Minister, Deputy Moffat, will be familiar. I travelled only last week on the stretch that goes through Ballaghadereen and on towards Charlestown. In any other part of the country it would have been upgraded and widened before now. We have a valid argument in the west and in the midlands area. We need urgent development of our road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee, which Senator Ryan seems to have chosen to ignore or was not aware of, is in existence and monitoring what is going on. The Taoiseach heads it up, the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government are part of it and they are monitoring it on a daily basis. This gives a very firm and robust message to the general public that this Government is totally committed, not only to the aspiration of the national development plan but to ensuring it is implemented between now and 2006.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in listening to the banter between Senators Mooney and Ryan. Senator Ryan is probably right when he talks about roads and the need for bypasses around so many towns. If we go along with the approach of Senator Ryan, which is basically the rainbow approach, then the problem is not solved but moved. We need proper infrastructure throughout the country, and a number of main routes. Senator Ryan mentioned that the National Roads Authority is directing traffic on the main Dublin-Cork route through Athy. That is a temporary arrangement of which Senator Ryan is aware but did not tell us. The plan at the end of the day is to have a proper motorway from Dublin to Cork, a very positive move.</P>
      <P>There are two factors that I want to focus on in this debate. One is the location of the main roads. I welcome the Minister because I am sure this is a subject in which he has a very deep interest. The National Roads Authority published its suggestions a number of years ago with regard to the projected locations for the country's main routes. While the proposals are not sacrosanct they gave an indication of thinking at the time. The road from Dublin to Waterford is a major road because it is the main link to the south-east. The N11 through Wicklow and on to Wexford &ndash; unfortunately but probably very necessarily because of the topography &ndash; runs along the coast and consequently services only one side of the road. The servicing of as many towns and villages as possible is I believe an important element of the location of these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to the current debate regarding the main road between Dublin and Waterford. In the past two weeks the National Roads Authority, which is in the consultation phase with regard to the upgrading of that road, has sug<Col N="184" /> gested a very wide corridor in which the road may lie from Kilcullen down to Waterford. One of the difficulties is that the area west of that corridor is already to be serviced by the main road to Cork, the N6. It is very close to that road. To the east side of the corridor outlined the road is more likely to service an area that would otherwise not be serviced because, in geographical terms, the distance between the N11 and the N9 and N10 is quite large.</P>
    <P>There are many small towns in that area which need to be serviced if they are to develop. This feeds into our commitment towards rural development. Towns such as Baltinglass, Tullow and Bunclody will not be serviced if we base our developments west of the corridor suggested by the National Roads Authority. It is important that we should service these towns because, on the other side of the corridor, towns such as Castlecomer, Athy etc. are situated much closer to the Cork road. We must ensure that roads service as many areas throughout the country as possible.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the road to which I refer should service and run close to the town of Carlow. There was a great deal of debate in recent years regarding a proposed bypass of Carlow, which was shelved following the welcome publication of the national development plan. Debate is usually engendered when a route is selected. That is when the placards are written and the objections begin. Regardless of where we locate roads, people will object. However, we need to build those roads. The National Roads Authority is responsible for selecting routes and it must take into consideration many different factors when doing so.</P>
    <P>The road from Kilcullen to Waterford must service two major centres of population, namely, Carlow and Kilkenny. Carlow is, by all accounts, the fastest growing urban area outside Dublin. Unfortunately, it serves Dublin as a satellite commuter town which is something I do not favour. I object strenuously to the fact that everything is centred in Dublin and, therefore, it is vital that the road should service Carlow. Kilkenny is an extremely important location from the point of view of the tourism industry and it must also be serviced so that tourists can travel to the locations they want to visit, quickly and easily. That is why these centres must be serviced. It can be done and I look forward to the National Roads Authority making a decision based on economic considerations rather than any other factors.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that Thomastown in County Kilkenny has been in dire need of a bypass for many years. Huge volumes of traffic pass through this town but its streets are so narrow that if a truck is passing, all other vehicles must stop. That situation cannot be allowed to continue. I have heard of instances where trucks passing along the street in Thomastown ripped the rain covers off children's buggies that were being wheeled along the footpaths, <Col N="185" /> which are too narrow. The areas to which I refer must be properly serviced by our roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rail network, I am pleased that the Arrow service has been extended to Monasterevin. However, it is time that Iarnród Éireann adopted a more progressive approach to planning. If the company considers the volume of commuter traffic using the road from Carlow to Dublin on a daily basis, it will realise that if it provided a service many people would have no need to use the road. However, there is no such service on offer. Opportunities exist in terms of developing rail services and putting in place the required rolling stock. If these are availed of, the system will operate properly.</P>
    <P>Another issue of relevance to the south-east, which is not properly addressed in the national development plan, is the provision of air services. There is a regional airport in Waterford but it is not operating as well as had been anticipated. In my view, the main reason for this is that it is located in the wrong place. To locate an airport close to the sea, where it is regularly affected by fog, and on the far side of Waterford, away from the area it services, does not make sense. There is a need to develop a proper airport in this area, but I am not sure Waterford is the correct location. The matter should be investigated so that the correct location is identified because it is important that business people travelling to Ireland should be able to travel to their destination quickly, carry out their business, return to the airport and leave the country again.</P>
    <P>The points I have raised about the south-east are worth bearing in mind. In my opinion the route chosen for the motorway or dual carriageway is particularly important in terms of servicing the minor and major towns in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a timely motion. I thank the Minister for being present to take on board the views of Members. Deputy Dempsey was a successful member of his local authority and served as secretary of LAMA before being elected as a Deputy and, eventually, becoming Minister for the Environment and Local Government. We are proud of the wonderful work the Minister is doing on behalf of his Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister represents a north Leinster constituency and I can inform him that everyone in counties Louth, Meath and Westmeath are looking forward to the investments that will be made in their areas. I intend to devote part of my contribution to the N52, provision for which is not made in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the new dual line which will be put in place to Maynooth. This line will ensure that the 15% of people from Mullingar and north Westmeath who travel to work in Dublin each day will find it easier to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who used to drive up to 60,000 miles per year, I can state that the new roads being put in place represent a pleasant change from what went before. Credit for this must go to the National Roads Authority and the successive <Col N="186" /> Governments which made the necessary money available. Ireland has always been able to make maximum use of the allocations given to it by the EU following the Edinburgh and other agreements. Officials, particularly those from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, have done excellent work on behalf of Irish citizens in acquiring Leader and Cohesion Funds for road construction projects.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the commencement of work on the motorway from Kilcock to Athlone in September 2002. As a representative for Westmeath, I am proud that Westmeath County Council has been charged with carrying out the engineering works on that motorway. North Westmeath is situated only 40 minutes from a number of ports, which will allow it to attract major outside investment. I call on IDA Ireland to make preparations and plans in that regard because the new road infrastructure will be in place in less than two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of the House 19 years ago this month, there has been little investment in the N52, the road that runs from Nenagh in north Tipperary through Offaly, Westmeath, Meath and into Louth. The N52 is a link between the port of Tarbert in County Limerick and Carlingford and it should have been included in the national development plan. I do not know why it was not included, but I ask the Minister, who has responsibility for seeking and disbursing Government funds, to seek a special allocation of moneys to be invested in putting in place a design team and a plan for the N52 and its future development. The N52 serves the part of our country known as the hidden Ireland, which must be allowed to develop its tourism potential. There is much culture and heritage in towns such as Kells, which people want to see. The second greatest tourist attraction is the Book of Kells. It is only natural that everyone would want to visit Kells.</P>
    <P>I understand a motorway is proposed from Dublin to Cavan for which I pay tribute to the Minister. The N52 is the road people use when travelling from Limerick to County Louth. I would like £1.25 million allocated in the near future for the road from Mullingar to Castlepollard. There have been many accidents at a dangerous place known as Taghmon beside Crookedwood. Westmeath County Council has done minor short-term works on the road. This area does not make many requests to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I ask the Minister and his officials to make the £1.25 million available in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the targets of the plan is to build half a million houses over the next ten years, that is one new house for every eight people living in the Twenty-six Counties. That is an ambitious target which will create employment and bring comfort to people in need of housing. In 1987 there were more than 900,000 people employed here, but that has now risen to 1.7 million. Some 79% of all businesses in the USA are in the services sector, but that sector accounts for only 59% of busi<Col N="187" /> nesses in Ireland. We have a lot to make up. If the progress we made in the past ten or 12 years continues in the next ten or 12 years, most of the targets set out in the national development plan will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am glad a start has been made in investing in the rail infrastructure, which was badly in need of funding. I make a special plea for a major investment in the west. Senator Burke often asks me on the Order of Business about how money has been dispersed in the BMW region after 12 months in operation. I heard Senator Mooney's contribution about the road between Ballaghaderreen and Charlestown. I know it as the pilgrimage route because that is the way I go to Knock every year on my pilgrimage. Ballaghaderreen is the headquarters of the BMW region. I am sure investment can be made in this area at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We in Mullingar have undertaken the national rail museum project in the BMW area as part of our attempt to attract a national flagship project to the area. This project has the support of Bord Fáilte, CIE and other heritage associations. We are in the digital conference era. There is no reason that three or four smaller hotels in the midlands cannot become involved in digital conferencing which would allow people to stay in the area for three or four days having been brought there by rail. We all know about the success of the small rail museum in York in the UK. The national rail museum in Mullingar could be a great tourist attraction. I hope the BMW allocation under the national development plan will be given to the four counties of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. The national development plan is crucial to the future development of this country. It is a coincidence worth noting that as we are debating this issue today we learn for the first time of a significant underestimate of our economic growth and development. We should heed the figures published by the Department of Finance yesterday. We have watched economic growth approach two figures per annum in recent years. However, it is now back down to slightly more than half of that. A downturn in the figures for recent years is probably a good thing if we want to sustain economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one reason above all others to underline the importance of the national development plan is that when the inevitable and inexorable downturn in the economy happens, we have in place the infrastructure to work our way out of it. It is not about getting from A to B more quickly, except in terms of helping trade and exports. In previous times when we suffered a downturn in the economy, we had to work with a poor infrastructure. Every year we gain now puts us in a stronger position. We must ensure that the fish lorry leaving Dingle to bring produce to the Paris market or a lorry leaving a factory in the mid<Col N="188" /> lands is not held back by the bad road between Tralee and Dingle or the N52 between Dundalk and Limerick. We need to look at those roads. We need to look at the three areas of roads, rail and IT infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It would be unthinkable for someone to live in Dingle and commute to Dublin on a daily basis. That would be beyond people's comprehension. It is like something Jules Verne would think about. My opposite number in the UK, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, lives in the beautiful city of York, to which the Leader alluded. He gets the train every morning at 6.35 a.m. and pulls into Euston Station one hour and 50 minutes later. He is ten minutes walk from his office. He is further away from his office than I would be if I lived in Dingle. We should recognise that is what can be done with a proper rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We need huge investment in a rail service with a proper timetable. I ask the Minister to put in place the two objectives which do not require a huge amount of costing. The test of a rail system is that it is comfortable and provides a good service and that one does not have to look for a timetable. I should know when I walk to Heuston Station that the train to Galway will leave at four minutes past every hour and that it will not stop at 7 p.m. I should not have to worry when I go to Cork for a meeting that the last train to Dublin leaves at 7 p.m. and that I must put pressure on the road by driving. The same should apply if I want to go to a funeral removal or an after tea meeting in Cork. It should be easy for people to get on a train in Dublin after work, go to the Opera House in Cork and come back to Dublin that night. It should not be a big deal. We are not getting what we should out of our rail service. I deliberately picked the best line because that type of service could be delivered on it immediately.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the national development plan to reopen the rail service to Navan in the Minister's constituency is crucially important in terms of taking away traffic congestion. Let us look at traffic congestion as part of inflation because that is what it is. It is a direct result of inflation because more cars are on the road which slows down traffic.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at things like the Limerick to Sligo line. It would be a worthwhile investment. One of the problems with suggestions like these is that in a cold calculation on their viability they do not come up to scratch. I have argued this regularly with IBEC. Seeing how it is run on the Continent, there would be a demand if the service were better. If people knew they could get on a train at an appointed hour, get a meal in comfort and that it would leave and arrive on time, more would leave their cars at home. That is important.</P>
    <P>The development of our airports also opens up many opportunities, especially international ones. Internally rail is the key. Obviously roads are important and much has been said about them. <Col N="189" /> However, someone in Cabinet needs to fly the flag for an improved rail service and should take a risk in saying that if a service is there, more people will use it. That means there must be an initial investment in them.</P>
    <P>We must open out ISDN and broadband access to the Internet. Senator Cassidy's point about the use of digital technology in a town like Athlone or Mullingar will only be possible when we have a better operational system. Every school should have wireless access to the Internet, in other words, no wiring or cabling. Equipment is available cheaply to bring the laptop anywhere using a wireless connection. That is the way forward.</P>
    <P>There is a final issue when looking at the downturn in the economy. Jobs were lost in the Minister's constituency in the clothing industry, for example. We both know that there will be no clothing industry here in ten years time. The trade will be in finished objects. People will not work for the kind of wages they would get to produce clothes. All traditional industries will go. Our future is in intellectual added value and that comes through research and development.</P>
    <P>Too many companies investing here have no research and development programme. The best example I know is AppleMac which has an operation in Cork. Nobody in the factory can talk technically about what is being made there. I tried to get information last year when I had a problem with a Cork made laptop and could not get an answer to a technical question. I had to ring Minnesota.</P>
    <P>The last month has seen a pull back in jobs in the information technology sector. No jobs have been lost in the research and development area. It is those who put the bits together who have lost jobs and we are over-exposed in that area. It is no one's fault because we had to create jobs. To consolidate our position, we need added value.</P>
    <P>The other big element in employment is the call centres. In 15 years time, they will be in English speaking countries in Africa. They will be gone from here. That will affect many people. Both traditional and some new industries will be threatened by a downturn in the global markets.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will help. We should up the ante and get it through quicker. There should be total support for the investment in it. On behalf of the trade union movement and the social partners, I say that the level of research and consultation, as it was being put together, added to its strength and the commitment to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed and apologise to those I missed. This is an important motion giving us an opportunity to consider in a number of key areas the progress we are making on the implementation of the major infrastructural investment programmes in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> By this time, when anyone talks about the plan people's eyes glaze over and the public switches off because they have heard so much about the concept of such a plan in the last two or three years. It is easy to understand that reaction because when Ministers or politicians talk about it, we immediately get into figures like £40 billion or £6 billion for housing and other concepts like that. Facts and figures are guaranteed to switch people off any topic.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is really about a simple concept, which Senator O'Toole identified, and that is improving the quality of life. When we use terms like providing roads, water, waste water services, waste management services, housing, hospital infrastructure and social inclusion we are talking about improving the quality of life for all our citizens. As Senators pointed out, to do that it is necessary to put in place an infrastructure, another word used constantly by Members. When we use that word, it conjures up in every mind, roads, water and sewerage but the national development plan is about much more.</P>
    <P>We all have an obligation to get across the quality of life message, although it is not so easy when there is a consultation process or a bit of someone's land is being taken for a road or extra housing. However, overall we must keep in mind the concept that the intent of the national development plan over a six year period is to transform this country and put in place the necessary facilities to improve everybody's quality of life.</P>
    <P>Earlier national development plans were necessarily focused on other issues such as the need to improve the national finances, as in the first one, or to combat high unemployment. With those two problems more or less overcome, improved infrastructure is the key issue for a better quality of life, national development and to maintain and improve our competitiveness which is only a means to an end. Improving competitiveness will enhance the quality of life.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will enhance our environment which will also improve the quality of life. As Members on all sides pointed out, there is an urgent need to develop our infrastructure to meet our growing needs and prepare for the day, as Senator O'Toole stated, when matters will not be so good and we will need these in place. That is why the Government has accorded priority in the plan to the various programmes. More than half of the plan's 51 billion investment is dedicated to economic, social, cultural and environmental infrastructure. Those programmes cover roads, public transport, water, waste water, waste management, sustainable energy, social housing, health facilities and urban and village development.</P>
    <P>This massively increased investment in infrastructure in the plan is about three times that between 1994 and 1999, but is not an end in itself. <Col N="191" /> It is designed to transform the country over the next seven years by making regions and cities more accessible for tourism, business and leisure and by providing greater mobility for those travelling by rail and road, including the young, the elderly and those with disabilities. To remove actual and potential sources of pollution to guarantee a clean, green environment now and in the future is something we should desire for ourselves, our children, the tourist, food and agri-food industries and for the good of the nation generally.</P>
    <P>The size of this plan and the dramatic changes it will give rise to have escaped notice or become old hat. Ireland has about 300 km of dual carriageways and motorways, but the national development plan will add nearly 700 km by 2006. Implementation of the national roads programme will reduce journey times from Dublin to five other major cities by an aggregate time of three hours. That is not an end in itself, but is something that will improve quality of life, as well as adding to our competitiveness, as has been said.</P>
    <P>Improvements to public transport will provide real and concrete benefits to service users. By 2003, light rail services will become a reality for the commuters of south-west Dublin, and the Luas system will then progressively extend to other areas and greatly increase the throughput of public transport users on roads and streets. Once more I stress that that will improve the quality of life of everybody in the greater Dublin area. Mainline rail commuter services are also set to increase their custom. By the later stages of the NDP period, planning for a Dublin metro service will be well advanced.</P>
    <P>At present, major waste water discharges flow directly into the sea at Cork, Dundalk, Limerick, Drogheda and other coastal towns. The discharge from Dublin receives primary treatment only. Within one to three years all such discharges, representing 80% of the country's pollution load from waste water, will be treated to full EU standards before entering the marine environment, giving a boost to quality of life. All these benefits are real and tangible and will make Ireland a better connected and more accessible place for its people. The provisions of the NDP will greatly reduce environmental pressures and make the use of efficient and comfortable public transport in urban areas the norm rather than the exception. Transport in rural areas will also be provided under the plan.</P>
    <P>I am responsible for the national road network, which is our principal mode of transport for economic and social purposes. The quality of the network has a huge bearing on the efficiency of our daily business and accordingly on our quality of life. For this reason, upgrading our road network is a key element in the improvement of our infrastructure. Our objective for national roads is nothing less than a transformation of the net<Col N="192" /> work. The NDP envisages upgrading key inter-urban routes by addressing bottlenecks and capacity deficiencies, improving road infrastructure within and between regions and contributing towards the achievement of the Government's road safety strategy. The national spatial strategy, which is dedicated to balanced regional development, will also be supported by the NDP.</P>
    <P>Investment in national roads this year will be £660 million, an increase of 154% on investment in 1997. Overall, the NDP provides for a total investment at 1999 prices of £4.4 billion in the national roads network. I am glad to report that the plan to complete upgrading of the Dublin-Border, Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Limerick, and Dublin-Cork routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard by 2006 is on schedule. Similarly, the completion of the Dublin-Waterford route to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard is on schedule for 2007, and progress is being maintained on major improvements on the other national primary routes.</P>
    <P>In its recently published Review 2000 and Programme for 2001, the NRA identified 20 projects to be completed during 2001 and 23 more to start. This investment will deliver major quality of life benefits in terms of journey time savings, removal of through traffic from 60 towns and villages and a much safer major road network. A Senator spoke of reverting to the policy of focusing on bypassing minor towns rather than putting in place a good spine of national roads. The focus on bypasses was a disaster, and I think we are now going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>This year we provided over £319 million for non-national roads, an increase of over 21% on the initial 2000 allocation. This level of commitment to the non-national roads programme will be maintained up to 2006. The inclusion of non-national roads in NDP operational programmes for the southern and eastern and Border, midlands and western regions underlines their vital importance to these regions and guarantees the full resourcing of the work over the next six years.</P>
    <P>The restoration programme remains at the centre of efforts to improve the non-national roads network. Since its inception in 1995, 15,346 road improvement schemes have been completed, with over 21,567 kilometres of non-national roads benefiting from improvement. Allocations for 2001 also include over £32 million in non-national road grants to support development such as housing. Grant assistance will be provided to local authorities in the greater Dublin area, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and adjoining counties, where housing demand is highest, for certain strategic non-national roads to support housing, industrial, commercial and other developments. That scheme will provide grant aid of £294 million, outside of the non-national roads programme, for 42 projects between 2001 and 2004.</P>
    <P>The plan's approach to developing transport infrastructure is not confined to investing in <Col N="193" /> national and non-national roads, as it contains a record level of £2.2 billion in 1999 prices to develop public transport infrastructure in Dublin and throughout the country. This investment will expand our overall public transport infrastructure, maximise the efficiency of the road system, improve accessibility for those without private transport to service their needs, and improve the environmental sustainability of the system. Members are familiar with the main features of the planned public transport system like Luas, the completion of work on the rail safety programme for mainline rail, which is 50% complete, and the improvement of bus services throughout the country, including long distance services and urban services in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. We are trying to improve the quality of life in rural areas and are, therefore, also concentrating on the rural transport scheme.</P>
    <P>This programme is being overseen by the Minister for Public Enterprise and it is achieving considerable success. There have been major improvements in the quality and frequency of bus services because of the commissioning of 125 new low floor, wheelchair accessible buses by Dublin Bus. This has led to a substantial increase in the peak time carrying capacity of the fleet. There are already six quality bus corridors in place and a further three will be in operation by the end of this year. This will lead to an improved quality of service for commuters.</P>
    <P>The commissioning of 40 new buses by Bus Éireann led to significant improvement in services to centres such as my town of Trim, Navan and Drogheda and the Kildare and Wicklow areas. A further 34 buses to be delivered later this year will allow further improvements to services to be made. DART and suburban rail services have been substantially improved through new DART carriages. An order for 60 Arrow carriages has been placed with delivery due in late 2002 and the construction of the light rail network has commenced. Good progress has been made in the improvement of public transport services outside Dublin. By the end of 2001, in excess of 200 miles of rail track will have been renewed and in excess of 200 level crossings will have been upgraded as part of the railway safety programme I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Water and waste water services are sometimes taken for granted, but they are a vital element of infrastructure. For this reason, water and waste water infrastructure are also benefiting substantially from an expanded programme of work under the NDP. The investment programme responds directly to the issues of water supply networks and leakages from them, the need to improve protection of watercourses and improved standards regarding waste water. The aim of the programme is to provide an adequate water supply and waste water infrastructure to meet growing economic and social needs, to secure compliance with EU and national standards in relation to waste water and drinking water, to remedy existing pollution and prevent <Col N="194" /> future water pollution and to improve the management of the network generally.</P>
    <P>The total investment in this programme is £3 billion and the first major step in rolling out this investment was the water services programme, covering the period 2000 to 2001, which I launched last July. The programme provides for the construction of 529 schemes consisting of 79 major water and sewerage schemes, 113 further schemes to proceed to construction during the 2000-02 period, 131 schemes to begin planning in preparation for construction during the NDP period, 140 serviced land initiative schemes and 66 schemes under the rural towns and villages initiative. The major projects included are the completion of the Dublin Bay, Cork, Limerick and Waterford main drainage schemes. The total investment under this three year programme is £2.1 billion. Public-private partnerships will play an increasing role over the period of the NDP in delivering these projects</P>
    <P>In terms of quality of life issues, the serious problem of the quality of water in rural areas has been met head on. There are continuing serious problems in private water supplies, particularly group water schemes, and they will benefit substantially under the NDP. Approximately £8 million or £9 million was provided in 1997 for this area but a record £35 million has been provided this year. This investment enables us to confidently predict that inferior drinking water quality in rural areas will be eliminated within three years.</P>
    <P>Investment in infrastructure on the scale contained in the NDP imposes substantial challenges on the bodies with responsibility for delivering it. Since the launch of the plan, the Government has devoted considerable time and energy to the issue of deliverability. This has involved a hands-on approach through the Cabinet committee on infrastructure which is chaired by the Taoiseach. I attended a meeting of that committee earlier today. Initiatives have been taken already to intensify the public-private partnership approach to infrastructural development in all the programmes I mentioned. The Cabinet committee also monitors progress on the major projects and this will continue during the lifetime of the plan to ensure that the vision of the NDP is realised.</P>
    <P>I outlined a number of programmes, but others are equally important, particularly the housing programme. These matters are covered by the plan, the aim of which is to improve the quality of life for everybody living and working in Ireland and in maintaining our capacity for continued growth and development. Over the period of the national development plan, we will all benefit from reduced journey and commuting times, safer roads, better and safer public transport services, improved drinking water and surface water quality and improved health, housing, education and community facilities. The economic growth we have enjoyed in recent years is giving us the opportunity to make up for the years of under-investment and to ensure that the public have the <Col N="195" /> infrastructure and services to underpin a high quality of life.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to provide for the development of the national infrastructure is demonstrated in the national development plan. The commitment has been matched by unprecedented financial resources and the ongoing special attention of the Cabinet. I am, therefore, confident that the infrastructural investment programme of the NDP will be fully implemented and I look forward to the continued support of Members of the House in achieving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate; it is a pity more time was not made available. The matter should be discussed on another occasion outside <Col N="196" /> Private Members' business because it is most important. The Minister said that more than half of the plan's 51 billion investment is dedicated to economic, social and environmental infrastructure. These programmes cover roads, public transport, water, waste water and its management, sustainable energy, social housing, health facilities and urban and village development. Senator O'Toole referred to downturns in the economy and said that in ten years, there will be no manufacturing jobs left in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

      <P>We will all be teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole elaborated on that point and said that was the way matters are developing. Ireland will spend 102 billion over the next few years, but that is where we will end up. I have called on a number of occasions for a debate on the BMW region which is not receiving a fair share of funding.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made an important point that manufacturing jobs could be lost because of high wages and the fact that the Government is not investing sufficiently in research and development. I agree the Government should invest more funds in this area. While there has been massive growth in recent years in the IT sector, which on balance has lifted the whole country, we are not putting in place research and development facilities. The Minister should take up this aspect with his colleagues in Government because if we do not fund this area, we are going nowhere as a nation. Senator O'Toole is correct that we could be facing into a downward trend in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes I have left, I wish to be parochial and ask the Minister to look at the N5 route. While he said the national development plan will be in place for the next five or six years, there is no funding available for the national primary route from Charlestown to Tarmonbarry&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;other than funds to buy maps to outline the route. This is not sufficient because the area will be left way behind. There is no funding available for the N5, an area which has also a very poor rail service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will indicate it is not true. I would draw Senator Cassidy's attention to the needs study which took place 15 years before any development to the N5. The Minister mentioned in his speech all the national routes, bar the N5. He should clarify if funding is being made available for that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="197" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned many routes to the Border, Cork, Limerick and the five cities outside Dublin. He also mentioned bus routes, Luas, the DART and the N4 to Galway but there is no mention of the N5.</P>
      <P>Two or three years ago, the Minister prioritised various local authorities for funding for small sewerage schemes. In the past two years, he has not prioritised any small schemes for funding, those for small towns with a population of less than 1,000. This would be of major benefit to schemes on the outskirts of towns which are coming under a lot of pressure. I hope this year the Minister will allocate funding to local authorities throughout the country for small sewerage schemes.</P>
      <P>I am not pleased with what the Minister has outlined in the national development plan for the BMW region. I have asked the Leader of the House on numerous occasions for a debate on how the BMW region is faring in terms of funding compared to other regions because I believe we are not receiving our fair share. The Dublin region is getting a national stadium, which I welcome, together with Luas, motorways and so on. It is time the BMW region, which includes Senator Cassidy's area, was taken into consideration. I ask the Minister to consider funding for the N5 and the small sewerage schemes to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Ms Quill Ms Quill">
      <NameTxt>Ms Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In three minutes I will make three points and I hope Members will not think I am the cribber of the month. I do not have time to put on record my approval of the plan or my optimism that it will sow the seeds of good development into the next generation and beyond. I regret that I must draw to the Minister's attention aspects that need to be attended to.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to extend the railway lines, including the Cork to Midleton and Cork to Blarney lines which will be reopened. That railways service worked well 100 years ago and there is no reason why it should not work well now. I would like to see more investment in railways because there will not be a good quality of life if the number of cars on the roads continues to increase, regardless of how fine the roads are. We must invest money in public transport and put better management in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the lack of cohesion between the different elements of the public service. For example, I travelled this morning from Cork on the intercity train, which is an excellent train service from Cork to Dublin. When I arrived in Dublin I had to wait for a taxi. Even though there are a fair number of taxis available, to get a taxi from Heuston Station one must come out on to St. John's Road West which carries the heaviest volume of traffic in the country and where taxis must compete with the flow of traffic to pick up people <Col N="198" /> who come off the train. If a taxi rank was positioned at the other side of the station opposite the Ashling Hotel, it would eliminate that bottleneck. That simple change to create a space for taxis would make a huge difference. I ask the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>In any other European country, one could buy a ticket in Cork which would also allow one to travel on buses. Why should one have to purchase tickets in railway stations, bus stations and so on? Are we not intelligent enough to introduce some cohesion in this area which would add to the quality of life?</P>
    <P>On the non-national routes, I am pleased at the money being invested in this area. However, road-building is more than just road-surfacing. Road-building is a package of measures made up of proper advance signage, proper directional signage, proper safety signage and proper lane and line markings. Sometimes we fall down on that aspect. I found myself in a part of north Cork recently and I might as well have been in the Sahara Desert. Every time I arrived at a crossroads, there was no sign, and I did not know whether I was travelling north, south, east or west. I pity tourists trying to navigate their way in that type of situation, which I do not exaggerate.</P>
    <P>I flew from Cork Airport to Dublin Airport on Monday. Millions of pounds have been ploughed into Dublin Airport in the recent past but whoever is responsible for the modernisation of the airport is a sadist. One would only find such a place in the most horrible of horror films. Anyone who goes through the arrivals or departure area at that airport will never have to go to Lough Derg. There are times when one's stocking is so torn at the heel that stitching and darning will not be sufficient and it must be thrown out. Dublin Airport is a nightmare which needs to be addressed. I do not know how this can be done but whoever designed the airport needs to be made accountable for the obstacles he has put in the way of people who use the airport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is listening to me. Those are three key points. If quality of life is his priority, those are three very tangible matters for him to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion has generated much good debate and some good points have been made. Of all the contributions, there was none finer than the Minister's. He showed a breadth of vision and a comprehensive knowledge of what needs to be done and what is in the plan. This is only what we expect from somebody who is one of the architects of this plan, which is the most ambitious ever to come before either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these plans was in the late 1980s when our public finances were in an appalling condition. The overriding objective was to control them and to tackle the very serious unemployment problem we had. We were successful in both of those. If this plan is pursued with the same commitment and dedication, it should yield the <Col N="199" /> results that we all aspire to. Improving the quality of life has been identified as the overriding objective of the plan. As we become more affluent, this becomes a greater priority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the plan is a comprehensive blueprint for the future and not merely about roads, rail, waste, water treatment etc. Putting £500 million into the technology fund is a major new initiative. Given that we are now the number one exporter of computer software in the world, it is appropriate that we should invest heavily in that sector. People with skills are required to ensure that we keep up with the tremendous pace of change in that industry and bed it down as a key industry for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced £100 million for sewage treatment plants in rural towns and villages. One of the Senators mentioned agriculture. The development of our food industry is one of the key objectives in the plan which has a wide remit.</P>
    <P>While road and rail form only part of the plan, quality of life will hinge on success in improving deficiencies in that area. The plan has a vision <Col N="200" /> of motorways or high standard dual carriageways between the major population centres and the capital city. Missing from the plan &ndash; I hope it will be in the next plan &ndash; is a proposal to connect those provincial population centres directly with the same standard of roads. If this is not done, we will attract investment into the city when we should be developing those other major population centres. I agree fully with what the Minister said about bypasses.</P>
    <P>In my area, we are looking at a second river crossing and consultants have been assessing this for almost two years. There needs to be fast-tracking so that the consultation process, which obviously needs to be thorough, can be done speedily and will not become an impediment to the objectives in the plan.</P>
    <P>At a time of economic success and significant surplus in the Exchequer, it is important that we invest wisely to secure a sustainable economy for future generations. This plan is the blueprint for that. I hope that it will be implemented in a way that will yield the results that are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will recall that I raised this matter on the Adjournment last year. It indicates the concerns I and members of the Midland Health Board have about the completion of Phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar. This project is especially important not only to the Mullingar and north Westmeath areas but also to County Longford. The current position is having a serious effect, especially on surgical beds. There are 57 official medical beds in the hospital and at the beginning of March this year, the lowest number of medical patients had been 75 and the highest had been 114. On eight days there were more than 100 medical patients, while the average number was 95 beds. It can be appreciated that in such <Col N="201" /> a situation, medical emergencies occupy surgical beds on a regular basis and elective gynaecology beds to a lesser extent.</P>
      <P>The shell of Phase 2B exists and there is an expectation among the public in the north Westmeath and Longford areas which has led to anger that the project is not up and running. We appreciate and are grateful for the marvellous funding we have received from the Government. We are especially grateful to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Cowen, who gave us the funding to commission Phase 2A. However, time moves on and we cannot sit on our laurels. Much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>The Phase 2B brief contains an acute psychiatric admission unit, medical assessment unit, operating department, pathology department, day surgery, palliative care department, on-call accommodation, staff changing facilities and an administration department. Additional departments were requested for inclusion in Phase 2B by the project team and subsequently by the Midland Health Board of which I am honoured to be a member, with my colleague, Senator Cassidy. We have asked the Minister and the Department to consider providing what the brief contains.</P>
      <P>The existing number of medical beds is 57. On completion of Phase 2B, that number will have risen to 93. The number of surgical beds, which stands at 57, will increase to 62, and that will include 19 five-day beds and 12 day beds or trolleys. We have no rehabilitation beds at present, but there will be 15. We have 25 paediatric beds, the number of which will not change, neither will the number of obstetric or gynaecology beds. The number of intensive care unit beds will increase from three to six and coronary care unit beds will increase from three to six. The Minister of State will appreciate, given my background, that the acute psychiatric unit is important to me and also to people who suffer from psychiatric illness in the Longford-Westmeath catchment area.</P>
      <P>It is important that the next stage of the development of Phase 2B is approved as a matter of urgency. I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to do everything possible to expedite the appointment of the design team to allow the development of Phase 2B to proceed. There is impatience with the manner in which it is proceeding. I accept there are difficulties and additional costs, but I appeal to the Minister of State to look on it as favourably as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything Senator Glynn has called for. He is a long-standing member of the health board and will be the incoming chairman this summer. He has vast experience in the health service, having devoted all his life to the service of the people of the midlands. We realise that eight stages are involved in this plan before work will commence on Phase 2B. We are at stage three and we understand from our briefing with the consultants, health board officials <Col N="202" /> and representatives of the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital some months ago that, with the best will in the world and with everything in place and running on time, this project will not be able to commence until the autumn of 2002.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, our job as public representatives and members of the health board is to ensure the Government allocates the £30 million or more needed to allow the project proceed to the design team and tender documents stages. As the project is enormous, it must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. The building is in place and everything is ready. It only requires funding to be made available. If it is not available, I sincerely hope that the Estimates going through Government include this project. This is the number one project for us as public representatives of the midland counties of Longford and Westmeath. The investment by previous Governments and by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Cowen, in Longford-Westmeath General Hospital has been substantial, with the result that it now has one of the finest hospital units in the country. The staff are magnificent and do a wonderful job, carrying out their work above and beyond the call of duty.</P>
      <P>The increase in population has created a huge need. Twenty years ago, Mullingar had a population of 8,000. Westmeath County Council is now putting in place infrastructure for water and sewerage for a town of 50,000. Road and rail improvements and the fact that we are so close to Dublin are indicators that Mullingar will soon be an arm of Dublin, with O'Connell Street only 40 minutes away. We need to have the finance in place for this necessary wing, the structure of which is already built. I hope funding will be made available soon for this necessary project.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt): I am pleased to address the Seanad on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>As the Senators will be aware, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, approved the establishment of a project team in May 1999 to commence the planning of the Phase 2B development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. In keeping with normal practice in major capital developments of this type, the project team was asked to prepare a written design brief for the development of Phase 2B, taking into account the considerable detail involved in developing a brief of this type. The brief for the hospital development indicated that Phase 2B would include the following departments: pathology, theatres, general medicine, general surgery, day surgery, administration services, isolation facilities, staff changing rooms and staff rest rooms. The urgent requirement for an acute psychiatric unit on the site was highlighted subsequent to the development of the original Phase 2 brief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The brief was received in the Department on 16 November 2000. In a letter from the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board, which accompanied the brief, he indicated that the project team was anxious that intensive care and coronary care be included in Phase 2B and that the budget allocated for this purpose should enable these departments to proceed. The chief executive officer also expressed the view of the project team that, in the event of additional national development plan funding or other capital funding being made available, the outstanding departments not already included in Phase 2B should proceed as part of the Phase 2B contract. These include a rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy, a catering department, day services, other than surgical, and ICU/CCU.</P>
    <P>A further letter on 10 January 2001 from the <Col N="204" /> secretary of the Midland Health Board to the Secretary General of the Department indicated that board members had unanimously adopted a motion calling on my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to give a firm commitment on the inclusion of the ICU/CCU, rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy department, catering department and day services in Phase 2B of the Longford-Westmeath development.</P>
    <P>The additional accommodation is a substantial additional cost on the Phase 2B proposal for which the project team was appointed. My Department will consider these additional proposals in the light of the availability of funding under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 April 2001.</P>
