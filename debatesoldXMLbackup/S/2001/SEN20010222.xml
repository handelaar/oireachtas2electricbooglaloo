      <P>I have received notice from Senator Keogh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the crisis in residential child care and the lack of places for young people at risk resulting in teenagers being accommodated in bed and breakfasts, Garda stations and hotels.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, motion re the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam with regard to the extension of the Dublin Convention arrangements to Norway and Iceland to be taken without debate; No. 2, the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes; No. 3, Broadcasting Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee Stage (resumed). Business will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The business as outlined is agreeable. I want to make an appeal to the wider public to co-operate with the authorities to ensure that foot and mouth disease is curtailed. The consequences of the disease entering Ireland are too awful to contemplate but the responsibility for its curtailment rests not just with the authorities. The safeguarding of the country depends on the widest co-operation of many people, truckers, farmers, travellers, etc. The word should go out from this House that all par<Col N="570" /> ties are fully behind the authorities in trying to prevent this disease reaching Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Manning. It would be useful to show a sense of concern, not that Members can add much in terms of technological knowledge. It would be helpful if a Minister would reassure the House and use that opportunity to outline what steps are being taken to curtail the disease. There is a danger that people will not give full information. Problems have occurred because some farmers were reluctant to discuss problems and I would appreciate a Minister taking 20 minutes to come to the House today to outline the current policy. As Senator Manning rightly pointed out, it is not a party political matter but something everybody has a deep interest in. Ironically, we had a long debate last night on the food industry and it is not that we need to discuss that issue further, rather we would like to hear a Minister's views as well as showing commitment on this matter.</P>
      <P>The question of housing is another that the Leader should come back to. Housing has gone off the agenda as there have been many other things in the news in recent times. The difficulties and costs for young people buying houses, and the problems created by families having to double and treble up in houses, have a high cost for society. I ask the Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, to come to the House to explain how the Bacon initiatives are working, what impact they are having and how the issue is to be dealt with in the future. The take-up of local authority supported initiatives is another issue to be discussed as is the increase in some mortgage time-spans to 30 years.</P>
      <P>The housing problem is not just a single issue. There are many aspects to the problem, and Members are hearing about these from constituents. The importance of dealing with this issue on behalf of young people is hugely important at a time when they are disengaged from politics and we should show our concern and put forward our proposals on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the call for maximum co-operation on the curtailment of foot and mouth disease. There is a possibility that the disease will hop across the channel to Ireland. We seem to be going from crisis to crisis in the agricultural sector but there is nothing that would be more damaging to the farming community and the national community than an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Maximum co-operation by the farming community, the road haulage community and the public is needed. It would be valuable if the Minister came to the House to outline what measures are being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers' dispute is another issue which has not gone away. Today's newspapers claim that the commissioner for data protection has ruled in favour of the teachers, stating that the <Col N="571" /> money deducted during the work-to-rule was deducted illegally&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are negotiations under way on this matter and it is not appropriate that we should have a debate on it on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of discussing the negotiations. This matter has been resolved. The data commissioner has made his report and it is now a public matter. Because of the deductions, negotiations have been delayed for over two months and I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science not to appeal the commissioner's decision. If he does appeal, negotiations could be delayed further and the threat to examinations would increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the appeal to farmers and the wider public to do all in their power to ensure that foot and mouth disease does not come to this country. It is primarily a matter of individual responsibility. The Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are also aware of their responsibilities and I am pleased that they have acted quickly to trace a lorry to Virginia which had visited a facility in England where the outbreak occurred.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, it is more than 60 years since we had the disease in Ireland but it is very contagious. If people are visiting England they should avoid going to farms, meat factories or other agricultural facilities. In the event that they do visit such facilities, they should report to Irish port authorities when they return so that they can be traced in the event of an unfortunate occurrence.</P>
      <P>While BSE is very serious and has had a devastating effect, this would be nothing by comparison to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, not just for agriculture but for the whole country. I join with Senator Manning in that matter.</P>
      <P>The teachers' dispute is at arbitration and we should not say anything to prejudice that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Senators' concerns about doing everything possible to avoid the foot and mouth disease that could devastate farming which has had so many body blows recently.</P>
      <P>Regardless of arbitration, we did expect the education problem and the threat to examinations would have been resolved when we came back at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no control over this matter in this House and it certainly is not appropriate to the Order of Business. Any debate here might only exacerbate the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not looking for a debate. We are encouraging the Minister to do everything in his power to go the right way about <Col N="572" /> resolving this issue, particularly in the light of the debacle over the withdrawal of payments before Christmas. We raised that issue and the Minister simply deducted the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senators Manning, Dardis and others have said about everything possible being done by all concerned to ensure that the deadly disease, foot and mouth, should not spread to this country or any further in England. I remember in 1968, I think, when we had the last foot and mouth scare here and sporting fixtures had to be abandoned. This disappointed me because I was involved with greyhounds at the time and greyhound fixtures could not take place. It would be very disappointing for some of us here if a very important sporting fixture were abandoned across the sea. However, if sporting or any other fixtures have to be abandoned so be it. I appeal to everyone concerned to ensure all precautions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very useful debate last night on Senator Feargal Quinn's motion about the public health aspects of BSE. I ask the Leader for a debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to discuss the environmental aspects of this problem. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Department are being asked to deal with the whole problem whereas there is far more competence in other Departments on this issue. It would be worth hearing the views of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the serious difficulties with the disposal of carcases and specified risk material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for total co-operation, not alone from the farming community and the haulage industry but the public also. It is essential to protect the agriculture industry and we should take all steps to do that. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation may have a responsibility here. The travelling public have a vital role to play. Leaflets should be prepared and given to those who are travelling that would give guidance. We must stop the disease entering this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any further references to the foot and mouth outbreak can only be repetitious. I know that the call that has gone out from here this morning has the support of all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with you. We all support the steps taken by the Government so I will say no more on it.</P>
      <P>I rejoice in your innocence if you think the debate on the ASTI could be further exacerbated. A few days ago two senior officials were knocking lumps out of each other and the police had to be called. I do not know how it could be exacerbated any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I raise a question about Borneo. I ask the Leader, with all the urgency at my command, to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to contact immediately the Indonesian ambassador regarding the situation in Borneo. There is news today following an outbreak of violence there that the Indonesian authorities intend to saturate the area under their control with troops. Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs we heard evidence from Mr. Iten, a distinguished Swiss journalist, about events that occurred under Indonesian control in West Papua at the beginning of December. Horrendous human rights abuses, torture and murder on a wide scale are being carried out by the Indonesian military. They have learnt nothing from the situation in East Timor. If we do not utter a protest, there will be a further massacre in the interests of the American, Canadian and Australian mining companies that are exploiting the natural resources of these regions. We really must protest in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your comments on foot and mouth disease. However, I am talking about a different type of foot and mouth disease. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if he intends to have any training for the Judiciary in view of the most intemperate and inappropriate language used recently in a case, which got widespread media coverage. In some realms of society, things have not moved on at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention that we do not criticise the Judiciary in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not naming anybody in particular. I appreciate your point, but it does not mean that they do not deserve the criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>To allow both sides to have space to enter the negotiations fully, the less said about the teachers dispute, the better and so we should not speak about it.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science should urgently take note of the lack of psychological services that still exist in many parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate last night on BSE and I understand the point the Chair is making about continuing on the subject of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate yesterday on the Electoral Bill, I was reminded of the strategic management initiative started about four years and about which we have heard very little since. When discussing electronic voting yesterday, I was impressed at how far we are slipping behind the ambitions we had of making sure that we would become the electronic hub of Europe. There is a huge difference between the different Departments in their ability to become Internet com<Col N="574" /> pliant. Those of us who use the Internet have found that some Departments are way ahead of others. Some are really with it and some are way behind. Who is handling the strategic management initiative?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dick Roche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could he come here to debate how that is progressing? It was developed in, I think, 1996 with a big fanfare. It may be going on behind the scenes with great success but we do not know about it. It would be a useful debate to have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator O'Toole's proposal for a debate on housing, particularly bearing in mind the recent statement by the Irish House Builders Association that they will not meet their targets for completed buildings this year. It is worthy of debate. It is part of the PPF and it is important that we look at it in the context of our housing strategy and in light of consideration of the review of the 9% levy taking the investor out of the whole business. It is important and worthy of a debate.</P>
      <P>I add my support to the Department of Agriculture and all affected groups in the foot and mouth scare. It is interesting to note the total withdrawal of meat and all food products from food halls on Grafton Street this morning. It is important to note the amount of imported food products and the part we all have to play to protect our natural resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to the case made by Senator Quinn in regard to the SMI. I raised this two weeks ago during the debate on the Agriculture Appeals Bill and referred, in particular, to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. A debate with the relevant Minister would be in order and I ask the Leader of the House to consider this proposal. The SMI committee which, I think, is still chaired by Deputy Roche &ndash; I was vice-chair some years ago &ndash; did excellent work. Up to 18 months ago I was up to speed with its work but I am not sure what it is doing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has got better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roche is up to speed on the work and I am sure the relevant Minister, whom I think is Deputy Cullen, may be able to oblige the Leader in his request for a debate. One of the best aspects of the House is our greater degree of flexibility than the Lower House in terms of responding to national crises and issues of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to trespass on your patience, a Chathaoirligh, and refer to the pleas made this morning on the foot and mouth issue. I commend the Minister for his speedy response. On top of the BSE crisis, the importance of this issue cannot be underestimated. As I was entering the <Col N="575" /> Chamber a Senator on the Government side referred to the economic impact of a further catastrophe not only for farmers and the meat trade but for all international fixtures between the two islands. Given that Cheltenham is only down the road, so to speak, this issue has huge economic implications for another industry which is extremely important to us. Would it be possible to allocate time today &ndash; we could suspend business &ndash; so that the Minister can up-date the House on the position on this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your ruling, a Chathaoirligh, that it is not appropriate to criticise the Judiciary in the House. This has always <Col N="576" /> been a part of the procedure in both Houses of the Oireachtas. However, given that Ministers appoint members of the Judiciary under legislation passed by the House we should be able to criticise members of the Judiciary when they abuse their position. Judge Connellan deserves to be censured by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his comments in a case in Newbridge a few days ago.</P>

      <P>The second issue relates to the IBTS which has decided to cover itself under privilege and not release documentation to the Lindsay tribunal. Its behaviour is absolutely despicable and deserves to be condemned by the House.

      <P>On item No. 2, I proposed ten minutes for the main speakers but intended to propose 15 minutes. I seek the permission of the House to allocate 15 minutes for the main spokespersons and seven minutes for all other Senators.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Jackman, Rory Kiely, Callanan, Chambers and Doyle expressed serious concern about the alarm bells which have been sounded by the incidence of foot and mouth disease in the UK and the involvement of a truck from Virginia, County Cavan. I wish to be associated with the congratulations offered to the Minister and Government for moving speedily and effectively on this serious issue. I intend to have the Minister present in the House next week to give us an up-date on the position. As requested by the Senators, I hope that people who have been on farms or been in contact with an agricultural processing plant will act responsibly in the national interest and in the interests of all concerned in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Senators O'Toole and Chambers called for a debate on the up-to-date situation on housing and the progress and effectiveness of Bacon One, Two and Three. I will allocate time for this debate. I will pass the comments made by Senators Costello, Dardis, Jackman, Ormonde and Walsh on the teachers' dispute to the Minister for Education and Children. Following the good debate in the House last night on BSE, Senator Henry called for a further debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government present. I will pass Senator Norris's views on human rights abuses in Indonesia to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will pass the views expressed by Senators Keogh and Taylor-Quinn to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will pass Senator Ormonde's views to the Minister for Education and Children.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Doyle referred to the SMI. I understand that the Committee on Finance and Public Service has this issue on its agenda for this session. I will pass their views to the chairman of the committee. Senator Ridge referred to the Bill debated yesterday. The use of photographs is provided for in the Bill. The Minister stressed that the photograph would have to be an up-to-date one. I will pass Senator Taylor-Quinn's views on the provisions of documents to the Lindsay tribunal to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill before the Seanad today. The Bill is an enabling measure to give the force of law in Ireland to two international conventions and three related instruments dealing with co-operation and mutual assistance for customs administrations within the European Union in the fight against organised crime, particularly in the areas of serious smuggling and drug trafficking. Ireland has already signed all these instruments subject to adoption and it is necessary to give them the force of law before we can proceed formally to adopt them.</P>
      <P>International co-operation in customs matters is not something new. On its accession to the EEC in 1973, Ireland became a party to the Naples Convention which had been drawn up in 1967. That convention has proved to be an invaluable tool to the customs administrations in the European Union in dealing with cases involving smuggling of prohibited substances such as drugs, restricted goods such as guns and ammunition and dutiable goods such as alcohol and tobacco products. It has served us well over its lifetime and an illustration of its effectiveness can be seen over the past three years when close to 200 million illegal cigarettes have been seized by Irish customs based, in significant measure, on intelligence and information received under mutual assistance arrangements. The loss of this quantity of cigarettes to the criminal organisations involved both here in Ireland and overseas has had severe repercussions for their finances. These seizures have affected the level of supply to the marketplace and have also forced the criminals involved to alter their routes and methods accordingly.</P>
      <P>The battle against smuggling has also been assisted by the creation in 1999 within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of a central risk analysis unit which monitors commercial freight information in an effort to target bogus consignments, including illicit drugs, and contraband goods, concealed in regular traffic patterns. This unit collates and analyses current worldwide smuggling trends produced internationally with a view to identifying similar <i>modus operandi</i> being used in Ireland. I am pleased that this unit has made an immediate, important contribution to the fight against organised, international criminal activity since its inception which resulted in the seizure of large numbers of cigarettes in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have used the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; on a number of occasions already and I make no apology for that because the types of activity being perpetrated by international organisations involved in serious smuggling is highly detrimental to us all. In this regard, Members will join with me when I single out for particular mention the scourge of drugs. More than any other commodity, illicit drugs need to be stopped at our borders. The record of the customs service and the Garda Síochána in intercepting both drugs <Col N="579" /> shipments and internal movements has been commendable in recent years and must be sustained. Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between customs and the Garda Síochána in January 1996 there has been a co-ordinated approach to the fight against drugs and the criminals who are engaged in this evil trade. This memorandum has been strengthened further by the agreement of an operational protocol on day-to-day issues which was signed recently.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that sustained progress continues to be made against the drug barons. Members will be aware that the Criminal Assets Bureau was set up in 1996 to identify, seize and investigate the assets of criminal activity. The bureau comprises officers drawn from the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Not surprisingly, customs has had continued liaison with the Criminal Assets Bureau since its inception, involving both general contact on an informal basis and the formal exchange of information and intelligence, including details of drug and cash seizures made from individuals and the property of individuals involved or suspected to be involved in drug smuggling. Many of the successes of the Criminal Assets Bureau may be attributed to the quality of the information and intelligence provided by customs.</P>
    <P>In addressing the drugs issue, I have concentrated on our efforts in the enforcement area which is of most relevance in the context of the Bill. However, Members will understand that effective enforcement measures are only one aspect of addressing the overall drugs problem facing society. The Bill is focused clearly on helping to limit the supply and availability of drugs. Members will appreciate that it is necessary to address the demand side of the drugs problem also. While I do not propose to go into this aspect in detail here, the consistent approach adopted to date in that context has been based on two key elements, reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drugs free lifestyle. I am pleased the relevant State agencies, in partnership with many voluntary bodies, are actively involved in pursuing these twin objectives. I mention these activities merely to emphasise the importance which the Government attaches to adopting a broad, multi-disciplinary approach to the drugs problem, part of which involves the enactment of the Bill that is before the House.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that this Bill is enabling legislation which must be enacted before this country can adopt two international conventions and three related instruments in the area of co-operation and mutual assistance between the customs administrations in the member states of the European Union. It will give the force of law <Col N="580" /> in Ireland to these five instruments and it will be possible for Ireland to adopt them at European Union level only when it is enacted. Each member state of the Union is required to adopt these instruments in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. The five instruments involved are: the Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes &ndash; the CIS convention; an agreement to enable certain member states to apply the CIS convention in an interim period until all are in a position to adopt it; a protocol to the CIS convention dealing with the role of the European Court of Justice; a second protocol to the CIS Convention to remedy two deficiencies identified in it; and the Convention on Mutual Assistance and Co-operation between Customs Administrations. The Bill is comparatively short and, for ease of reference, the five instruments are appended to it in both English and Irish, the texts being equally authentic in both languages.</P>
    <P>I propose to give the background to the two conventions and related instruments before turning to the detail of the individual sections. The Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes &ndash; the CIS convention &ndash; was signed by all member states on 26 July 1995 and provides for the establishment of a customs information system. The system comprises a computerised central database located in Brussels, with terminals in each member state linked to the central database, allowing for the rapid dissemination of information and intelligence about illegal movements over internal frontiers so that effective action can be taken by customs to combat all forms of smuggling. The central database will carry information on commodities, means of transport, businesses, persons, fraud trends and availability of expertise. By using the central database, customs administrations will be able to pass on information about suspect movements, carry out discreet surveillance or specific checks and report the results to any of or all the other customs administrations concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the CIS convention, only nominated national authorities are allowed access to and use of data on the central database. Such nominated national authorities must take appropriate measures to protect the security of data which they have accessed. The convention lays down detailed rules about what data may be included on the database and member states are required to have national law in place giving a level of protection to data which is at least equal to that in the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection. The Data Protection Act, 1988, gave effect to that convention in Ireland so it will apply in respect of data held on the database. The Revenue Commissioners will fully respect their obligations under this Act. Data will only be included on the database on the basis of prior illegal activities or where there are real indications to suggest that the person concerned has <Col N="581" /> committed, is in the act of committing, or will commit serious contraventions of national law.</P>
    <P>In the CIS convention, there are specific limits to the data which may be included on the database and individuals have the right to access data about themselves as well as the right to have data checked, corrected or deleted and to have their rights vindicated in the courts. Members should note that personal data relating to such sensitive issues as racial origin, political opinion, religious or other beliefs and details of an individual's health or sexual life may not be included on the database. I assure Members that the database will not contain information on immigrants or their movements. Neither will it contain details on illegal trafficking of people, as these are matters which are outside the remit of customs. The CIS convention also provides for independent supervision of data to protect the rights of individuals. In Ireland, the data protection commissioner will perform this function.</P>
    <P>The convention provides that each member state is responsible in accordance with its national law for any injury caused through the use of the database in its territory, including injury arising from inaccurate data supplied by another member state or data supplied by another member state which should not have been included on the database. Where injury is caused as a result of data provided by another member state, the apportionment of liability will be subject to agreement between the states concerned. The CIS convention also lays down an elaborate framework for the management and supervision of the database. I will provide more details about these management and supervisory structures later as I appreciate that Members of this House have a particular interest in this whole area of data protection. I mentioned that, in addition to the CIS convention itself, this Bill gives legal effect to an agreement on provisional application of the convention and two protocols to it. I will now elaborate on each of these three instruments.</P>
    <P>The agreement on provisional application was signed on the same date as the convention itself and allows it to be applied by some but not all the member states in an interim period until such time as all are in a position to adopt it. This arrangement emerged from a recognition that certain member states would have to introduce legislation to give effect to certain provisions in the CIS convention before they could adopt it and that this could slow down the overall process. One particular issue that arose before the CIS convention was signed was whether the European Court of Justice should have power to interpret its provisions. There was no agreement between member states on this point at the time but a compromise was worked out subsequently, resulting in a protocol to the CIS convention being drawn up which enabled each member state to accept such a role for the court on an opt-in basis. Ireland signed the protocol, subject to adoption, on 29 November 1996. The protocol confers jurisdiction on the court to rule on dis<Col N="582" /> putes between member states and between member states and the Commission regarding the application of the convention.</P>
    <P>The protocol also confers jurisdiction on the court to interpret the convention but makes the application of this clause by national courts conditional on a declaration to be made at the time of signature, or at any time thereafter, to the effect that the member states will accept the court's jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the convention. In relation to the application of the CIS convention, member states which are prepared to accept the court's jurisdiction may specify whether courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under their national law, or all their national courts or tribunals, will be in a position to ask the court for preliminary rulings.</P>
    <P>Ireland made a declaration at the time of signing the protocol to the effect that it would agree to give only those courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law the right to request a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the CIS convention from the Court of Justice. In practice, this means that only the Supreme Court will be in a position to request a preliminary ruling. This reflected Ireland's position in relation to similar jurisdiction provisions in other EU conventions. The reason for adopting such an approach is the serious difficulty that could arise under our legal system if criminal trials had to be suspended for lengthy periods while rulings were obtained from the court.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparing for the implementation of the provisions of the CIS convention, two deficiencies were identified in the convention. The first deficiency related to the items of information which could be placed on the database. It was discovered that member states' customs administrations could not include the registration number of the means of transport of smuggled goods on the database even though this additional data element could be very useful. The second deficiency related to the information which could be placed on the database in connection with money laundering. While the CIS convention provided for an exchange of information on money laundering specifically in connection with illicit international drug trafficking, it did not provide for exchanges of information on money laundering in connection with other types of crime which involved infringements of Union and national customs laws. In the interests of ensuring a comprehensive response to all types of smuggling, it was necessary to draw up a second protocol to remedy the two deficiencies. This was signed on 12 March 1999, subject to adoption.</P>
    <P>The fifth instrument to which the Bill gives legal effect is the Convention on Mutual Assistance and Co-operation between Customs Administrations &ndash; the customs co-operation convention &ndash; signed by all member states on 18 December 1997, subject to adoption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> As I have mentioned already, on its accession to the EEC in 1973, Ireland became a party to the 1967 Naples Convention. Since then, that convention has been the principal legal instrument available for the provision of mutual assistance allowing customs administrations to exchange useful information and intelligence as well as assisting in the investigation of breaches of customs law. By the early 1990s, it became apparent to member states that the Naples convention was in need of revision so that customs administrations would have the means to tackle cross-border smuggling activities effectively in the context of a single market without internal frontiers. As a result, the updated customs co-operation convention, known informally as &ldquo;Naples II&rdquo;, was concluded under Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union. First and foremost, the customs co-operation convention updates provisions in the Naples convention. However, it also extends the scope of the Naples convention in several ways. In particular, it provides for special forms of co-operation between customs administrations not existing heretofore. I will come back to these forms of co-operation in greater detail shortly.</P>
    <P>The customs co-operation convention provides that customs administrations may exchange information and intelligence on the basis of both formal and spontaneous requests. In conducting any such exchanges, the customs administrations must act in accordance with their national legislative powers in applying the provisions of the convention. Formal requests for assistance must be channelled through specific contact points in each member state and, in providing assistance in response to requests, which must be in writing, the requested administration must act as if the request had emanated from within its own country. All reasonable measures must be taken to comply with a request for assistance and, in certain circumstances, officials from the applicant administration may visit the offices of the requested administration to obtain further information. The requested administration can be asked to carry out surveillance on suspect persons and on means of transport, goods and places. While a representative of the applicant administration may be present as an observer in the course of inquiries carried out by the requested administration, provided both agree, only officers of the requested administration may conduct the actual inquiries. In certain cases, where it may not be practicable for operational reasons to make a formal request for assistance, a customs administration may make a spontaneous request and this must be acted on expeditiously. A spontaneous request will be followed up with a formal request in due course.</P>
    <P>Member states which obtain information under the convention must treat it as confidential. Such information may only be used for the purposes specified in the convention but it can also be used as evidence in the receiving member state in accordance with national law. The convention has a standard of data protection which is similar to <Col N="584" /> the CIS convention, which I have referred to in some detail.</P>
    <P>I made a brief reference earlier to the special forms of co-operation provided for in the customs co-operation convention. These are significant provisions which enable customs administrations to engage in special forms of cross-border co-operation in respect of certain types of infringements such as cases involving illicit traffic in drugs, weapons, munitions and serious cases of smuggling of taxable goods. These special forms of co-operation are hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, controlled delivery, covert investigations and joint special investigation teams.</P>
    <P>However, the convention allows member states to opt out of applying some of these provisions, that is, hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance and covert investigations. The Government proposes to avail of the opt out provision and will make a declaration to this effect when Ireland lodges its instruments of adoption of the convention. Most of the other member states intend to apply the provisions and their position is facilitated by the fact that they are already party to the Schengen convention which contains similar arrangements for co-operation. Neither Ireland nor the UK are signatories to the Schengen convention. Notwithstanding this fact, there is provision in the Schengen Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty for Ireland and the UK to identify those parts of the Schengen Acquis in which they wish to participate and to ask, at any time, to take part. While Ireland has now lodged an application to participate in selected provisions of Schengen, it is not proposed to participate in the arrangements for special co-operation.</P>
    <P>The other provisions for special co-operation, that is, controlled delivery and joint special investigation teams, are mandatory. Members of this House may not be familiar with what these activities entail and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the position. Controlled delivery is an investigation technique in which consignments of prohibited or restricted goods are not seized at the frontier but are kept under surveillance until they reach their destination. This helps customs services to identify and prosecute organisations responsible for smuggling goods such as tobacco on which duty has not been paid, for example, rather than just seizing such products at the frontier.</P>
    <P>The convention allows member states to set up, by mutual agreement, joint special investigation teams comprising officers from a number of member states with relevant specialist skills. These teams are aimed at improving the control and co-ordination of specific investigations relating to the prevention and detection of particular types of customs infringements. It is important to emphasise that they are purely investigatory and are not operational. They are intended to function only for specified periods and in relation to specific investigations.</P>
    <P>An officer from the member state where the team is located will be in charge and that member state will make the necessary arrangements for <Col N="585" /> the team to undertake its activities. All activities undertaken by such a team must be in accordance with the national law of the member state where these are being undertaken. The convention confers no additional powers of intervention on officers from one member state while they are acting in the territory of another, that is, they are subject to the national law of that member state. Thus, in the event of a joint special investigation team being established in Ireland, it will be headed by an Irish official and all of its activities will be subject to, and must be conducted in accordance with, Irish law.</P>
    <P>The customs co-operation convention contains a specific provision enabling the European Court of Justice to rule on disputes between member states and between member states and the Commission regarding its application. In common with the protocol to the CIS Convention, it also confers jurisdiction on the court to interpret the convention and contains similar conditions regarding what national courts may seek by way of a preliminary ruling. Ireland will make a similar declaration in relation to this matter as for the CIS Convention for the same reasons that I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>Operation of the customs co-operation convention centres on requests for assistance. It is important to note that a request under the convention may be refused where it is considered to be prejudicial to public policy or other essential interests and rights of the member state concerned, particularly in the field of data protection, or where the action requested is disproportionate to the gravity of the presumed offence. In any case where a request is being refused, reasons must be given for such a refusal.</P>
    <P>The final point that I wish to make regarding the five instruments relates to when they will come into force. In this regard both conventions are to enter into force 90 days after the last of the member states has adopted them. The agreement is to provisionally apply the CIS Convention to enter into force as and from the first day of the third month after the eighth member state has adopted it. Adoption of this agreement by those eight states will allow the convention to be applied provisionally subject to certain conditions specified in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement will cease to have effect when the convention enters into force. The current position is that eight member states have adopted the agreement and it has recently come into operation for those countries. As with the CIS Convention, both protocols are also to enter into force 90 days after the last of the member states has adopted them but cannot be implemented during the period of provisional application of that convention.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill. It is not my intention to spend an inordinate amount of time on the specific provisions since the explanatory memorandum contains a detailed commentary on the individual sections and their related provisions in the five instruments. As I <Col N="586" /> have mentioned already, the approach being taken is to give the five instruments the force of law in the State. This is at the heart of the Bill and the relevant provision is contained in section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 3 designates the Revenue Commissioners as the national authority for the purposes of Articles 7 and 8 of the CIS Convention, which deal with direct access to and use of the database, respectively. This means that, in Ireland, such access to and use of the database will be exercised by the Revenue Commissioners. The infrastructure for this system is already in place with over 20 terminals based at, among other locations, customs offices in ports and airports around the country.</P>
    <P>Section 4 designates the Revenue Commissioners as the competent customs administration for the purposes of Article 10 of the CIS Convention. That article requires each member state to designate a competent customs administration to take responsibility for the correct operation of the database within the member state and to ensure compliance with the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 9 are concerned with data protection and I propose to elaborate on these as I am aware that some Members of the House have a special interest in this topic. The 1981 Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection is the standard of protection laid down in respect of automated data dealt with under the instruments to which the Bill is giving legal effect. In Ireland, the Data Protection Act, 1988, gives effect to the principles on data protection laid down in that convention and the main purpose of section 5 is to apply that Act to relevant provisions in the five instruments, subject to modification where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 6 designates the Data Protection Commissioner as the national supervisory authority for the purposes of the conventions so that he will be empowered to monitor implementation of the data protection provisions in respect of automated data. This role for the commissioner also extends to being a member of the joint supervisory authority, consisting of representatives from the respective national supervisory authorities, with responsibility for examining difficulties of application or interpretation. Members will note that there is a strong emphasis throughout on independent supervision of the database and its operation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 creates an offence under the 1988 Act for the improper use of data on the database. Penalties for such offences are to be the same as those set out in section 31 of the 1988 Act, namely, a fine not exceeding £1,000, or 1,265, on summary conviction, or a fine not exceeding £50,000, or 63,485, on conviction on indictment. All of these sections deal only with data which is processed by automated means and I will shortly deal with the question of protecting non-automated, or manual, data in a few moments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> Section 7 deals with the special forms of co-operation set out in the customs co-operation convention. The convention provides for five special forms of co-operation. While two of these are mandatory, member states may decide to opt out of the others. Therefore, while the Bill will give the force of law to the convention, it is necessary to specify in it that the State shall not be bound by those provisions from which the opt out is being exercised.</P>
    <P>I have stated already that we are opting out of the relevant special forms of co-operation. If those considerations giving rise to Ireland opting out were to change at any point in the future and it was desired to avail of these provisions, further legislation would be required to amend subsection (1) of this section. However, by providing in subsection (2) for possible opt in later by way of Government order, the necessity of having to enact amending legislation is avoided. A draft of any such order would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and could not be made until a resolution approving of such draft had been passed by each House in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 11 contain provisions for the making of ministerial regulations which may appear to be necessary and expedient for carrying out the purposes of the Bill. As in the case of orders, a draft of any regulations under the Bill would also have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and could not be made until a resolution approving of such draft had been passed by each House. While the Bill does not specifically require the making of regulations in relation to any particular aspect of its provisions, it may be necessary at a later stage to consider the need for regulations if it emerges that there is a need to give effect to protection of personal data exchanged by manual means. Therefore, I am making specific provision for that purpose since, as I mentioned earlier, the existing national data protection legislation only applies to automated exchanges of data. Other than in the case of that specific issue, the purpose of these sections is merely to enable incidental requirements to be met from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the interpretation of both the CIS and customs co-operation conventions by the European Court of Justice by way of preliminary rulings and for judicial notice to be taken of such rulings. I have outlined how both the 1996 Protocol to the CIS Convention and the customs co-operation convention provide that member states may, by way of declaration, accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the conventions. As a further measure, those member states that accept the court's jurisdiction must declare whether they will allow all of their national courts or only those from whose decision there is no avenue of appeal to seek such preliminary rulings. At the time of signature of both instruments, Ireland decided on the latter option <Col N="588" /> in both cases to ensure that there will be as little disruption as possible to the progress of a criminal trial once it has commenced.</P>
    <P>The measures that are being given the force of law by this Bill are not new. For over 30 years, arrangements have been in place for customs administrations to assist and co-operate with each other in the ongoing fight against international criminals. We are building on that solid foundation with the measures which are covered by the Bill and I am confident that with these enhanced measures, the Revenue Commissioners will be even more successful than heretofore. Make no mistake, we have been successful in counteracting smuggling directly in Ireland and indirectly by helping customs administrations in other member states. However, as I have said before, this is an ongoing battle and we cannot bask in the successes of the past. We must focus resolutely on the future and put to good and effective use the enhanced provisions contained in the conventions and related instruments which are at the heart of this Bill. The fight against drugs, in particular, must be relentless and Members will agree that the measures being introduced by this Bill are very desirable in this regard. Both conventions and related instruments represent a comprehensive package of measures to enhance the present co-operation arrangements to assist customs administrations in preventing serious smuggling, illegal cross-frontier movement of illicit substances and products and generally in improving controls.</P>
    <P>Members from all sides of this House will find this Bill acceptable. I shall give careful consideration to the points which Members may make and to any suggestions for amendments that may occur in the course of the debate. Members will note that my speech was somewhat lengthy but I hope they will appreciate that I wanted to give the fullest information possible. I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his comprehensive overview of the Bill, which I welcome. As he has said, the Bill is a necessary enabling measure regarding conventions, protocols and agreements already signed up to pending enactment of this measure. The Bill is useful as well as necessary and will greatly strengthen the hand of customs and excise officials in combating international crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal measure in the Bill is the adoption of the EU convention on the customs information systems and it legislates for the provisional application of the convention. There are also two protocols to the convention which change the interpretation of key sections. A separate convention is also to be adopted on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations. All reasonably minded people would readily accept the necessity for the provisions contained in this Bill. Because of the ease of movement of people and goods within Europe, member states are hugely dependent on one <Col N="589" /> another's co-operation and goodwill in combating illegalities, whether the promotion and smuggling of drugs, money laundering, illegal acquisition of assets with the proceeds or international terrorism.</P>
    <P>We very much welcome the strengthening of the powers of customs and excise officials in their fight against organised crime. Unfortunately, a lot of the political advances in freeing up the movement of goods and people has increased crime and such activity internationally. The democratisation of eastern Europe, for example, has further facilitated mafia activities originating in Russia, Romania and other eastern European countries. Large amounts of armaments have found their way onto the black market and have become increasingly freely available. The various wars in former Yugoslavia have made vast quantities of arms available. The availability of this weaponry for crime has posed considerable problems and we, as a country, are not free from it. We also know from our recent past that guns and semtex were successfully smuggled into Ireland originating from sources ranging from former Czechoslovakia to Libya.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister of State that this Bill incorporating international agreements will much better position us to combat trafficking in illegal drugs which, sadly, is so prevalent in our country and which reduces the possibility of quasi-republican dissident groups importing arms which are freely available across Europe. This is very welcome.</P>
    <P>One of the most important provisions of the CIS Convention will allow for the establishment of computerised central databases with terminals in each member state and the inclusion on the databases of very significant information relevant to all areas which concern organised crime. This will encompass such matters as commodities, names of transport businesses, names of persons, fraud trends and any other relevant details. The intention is that the database will be constantly updated and the flow of information will be available to each of the member countries. We can see how important this is when we realise that 14 million people per annum pass through Dublin Airport and cars and trucks can come and go freely on ferries.</P>
    <P>Our drug problem has greatly escalated and is no longer confined to our major cities. Drugs have reached even our small villages and are extremely widespread. I wish the customs and excise officials and the Garda Síochána every success in their efforts and I hope they will be able to deal more successfully with these areas of crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has turned out to be a very important weapon in our armoury against drug related and other crime. However, we have seen how successfully some Irish people involved in this illicit trade have been able to deal from Amsterdam. Indeed, some of them have been able to live lives of luxury there. This shows how well developed their links are internationally and that there is a safe haven for them in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> In line with my party colleagues in the other House, I fully approve of our ratification of the convention and the continuing efforts which will flow from it. The customs information system will also be used to disseminate information in all areas of custom concern and will not be confined solely to the exchange of information on drugs and other sensitive goods. The convention on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations is also welcomed by my party. The provision is for mutual assistance and it allows the customs authorities to exchange useful information and intelligence in the investigation of breaches of customs law, including the smuggling of prohibited goods such as armaments, ammunition and drugs. According to the explanatory memorandum, it will allow member states to co-operate to the extent of agreeing to hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, controlled delivery, covert investigations and joint special investigation teams.</P>
    <P>I note opt out clauses are provided for and I am sure the Minister of State will clarify Ireland's position on whether we are opting out. I think he said we are opting out for the moment in regard to proposals contained in the Schengen Agreement and that, by ministerial order, it will be possible for us to opt out without having to enact further legislation. We no doubt need that flexibility. The Minister of State will forgive me but I may be slightly confused in regard to the opt outs. Will the convention enable our customs officials to bring in people from the United Kingdom to become involved in joint surveillance activity? Will it allow hot pursuit across the Border in regard to the suspected movement of drugs or other items? Will covert investigations allow the use of customs and excise officials from other European countries to operate here? If I understood the Minister of State correctly, I think that will be under the control of our people operating under our law but maybe he will clarify or elaborate on that in his response.</P>
    <P>We are well aware from holidaying abroad of the different experiences one can have from country to country regarding cultural procedures security-wise and that what is acceptable in some countries is most unacceptable in others. We need to know specifically what we are signing up to in regard to how it is intended the measures will operate in practice. The Minister of State might come back to that.</P>
    <P>The use of information technology for customs purposes is very welcome. There are considerations which will have to be taken into account in regard to what is included on the database. What safeguards will there be to ensure personal rights are not transgressed? What access will people have to the database if they feel their rights are being infringed? I was glad the Minister of State said there is a strong emphasis throughout on independent supervision of the database in its operation, which is very welcome. He said that the protection will be at least as strong at that provided under domestic law in the Data Protec<Col N="591" /> tion Act. Will there be guarantees in regard to updating necessary corrections to protect the good name of citizens in the case of erroneous material getting onto the database?</P>
    <P>This technology is very useful and I am glad to note the strong independent assessments the Minister referred to. However, information can get on to computer systems and in the course of their duties people tend to look ahead rather than to look back. If incorrect information gets on, what guarantee have we? A citizen may not know and his good name could be damaged. The Minister might return to this in his response.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the elaborate framework for the management and supervision of the CIS which ranges from the committee consisting of customs administrations from member states to a national supervisory authority and a joint supervisory authority. While the safeguards appear to be adequate to provide the necessary overall protection, there is no doubt that in some instances incorrect information can be stored on computers. There is a genuine risk that some people could be found guilty by association.</P>
    <P>The two protocols are welcomed, as is the fact that the European Court of Justice will be the arbiter and interpreter of the convention. This is as it should be. I also welcome the improved level of co-operation among the member states and the fact that the protection of data concerning individuals will be stronger than the requirements to protect data concerning persons who might be involved in money laundering or smuggling drugs and armaments. The Minister might say a brief word about that portion of the explanatory memorandum which states:</P>
    <P>The requested authority can be asked to carry out surveillance on suspect persons and on means of transport, goods and places (Article 11). A representative of the applicant authority may be present when action is carried out by the requested authority provided both authorities agree (Article 12).</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response and I wish him well with this Bill.</P>

      <P>I join in the welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen and compliment him on his wide-ranging address on this important legislation. The Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Bill, 2000 is an important part of the Government's fight against organised crime. In particular it seeks to eliminate the scourge of drugs, their importation for sale here and the opportunity to use Ireland as a conduit for flooding other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a new-found co-operation among the Garda, Customs and Excise and the Revenue Commissioners in the fight against crime. With the back-up legislation recently brought in by this Government regarding the Criminal Assets Bureau the co-operation among the three agencies has had major success against organised <Col N="592" /> crime and the scourge of drugs. We cannot however be complacent.</P>
    <P>Attempts will be made by criminals to seek new opportunities. We have to send out a loud and clear message from this House that Ireland will not be a soft touch for the international criminal in setting up bases or conduits for organised crime. Ireland must be seen internationally as being in no way a haven for the international criminal. This legislation is a firm message to those who may think Ireland will tolerate the illegal importation of drugs or contraband.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the legislation that have been in use over the last 20 to 30 years. This Bill brings those aspects together and puts in place a framework for co-operation among member states in stamping out the aforementioned forms of illegal activity. There is a strengthening of the protocols for co-operation. Our lengthy coastline is used by drug barons for the importation of substances via the many small ports and secluded beaches. We applaud the recent successes of the agencies of Government in stamping out this activity. The legislation offers those agencies further opportunities to ensure that this country will not be so used.</P>
    <P>There is practically no town or village that has not experienced the scourge of drugs. It behoves us all to open our eyes to the fact that drugs have become freely available. This legislation is therefore of vital importance. It is also of vital importance that we co-operate with member states in ensuring that future generations are not damaged by exposure to drugs. I compliment the Minister and the Government on what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on some of the following in his reply. There is reluctance by some people to accept the measure regarding hot pursuit. They feel there have been incursions by British forces that were both illegal and inappropriate. There is a fear and mistrust on this matter. I would ask the Minister to elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>While we do not wish to inhibit the chase, arrest and conviction of those involved in illegal activity, we do not want to see democratic republican activity interfered with by any misuse of legislation. The Minister might reassure the House with regard to that.</P>
    <P>People may be concerned by the breadth of personal information held on databases. Some 30 years ago, it would not have been considered at all appropriate to hold such data but modern technology has made it possible to obtain virtually all information relating to citizens, a fact which worries some people. Perhaps the Minister will offer some reassurance on this point.</P>
    <P>Trafficking in people is an area of huge concern. In the past, we had the slave trade between Africa and America but now we have a white slave trade. Criminals are engaged in the trafficking of people from eastern Europe to western Europe. These people are being abused and exploited at the hands of pimps and ruthless employers. This legislation does not appear to <Col N="593" /> cover this issue and, if it does not, the Minister might indicate where it is covered.</P>
    <P>We all abhor the trafficking of people which is the lowest form of criminal activity. Unfortunate people living under difficult regimes can be attracted by the opportunity to leave their homes. They pay hard cash in the hope of making a better life in western Europe but they end up in very suspect situations, often being abused by the very people they saw as offering them new opportunities. Young girls and women in particular are being abused by being forced into prostitution and other illegal activities.</P>
    <P>People in Ireland who have amassed huge amounts of money through illegal activity have reinvested that money in legitimate enterprises here and abroad. The Bill covers money laundering and I would welcome some further insight into this. We should applaud the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in regard to the confiscation, through the courts, of criminals' ill-gotten gains which are subsequently returned to the State. Some of these criminals are still at large in other European capitals but the success of the Garda, Customs and Excise officers and the Revenue Commissioners has sent out a clear message that people who have acquired empires through criminal activity can now be brought to justice. This legislation enhances and complements the existing raft of legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill which is a clear indication of the Government's intention to continue to fight organised crime through international and European co-operation. The Bill puts down a clear marker that criminals should not expect to carry on their illegal activities, be it the distribution of drugs or other contraband, easily here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a further step in the development of mutual co-operation between EU member states. The Bill will be particularly valuable in the fight against crime. As an island nation, Ireland is easily accessible by sea and air and it is difficult for us to effectively police our boundaries. Therefore, it is very important that there are mutual co-operation arrangements between Ireland and other EU member states.</P>
      <P>There are inlets all around Ireland's coastline and it is difficult to prevent the landing of illegal products such as drugs, cigarettes and weapons. I do not know whether the Bill addresses the various problems facing jurisdictions. A country like Ireland will require extra resources to provide mutual assistance and co-operation because of the complexities associated with being an island nation. The provision of effective air and sea policing services is far more costly in Ireland than in a country which is landlocked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish criminal fraternity has altered its operations in recent times. In terms of criminal activity, Ireland was formerly a small-time gangland area. The effective operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau has resulted in many of the big <Col N="594" /> players moving abroad. People formerly resident in Ireland who had contacts abroad have moved abroad altogether and established bases from which they run their illegal operations, such as the importation of drugs and weapons into Ireland and money laundering. Only this week, a Dutch court convicted a person who had paramilitary links in Ireland in the past and who has strong drug links here at present. The man organised the transport of drugs, guns and ammunition to Ireland. All of these combined in one set of activities is becoming increasingly common. Ironically, because of the excellent policing in these areas, our local criminal fraternity is now expanding abroad and is becoming much more influential in the international criminal circuit. That underscores the need for the maximum activity in terms of mutual co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is another side to co-operation. We share a border with Northern Ireland which has seen the greatest amount of crime in terms of smuggling weapons, bombs, ammunition and, increasingly, drugs. I am disappointed that we have not made more progress with the Good Friday Agreement in terms of joint co-operation on policing, North and South. We appear to have better relations with the Dutch police than we do with the RUC. What is happening between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the RUC in terms of joint policing which is so essential in that area? In many cases a blind eye seems to be turned to certain forms of criminal activity. I thought that would have been one of the areas most focused on in terms of cross-Border co-operation and that the area of drugs in particular, cigarette smuggling and other activities would be hard hit by now, but that is not the case. That is a common problem here and many illegal entries from other jurisdictions, be it Britain or elsewhere, take place across the Border.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the first area on which we need mutual co-operation of the highest order is the Border. I would like to see that mutual co-operation being promoted to a greater degree. With the British-Irish group meeting this weekend, there is scope for discussion of various forms of co-operation in terms of policing and criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the one opt-out clause we have is that in relation to the Schengen Convention, namely, the area of hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance and covert investigation between two jurisdictions in terms of customs co-operation. He indicated that we are likely to opt out of that agreement. That is in relation to Northern Ireland where any covert surveillance is likely to take place that would be termed cross-Border in our jurisdiction; it would be difficult for it to take place elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What talks, if any, have taken place with the neighbouring jurisdiction on this matter? For example, when Britain signs these conventions, will it look for a similar opt-out clause in relation <Col N="595" /> to our jurisdiction or will it retain the full force of the Schengen Agreement? Will we find ourselves not participating from this jurisdiction if our police force wants to engage in pursuit while it would be possible for the police force in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction, or indeed the army, to engage in certain circumstances? That is an important point on which I would like clarification.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the controlled delivery of illegal materials. Provision is being made in the legislation whereby materials and goods that have been identified as illicit by a police force in one jurisdiction can be kept under surveillance while they cross a border into another jurisdiction. The theory is that it is seized at the point of delivery but our experience of dealing with that in this jurisdiction has been poor because, invariably, the people abscond at the point of delivery and the general transmission process is a mess. I would be wary of Starsky and Hutch or James Bond type covert operations where the delivery of illicit materials is tracked in exciting, trans-border activity because invariably there is a breakdown in communication. That has happened so often in the past when materials pass from one jurisdiction to another, and perhaps even to a third. We have to be careful about that because the statistics indicate that of those we have attempted in this jurisdiction, there have been few successful sting operations of this nature. It might not be any harm to examine the statistics before we agree too readily to this form of operation which might become the norm as criminal activity becomes more widespread on the international or European circuit.</P>
    <P>Data protection is extremely important and the Bill provides for co-operation in this area in terms of the Data Protection Commissioner. In our jurisdiction we see how readily official bodies use confidential personal information for other purposes. I raised on the Order of Business this morning the manner in which the Department of Education and Science used confidential data on members of the ASTI to deduct pay from those teachers, and only those teachers, who paid their union subscription by direct debit. The Department used that information, without permission, to deduct from the salaries of the ASTI members who were working to rule during that dispute. As a result, the whole process of industrial negotiation with the teachers was set back by two months because of the anger the teachers felt at what was clearly an illegal act by a Department. The Minister is considering appealing that decision which will further provoke the teachers because he embarked on an illegal act in relation to personal confidential information. It is difficult to police that area in this jurisdiction. The data commissioner has much work to do in that regard alone.</P>
    <P>In terms of exchanging information with other jurisdictions the Minister spoke about &ldquo;clear situations&rdquo; where there was prior illegal activity or <Col N="596" /> where there are real indications to suggest the person concerned has committed, is in the act of committing or will commit serious contraventions of law. This is extremely vague &ndash; a policeman's suspicion will not be upheld in a court of law. Material can be put on a database by a policeman, Customs and Excise officers and other officials and remain there, and the danger is that it will be abused unless there is proper confidential data protection. I am worried there could be a huge database of citizens which could be used for a variety of purposes. This will require continuing supervision and the inclusion of caveats so that what I have outlined does not happen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is a useful contribution to the fight against international crime, but I enter the caveat that in all these circumstances we must be careful to ensure the rights and liberties of all citizens are protected as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this important debate. A number of issues were raised, but I wish to begin by giving some information on what has happened over recent years in terms of convictions etc. The Revenue Commissioners take a very robust approach to customs and excise offences. Where commercial smuggling is concerned, the goods are seized and confiscated and offenders are prosecuted if there is sufficient evidence to do so. In the case of excise offences, where the necessary evidence to sustain a conviction is more readily available than in other areas, there is substantial emphasis on prosecution.</P>
      <P>In the context of customs and excise, over the past 12 years more than 3,600 convictions were obtained. Court penalties of almost £3.5 million were imposed and jail sentences were imposed in 18 cases while 237 jail sentences have been imposed for non-payment of fines. Enforcement action in relation to smuggling has been hitting criminals hard, and over the past eight years 6,650 seizures have been made with an estimated total value of almost £46 million. Therefore, regarding Senator Costello's point, it would be unfair to suggest that things are not happening. There have been one or two high profile cases where things did not work out as well as they should have, but we should be aware of the substantial level of seizures over recent years. The co-operation agreements which now exist between the Garda, Customs and Excise and Revenue, with a new protocol having been recently signed, have immeasurably improved understandings and relationships, particularly in terms of operations. Perhaps in the past there was not the most efficient use of resources in expediting particular cases. Currently over 800 cases involving smuggling and other customs and excise offences are being processed with a view to bringing offenders before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Senators referred to the opt out clause under the conventions. As I outlined in some detail, the five areas involved are hot pursuit, <Col N="597" /> cross-border surveillance, controlled delivery, covert investigations and joint special investigations teams. Joint special investigations teams and controlled delivery are mandatory, but we are opting out of the other three to a certain extent, as is the UK to more or less a similar degree, because neither ourselves nor the UK are party to the Schengen agreement, which has obvious implications in terms of our enforcement ability. However, it would be wrong for Members to simply say we are opting out. The flow of information, as I outlined in great detail, between Customs and Excise administrations in various member states is very advanced and very high tech, and the structures in place for assimilating information and processing it is very sophisticated. The message we need to send out is that Ireland has a very strong approach towards international criminals, whether they are based in Ireland or abroad, and that they are not welcome here. The Legislature and Government will do everything possible to ensure all the forces of law bring these people to justice so that they are prosecuted and given jail sentences where the evidence is available and, therefore, cannot continue to be involved in criminal activity.</P>
    <P>As parents we are all aware of the scourge of drugs and what is happening some of our young people. We must exorcise this scourge from the culture of young people. One method of doing so is to prevent illicit substances from entering the country and ensure we can cut off supply. This will be a constant battle which will probably never end, but we can make it extremely difficult for criminals who want to do business here.</P>
    <P>All Senators referred to the importance of data protection. The provisions in the Bill are specific in terms of data protection and are in keeping with existing data protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran specifically asked about trafficking in terms of illegal immigration. I am sure Members know that the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, deals with this issue as does the Refugee Act, 1996, which was amended by the Immigration Act, 1999. Therefore, there is a substantial body of legislation to deal with some of the matters raised by Senators.</P>
    <P>This Bill is specific and I gave an amount of detail as to how it fits into our armoury of measures dealing with crime. It is important that Ireland keeps its legislation up to date so we can be party to international conventions and signatories to them. This allows us work in consort with our fellow members in the EU to ensure a cohesive and co-ordinated approach in the Union to dealing with international crime. What we are dealing with in the Bill is how automated data is shared among member states, the responsibilities involved, how various Customs and Excise administrations act and the relationship between them so that we are successful in bringing to the courts, in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU, the drug barons and international criminals who create misery and suffering for many people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> I will deal on Committee Stage with specific points which arise. However, I hope I have responded in general to the issues raised by Senators. They can reflect on the information I have given. I appreciate the support on all sides of the House for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot support this group of amendments. The television programme service contractor stipulated in the subsections to which these amendments refer is the television programme service contractor selected by the Independent Radio and Television Commission under the terms of the Radio and Television Act, 1988. As we all know, the television programme service contractor selected by the Independent Radio and Television Commission is TV3. The 1988 legislation set out the specific procedures that must be employed in selecting the independent television service contractor. The Independent Radio and Television Commission must follow these procedures. I cannot, therefore, see the point of inserting the words &ldquo;as licensed and agreed by the Broadcasting Commission subject to specific obligations and following public consultation&rdquo; into the subsections as proposed by amendments Nos. 45, 48, 51 and 54. In my view these might have made sense only if the amendments proposing the establishment of the super authority had been accepted. In addition, amendments Nos. 44, 47, 49 and 53 which propose to change the word &ldquo;each&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; in subsections (5) and (6) of section 37 would seem to make sense only if the other amendments in this group were accepted.

      <P>This group of amendments seems to be designed to make TG4 a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; service on analogue and digital MMDS systems. They also seem to conflict with the purpose of an earlier group of amendments which sought to control the amount of &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; services on cable and MMDS. My intention with regard to these services on cable and MMDS systems provided for in section 37 is to preserve the <i>status quo </i>to a large extent. Accordingly, our indigenous analogue free-to-air services are and will remain &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; on analogue cable systems. The independent television service provided for in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, was originally envisaged as a service that would be available only on cable and MMDS systems, hence its &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on MMDS. It does not make much sense to make TG4, which was originally envisaged as a standard service in transmission terms, a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; service on MMDS, which has very limited frequency capacity. Equally, TG4's digital free-to-air service will be &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; on DTT. There seems no particular reason to require a non-universal subscription service such as digital MMDS to carry TG4 when it will be available on a free-to-air basis on DTT which is designed to provide universal service. Accordingly, these amendments should be opposed.</P>

      <P>Section 39(8) gives the definition of local community: &ldquo; In this section 'local community' means the community of a town or other urban or rural area.&rdquo;. Amendment No. 71 provides for the deletion of &ldquo;area,&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;area, or of a defined community of interest irrespective of geographical proximity or location&rdquo;. It is the shared bonding of a particular value, interest or set of objectives that I seek to have enshrined in this legislation.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 59, 60, 65, 67, 70 and 71, I explained at length in the other House that the reference to community television in section 38 is made in the context of cable and MMD systems. Cable and MMD systems are specifically mentioned because of the channel capacities such systems have. However, one of the limitations of the systems is that they are specific to a particular geographic area, that is, the area franchised under licence granted by the ODTR.</P>
      <P>I refer to the definition of community as set out in section 38(8): &ldquo; a town or other urban or rural area&rdquo;. The use of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; throughout section 38 is consistent with the limitations inherent in the systems on which community channels will be distributed because they will be community channels distributed at a local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of community proposed in amendment No. 71 introduces the concept of community of interest irrespective of geographical proximity or location. I do not see how a television channel of any kind on cable or MMD can be distributed under those conditions. The geo<Col N="602" /> graphic limitations of cable and MMD are a fact and must be addressed as such. That is not to say that the concept of a community of interests is not valid. The provisions of section 38 as drafted allow the commission to grant community content contracts to communities representing particular interests within a specific area.</P>
    <P>The definition of the communities set out in section 38(8) does not rule out community of interest channels. It simply reflects the physical reality of the limitations of cable and MMD. Therefore, I am unable to support amendments Nos. 59, 60, 65, 67, 70 and 71.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister. I think she is misguided in simply limiting the cable or MMD channels to a locally defined geographic area, whether urban or rural. There are plenty of shared community interests that are not defined in geographic terms. I think that the legislation should leave an option there. The shared interest basis is not necessarily locally based and I think the Minister should open up the legislation to that possibility. Think of musicians, like Senator Ó Murchú. Will all sean-nós singers be in a geographical setting in Connemara or Ring or the Kerry Gaeltacht? A local community music station could be based in a number of specified areas but be wider than any geographical entity. We should highlight the shared interest in community terms rather than shared location. </P>

      <P>There is not such a divergence of opinion between Senator Costello and me. I agree that the concept of community of interest is valid. It is not a question of my wishing to limit the sense of community but of having to address the technical realities that limit it to a geographical area. It is not the concept of community that the Senator and I differ over but simply the technical realities that have to be addressed. In that vein, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are technical realities but these can be addressed. The legislation should be broad ranging and leave scope for technical adjustment which might now be a problem but could be sorted out in the future. There is a difference and I think the legislation should be more flexible. People involved in community media networking also hold the view that the legislation should be wider in scope and they see a broader definition of community as more desirable in the operational context of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Costello and the Minister and I am a little confused. I feel that we have a sense of place here in Ireland and if one looks at how franchises are allocated across the world it is clear that this is done on a technical basis. The necessity to ensure that there is no overlap between different franchise areas is important. I fail to understand how specifying the word local inhibits the diver<Col N="603" /> sity of programmes that reflect the community to which the programme contractors are transmitting. I would be glad if Senator Costello addressed this point.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also about the continued operation of pirate radio. I understand that this is not the Minister's responsibility and that is was her colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who set up the legislation in question. I do not understand how these operators are allowed to continue 13 years after the 1988 Act which introduced draconian penalties for assisting illegal radio operators. The Office of the Director of Telecommunication Regulation and Miss Etain Doyle have not adequately explained why it has not shut down pirate radio stations that are trampling across the airwaves and interfering with law-abiding franchise holders.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about those involved with community licences. I recently received a complaint from community licence holders in Dublin who find that the frequency they were allocated is being dumped on by a pirate station which has been operating with impunity in their franchise area for several years. One can understand the frustrations of the community operators because the legislation prevents them seeking to generate advertising revenue in excess of 50% of their income. Consequently they are anxious to have a level playing field.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to use whatever influence she has, within the limits of her legislative mandate, to impress upon the Office of the Director of Telecommunication Regulation that it must ensure that the law is upheld as well as fulfilling its duty to regulate the broadcasting industry. The Independent Radio and Television Commission is addressing the needs of the broadcasting community and it is no longer justifiable to tolerate the operation of pirate radio stations. It was perhaps justifiable when there were fewer radio stations and less diversity but that is no longer a valid reason.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful for some clarity on the subject of local community operators. The Minister has attempted to address the issue as best she can but I cannot see how the deletion of &lsquo;local' from the various sections would promote the diversity of programming and reflect the sense of place that I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not just talking about a sense of place in terms of community radio or television channels. A sense of place is a wonderful concept but we are talking about the award of community licences. Will it be possible for the Traveller community to have a community channel? Because they do not reside in a specific geographical location this legislation will specifically prohibit the Traveller community from applying. How can we reflect our diversity of values and cultures when we give out the channels? Why should we restrict it to a geographical area? If <Col N="604" /> women, as a community group, wanted to seek a licence to project gender issues, they would have to be in a specific geographical area to apply.</P>
      <P>A community of interest should be the key theme in the distribution of licences rather than a community based on a local, geographical area. I am not knocking local, geographical areas, which are a valuable basis for issuing licences, but it is important to promote a diversity that includes locality plus other factors.</P>

      <P>The section only refers to community television channels on cable and MMDS. It is open to adjustment but the commission is not limited, and the legislation is wide open for community groups to apply for licences on other broadcasting platforms such as radio. That is the kernel of the argument here.</P>
      <P>On the issue of pirate radio, which Senator Mooney is particularly exercised about, I know he is aware that this is not my area of responsibility but that of another Department and the Office of the Director of Telecommunication Regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 61 and amendment No. 64 would impose very onerous obligations on the commission with regard to the level of community participation required before a contract can be used. It seems to me that under the proposed amendments a small number of dissenting voices could prevent the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland from granting a community content contract. While it would be desirable if the commission could achieve the level of <Col N="605" /> co-operation envisaged by the Senator, it is important to allow it to act in the interests of the community rather than the interests of a small number of persons or organisations who may not wish to accept any ideas on community broadcasting other than their own.</P>
      <P>The deletion of sections 39(4) and 39(5) as proposed in amendment No. 64 would undermine the consultative process which the commission would be required to undertake before a community content contract would be granted. This process ensures that the community is given a chance to influence the nature of the community services it wishes to see broadcast. Accordingly I cannot support amendments Nos. 61 and 64. However, I appreciate the importance of community participation in successful establishment of community television.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 stress the importance of participation and the interest of community in the context of a survey to be undertaken by the commission after the launch of a particular community channel. Section 39(6)(a) was inserted by the Dáil to take account of this particular concern. I could not take paragraph (b) of amendment No. 69 as I believe it is adequately dealt with in the existing section 39(6)(b)(ii).</P>
      <P>On amendments Nos. 62 and 63, I am satisfied the provisions contained in 39(2), as drafted, are sufficient to ensure community content contracts will only be granted to those who are representative of the community and that the operation of the channel will be on a no profit basis and its content will address the interests of that community. Accordingly I cannot accept amendments Nos. 62 and 63.</P>

      <P>What the amendments seek to ensure that there is active consultation with all members of the community and that that take place prior to the granting of the licence and also that there is active participation and consultation, subsequently, on the content. The Minister says that would impose an excessively onerous burden but that there will be consultation and participation. I seek assurance from the Minister that it will be democratic and that there will be active participation and consultation in community television.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to disagree with Senator Costello in the spirit of this amendment and the previous one. There is a conflict between idealism and pragmatism. I welcome the Minister's response on the consultative nature. The whole idea of local or community radio was to reflect the aspirations, talents and strengths of that community. There is always a danger that, like national radio, it will become over-commercialised and look at the bottom line of how much money is being made. I understand the spirit of what the Senator is saying, but he seems happy with what he is hearing from the Minister. I hope that is the case.</P>

      <P>I echo what Senator Ó Murchú has said. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello. The Minister has moved to reassure the House on that point.</P>
      <P>Will there be competition in the franchise area? There is no competition now in the allocated local radio franchise areas. That is not in any way a reflection of the excellent work that local radio is doing. We started on a blank page in 1990, following the 1988 legislation, in establishing a role for local radio, much of which is community based. We are now moving to a new era of broadcasting on the digital platform which will permit a larger number of digital television channels than would be allowed under the existing radio spectrum. When the commission are mandated to allocate franchises for local community digital television, will there be a competitive element within the franchise area? That would go a long way to address the issues raised by Senator Costello and endorsed by Senator Ó Murchú.</P>
      <P>On consultation, will there be any obstacles placed in the way of those who wish to apply for licences? Would there, for example, be any obstacle to an application by an outside corporation for a community television as distinct to an application that would be representative of the community? This is an area that concerns me. As the area of digital television opens up, with the vast array of television channels that would be available under the new technology, multinational corporations may see this as an attractive option. It has already happened in the case of the proposed take-over of Cork radio by UTV. I accept that the Minister can only go so far in enabling legislation, but I would like to hear her thinking on this matter.</P>

      <P>In answer to Senator Mooney's question, there is a possibility for more than one in any local area. There could be both a local and a community channel in any area.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that I cannot support amendment No. 72 which seeks to tie the establishment of TG4 as a separate statutory entity to the publication of a comprehensive policy relating to the Irish language. Establishing TG4 as an entity in its own right will be a complex process established by the provisions in the Bill. The policy of the Government is that it should be a separate broadcasting institution. This is in line with the policy of successive Governments involved in its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This element of policy is not dependent on any other policy matter. My priority in this regard is to have TG4 established properly and comprehensively. The precise amount of time it may take to do this is not and cannot be more important than getting the job done properly. There will be many difficult and complex issues to be addressed and it would not be appropriate to establish TG4 as a separate statutory entity until such issues are <Col N="608" /> resolved satisfactorily. Issues such as the appropriate level of staffing and financing and the ongoing relationship between RTE and TG4 into the future all need to be clarified and pinned down beforehand. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 73.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If six months is too short, can I take it that two years is too long? Will the Minister indicate if she will strike a happy compromise for us? Properly establishing TG4 means having it established within a reasonable timeframe. There are always difficulties with a new entity but we have been more or less over this ground before in terms of staff, funding, programme content and the relationship between the other stations and channels. It is not new ground and what is required is a commitment to establish TG4 on a statutory basis as quickly as possible. This issue should not be left hanging as changes can take place quickly. The Minister may not be Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the next Administration, which may come to power before too long. Given the lifetime of the Government, I thought six months was a reasonable period so that this could be done during the Minister's term of office.</P>

      <P>The announcement by the Minister that TG4 will be a separate statutory body is a kudos for all those who supported the station and the professionals involved in it. They have taken much consolation and hope from the Minister's action in this regard.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I would like to be sure that the foundations are solid and that this is not rushed through merely for the sake of it. We owe it to all those involved in TG4 to ensure that they get the support they so richly deserve. The best way of doing this is to ensure that those who wish to have an input to the organic approach to TG4 can have it. I think we all share Senator Costello's desire to see this happening soon. We all share the pride in TG4. Many prophets of doom said that TG4 would not last, but I now hear people with a minimum of Irish or no Irish praise the station. TG4 has an exceptionally bright future and I have no doubt the Minister and Government are reflecting this in the legislation. I wish the Minister well in this regard.</P>

    <P>It is to the great credit of TG4 that it has given rural areas the type of programmes people love to watch.

      <P>I endorse the comments made by my colleagues in regard to TG4. I wish to put on the record my acknowledgement of the outstanding contribution an chéad ceannaire of TG4, Cathal Goan, made to the establishment of the station. TG4 hit the ground running and it has not stopped. As Senator Cassidy accurately said, those in the larger national broadcasting organisation in Dublin 4 should reflect on the fact that the ethos of TG4 was centred on the real Ireland. There has been none of the criticism of the philosophy and programme content of TG4 that we hear on a continuous basis about RTE, the parent station. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned from this. Having moved from Contae na Gaillimhe and the good environment of the west, Cathal Goan will be like a breath of fresh air in the corridors of Montrose. Having spoken to Mr. Goan on a number of occasions since he took up his appointment as head of programming, he will bring a fresh approach to RTE. I hope this is reflected in a wider diversity of programmes on RTE radio and television.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello expressed concern that the Minister may not retain her portfolio following the next election. As the Labour Party has high expectations of being in the next Government, irrespective of who its partners will be, I am sure the Senator will ensure that the legislation is implemented as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to acknowledge that and I have been happy to do so on other occasions. For the Senator's benefit, when the Bill was first published some people were concerned that I was trying to push TG4 into becoming a separate entity straightaway. I explained that this was enabling legislation, I wanted to make the transitional period easier and ensure that no move would be made until everything was put in place and TG4 was happy with the proposals.</P>
      <P>Since publication of the Bill matters have progressed. There are those in TG4 who wish to see the separate entity set up under the right conditions. Work has already started on the plans for the separate establishment. To put a time limit on it as suggested by the Senator would not be helpful because it is important that the job is done correctly from the beginning in a coherent and co-ordinated fashion. It is in everyone's interest, particularly TG4, that it would proceed in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to see it unfolding as quickly as possible. Certainly every encouragement will be given to ensure that work already undertaken will progress speedily but at the same time it will be <Col N="610" /> necessary to be cautious in the sense of taking every issue on board to ensure the transfer will be a happy one for TG4.</P>

This is a load of twaddle and it is unbecoming any administration to presume there is a need for this type of provision to be incorporated in legislation. Teilifís na Gaeilge is subject to the Constitution in the same way as every other individual or corporate body in the State and surely that section should be deleted.

Rather than speak about upholding democratic values and rightful liberty, why does the provision not simply say that Teilifís na Gaeilge in peforming its functions shall uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. Why specify two elements of the rule of law &ndash; democratic values and rightful liberty? It seems to me this is unnecessary and there is no reason for it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would have seen this as an improved status for TG4, although it might sound convoluted. Until now it was viewed as a subsidiary of RTE whereas now it has autonomy under this legislation. In the same way that RTE is governed by statute and by charter, I believe TG4 would like to think it is on an level playing pitch.  I was inclined to interpret it in that way rather than as an unusual restriction on it.</P>

      <P>I take the point made by Senator Costello. Teilifís na Gaeilge represents all that is fine in terms of who we are and of our cultural identity. The station was set up for the purpose of furthering the Irish language, spoken, written and through the medium of television. While it may seem a narrow Nationalist view &ndash; and I have no wish that my remarks be interpreted as such &ndash; why not take the opportunity, when celebrating the legal establishment of an all-Irish language television station, to state that we wish it to uphold democratic values as enshrined in the Constitution. Perhaps I view it differently from the Minister and others. Although it is a legal instrument it is also symbolic and is a reflection of those who cherish and love the Irish language and who see it as a badge of our identity. Without labouring the point, I cannot but reflect on two current examples. The first is the advertisement on RTE to promote the language. It consists of a young man in a fast food establishment who sits down beside two young ladies who are having a conversation in Irish. They assume the young man cannot speak the language and obviously they pass some complimentary remarks about him. He responds immediately to what they have said and they are aghast. The point is that young people especially are becoming more aware of the importance of their language as a separate badge of our identity. The second example relates to the time when people travelled abroad for the first time. When in the company of foreign nationals who spoke their own language, they <Col N="612" /> immediately felt somewhat outside and began to recite the Hail Mary and the Our Father to each other to convey that they too had a separate language. We have moved on from that. As recent statistics indicate, not only do more people speak the language but more wish to speak it. Long may that be the case.</P>
      <P>I subscribe fully to the philosophy of Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh, the former Cathaoirleach of Bord na Gaeilge, who believes in a multilingual and bilingual society where we will eventually be able to speak in Irish and English as part of our everyday speech. He, of course, is the best exponent of that. That is how I feel about this section, without going into dreamy Nationalist vistas.</P>

      <P>Like the Senators who have already contributed to the debate, I wish to again put on record that we are very proud of the high standards and quality set by TG4. Many other broadcasters throughout Europe would do well to follow its example. This obligation is appropriate to all television broadcasters and the basis of the section was the interpretation given by Senator Ó Murchú. What we are doing here is ensuring that all television broadcasters are obliged to follow this requirement. I see no reason TG4 would be exempt from this provision, nor do I believe it would wish to be exempt. In my view, this provision will not cause TG4 any problem and, as Senator Ó Murchú pointed out, it will give it the status of being exactly on the same level and not a subsidiary of any other broadcaster.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate but if this type of phraseology and section is in all the legislation relating to public broadcasting, then it should be deleted. It is insulting to any organisation to suggest that specific aspects of the Constitution should be elicited and that it must be subject to those particular aspects. It goes beyond that because it states that Teilifís na Gaeilge must be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland. These are unnecessary concepts which have a whiff of Teilifís na Gaeilge being in some form a little bit subversive, that it cannot be relied on to be fair and democratic in its programming, that in some way it will not give rightful expression to issues or will not uphold all the democratic values. I do not see this provision as enhancing the role of Teilifís na Gaeilge but undermining it by implying that these fundamental areas of law need to be hammered home for the station.</P>

      <P>I reject the Senator's interpretation of this provision because we are not talking about mere compliance. We have outlined the very positive role TG4 has played in terms of the Irish language and broadcasting generally. Because of the particular strength of the medium of television, it is in a very special position, as are all other broadcasters, to give a lead, as it were, <Col N="613" /> in the community. What we are doing is giving it a very strong role here in terms of the role it can play in upholding these particular values. Therefore, there is an onus on TG4 and I have every reason to believe that not only will it carry out that responsibility, and it is not a question of mere compliance, but it will take on a leadership role in upholding these democratic values.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a typographical error in the section. Section 46(<i>d</i>) reads that Teilifís na Gaeilge &ldquo;shall have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State. . . &rdquo;. Should that read &ldquo;of other states other than the Irish State&rdquo;? Are countries and states not two separate concepts? The paragraph goes on to read, &ldquo;. . . including in particular those of the Member States. . . &rdquo;, not member countries. Surely the terminology should be similar throughout and the word should be &ldquo;state&rdquo;, not &ldquo;country&rdquo;.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 39, after &ldquo;her&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and that such rules be introduced not later than 12 months after the enactment of this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment incorporates what Senator Manning was seeking to do in amendment No. 1. Rather than calling for the provision of a full subtitling service, the amendment addresses the section providing for a commission that will make rules to deal with problems experienced by persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or partially sighted. Given that the rules deal with the accessibility by all citizens to what is being transmitted they should be compiled without delay and the legislation should impose a time limit on their introduction of not be later than 12 months after its enactment. That is a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those experiencing difficulty are members of the Irish Hard of Hearing Association. They met me and a number of other Members yesterday. They are adamant that the legislation should be more in line with what is the norm abroad, especially our nearest neighbour where a specific element of subtitling is provided for in the legislation. I have obtained figures on people with hearing loss in the UK. People between the ages of 51 and 60 experience 18.9% loss, it rises to 36.8% loss between 61 and 70 and to 60.2% loss between 71 and 80. If we do not provide subtitles or an alternative means of listening and communicating we are discriminating against the elderly, especially as they suffer disproportionately more, and to others who have <Col N="615" /> become partially incapacitated in this respect during life or at birth.</P>
    <P>Everything to do with broadcasting is about communication. I am always a little reluctant when I see something which is very critical to the values expressed in legislation being sent to a commission or being referred to a committee which will go about its business. We need to put time limits on when that body will report back to the Minister who will introduce whatever recommendations are made. We need something better than what is here for people who are partially sighted, blind, hard of hearing or deaf. The Minister should give us some comfort on the issue by assuring us that the matter will be addressed urgently.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. This is so important for such a large number of people that the Minister should try to make sure there is some sort of timetable. People who are hard of hearing were mentioned. Yesterday I mentioned that, unfortunately, an increasing number of young people are hard of hearing, probably because of the use of headphones, Walkmans and so on and because of disco music. The timetable Senator Costello has set down is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I come to this debate with a certain amount of baggage. I first became aware of the difficulties the hard of hearing have in accessing programmes when I started to present radio programmes on RTE. I exchanged correspondence with many of those who are hard of hearing and I was acutely aware when going on air that they had this difficulty. It is considerably compounded by the viewing of television and that is why the area of subtitling has become controversial in recent weeks and days.</P>
      <P>I have the strongest sympathy with this amendment and the contributions Senator Costello and Senator Henry made. However, I also acknowledge that the Minister and her advisers have been acutely aware of the frustrations of those who are hard of hearing. Most of their frustration has been directed at the national broadcaster, RTE. However, it is important to point out that this legislation is all encompassing and places obligations on all broadcast contractors, not just RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are dealing with the here and now, perhaps it might be of some assistance to the House if I outlined briefly RTE's position in relation to this. I already referred to it on Second Stage and quoted from the 1999 annual report. The simple reality as far as RTE is concerned is one of resources. There is a glaring lack of resources in this area. I think RTE, if asked &ndash; it was subjected to some criticism at the various public meetings it held around the country in recent weeks when this question arose &ndash; would put its hand up and admit that there has been inadequacy in this area. That, of course, has led to <Col N="616" /> continuous frustration among those who represent the hard of hearing. The Minister has already seen a number of those organisations and they have exchanged views with her. I am sure she will take this opportunity to expand on her views in this area.</P>
    <P>If RTE, in particular, because it is the national broadcaster is to discharge its responsibilities in this area, it must be resourced. We have already heard in great detail about the difficulties RTE has in meeting the needs of all its viewers because of the increasing cost of producing programmes. I do not wish my remarks to be interpreted as representing the corporate view of RTE but unless there is an increase in its licence fee which will allow it to address this and other areas, it will prove difficult for the commission to implement this section as written. I think that was the point Senator Costello made, that is, unless a timeframe is included and unless there is a specific obligation on television contractors to respond to the obligations contained in the section, which states that the commission shall make rules requiring each broadcaster to take specified steps, television broadcasters, especially those in the private sector &ndash; irrespective of RTE's continuing role in this &ndash; could plead lack of resources or finance or, indeed, indifference. They cannot be allowed to do that on a continuing basis but they could make appropriate noises to the commission without taking specific action. That is the spirit in which this amendment has been put forward and with which I have a great degree of sympathy.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and on a positive note, RTE has tendered for new technology to improve and introduce subtitling on its news programmes, hopefully by the middle of this year. That will be a major advance on what is currently the case. It might surprise the House to know that the subtitling section of RTE is severely under resourced and I appreciate this is a matter for RTE itself to address. Currently, it has 2.5 persons in the section &ndash; a head of section, an assistant and a part-time employee &ndash; and subtitling is being carried out by reporters from outside. Having said that, I acknowledge the Trojan work being done by that small group of dedicated people. I will give the House a flavour of what is involved. For example, RTE would be the first&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain the context of subtitling and the difficulties that might be inherent in this amendment being passed and imposing a specified time, mainly because the lobby, as it were, or the issues are being addressed to RTE. I will be as brief as I can. I appreciate what you are saying, a Chathaoirleach, and I do not wish to broaden the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE was the first channel in Europe to receive a number of American programmes &ndash;&ldquo;ER&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dawson's Creek&rdquo; are two that come to mind. In America, the only obligation is on the public <Col N="617" /> broadcasting system which currently has about 2% to 3% of the viewing audience and public broadcasting transmissions are 100% subtitled. However, the private broadcasters, including CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox, are not obliged by law to have subtitling. Consequently, programmes like &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, for example, come into this country with a master tape and a script accompanying that tape. The subtitling section in RTE has to introduce what is called a character generator and manually type in the subtitle using a time code on the master tape. One can understand the time involved in doing that. It has to do it with these programmes because RTE has managed to be very competitive in attracting some high quality America programmes which are shown here ahead of Britain, France and elsewhere in Europe and fair play to it. It does not have an existing subtitle tape and has to create it itself. That is on the recorded side; but on the live side, it is actually done as the programmes are being transmitted and it is time delayed.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand what is involved here. An individual sits at a character generator, which is like a typewriter, watches the news as it unfolds and types in a subtitle as it goes along. I am only giving Members a broad outline of the practicalities involved in trying to answer the very reasonable and justifiable demands of the hard of hearing lobby for full subtitling on all programmes. It is because of that system and the manner in which it is currently operated that I again put down the marker in the wider debate about an increase in the television licence fee, that unless RTE is given those financial resources it will not be in a position to fully discharge this function in the short-term. We are all very anxious that a timeframe is placed on this. I want to emphasise that there is not 100% subtitling on commercial programming from America and there is not as high a percentage of subtitled programming from the BBC as we have been led to believe, though it is significantly higher than from RTE.</P>
    <P>RTE is currently taking steps to address what it admits is an unacceptable situation but it is an inadequate response to those who seek to have full subtitling on all their output. Finally, this is not a problem of TG4 as it is fully subtitled due to its use of digitalisation. This amendment is aimed at RTE, but the obligation on new programme contractors to address the requirements of the existing section is of concern to us all and hopefully the Minister can reassure us on that point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;35.&ndash;Section 5 of the broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993 is hereby amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)in subsection (1) (a) by the indention of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (iii):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(iv)the persons who undertake the distribution and exploitation of the said programme, other than its broadcast by the broadcaster itself, and any simultaneous re-transmissions thereof,',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I moved this amendment on Committee Stage. It concerns the fact that if an independent producer gets more than 50% of money from the independent production unit of RTE they are obliged to give the distribution and transmission rights to a section known as RTE . When I spoke on Committee Stage the Minister said there was no such legal regulation and appeared to be so advised by her officials. She will now have received from me copies of draft contracts which RTE obliges independent producers to sign.</P>
      <P>The situation is therefore that independent producers have to sign over distribution rights to RTE. I quote from the general terms and conditions of the contract:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Distribution: Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, RTE shall have distribution rights for a term of five years from the <Col N="619" /> date of first broadcast in Ireland. On expiry of the five year term, the Contractor shall be assigned distribution rights unless otherwise agreed between the parties. 70% of the net receipts shall accrue to RTE after the deduction of print and post production costs, agency sales commission (normally 30%), freight and customs charges, copyright license fees, promotion and publicity costs and such other charges deemed by RTE to have been necessarily incurred in the selling of recordings of the Programme. The balance of the 30% shall be paid to the Contractor.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that the contractor is not going to do terribly well. The more recent draft regulations regarding distribution state:</P>
    <P>Unless otherwise agreed RTE will normally retain distribution rights in programmes where RTE provides at least 50% of the funding for a period of five years from the date of first broadcast in Ireland. Such distribution may cover TV broadcasts world-wide and subject to agreement between RTE and the producer and subject to availability of such rights in connection with the project theatric, non-theatric, cable and satellite sales, and in addition the exploitation of books, records, video, merchandising and other ancillary rights. The producer will warrant that required rights are cleared to enable RTE to transmit the programme twice within five years and where applicable to exploit and distribute the programme.</P>
    <P>Things are very heavily weighted on the side of RTE.</P>
    <P>RTE is an absolutely splendid institution but for independent producers to be really independent and to enable them to have their product transmitted internationally it is essential that they not have to go through RTE . This is one of the few areas in which the RTE management would be willing to agree that they do not have a great deal of expertise and personnel.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the shortage of staff in the subtitling division. Apparently in RTE two people are employed. This is to cover the sale of all independently produced films to the rest of the world. They are in competition with specialised sales units in the UK which have some of the most sophisticated operations in the world and our small independent producers will not get a fair opportunity to have their product transmitted internationally. They should be allowed to choose an independent sales promoter here or to work with companies in the UK.</P>
    <P>It is a very specialised area. There are specialised companies dealing in children's programmes which must surely interest the Leader of the House as it must Senators Mooney and Labhrás Ó Murchú. We want to give our producers the very best chance to sell their work internationally. There was a programme recently which has been a huge international success. &ldquo;Irish Empire&rdquo; about the Irish experience around the world was <Col N="620" /> a co-production and so was able to be sold everywhere. It has been a great financial success. Other programmes have had a far more limited distribution. I do not wish to name them as that would be invidious but some people have been extraordinarily disappointed in the distribution they managed to get for their programmes.</P>
    <P>In terms of books and merchandise there is a question of quite a lot of money. It is not only the money of course. Independent producers have to make a name for themselves. They have to do this internationally. The contracts they are obliged to sign with RTE stymie the independent producers. I realise the Bill covers all television stations but we are funding RTE and I urge the Minister to make this change.</P>
    <P>RTE is trying to handle a brief which is really too wide. It has a very important job to do and should allow specialised companies to deal with sales promotion. Independent producers must be given some latitude. I note that a Government amendment has been tabled which means the Bill must go back to the Dáil. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. Our independent producers have produced very good work &ndash; I spoke earlier about the programmes on TG4 &ndash; and it is important that they are allowed to be really independent. I am sure that the taxpayers who fund RTE would like to see independent producers being provided with the best opportunity to sell their product.</P>

      <P>I understand where Senator Henry is coming from with this amendment and I fully understand the manner in which independent film makers have interpreted the legislation. I am aware Senator Henry has been in contact with them and is perhaps representing their views here, although that does not in any way detract from the validity of the argument she advanced.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board, which comes under the Minister's remit, has also produced some outstanding cinematic works in recent years. One need only glance at the board's annual report to see the number of films which have been made with State funding. Yet these films have had a relatively small international success rate. A significant number of the films financed and produced under the board's aegis have not recouped their costs and very few have been a commercial success. I do not deny that the independent sector produced marvellous programmes in co-operation with RTE but it does not always follow that such programmes will find a ready market. Notwithstanding that, there is undoubtedly a problem in the commercial enterprise section of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleague, Senator Cassidy, I have produced a number of music cassettes and CDs in co-operation with RTE and have almost always dealt with Mr. Michael Croke, who has worked there for a long time. Senator Henry is correct that only a small number of people work in the section. However, I would not go so far as to sug<Col N="621" /> gest that an outside agency should be employed to sell RTE programmes. RTE should look into the mote in its own eye and head-hunt expertise in the area of programme sales, as it does in the areas of television programming, production and administration.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a Civil Service culture here, as distinct from a commercial one. That is not a negative reflection on civil servants; they merely have a different agenda. There is a need in the competitive world of international television marketing for sales expertise which will aggressively sell programmes. I do not wish to cast aspersions on the current operating procedures of RTE but I have been informed by representatives of Irish-based companies who successfully sell independent television programmes &ndash; television programmes are bought and sold on a regular basis in a number of international fora in the same way as music publishing deals are bought and sold &ndash; that there is a marked absence of RTE personnel where the real business of buying and selling television programmes is carried on. We must ask whether RTE is serious about promoting and aggressively marketing the excellent output of programmes to which Senator Henry referred.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the trading arrangements between the independent film makers and RTE do not lie at the core of the issue. The core of the issue is that they would perhaps be prepared to accept the type of agreement entered into if they believed the products had a fair chance of being sold on the international market, not only recouping their costs but also generating sufficient income to make a further series of programmes.</P>
    <P>The 70:30 percentage ratio is currently under negotiation between the film makers and RTE and we await the outcome with interest. The commission on the sale of television programmes is of the order of 35% internationally. The detail of the trading agreement to which Senator Henry referred reveals that the 70% includes all pre-production and post-production costs. To draw an analogy, a royalty agreement between a performing artist and a record company almost invariably includes a section to the effect that royalties are paid following the recoupment of all production costs. The 70% retained by RTE does not go directly into its exchequer as it includes all pre-production and post-production costs and the 30% received by the film makers is provided after all such costs have been met. That is the reality of the commercial arrangement between the independent film makers and RTE and it is not for any of us to defend that.</P>
    <P>Without putting a tooth in it, the RTE section is in serious need of an overhaul and additional resources must be provided in terms of the expertise to which Senator Henry referred. I have always found Michael Croke to be courteous, efficient and helpful and he has always discharged his responsibilities to the very best of his ability. It is a prevailing culture rather than individuals <Col N="622" /> who are causing this problem. RTE must realise that its quality programming can find success on the international market. BBC commercial enterprises has very successfully exploited its programming, particularly its costume drama, and I do not see any reason why RTE should not follow suit. However, RTE appears to be absenting itself from international sales fora or failing to profile itself to the extent others who are selling programmes in the independent sector would wish it to.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if this will advance the debate, but in the wider context of RTE's application for a licence fee increase it is something the Minister could highlight, in her deliberations on this issue, as an important income generator for RTE. I am sure RTE knows that already but obviously there are serious deficiencies in the manner in which it is currently being carried out, to the extent that the independent film makers feel so chagrined that they wish to have a change introduced in enabling legislation. It gives a valuable insight into how strongly the independent film operators feel about this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's amendment. The case has been well aired by both Senator Henry and Senator Mooney. It is the old chestnut where one set of people produce the programmes, another is creative while another is good at marketing. If RTE is not putting the personnel, the resources or the ethos into the enterprise sector in terms of marketing and trading abroad with the independent film programmes, or indeed their own programmes, that matter needs to be addressed because we are talking about people's creations, products, careers and livelihoods.</P>
      <P>It should not be impossible for RTE to get its act together on this matter because, as Senator Mooney said, it could be a lucrative part of its operation. At the same time, it is questionable whether it should be a monopoly and whether we should be examining an alternative option for international trading and marketing of programmes. As Senator Henry said, that option should be available. We need to ensure that the best possible marketer is available to the people who produce the programmes so that they can get the maximum tradability throughout the world. It is a difficult market but it is an international market and if, for whatever reason, RTE is not represented at world film fairs or does not attend the appropriate fora, the job is not being done adequately. That is important for our fledgling programme and film making industry. We are new to both areas and any independent programme maker deserves to have the best possible promoter of that product available to them in every arena where there is a market. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment also. Some logical points have been made and I do not intend to go into any of the detail to the extent <Col N="623" /> that it has been already been done. Even if I wanted to I do not have the knowledge other people have of this area.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware that for many years it has been a sore point with independent producers and Irish film makers that while they do very well in terms of making a film and getting it to a certain audience, they fall down in terms of distribution and marketing. That issue has been raised over the years. In the context of the Bill and the amendment put forward, we now have an opportunity to seek to put it right.</P>
      <P>We have a small cohort of highly intelligent, creative and imaginative people who have made stunningly good films and excellent documentaries and television programmes. They are the best ambassadors we have abroad for the only real asset we have as a nation &ndash; our intelligence and our creativity. When an Irish film sells well abroad, every Irish person living abroad raises his or her head and is proud to be from Ireland. When we try to break into markets with other commodities, that reputation that film makers gain for us is of great benefit. We should regard our film and television industry and the people who work in it as an important overall resource. They have mastered a whole range of skills, including script writing and technical skills, to enable them put the production in place.</P>
      <P>What has been lacking in terms of the measure that ought to be forthcoming is in the distribution and the marketing areas. Some of the reasons for that have been touched upon, and I will not go into that except to say that this section of the Bill gives us an opportunity to remedy that situation and to unleash the potential that exists. It is important for the producers, and for the country, that this should be done. It is well known that films are not being marketed either at home or abroad in the manner they deserve. I am not saying every film that has been made deserves that kind of treatment but every film deserves a fair chance to reach the market.</P>
      <P>Film makers say there has been a minor improvement recently in terms of distribution but a great deal of potential remains to be exploited. I appeal to the Minister to take Senator Henry's amendment seriously, to listen carefully to what has been said by all speakers and to seek to put in place, in the context of the Bill, a better system that will serve the overall needs in the way that has been outlined.</P>

      <P>With regard to the marketing issue and RTE Commercial Enterprises, that is very much a matter for RTE. I note, however, that Senators have said this matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment before us, Senator Henry raised this issue on Committee Stage and she has since sent me further material on the issue for which I thank her. The fact <Col N="624" /> remains, however, that there is not a statutory requirement on the producers to accept these terms of trade. They are a matter for negotiation between RTE and the independent sector. RTE receives over £60 million in public funding each year and it is important that RTE has the autonomy to do the best deal it can in spending those funds. I cannot make it illegal for RTE to disagree with the independent producers and, accordingly, I am still opposed to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response was as I had expected but I am very disappointed because section 5 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993, defines so much about independent television programmes and producers. It states that producers are the persons who can decide the persons who are to participate in the said programme, the persons who are to be involved in the making of the said programme and the equipment and facilities to be used in the making of the said programme. The only people who are left out are the persons who undertake the distribution and exploitation of the said programme other than as broadcast by the broadcaster itself, and any simultaneous retransmission thereof.</P>
      <P>I thank my fellow Senators for their support, which even came from the Government benches. I know Senator Quill is a fan of the Cork Film Festival and she has such a knowledge of the film making industry here.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney has great knowledge of the making of films and of RTE. So much is set out in the Bill regarding independent producers and I cannot see why my amendment, which would allow them choose who distributes their work, cannot be included. Everybody has agreed there is a problem with distribution of these films, at least 50% of the funding for which is provided by taxpayers. I suspect taxpayers would like to see the very best use being made of these films. While I understand only too well Senator Mooney's comment that not all films are a great financial success, we should not be too pessimistic. Many films are excellent and if given more exposure they might be a better financial success.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the contract states:</P>
      <P>Distribution: Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, RTE shall have the distribution rights for a term of five years from the date of first broadcast in Ireland. On expiry of the five year term the contractor shall be assigned distribution rights unless otherwise agreed between the parties.</P>
      <P>Then comes the important piece:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seventy per cent of the net receipts shall accrue to RTE after the deduction of print and post production costs, agency sales commission (normally 30%), freight and customs charges, copyright licence fees, promotion and publicity costs and any other charges deemed by RTE to <Col N="625" /> have been necessarily incurred in the selling of recordings of the programme. The balance of the 30% shall be paid to the contractor.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there will not be huge sums unless the film is a great financial success. My concern is not just about financing, but that talented young people in every field &ndash; scriptwriters, actors, camera operators, people involved in lighting and costumes &ndash; who must get international exposure if they are to be successful, are not getting it at present. We should not blame RTE for this, though its contract is at fault. I am not enthusiastic about RTE diversifying into merchandising, an area in which it has not been very satisfactorily involved over the years. RTE cannot do everything. It has enough on its plate. I want to ensure independent producers, who make films using our money, are in a position to give films to specialised agencies who go to all the international shows, including the Cork Film Festival.</P>

      <P>It is such a pity we are blocking the availability of these films from people who could sell them from a better position than RTE Commercial Enterprises. A Government amendment has been tabled, so the Bill has to be returned to the Dáil, and it would be a weight off the shoulders of these young film makers and all those <Col N="626" /> involved if the Minister accepted this amendment. Why is it not possible to include such provision for an independent producer when the Bill includes other provisions for them? I find it very difficult to follow. It is cherry-picking and not to the advantage of those working with such enthusiasm. These people have to work extremely hard as the film industry here is not quite as good as it was a few years ago. I meet people who have good ideas, are full of enthusiasm and want to make films but who seriously worry that after spending our money they will be hog-tied regarding the sale of their product.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senator Henry will be delighted to hear that according to the figures, this year is one of the best ever, if not the best, for the Irish film industry. Regarding this amendment, it is not a statutory requirement but a matter of negotiation between RTE and the independent sector. No doubt the Senator will think I am being particularly stubborn on this matter in not wishing to accept her amendment, but I am not convinced by the case put forward. I accept that much public funding is involved, to which I referred in my reply by saying that RTE receives over £60 million in public funding. Because of that it is important that RTE has the autonomy to do the best in terms of spending funds. I do not believe the amendment is warranted.</P>

There was near unanimity on our concern that existing licence holders would have the opportunity of their track record being taken into account. Amendment No. 4 put forward by the Minister is particularly astute.

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for allowing the motion on the Adjournment to be taken today and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, for coming to the House.</P>
      <P>Again this week the intolerable situation in the child care services has been brought into sharp relief and we know who is responsible for this. Mr. Justice Kelly in the High Court has again slated the State's record, saying that it has descended to new levels of farce. What happened this week is beyond belief. There are reports of 13 and 14 year old boys being put into hotels because there is no suitable place of care for them. Mr. Justice Kelly said that not only would he not approve of any proposals for the hotel detention of troubled children, but that he was positively disapproving of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> Other cases that have come before Mr. Justice Kelly include a troubled 13 year old boy who has been held in a Dublin Garda station for five days, a teenage girl who has been detained at the Central Mental Hospital, a 15 year old boy who was forced to sleep in Pearse Street Garda station after he had failed to turn up in court 52 times, and a 14 year old on assault charges who spent a number of nights in Waterford Garda station after his father refused to pay the £1 bail for his release.</P>
    <P>These appalling cases highlight the point made two months ago by the director of Trinity House, the State's secure centre for convicted juvenile offenders, that it would take years to get an integrated care system where children would be given proper facilities. This helps us realise what the true situation is. Eight of the centre's 22 beds were taken up by disturbed children and although the unit does its best, it is not a therapeutic environment for these children. The director of the national assessment centre said the centre was increasingly unable to carry out assessments because beds are occupied by disturbed children who should be elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Obviously children and sometimes the general public are at risk. We have to thank Mr. Justice Kelly for continually highlighting this scandal in our care system but those thanks are not enough. Why is it that each time these cases hit the headlines we have to call upon the Government to provide secure places where children are given proper facilities? </P>
    <P>I accept that this is not a simple or straightforward problem and it cannot have a simple or straightforward solution. These young people have problems throughout their lives and what we need is a co-ordinated approach to solving their difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is a stark contrast between this crisis and the response to what is happening in the agricultural and food industries. This morning in this House we congratulated the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for his speedy response to the foot and mouth disease threat. Nobody is able to congratulate the Minister for Health and Children for his speedy response to the threat to young people.</P>
    <P>This is not to say we want a stop-gap solution. What we need is a proper, well co-ordinated approach to the care of vulnerable children. This must be addressed as a matter of great urgency. We know the difficulties in relation to staffing levels and the needs of staff in terms of wages, conditions, support and, most important of all, training appropriate to the needs of the young people they are dealing with. This is possible if it is given the utmost priority and that is what the Government must do. We must ensure that children, particularly those who are most vulnerable in society, receive the supports they need, whether this is therapy, psychological services or other supports.</P>
    <P>Above all, what these children need within our education system, and our society as a whole, is <Col N="630" /> an early intervention system so that they can be supported from a very early age and do not become drop-outs or fall between the cracks of what services there are. We have a national children strategy but unfortunately it is just not working for these young people. I take this opportunity to highlight the issue and to put the onus on the Department of Health and Children to ensure that these children are cared for.</P>
    <P>They are not just the flotsam and jetsam of society. To treat them as such is intolerable and something of which we should be ashamed. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the facilities are provided for these young people as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Keogh for giving me the opportunity to put on the record the absolute priority this Government places on children, and has done since it came into office in 1997. This is evidenced by the fact that we have invested more than £90 million extra revenue in the development of child care services. This significant investment has allowed for the development of improved services to tackle youth homelessness in Dublin and elsewhere. New child and family support services, such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects, have also been put in place to allow health boards provide a range of appropriate interventions in order to place specialised residential care in an appropriate context.</P>
      <P>This additional funding has allowed health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places from 17 in 1996 to a current total of approximately 70 places. That figure of 17 is from the term of the last Government, of which Senator Keogh's party was a member. The need for these places was identified in a High Court case in 1995, as the former Government not only provided no new places but had made no plans for new places. This meant that all that work started in 1997 and we have now increased the number of places to 70. That number includes one-third of the 24 places in the purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in Dublin, which is ready, but which can only be opened on a phased basis due to difficulties in recruiting staff.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of special arrangements have been provided by health boards for individual children and this will continue to be a feature of the boards' responses to the needs of troubled children. Taking a child into residential care is undertaken only as a last resort because we accept that the child should be supported within his or her own family first and, where that cannot happen, within foster care. An extra allocation was made in this year's budget for the support of foster care and foster carers. A national development plan exists for the provision of high support and special care residential places based on the needs identified by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans are under way to develop an additional 56 places nationally. In the Eastern Regional <Col N="631" /> Health Authority area the construction of a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane has commenced. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. The Midland Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblaney, ten high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board and five high support places for boys in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, special arrangements for individual children will continue to be provided and this will bring the total number of places available to about 160, at a total capital cost of approximately £30 million. This is a large increase from the 17 places available when this Government took over in 1997.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to a number of points relating to the speed at which the development of high support and special care units can be undertaken and put in place by health boards. Because of the public perception of these services and some opposition from local communities I know that health boards find it difficult to source suitable sites or premises. This complicates and lengthens the planning process. The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult. In response, some health boards have recruited staff from outside the State. Against this background considerable progress has been made by the health boards in putting this programme of developments in place.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, which is currently before a Committee of the Dáil, contains a number of important measures for non-offending children who are in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 of the Bill which empowers health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection and Part 2 which introduces the family welfare conference on a statutory basis for the first time. Familly welfare conferencing has been operating on a pilot basis for the past year. It has been evaluated and it has given us some valuabale guidance and information for the future.</P>

      <Col N="632" /> The Government also recognises that research is needed to establish what works well in responding to the needs of children. It is not enough to be well intentioned, our policies need to be underpinned by solid, research-based evidence. In this context the Senator will be aware that a £200,000 annual research fund has been established under the aegis of the National Children's Office as part of the national children's strategy for research into the needs of children in care. Although the national children's strategy was only launched in November, we can already see some real effects.</P>
    <P>Child welfare services are not just about additional funding and additional specialised residential services being put in place. They are, more importantly, about ensuring the highest standards in the provision of those services, especially in the provision of services for children in care.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in this regard since this Government came to office, with the setting up of the social services inspectorate on an administrative basis in April 1999. In the first three years, the inspectorate is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on residential child care services. I acknowledge the important work the inspectorate has done to date, in partnership with health board management and staff and other providers of services, in recognising best practice and helping to improve standards.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter carefully, including concerns about isolated instances where standards of care have fallen short of what is expected, I intend proposing to Government that the social services inspectorate be established on a statutory footing to strengthen its role in relation to ensuring that our child welfare services are of the highest standards. Such development would also complement the role of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and I intend publishing the legislation shortly. This office, when established, will act as a powerful advocate for children and promote the welfare and rights of children. With the Ombudsman for Children, I intend to continue to be an advocate for children and I have the full backing of the Government in ensuring that will happen.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 February 2001.</P>
