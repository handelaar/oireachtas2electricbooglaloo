      <P>The Order of Business is No.1, the Mental Health Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee Stage; No. 2, Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken no earlier than 2.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes, and Senators may share time; No. 3, motion 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for taking the advice I gave him yesterday regarding the taking of Report Stage of the Mental Health Bill. It is not good legislative practice to compress the taking of legislation like that. If the Carer's Leave Bill is not completed before 6 p.m., is it intended to take it after 8 p.m.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate was requested yesterday in regard to President Bush's visit. He will visit Sweden tomorrow which, as we know, is the home of environmentally conscious people. It is appropriate that Ireland's voice is raised there both in regard to the issue of global warming, which he seems to deny, and the 1972 nuclear missile treaty, which is moribund, according to Mr. Bush, but which has through the years worked well, including during the Cold War period, to prevent the escalation of nuclear arms. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make it known to Mr. Bush personally and through the EU leaders that tinkering with the 1972 anti-nuclear treaty could be very dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue raised yesterday, which is very much in the public domain today, is the National Roads Authority and the seeking of partnership with private enterprise. I have no objection to such a partnership but if it is to be done, it should be debated in both Houses before any decision is made. My view on the National Roads Authority <Col N="70" /> is very clear. No group should be above democratic accountability, and it is. Therefore, I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on that issue. A substantial amount of revenue is raised from car tax, most of which does not go back into roads. Non-designated tax may be appropriate for the Government but when in the region of 90% of taxation is not going back into roads, we have to ask questions. Will the Leader agree to such a debate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for agreeing to restrict the Mental Health Bill to Committee Stage today, which is very much appreciated. In terms of dealing with the issues I raised yesterday and which were raised this morning &ndash; the Kyoto Protocol and disarmament &ndash; we should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in and explain the Government's position on them. We learned many years ago that there is no point having hugely confrontational attitudes between east and west &ndash; it does not work. What needs to be explained to President Bush is that decisions on Kyoto and nuclear disarmament are issues which required huge compromise and a lot of movement. Many people were unhappy with final outcomes but everybody took the decision for the greater global interest. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House and allow debate to take place on this matter. The position of the American President should be inched forward so that he has an understanding not only of the issues, which he does, but of the fact that he cannot take decisions in the interests of America only. These are global matters which concern everybody on the globe. That is the message that has to be conveyed to him and with that he has to agree.</P>
      <P>I would like a debate on education, particularly in terms of funding. A commitment was given to have such a debate and I would like to see it on the agenda in the next two weeks, otherwise I may need to table amendments to the Order of Business. Funding for school buildings, disadvantaged areas, in particular, and special education is an issue of huge importance about which we are getting many demands from people. I would like these issues to be discussed here. Every Member of the House has solid, practical and progressive views on this from which the Minister could take advice. I accept that wisdom does not lie on one side of the House. Members have something to say on this and we should have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers in relation to taking every opportunity when President Bush is in Europe to highlight the global issues of concern, the environmental issue and the issue we raised yesterday, the death penalty, where the American experience is not akin to the one in Europe. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should come into the House to enable us to discuss this matter. Now that we have a seat on the Security Council we should be exerting and <Col N="71" /> asserting a role in that capacity. We have a better opportunity of being heard abroad because we have been respected by 186 countries who voted for us to have a voice at the Security Council.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Cabinet decision yesterday to establish a national forum in relation to referenda and the Treaty of Nice. It is a little like putting the cart before the horse but nevertheless it is welcome. I am concerned as to what its composition will be. I call for a wider debate on this issue in the House because we are distancing ourselves from Europe. There is not a perception that citizens here or this Parliament has any connection with the European experience. This is the opportunity for us to discuss how we, as a Parliament, relate to the European Parliament and the European institutions. It is an opportunity to have a wide-ranging discussion on decision making domestically in terms of our subsidiarity position and in Europe and on the treaties that are being negotiated. This Parliament and this House, in particular, should have a full discussion on the issue.</P>
      <P>The all-Ireland report on mortality rates is being launched today North and South of the Border. I call for a debate on that as it reveals an alarming statistic. Those who live in deprived areas tend to have a much higher mortality rate than those who live in higher occupational areas. While one may say that is a given, one of the good points about the Nice treaty was that it made provision for a biennial audit whereby each country would have to provide an anti-poverty audit of the measures it was taking to tackle poverty. This issue has a strong connection with that aspect of the Nice treaty. I call for a debate on the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on banking. While we dealt with legislation in that area yesterday, this is a broader issue. It concerns the recent decision of many of our commercial banks to close branches in towns, villages and even in some suburbs of our cities and their refusal to discuss the matter with local organisations. That flies in the face of the efforts of local development organisations and Government policy on decentralisation and the work of Departments and agencies. We should investigate the possibility of how we can advance the cause of post offices and credit unions so that we can provide an alternative to commercial banks and support their efforts. In doing so, we would be supporting the efforts of local development organisations and Government policy. A debate on this matter would be opportune and appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the pertinent comments made by my acting Leader, Senator Coogan. I would like to recognise the great good Kerry Co-op proposes to do for many in the agri<Col N="72" /> cultural community, particularly in the Golden Vale. I refer to the proposal&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the protection afforded by the Chair on this matter. The Leader will recognise the importance of the future of our food industry. In the national interest, I wish that company's efforts every success.</P>
      <P>In my absence yesterday there was much talk about Europe when that great soothsayer and fellow countyman of mine raised the issue. A more important wake up call relates to the euro&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much not being here. I agree with Senator Finneran's request for <Col N="73" /> a debate on banking, its social input and all the other ramifications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the House should take due cognisance of the decision by the Government yesterday, particularly by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, in regard to increased payments to foster parents. I ask the Leader for a debate on the background to the need for fostering. Lack of education, lack of discipline in homes and lack of parental care is a big problem. While I applaud what is being done in the area of fostering, it is about time we looked at the background to the need for fostering.</P>
      <P>I read an article by Mr. Horovitz in the Middle East in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which states that Mr. George Tenet, the head of the CIA, has given the Palestinians a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; ultimatum or else they will go back into full war. The Israelis have decided they will &ldquo;take it&rdquo; and the Palestinians are saying &ldquo;do not take it or leave it&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the CIA is not good. If there is an early debate on the Middle East, I ask the Leader for a discussion on the &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude of the CIA in relation to a conflict in the Middle East for which the CIA has absolutely no responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the legislative agenda in Britain, I realise the new Government is copying a great deal of the legislation we have introduced. I am referring in particular to the success of our Criminal Assets Bureau which that Government now intends to copy and introduce. They also intend to devolve authority down the line.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of flag flying and bells and whistles when we announced the strategic management initiative approximately six years ago. It was to be a long programme which began very well. It may well be successful. I ask the Leader to bring to this House the Minister responsible, who may be the Taoiseach, to tell us how it has achieved its standards. This relates to devolving authority down the line.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on aviation for which we asked some time ago. I am reminded of a report yesterday of a near miss last year at Heathrow Airport when approximately 400 people were almost involved in a crash because of authority being devolved down the line to those involved at air traffic control. We should debate that issue before an accident occurs. Perhaps there is no problem and everything is in control. However, I would like the Minister to come to this House and put our minds at rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's request for a debate on the health report being published today. That will give us an opportunity <Col N="74" /> for a fundamental debate on health issues. There is a clear correlation between income and social class and health status. A debate would give us the opportunity to discuss whether it would be better to try taking people out of poverty in order to improve their health than to build more hospitals and increase the number of beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have an early debate on education, including particularly learning disability? Other speakers have also mentioned the need for early intervention in relation to children from deprived backgrounds. We must emphasise how important it is that children get opportunities from the earliest stage. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on this issue as soon as possible, particularly since there is a focus on education at the moment with exams taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I reinforce the point that an early debate on education is very important. It should encompass the success story or otherwise of Breaking the Cycle and also the transition from primary into second level and from second to third level. It should be discussed particularly in the light of the Combat Poverty report.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government for setting up the national forum in relation to the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum. We should have a full debate on that to show our concern and to help clear misinformation. The national forum should be allowed do its work before we have the debate.</P>
      <P>It is important also that we have a discussion on the operation of the banks in the light of the euro change. The banks should not dictate the social structure of the country. The role of post offices and the social system within the infrastructure of small villages and towns should be included in that discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ensure that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government comes into the House to discuss the role of the National Roads Authority, particularly in the light of public and private partnerships and the imposition of tolls, and also the lack of appropriate compensation to farmers and ordinary citizens discommoded by bypasses and the construction of motorways?</P>
      <P>I ask also for debate on car insurance. This morning we received an excellent document from Macra na Feirme on car insurance and provisional drivers. Macra asks the Government to impose price controls on the cost of insurance for young drivers. We should have a debate on that before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review existing legislation on the implementation and enforcement of crowd control at major sporting events in view of the serious incident that took place on the terraces of Páirc Uí Chaoimh last Sunday. We were fortu<Col N="75" /> nate that there was no serious injury or fatality arising from the inefficient and blatantly careless crowd management there. It is urgent that the Minister should review the legislation and bring forward new legislation if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for debate on Europe. It should not be on the referendum <i>per se</i>. I have met a large number of people who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but if somebody tries to foist a second referendum on them without a proper debate they will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We need to be careful with this issue. The debate should be wide ranging. All communication between this country and the EU was excluded from the Freedom of Information Act because it is regarded as international relations. We cannot insist on its being international relations and then claim it is a European Union. There is no reason why most of what the Government says to the EU should not be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The fact that European directives do not apply to the Commission itself is very convenient as it can make its own rules. That Commissioners still have duty-free privileges is one of a succession of issues of secrecy and accountability. If we do not move away from the belief that consultation is unnecessary, the European project will collapse. Such an eventuality was obvious from the Amsterdam treaty and I am surprised nobody noticed at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a discussion on rural services, including banks and post offices. I suggest we invite the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to speak to the House as he is responsible for rural and western development and has put proposals to Cabinet in relation to dealing with certain specific needs. We should consider setting aside Government time to listen to the Minister of State's proposals.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello mentioned the Cabinet decision in relation to the Nice treaty. The most glaring aspect of the discussions on the treaty was the disinformation and lack of information in relation to the EU. While I respect the privileges enjoyed by the House, I ask that we provide information to the public on Europe. Many people suffer from a shortage of information regarding events in Brussels and this needs to be addressed seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's call for a debate on banking. I particularly refer to AIB's rationalisation policy which has already resulted in the closure of two branches in County Limerick, including that in Kilfinnane, a town which no longer has a banking facility. If banks do not want to provide such basic services to customers, post offices and credit unions should be equipped to do so. I find it difficult to reconcile AIB's sponsorship of the Better Ireland awards which recognise the efforts of communities with the bank's closure of branches. I would welcome <Col N="76" /> a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Chambers for this House to play a role in bridging the information gulf between the EU and the public. I am aware that the Leader of the House is a strong proponent of this idea and perhaps this is an opportune time to look at how such a role can best be played.</P>
      <P>I refer also to Senator Coogan's call for a debate on the National Roads Authority's plans to introduce many new tolls. It is not correct to say that only 10% of funding from motor taxation goes back into roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is 17%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not being debated now and these points can be made during the debate that has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am allowed to finish I will explain the point to which I was coming. This Minister has channelled motor taxation funding into local government. There has never been as much money for roads as in recent years.</P>
      <P>When the Leader is organising a debate on this matter, I ask him to broaden it to include the entire national development plan. I am concerned about this topic as in my local area I have seen a two year delay while consultants considered which route to recommend. Given our serious infrastructural deficits and the need for significant investment as early as possible, such delays are incommensurate with the requirements of the transport industry. If the debate is on the national development plan as a whole, issues like tolls can be discussed too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education. I remind the Leader that I have sought a debate on two specific educational matters for months. The first of these is the highly respected Cromien report on the reform of the Department of Education and Science. The other is the NCCA report on the restructuring of the leaving certificate. These two reports are highly significant and advocate long overdue and badly needed reform of key areas of the education system. It is almost a scandal that the reports are gathering dust and that we cannot debate them with a view to action concerning their recommendations. I ask the Leader not to allow this session to finish without having made provision for a full-scale debate on both of these highly important reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on banking. For a long time we in this House have been trying to get the message across to the banks that the way they are doing their business is not good enough. Similarly, I support Senator Jackman's call for a debate on car insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the taxi industry, it is appalling that there is a possibility that a taxi cab which I might pick <Col N="77" /> up in Dublin late in the evening might be driven by somebody who is believed by the Garda Síochána to be involved in criminal activity. We need to examine seriously the criteria by which taxi licences are allocated. What is happening is an absolute disgrace. We should have a debate in this House as soon as possible, and I look forward to contributing on same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for a debate on the National Roads Authority. I have asked for such a debate a number of times during this session. I agree with Senator Walsh. However, I do not agree with Senator Coogan's comments on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and motor taxation. My reason for calling for this debate is totally different from Senator Coogan's. It is on the basis of the very small input by the National Roads Authority into our national secondary roads. I ask for a review of the possibility of bringing the national secondary roads back within the ambit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, based on the Minister's performance in the current Dáil. Perhaps then we would have a proper upgrading of our national secondary roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan inquired about the Carer's Leave Bill. If this is not concluded before 6 p.m. it will resume after 8 p.m. Senators Coogan, O'Toole and Costello expressed a desire to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House to discuss many issues which were highlighted this morning. I can have this done, as I said yesterday on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan, Jackman, Walsh and Bonner called for a debate on the National Roads Authority and I have agreed to an all-day debate. Senator Walsh suggested that the national development plan be coupled with it. I will certainly consider that and hope we will be able to have the debate before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Hayes called for a debate on health. There will be no difficulty in allocating time to such a debate. Senators O'Toole, Costello, Keogh, Ormonde and Quill called for a debate on education. Senators Quill and Ormonde referred particularly to the two reports. I will allow time for this in the coming weeks. Senator Costello welcomed the Government's decision yesterday to establish a national forum following the referendum result last week. I will pass his views on to the Taoiseach.</P>

    <P>Senators Finneran, Coghlan, Chambers, Cregan and Cox called for an urgent debate on banking. I considered this during the Order of Business and I will be proposing that the House have a debate next week in Fianna Fáil's Private Members' time from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If a sufficient number of Members are interested &ndash; it appears from the Order of Business this morning that this is the case &ndash; the debate can be extended by one hour. If the party whose turn it is the fol<Col N="78" /> lowing week wishes, it can also take it. It is very serious that banks are closing branches and rationalising at a time of economic buoyancy. However, it may provide a window of opportunity for post offices and credit unions.</P>
    <P>Many magnificent buildings are occupied by banking institutions in the towns and cities. Perhaps they could pass on their goodwill to the communities that have supported them by offering these to the credit unions and post offices to continue business. However, no doubt this will not happen and the commitment of the communities that have served them long and hard will possibly not be rewarded. As legislators we must give Members the opportunity to express their views in the presence of the Minister. I intend to start that debate during Private Members' business at 6 p.m. next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the food industry. I can have time allocated for this. Senator Lanigan complimented the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, on the allocations for fostering and called for a debate on this issue. I can allow time for this. Many families have played a very important social role in fostering over the past decades. They have done an excellent job and I am delighted to note the increased allocations announced by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also called for a debate on the Middle East. The House recently debated this issue but I can review the possibility of holding another debate before the start of the summer recess. Senator Quinn referred to the British Government availing of the progressive legislation we have introduced across all Departments. We have no objection to that. I understand an all-party committee under the chairmanship of Senator Roche is dealing with the matter he highlighted.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman and Senator Cox called for a debate on the motor insurance industry, while Senator Cox expressed strong views on those persons deemed suitable for taxi licences in Dublin. I can have time allowed for this. Senator Liam Fitzgerald expressed concern about crowd control, especially in the context of the appearance and success of the Limerick hurling team last Sunday. I will pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 20, after &ldquo;Health&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(Involuntary Admission)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring the Bill into line with its objective. The Bill is largely concerned with involuntary admission and this should be referred to in line 20 so as to read: <Col N="79" />&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Mental Health (Involuntary Admission) Act, 2001.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because the Bill deals with much more than the process of involuntary admission. More than half the Bill is concerned with providing for the establishment of the mental health commission and the new office of inspector of mental health services. Part 5 deals with the provisions regarding the registration of approved centres in which both involuntary and voluntary patients will reside and for a system of regulation and inspection whereby standards will be maintained in those centres.</P>
      <P>The functions of the mental health commission as described in the Bill will extend far beyond the involuntary admission process. The commission will be concerned with the interests of all patients, both voluntary and involuntary, and with ensuring that the highest standards are adhered to in the provision of mental health services. Accordingly, it would do the Bill a disservice to rename it the &ldquo;Mental Health (Involuntary Admission) Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senators have criticised the fact that some proposals that appeared in the White Paper in 1995 are not included in the Bill. The Minister made it clear during the debate on the Bill in the other House that these issues have not been overlooked or forgotten. They will be considered and addressed by the Department as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill.</P>

Some consultant psychiatrists are not employed by a health board or an approved centre, but they are competent consultant psychiatrists. Why have they been excluded?

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 30, after &ldquo;provide&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;assessment,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would have been wise to include &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; before &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; because one decides on the care and treatment of a patient following assessment. From a clinical point of view, it would be wise to insert &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; in the subsection.</P>

      <P>Mental health services are defined for the purpose of the Bill as services which provide care and treatment to persons suffering from a mental illness or a mental disorder under the clinical direction of a consultant psychiatrist. Senator Henry's amendment is unnecessary because any services that provide care and treatment to people suffering from mental illness would also of necessity have to provide assessment services. Therefore, I do not intend to accept the amendment because its point is already incorporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a constant criticism of the medical profession that it does not spend sufficient time making assessments before it gives care and treatment. This is why I tabled the amendment. The assessment of the patient's problem is the most important part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Any treatment would <i>ipso facto</i> entail assessment. One cannot properly treat a person's condition if one does not go through the proper assessment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a satisfactory response. The Bill states later that the patient is paramount. Surely the assessment of the patient's problem is extremely important but that is not stressed in the Bill. There is an enormous amount in this Bill about treatment and indeed a good bit also about care, but there is very little on assessment.</P>

      <P>I accept the points made by Senator Henry but I am advised that the amendment proposed is unnecessary. Where reference is made in the Bill to a parent of a child, there is also reference to a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i>. This can be seen in section 25(3) and section 23(2). I am advised that this is more appropriate in terms of drafting the Bill than the amendment suggested by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 of the Bill does not adequately look at the rights of the child. The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, has published a report on the improvements that are to be made in foster care. There is a huge number of children currently in foster care compared to the numbers some years ago. Of course, this is preferable to having so many children in institutional care. There will be more and more people who may be acting <i>in loco parentis </i>for troubled children and we must acknowledge the importance of that work at the <Col N="82" /> beginning of the Bill. Many of the children we will be dealing with will be troubled children. The main reason that children are put into care is a troubled past with perhaps psychiatric problems. The Minister will be aware of the extent of mental illness among the homeless. There may be parents who are not in a position to act in the best interests of the child. We must stress our interest in the welfare of these children by putting this reference at the beginning of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, fortunate for the Minister of State that my colleague, Senator Norris, is not here. I would have thought it wise to include provision for same sex partnerships. Surely under our equality legislation this would be required. Are we not liable to fall foul of that if we do not include both opposite and same sex partnerships in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ÜfcMr. Ryan ÜfcMr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I vigorously support Senator Henry's amendment. I am always taken by the prissiness of Government in relation to issues like this. I recall a definition of the term &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; which was presented in this House by a Minister who is still a member of the Government. The purpose was to save money on social welfare payments. He listed about eight reasons and then quietly mentioned sex at the bottom of the page. I see no reason we could not define &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; as husband and wife and leave it at that. Alternatively, if the definition is to be extended, it should be fully extended. It is an extraordinary phrase because, depending on how one interprets &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo;, it could mean that a brother and <Col N="83" /> sister are regarded as spouses. It is interesting that no definition of &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; is included. There is such a definition in social welfare law and in some of our pension law, but of course that only applies in the relevant context.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; is inserted here, perhaps to pretend to be liberal, but a distinction is made on the basis of gender which makes a mockery of it. There are two options, either, as Senator Henry suggested, to remove the discrimination on the basis of gender or to revert to a simple and intelligent definition in terms of a couple who are married and living together. The middle route which the Minister is following is almost laughable if it was not offensive in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the purpose of the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in the Bill. The term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; is used in section 9 to allow the spouse of a person make an application for involuntary admission of the person to a psychiatric hospital. This is not a privilege or an honour, but rather a facility to allow people to seek care for spouses who are unable or unwilling to access care for themselves. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a cohabiting partner of the same sex from making such an application because section 9(1)(<i>d</i>) allows any other person to make an application, subject to certain safeguards. It cannot be said that this provision discriminates against same sex couples. Under the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act, discrimination is defined as &ldquo;where a person in a minority group is treated less favourably than other persons&rdquo;. In the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in this Bill, we are not conferring special privilege on those who are deemed to be spouses, as opposed to those who are not.</P>
      <P>This provision does not discriminate against same sex couples because their treatment under the section is no less favourable than that of those in heterosexual relationships. There is no recognition in Irish law at present of same sex marriages or relationships. I do not consider that mental health legislation is the appropriate place to set such a precedent. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment. The term &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; was inserted in the Dáil in response to a Fine Gael and Labour Party amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here today because we have a problem with the European Convention on Human Rights, under which we were criticised for years about involuntary admission. I did not speak on Senator Ryan's amendment on this matter. There is more to it than just involuntary admission, but it is that aspect of the White Paper <Col N="84" /> on Mental Health, 1995, that has us here today. The most important section, chapter 7, on mentally ill people before the courts or in custody, was not dealt with.</P>
      <P>We could be in trouble again because of our definitions. Articles 8 and 14 of the convention, which we incorporated into Irish law in a sort of a way, suggest that opposite and same sex co-habitees should have the same rights. I take the Minister's point that it is not a privilege to make an application for involuntary admission. I hope that we err on the side of psychiatric social workers and psychiatric community nurses applying rather than close relatives. The involuntary patient will come out of hospital and may blame the applicant for being admitted. That is one reason it is better to encourage third party applications. It will be argued that this is also in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;, intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the definition that treatment, &ldquo;in relation to a patient, includes the administration of physical, psychological and other remedies relating to the care and rehabilitation of a patient under medical supervision, intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder.&rdquo; Why is &ldquo;ameliorating a mental disorder&rdquo; there? A patient could break a leg and it would be treated. It says &ldquo;physical&rdquo; but the words &ldquo;intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder&rdquo; indicate that they will only deal with physical signs and symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, which are a side effect of treatment. These words do not add to the Bill. It would be wise to say that whatever happens to the patient, he or she will receive treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition defines treatment for the purpose of this Bill and has particular relevance for the provision contained in Part 4. It contains provisions on consent to treatment and the administration of psycho-surgery, electro-convulsive therapy and medication to patients who are involuntarily detained. Senator Henry's amendment means that the provisions of Part 4, in relation to consent, for example, would apply to all treatment received by an involuntary patient, including treatment in an acute general hospital for physical ailments. That is not the Bill's intention. Consent of patients to treatment for medical conditions and other physical ailments unrelated to mental illness is covered, as the Senator knows, by common law and it is not proposed to change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last amendment, the Minister argued that we did not need <i>in loco parentis</i> in the general interpretation because it was in <Col N="85" /> section 25. Now he says we need it in the general interpretation because it will apply section 40. The word &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; is used in other sections of the Bill. Why can we not do the same with &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; here, as he suggested on <i>in loco parentis</i>, and take this out of the general interpretation? He argued on the last one that we did not need it in the general interpretation as it was in the specific section. Now the Minister argues that we need it in the general interpretation because there is a specific section on mental treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the treatment of an involuntary patient for a condition not related to mental illness be less because he or she is involuntary? This is a serious issue. Article 40 of the Constitution states, &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law.&rdquo; This Bill means that the law will deprive people of their personal liberty, which makes it important. Apart from the courts, only a couple of psychiatrists are able to deprive someone of his or her personal liberty. We must be sure that we take adequate care of those we deprive of their liberty. I am not sure that this does so. If we seek to describe treatment in a particular manner at a certain stage, we should do just that, and in the general section let treatment cover everything.</P>

I agree that the constitutional right is not to be held against a person's will except under law. However, this makes it clear that it narrows the conditions under which a person can be held. It must be for the purpose of ameliorating a mental disorder. If we include broken legs, sore heads and other ailments, it will be unnecessarily wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Senators' points. However, it does say that, but &ldquo;physical&rdquo; is then modified by the clause, &ldquo;intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder&rdquo;. If we <Col N="86" /> take out from &ldquo;physical&rdquo; to &ldquo;intended,&rdquo; it modifies all that, including the administration of physical care and rehabilitation intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder.

Why can we not include in Part 4 treatment such as psycho-surgery, electro-convulsive treatment and other areas which we are left out? If we want to do that, we can have the specific definition of treatment there rather than have this blanket definition of treatment.

Quite a lot of research is being done in the mid-west region on two individuals who have been in and out of prison and who have been diagnosed as having ADHD. They are not included in this in terms of assessment of their problems and having their mental health problems addressed. This is a relatively new phenomenon and, of course, there is disagreement between psychiatrists, psychologists and other personnel in relation to who does and does not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There is no doubt that children who escape definition, who are not treated with appropriate drugs and are not given proper support end up in our prisons. I would classify them as prisoners who should not be in prison in the first place but if they are there, the detection of <Col N="87" /> ADHD should be carried out and they should be included in this Bill. It would relieve the situation for a large number of people in prison who suffer from the problem.</P>
    <P>We have been supported by the governor of Mountjoy who has given a blanket figure of 50% of prisoners who he believes should not be there but should be under the mental health services. He has taken a particular interest in the plight of teenagers suffering from ADHD who end up in prison. He says they should be treated. The condition was not recognised then but it is in the throes of being recognised now and a lot of research has been done. It should have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have an extremely high level of suicide in prison and this has been documented. Deputy Neville, as a Senator, did quite a lot in that area and continues to be involved. I accept what he has to say in regard to the level of suicide in our prisons. Prisoners do not receive appropriate attention, support or treatment. Prisoners who have a tendency towards suicide are in an extremely threatening environment and it is very hard for them to survive if they have a disorder or are in a state of intensive depression.</P>
    <P>This Mental Health Bill does not go as far as we would have liked. Many people and organisations within the community had very high expectations and it is a pity the Minister did not go far enough and include what I consider important issues. I hope he will concede to including this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Jackman's amendment which at least makes some attempt to try to address a very serious problem with this Bill. Chapter 7 of the White Paper on mental health produced in 1995 is not in the Bill. Long before that White Paper was produced, the Henchy committee in 1978 said in regard to any persons dealt with by the courts as normal offenders who are either not responsible or not fully responsible for the conduct charged against them or who, even if fully responsible for such conduct, are in need of psychiatric or other special treatments, that the inability or restricted ability of the courts to order that the convicted person should receive appropriate treatment is a grave defect in the present state of the criminal law. I know the Minister will argue that this should be dealt with under criminal law legislation, but this is a possibility of bringing these ill people under a civil Bill. The White Paper suggested that this should be so. It was a great disappointment to many people that when this legislation was brought forward that there was nothing in it to cover this really serious area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman was quite right when she spoke about the number of people within our penal institutions who are suffering from mental illness. As we speak, there are people in Mountjoy who are in padded cells and who have been declared insane. The opening of Cloverhill <Col N="88" /> as a remand centre has, to some extent, ameliorated the situation because those within the prison system are trying to do their best to try to get people taken out of totally unsuitable circumstances and brought to areas where they may get slightly better treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman's proposal is very modest and states &ldquo;as far as it is practicable&rdquo;. We should try to apply this Bill to those people. Further on in the Bill, we will bring in sections which are more likely than not to increase the number of people sent to prison because of disruptive social behaviour. I know it is not the aim of the Bill to do this, but we want to be very careful that is not a very nine to five Bill and that those who have to apply it do not find themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances in dealing with the people presented to them either by the Garda or by relatives.</P>
    <P>The level of psychiatric illness in the prison community has been remarked on for decades. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admitted in this House that the psychiatric services within prisons were totally inadequate. It is good to have a psychologist like Senator Lydon here because the psychological services within the prison are virtually nil. This amendment is an attempt to remove at least some of those persons from the prison system and to have this Bill applied to them. It is a modest suggestion as to how we could do something about chapter 7.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that chapter 8, which related to the bringing in of adult care orders for people who did not need to be detained but, for their own well-being and safety, needed some sort of supervision in the community, is not included in the Bill. That would have been a very important addition in trying to ensure that people were not readmitted. This is the sort of situation to which Senator Jackman is pointing. It would be a modest achievement if the Minister could accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The most appropriate way of addressing the problems in the prison psychiatric services is the development of adequate services within the prison setting. I agree with the view expressed regarding the need for substantial improvements in the psychiatric services currently provided for the prison population. I support the principle that the health services available to prisoners should be on a par with those available to the rest of the community. I assure the House that the Department of Health and Children is actively taking steps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is represented on the review group on the structure and organisation of prison health care services which was established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 1999. Among other things, this groups is examining the need for a recognition of psychiatric services for prisoners and the provision of a properly structured forensic psychiatric service. Many of the concerns raised here today are being <Col N="89" /> considered in the course of this group's work. The group has visited every prison here and has also visited some prisons outside this jurisdiction to consider the best practice in the organisation of prison health care. The report of the group is nearing completion.  </P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the need to quantify the extent of mental disorder among the prison population. The problem in verifying the real needs in this area stems to a large extent from the lack of a consultant forensic psychiatrist input to the prisons. One of the objectives of the Department of Health and Children in recent years has been to address that situation. Since 1999 funding of £5 million and additional consultant forensic psychiatric teams has been provided. One of those has been appointed to the Central Mental Hospital and is also working in Mountjoy and Cloverhill Prisons. Two further posts in the Eastern Regional Health Authority have been advertised and will be filled this year. The remainder, one each in Limerick and Cork, will be progressed later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department has been involved in discussions with the Prison Service and the Midland Health Board on the development of health services for the new midland prison. It is hoped the services developed there will serve as a model of good practice for other prisons in the State.</P>
    <P>A great deal more needs to be done in this area but a start has been made. I assure the House of the commitment of the Minister and the Department to work with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Prison Service to improve health care services for the prison population and, in particular, to continue with the significant improvement in prison psychiatric services that has taken place in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, however, to accept this amendment as the role the Inspector of Mental Health Services is not appropriate to the inspection of prison facilities. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently preparing proposals for an inspector of prisons in the context of the prison Bill. I have already outlined the measures being taken to improve psychiatric services in the prisons and I do not believe this amendment would enhance that work in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has just taken away the compromise I was going to suggest. It is important the Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health Services should have a role in validating prison psychiatric services. If we are saying that we will give these people as good a psychiatric service within the prison as they would get outside it, one way of making sure of that is by ensuring they are inspected and validated by the same people. I would have thought that meeting the spirit of this amendment would have been a small step for the Minister of State and a great step for man<Col N="90" /> kind. The term &ldquo;as far as it is practicable&rdquo; is helpful. This could be dealt with by way of regulation.</P>
      <P>As has been said over and over again, it is a matter of a lottery as to whether a certain group of people in society finish up in a psychiatric hospital, in a prison or on the streets. The latter two settings are clearly inappropriate.</P>
      <P>It is an observable fact that forensic psychiatry on this island is rather a disadvantaged area so we would not want to put too much money into that area in the short term. It may be thought that because these people are in prison, they are in a place of safety. They may be in the sense that they will not create trouble for the wider community but they may not necessarily be in a place of safety or in a proper place for themselves.</P>
      <P>I would have been content with keeping those people in prison because of the difficulties of arranging for gardaí to accompany them and so on when they go out but only on the condition that the prison psychiatric service is up to the standard we seek for our people. Citizens, irrespective of whether they are prisoners, are entitled to that. I hope the Minister of State might at least accept that, while the prison services are being brought up to a standard in this area, those involved are allowed to do so under the validation of and benefiting from the advice and experience of the Mental Health Commission.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Senator Jackman which is clearly supported by Senator Maurice Hayes. What the Minister of State said opened my eyes to the work that is being done in this area of which I was not fully aware. Clearly a great deal is being done.</P>
      <P>This is not the type of problem to which there is only one possible solution. Two terms in the amendment, &ldquo;in so far as it is practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the discretion of the Commission&rdquo; cannot but be of benefit. I will not repeat what Senator Hayes said about the different people detained in prison. This amendment cannot but be an extra benefit in handling the difficult problems in prisons by ensuring that facilities in this area are up to date. I support Senator Jackman's amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Henry and Quinn for their support and particularly Senator Maurice Hayes for his constructive comments. I take on board what the Minister of State said which is to be welcomed. While I know what he said is not only aspirational and that such work will be done, I cannot but think in terms of time. I am mindful of young people suffering in prison who are not being provided with an appropriate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of this amendment is sufficient in terms of its practicality in that it states &ldquo;in so far as it is practicable&rdquo; and also &ldquo;at the discretion of the Commission&rdquo;. It was framed in such a way to provide for that scope. I cannot but hope that what I propose will happen some day. I hope the reforms to which the Minister of State referred <Col N="91" /> will be introduced quickly, but that is of no joy to people in the system who need a quality health service appropriate to their needs, particularly young people who may be suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and in prison <Col N="92" /> because they did not get appropriate treatment when they were much younger. In the interests of them and other prisoners suffering from mental illness, I press the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier we started to discuss the definition of a consultant psychiatrist. This is a very narrow definition and causes me to wonder how we will deal with the practicality of the Bill later. We define consultant psychiatrist here as &ldquo;a consultant psychiatrist who is employed by a health board or by an approved centre&rdquo;. Later in the Bill we say &ldquo;consultant psychiatrists who can serve on tribunals may be those within seven years of retiring&rdquo;. I presume that is of retiring from the health board. There are a considerable number of consultant psychiatrists in private practice and we exclude them altogether from the Bill. Why have we done this?</P>
      <P>There are about 2,500 people involuntarily committed every year in this country and I am not quite sure if that includes children. Senator Hayes and I differed slightly on this on Second Stage. Information I was given by doctors who worked in England after the tribunal system was set up there indicates that about 60% of patients apply for a tribunal review &ndash; that would be about 1,600 or 1,700 people. That means a great many extra consultant psychiatrists would be needed to sit on these tribunals. If the consultant psychiatrists involved in treating the patient have to attend the tribunals also, there will be a lack of consultant psychiatrists to deal with the clinics they should be running while they are at the tribunal. A considerable number of extra consultant psychiatrists will be needed to run the tribunals satisfactorily and to keep the psychiatric services going at the same time. It would be wiser to have some sort of definition here, such as that applied by Comhairle na nOspidéal and it should cover the training and experience of psychiatrists rather than the position of employment of psychiatrists.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that I cannot find some definitions within the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will be able to correct me but there does not appear to be any definition of detention, restraint or seclusion. They are important from the point of view of an involuntary patient, not to mind any other patient, and it would be worthwhile to include those definitions. I object to the definition of consultant psychiatrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already made known my objections to the definition of parent and it is not clear if that definition includes the non-marital father. This could be very important where we have a child whose parents are not married. Will the Minister inform me of the situation regarding the non-marital father? Why is the definition of consultant psychiatrist so narrow? It will be difficult to work the Bill with such a narrow definition. Why <Col N="93" /> are detention, restraint and seclusion not included in the interpretation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of psychiatrists does not exclude consultants employed by private hospitals which are registered as approved centres. Retired consultants are allowed to serve on tribunals. The purpose of the Bill is not to define consultant psychiatrists <i>in toto</i>. A definition of psychiatrists, referring to those working in hospitals or approved areas, has been included for use in this Bill only. That is the only definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is the problem. The only psychiatrists that can be used in this Bill are those employed by the health board or by approved centres. That is the problem, not the solution. What will we do with other consultant psychiatrists who may be extremely useful in these situations? The definition of the Medical Council's specialist register can be used if Comhairle na n-Ospidéal's definition is not wanted. The definition used in this Bill reduces enormously the number of people who can be involved in the application of this legislation. We want this Bill to work when it becomes an Act, but I do not see how that can happen given the narrow definition. Are those at tribunals allowed to employ as locums those who are not already employees of health boards? This Bill's provisions for consultant psychiatrists are a little confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to declare an interest regarding consultant psychiatrists because of my marital situation. I could list the names of six consultant psychiatrists in Cork city who are not employed by a health board or an approved centre and I have no reason to believe that any of them would wish to serve in a tribunal as they are busy, self-employed people. It is peculiar, nonetheless, that only consultant psychiatrists employed by a health board or an approved centre are eligible.</P>
      <P>I believe that somebody forgot to include other groups and now, ridiculously, a Minister of State has to defend the indefensible situation where somebody forgot the existence of private psychiatry. The prevailing attitude seems to be that it is too late to think of changing this measure and that it has to be left as it is. That is an outrageous way to deal with legislation. There is no reason a phrase cannot be redefined to allow those recognised as consultants by the profession of psychiatry to be included.</P>
      <P>This is not only a matter of the powers of consultants in hospitals and approved centres, but of who can serve in tribunals and on the commission. The Minister of State, although he may not have intended it, is saying that those who are not employed by health boards and approved centres are excluded from the areas I have mentioned. It is not a valid distinction as a consultant psychiatrist is not just somebody who is employed by a health board or an approved centre. That is not a correct definition.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister of State, I believe there has been a slip-up and that an omission has been made. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider, even at this late stage. Senator Henry's remarks seem logical. She said that in the United Kingdom 60% of people appeal to a tribunal and that if a similar pattern is evident in Ireland, there will be between 1,600 and 1,700 appeals. That will be impossible to handle without huge delays, which is a shame as time will be of the essence. I urge the Minister of State to rethink as if this has simply been a slip-up, it can easily be corrected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo;, which I always understood referred to a post rather than an actual qualification. A consultant psychologist is a post and should be seen as distinct from a consulting psychologist. I concur with remarks that have been made as it is possible that there are psychiatrists who are not consultants and do not have consultant posts. Even if they are members or fellows of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, they will be excluded under this Bill. I realise that was not intended in the Bill, but clarification is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult matter into which a lot of thought was put. There is no definite register of consultant psychiatrists, as all such registers are voluntary, not mandatory. When the Bill was being drafted a decision had to be taken and the definition now in the Bill was accepted. Consultants within the public system or working in an approved area within the past seven years have been included in the definition. That is all I can say as I am unable to clarify this matter further. I understand Senators who argue that a psychiatrist is a psychiatrist if he or she is qualified, regardless of whether he or she is working in the private or public sector. There seems to be a problem regarding this Bill's definition of a consultant, especially given that many are not on any specific register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will regret this section of the Bill as it will cause an awful lot of bother if it is not changed. The Medical Council has a register of specialists which could be used. It is obvious that it has been decided not to accept amendments in this House so we might as well just run through the Bill. This is a serious matter, however, and I am sure all Senators sitting on the Government side know it will cause real problems. Psychiatrists have stressed to me that this is a nine to five Bill. There will be trouble contacting people out of hours to deal with tribunals or to cover for clinics when consultants have to go to tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a big Bill with huge financial implications. If the small matter of a better definition of a consultant psychiatrist could be straightened out, we might get somewhere. This Bill will have to work when it becomes an Act, otherwise there is no point in introducing it. This section will not <Col N="95" /> work as the numbers are too small. The number of consultant psychiatrists who could be involved in the application of the Bill is being halved.</P>

Senators are not merely nit-picking, but trying to help to make this legislation work. Even if the definition is simply for the purposes of this Bill, it will mean the services of many people needed to make the Bill work will have been lost. Surely there must be a specialist register.</P>

      <P>A definition of a consultant can be read in the medical section of the Sunday newspapers. When advertisements are published for consultants in any specialty, it is always specified that he or she must have spent a certain number of years in the general practice of medicine and another specified number of years pursuing a specialised qualification or training in that area. That may be useful in addressing the problem raised by Senator Henry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition precludes cross-Border co-operation on this issue because it refers to approved centres or health boards which relate to this State.

      <P>I am surprised that so many things have to be defined. Even words such as &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;, &ldquo;give&rdquo; and &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; have to be defined. However, this would be greatly helped by the removal of the phrase &ldquo;who is employed by a health board or by an approved centre&rdquo;. It is not necessary to describe a consultant psychiatrist by putting in such a limitation because that excludes all others. The best thing to do would be to remove the definition since, as Senator Fitzpatrick said, we already have definitions elsewhere. We are only describing ordinary words in the English language which are very clear and well understood.</P>

There would be problems with legislation in the context of different types of co-operation. There is a clause in section 5 which <Col N="96" /> provides that if there are problems with the working of this Bill it can be reviewed in 12 months' time That is all I can say at this stage in that regard.</P>

According to the definition, &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; means &ldquo;mental illness, severe dementia or significant intellectual disability&rdquo; related to circumstances which are listed. The one that concerns me is the one that relates to a situation where, because of the severity of the illness, disability or dementia there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons, coupled with the definition of significant intellectual disability as meaning a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind of a person which includes significant impairment of intelligence. I will defer to the medical profession on this, but I do not think that definition of significant intellectual disability is capable of being treated medically. It is not capable of being treated in a psychiatric hospital. I would like to know if I am wrong.</P>

      <P>I presume the Bill is intended to cover those with mental handicap who are exhibiting what is described as challenging behaviour or who have another recognised form of mental illness which, as both my colleagues and Senator Hayes know only too well, is all too possible. There is not a lower rate of mental illness among people with a mental disorder than there is <Col N="97" /> among the rest of the community. However, it is odd that people should be classified as having a mental illness just because they come under this definition of significant intellectual disability. This is the sort of thing we have been trying to separate within the health services in recent years. It has been the big problem in St. Ita's and the other larger hospitals where we have been trying to separate those with what we describe as mental illness and those with intellectual impairment. Now we are putting them together again in this Bill.</P>
      <P>If we were talking about those with intellectual impairment who are exhibiting even the loose description of challenging behaviour &ndash; the value of medication in treating those with challenging behaviour is controversial &ndash; I could understand it, but there are many people working with people who have what is defined here as significant intellectual disability who find it very odd that significant intellectual disability is being put in here as a mental disorder when that is exactly what we have been trying to separate for years. I could accept it if we were talking about people with a mental disorder and challenging behaviour because there are some people for whom that means they are a danger to themselves or to others. Likewise, people who have depression or any mental illness which people with intellectual impairment can have could be covered by the Bill, but it is very odd that we have been trying to separate intellectual disability and mental illness for years and now we are putting them back together.</P>

      <P>Mental handicap and intellectual disability are very difficult to quantify. The basis of this provision is that the people concerned would be detained for their own safety. It does not mean they would be detained in psychiatric hospitals. Other institutions could be specified. That is why this is included.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry has made the point that I wanted to make. The Bill is full of definitions. However, that is no reflection on it, because there are legal constraints on Departments and Ministers. However, it is not being acknowledged that the fact that a person has an intellectual disability does not mean he or she cannot suffer from depression or any other problem that a psychiatrist could treat. We seem to be defining very narrowly and not looking at the patient in the round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity we are spending so much time on definitions. I understand to a degree why the definition of significant intellectual disability is there because it includes significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning and abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct. However, it is provided in section 8 that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authorising the involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre by reason only of the fact <Col N="98" /> that the person is socially deviant. We are providing under section 8 that a person cannot be involuntarily detained because they are socially deviant, but we are providing here that somebody who has a significant intellectual disability can be detained because they are socially deviant. That is as good a definition of social deviancy as I have seen. There is an issue to be dealt with here. What is really frustrating is that if the Minister had the will to say these questions are worthy of further study and that he would think about them, we could make some progress, but we know he will not be allowed to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have settled for a provision relating to people with significant intellectual disability who had a mental illness. I can see from the Minister's face that he is aware of the difficulties there will be in implementing this and the hurt that will be visited on people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Intellectual disability alone should never be a reason for detaining a person involuntarily. However, some people with an intellectual disability can exhibit abnormal aggressive behaviour which requires them to be detained for their own safety and the safety of others. The provisions of this Bill will provide a legal framework for such detentions. It is not the intention that such people will be detained in psychiatric units. Residential centres which specialise in the care of people with intellectual disability will be designated as approved centres for the purpose of the Bill and personnel in these centres can then avail of the provisions of the Bill, thus ensuring that the rights of the people detained are protected. That is basically the background.</P>

      <P>It may cheer up the House to note that this section was much improved in its passage through the Dáil. However, I am concerned that the effect of subsection (2) may be to delay treatment. Very little protection is provided to the doctor who may have to give emergency treatment, especially sedation. While I support the best interests of the patient, there may be a delay in administering treatment during which people could be entitled to make representations. The words &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; may cover this aspect. I need not tell the Minister of State and Senators Fitzpatrick, Lydon or Maurice Hayes that trying situations can arise. Will this provision delay treatment that could be desperately important? What will be the legal situation of the medical practitioner who gives such emergency treatment? That is not clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Doctors are covered as per the norm. They do the best they can and I do not believe they would be subject to recriminations or a legal response afterwards. While there are questions of legal indemnity, etc., very few cases have been brought to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister of State has said but the wording here is very loose. God bless his innocent Irish heart in thinking nobody would sue a doctor. This country has the highest level of litigation in the world. It is one area where I am glad I will not be called upon to give emergency treatment to patients. While the Bill must protect the civil liberties of the person, there is also a reciprocation in that the patient must get good medical treatment. In the absence of some form of legislative protection doctors will be very anxious. The Minister is aware of the trouble there has been for decades when dealing with a person of unsound mind. We may now be creating another difficulty in the area of emergency treatment, especially with regard to sedation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry. I do not wish to dwell on family issues but I have had the unfortunate experience on three or four occasions of bringing a member of my broader family involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital. On one occasion I ended up chasing somebody around the car park of Cork Regional Hospital. There was such a delay in making a decision on whether he should be admitted he decided to leave and he had to be &ldquo;persuaded&rdquo; to return. Reading this provision and knowing what I have learnt from listening to 3 o'clock telephone calls involving junior doctors because I happened to be on the other side of a bed with a consultant psychiatrist, the practicalities of what is proposed here need to be thought through very carefully. The Minister would also need to keep a careful watch on developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>The legal advice obtained by my Department indicates that the same standards of <Col N="100" /> liability for medical negligence would apply in relation to treatment under the provisions of this Bill as currently apply to all medical treatment. The standard in medical negligence cases is that the doctor is not negligent if it can be shown that another reasonable doctor would have made the same decision taking into account all the facts that are available. That is the type of <i>modus operandi</i> that would apply.</P>

      <P>Section 4(2) is very loosely worded. It entitles the person who is to receive treatment to make representations. This could take some time, especially in cases where a person, say a paranoid schizophrenic, requires hospitalisation. It may mean nothing may happen even where the person concerned could be causing havoc in a house. I favour people having a say in proposed treatments. Patients have an absolute right to make representations before committal. However, the wording of subsection (2) is very loose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister has taken advice on section 5(3) which states: &ldquo;Every regulation under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House . the regulation shall be annulled accordingly.&rdquo;. That is the negative test for secondary legislation. I am doubtful if fundamental regulations about something which so impinges on the right to liberty will be accepted by the courts if it is done through this form of secondary legislation. I presume the Minister has advice to the contrary but the advice the Government received about the vote last Thursday was not very good. I would not rely too much on advice. It would be better if regulations in this area were discussed by obligation and as of necessity rather than by the process laid down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 21, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall be in addition to any monies allocated to the psychiatric services at the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great concern that this legislation will be very expensive to implement and that the money required will be taken from the general provisions for the psychiatric services, which all <Col N="101" /> Members knows are appalling. There are no votes in mental health nor are there votes in trying to do anything about the psychiatric institutions. All the waiting lists we hear of involve the acute hospitals. We do not hear anything about the waiting list to get from the prisons to the Central Mental Hospital nor about the waiting list to get people out of the Central Mental Hospital into psychiatric institutions around the country. Indeed, we do not hear anything about the waiting list concerned with trying to get people with psychiatric illness into psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Money is very short in this area and people are very anxious that this legislation will take a huge amount of it out of the psychiatric services. This is why I want some reassurance that the Minister for Finance will be asked to reach into his deep pocket and give more money so that the Bill can be implemented without the meagre amount already available for the psychiatric services being raided. The Minister will understand why I tabled the amendment if he considers the non-existent community psychiatric services, the lack of psychiatric services for the homeless and the inadequacy of psychiatric services for adolescents and children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The mental health service is grossly underfunded and I am aware of numerous examples of the costs involved in taking patients out of institutions and placing them in appropriate community settings. This is expensive and it has been delayed because of a lack of funding. It is also terrible that young children and teenagers must share services. In regional hospitals, both groups are put together and this places stress and strain on adults and teenagers suffering from psychiatric illnesses. I ask the Minister to clarify how the Bill will be funded. Will he make it clear that specific additional funding will be made available to ensure the Bill is implemented in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The aspirations involved in the phrase &ldquo;planning for the future&rdquo; generate much cynicism among people who work in the psychiatric services. Those aspirations involve clearing people out of psychiatric hospitals and then forgetting about them. This view is shared in a submission by the Simon Community to the Department of Health and Children on its review. It quotes an Eastern Regional Health Authority report from 1999 which begins with the phrase &ldquo;We have no beds&rdquo;. On the mornings I was woken up at 3 a.m. the most frequent problem of admission to psychiatric services that I heard about as I listened to the conversation from the other side of the bed was that no beds were available. The Eastern Regional Health Authority said it found severe shortages in areas critical to patients, such as acute in-patient beds, community accommodation etc. in relation to psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the strange aspects of this country is that we appear determined to get rich in every <Col N="102" /> area with the exception of the provision of public services. This is a classic example. The amount of time of highly paid consultant psychiatrists it will of necessity and correctly take up at every stage will eat into already inadequate budgets. It is time the country began to accept that the only way to look after patients and those who care for them is by spending money. There is no other way. There is some waste, but anybody who imagines that a country which spends approximately half the amount others spend on health services can provide the quality of health services available in other countries is kidding himself or herself. This was stated by the current Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children. We do not appear to be prepared to pay taxes to provide for increased spending and, therefore, we cannot have the services. As Senator Henry said, it is a matter for Government to ensure that resources are available in this area to meet the wonderful rhetoric of the aspirations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Henry's anxiety about financing the Bill but much more has been spent on the health services over the past few years. The amount of spending has doubled over the past two or three years, but it takes time for such spending to filter down.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned community services and one of the problems lies with the community. In north County Dublin recently, the Northern Area Health Board, of which I am a member, wanted to open a house in a community setting for patients. However, the community opposed it. It does not all lie with the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern Regional Health Authority or the Northern Area Health Board. The aspirations exist and in that case the money, will and staff were available, but we faced that problem from the community.</P>
      <P>Mistakes were made in the early days of inappropriately putting people into the community. However, the push for community psychiatry came from the psychiatric profession. It looked good on paper until local concerned resident groups started opposing it. This was the hidden rock upon which community psychiatry almost perished.</P>

      <P>I am a resident of the area close to the local community to which Senator Fitzpatrick referred. A very small number of people in the community opposed the house. To their credit, none of the local county councillors gave credence to the objection. They all held the line in a manner of which public representatives can be proud. A number of people received huge publicity about the issue, but they were also told that most of us had people in our extended families who needed support and help in many ways. Many of us and our families have visited the house in the intervening period. There was much local support for it and I wish to clear the record for the people of Rolestown and Lispopple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> However, as somebody who supported the house and had an objective view on it &ndash; I am not involved in the local authority and I did not live near enough to be troubled in any way by it &ndash; the advance work done to make the community aware of the reason for the purchase of the house and the use it was intended to make of it was never explained. There are two sides to the story, but I accept the point made by the Senator. However, the people of Lispopple and the local county councillor who lives on the same road, Councillor Anne Devitt, deserve the greatest credit for standing up to the people who were being so negative about it.</P>

      <P>Senators expressed concerns that funding required to implement the provisions of the Bill should not come from existing moneys for mental health services. I assure the Senators that this is not the Government's intention. The costs of implementing the Bill were agreed by the Government at the time of its decision in relation to the publication of the legislation. It is estimated that the costs will amount to approximately £10 million in a full year and an initial allocation of £1.8 million has been made this year to allow preliminary measures to be taken in the establishment of the mental health commission.

The costs include the payment of a stipend to the chairman of the commission, the salaries of the chief executive, the inspector and other staff and the administrative costs of running the tribunals. Professional fees and travel and subsistence expenses for the consultant psychiatrists and solicitors who will make up the tribunals are also included in the costs.

One could look at Clerkenwell, Durham or any other <Col N="105" /> UK health board, in order to get an idea of what their costings are.</P>

More money may be needed and particular situations will have to be catered for once the Bill has been passed and <Col N="106" /> is put into operation. All these issues must be then resolved satisfactorily. It is in the interests of the health system in general that all the health boards co-operate in order to facilitate people who may be called to appear at tribunals or who may serve on the commission. This is not an insuperable problem and it may not be all a question of money. There are other factors besides money which must be considered. It is incumbent on the health boards to assist with the proper functioning of this new Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), line 33, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section there is an exclusion from involuntary admission in the case of those who are suffering from a personality disorder, who are socially deviant or who are addicted to drugs and intoxicants. Most of my psychiatric colleagues are in favour of this approach, although I would have thought it advisable to suggest that they should be admitted at least for assessment purposes. It must be difficult to diagnose, in a Garda barracks, whether a person is suffering from a personality disorder or has a manifestation of schizophrenia. While I respect the collective wisdom of my psychiatric colleagues, I feel that if this approach is being taken, we must take account of the fact that children will not be classified under these sections but could be classified as suffering from a conduct disorder. I urge the Minister of State to include that in the Bill. No such inclusion is made in section 25 but this is of importance.</P>

      <P>This section sets out criteria for the involuntary admission of adults to approved centres. Subsection (1) specifically refers to persons who may be involuntarily admitted, pursuant to an application under section 9 or section 12. This does not refer to children. Children can only be admitted involuntarily under the provisions set out in section 25, that is by way of court order. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to insert any reference to a child into this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific issue of conduct disorder, I appreciate the concerns which have been expressed about the treatment of disturbed children. Senators will be aware that, in recent years, the Government has made great strides in this <Col N="107" /> area, particularly in relation to the commissioning and planning of secure units throughout the country, providing care and treatment for disturbed children. In the scheme of this Bill, all decisions in relation to the treatment of children are decisions made by the courts. The courts will receive reports from consultant child psychiatrists on the appropriateness of treatment and the placement of individual children and will make their decisions on that basis. Therefore, I do not consider it advisable to fetter the courts' discretion by inserting references to specific conditions such as conduct disorder. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister of State's reply, particularly his statement that a child will have been examined by a consultant child psychiatrist. That, of course, is not in section 25, which only refers to examination by a consultant psychiatrist. Therefore, the Minister of State is incorrect in his statement, since section 25 does not specify a child psychiatrist. Does that make any difference to his consideration of my amendment? </P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)Such persons as described in <i>subsection (2) </i>shall be brought to a place of safety other than a prison.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is somewhat like Senator Jackman's earlier amendment. It is really a plea that these people should be brought to a place of safety other than a prison because that is where they will be taken. The Minister of State may have seen a recent newspaper report about a man who had been exposing himself in the Temple Bar area, either 81 times or 181 times &ndash; it does not really matter which. When this man was eventually brought before the court, the judge was obliged to send him to Mountjoy because there are no other pro<Col N="108" /> visions for such circumstances. It is outrageous and ridiculous that he should have to go to Mountjoy and of course it costs £1,000 per week to keep him there. That should be taken into account. There is no explanation as to what is to happen to these people.</P>
    <P>The adult care order section of the White Paper has been disregarded in the Bill. That proposal, as per chapter 8 of the 1985 White Paper, would at least have given us some degree of comfort. I did not put down an amendment on this but I may do so on Report Stage. The summary of chapter 8 of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide for an adult care order which could be used to protect mentally disordered persons who are being abused, neglected or exploited. The courts will be empowered to make adult care orders on the application of an authorised officer of a health board, or by a person authorised by a health board to act in that capacity. The order will provide for the placement of a person in the care of a relative, a health board or a voluntary agency, in the case of an emergency adult care order, for up to eight days and, for an adult care order, for a period to be specified by the court.</P>
    <P>All this would have been useful if included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What will we do with these people? I have repeatedly complained in this House, and got support from all sides, about the homeless people whom I see sleeping rough as I walk home from the Seanad every night. Some of them would be classified under this measure. I have been contacted repeatedly by relatives or neighbours of people, expressing concern that nothing will be done about them until they do something violent. It is unfair and this Bill does absolutely nothing to help those people. A huge group of people who are specified here are being totally neglected. At least my amendment would provide that they be brought to some place of safety. The adult care orders would have been an ideal way of dealing with this, but apparently that is not to be.</P>

He looked forward to hearing the Minister explain this section on Committee Stage.

      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the purpose of this section is to ensure that people's human rights are respected in line with international conventions and agreements on people suffering from mental disorders. It prohibits the involuntary detention of a person where he or she suffers from a personality disorder or is socially deviant or addicted to drugs or intoxicants, and where there is no evidence of mental disorder as defined by section 3. It is to ensure that a person's right to liberty is not infringed because a person does not conform to society's norms. I am concerned that Senator Henry's amendment infringes on that principle. Persons suffering from personality disorders, social deviance or addiction to drugs or intoxicants cannot be brought to a place of safety against their will. We must respect human rights and the right to liberty.</P>
      <P>Under our Constitution and laws, people cannot be involuntarily detained unless they have committed a crime or are mentally disordered. Health boards have voluntary services available for people addicted to drugs or intoxicants. Society as a whole has still to find a solution to the problem of those with personality disorders and social deviants. My advice, from legal sources and experts, such as the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, is that they should not be detained involuntarily in psychiatric hospitals and that is the sole purpose of this section. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would faint if the amendment were accepted. The Minister's reply is impractical. I support civil liberties. The fact that we have a high level of involuntary admissions today is something that must be seriously questioned. It is twice the rate of Italy and higher than other places also. These are important people. They are to be found around Dublin. I will not say where as that would make it too easy for people to go to stare at them. If they are a danger to themselves, is there nothing that can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, as I walked home about 7.30 p.m. over Huband Bridge, going from Percy Place to Haddington Road, I saw a young man in the centre of the road amidst the heavy traffic dragging his bedding, shouting to himself. Is there no way in which society can protect this person? Must we wait until he breaks a car window or is knocked down? Fortunately, he went on to the footpath. As a society, we wash our hands of people like him. How can someone make a long distance diagnosis that this man has a personality disorder, or is a florid exhibitionist schizophrenic, having <Col N="110" /> hallucinations or delusions? How is the registered medical practitioner who is summoned to find out? Can he not be taken to a place of safety to find out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Henry. It comes down to whether the person has a personality disorder or not. As I said in a Second Stage speech, it depends on which psychiatric textbook one reads. It is a grave omission in the Bill that none of the personality disorders is defined. Some put sociopathic and psychopathic together. The list is endless &ndash; paranoid, schizoid, aggressive hysterical, passive aggressive and so on. In an earlier section, the Minister stated that a person might be involuntarily admitted because of the likelihood that they would cause harm or serious harm to themselves or others. People with personality disorders do this. I cited the case of a person with a paranoid personality who is not psychotically paranoid, but suffers from a severe disorder. He makes life in the home impossible for the other people there and is a danger at times. It is the same with a sociopathic personality disorder. It is difficult to discuss what we cannot define. A case must be made for admitting these people to a psychiatric hospital to protect them and others.</P>
      <P>Where does borderline personality come into this? Any psychiatrist will state that borderline personality disorder is a condition for which someone must regularly enter hospital for four to six weeks at time. Such people cannot cope outside. It is unfair to deny them this help and that is what will happen if personality disorder is not defined clearly. I do not want them imprisoned against their will but I am against failing to provide help for those who need it. I have seen personality disorders cured, not just helped. It is difficult because it is intensive and long drawn out, which is why some medical professionals wash their hands of such people. There is no condition which is set in stone except severe intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make things difficult for the Minister but we are discussing people's lives and the effects on them. People with personality disorders, such as regressive, schizoid, and others, must come into a psychiatric hospital at certain times. It may be said that it is because of the personality disorder that a person develops depression, anxiety or other incumbent illness and that is why they are admitted. It is not. It is because of the basic personality disorder. This is subject to amelioration and there are programmes to deal with it. This seems crazy, if Members will pardon the use of the word in this context, and we are not tackling it correctly. The Bill ought to define, either broadly or narrowly, what a personality disorder is, and if it includes all or some such disorders.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Lydon, in talking of definitions, will support me in the next amendment. I agree with Senator Henry's <Col N="111" /> amendment. If they are excluded from the psychiatric area, they should be given safe havens. They should not be left like the individual she described so humanely. If they do not come under the category which can be detained in mental institutions, there should be a place of safety for them. I shall return to that in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Senator Lydon, a person with many years' experience in this area, one understands my concerns. These people are excluded totally. Given the great shortage of beds in the psychiatric service, people are not happy to deal with this category of person. I take Senator Lydon's point. It is very hard to diagnose long distance and to know how one is going to do with a patient before at least assessing them. Absolutely no provision has been made for that in this section. A most important group in society is being excluded from the word go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This section specifies that before an application can be made for the involuntary admission of a person with a mental disorder, certain criteria must be met in relation to the person to be admitted. It specifies mental disorder as defined in section 3 as the sole grounds for involuntary admission of a person for psychiatric care and treatment. However, there is nothing to prevent a person from being admitted voluntarily and, as has been said, if a person in any of these categories also suffers from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3, they may be admitted involuntarily.</P>
      <P>Talking about personality disorders, it is a grey area anyway and it is quite difficult. Psychiatrists, in general, have a general acceptance of certain criteria. As has been said about schizoid and a few other aspects, there is still disagreement. I do not think I can add much to what Senator Lydon has said because he knows as much anybody about this disorder. That is the problem with a lot of psychiatric disorders. We would not primarily call this a mental illness as such but we know full well that sometimes one has to have a period of observation to make a correct diagnosis. In the Dáil, as in other references to this Bill, a number of people said we are protecting doctors too much and that we must protect the people as well. We must be open and transparent and always err on the side of the patient rather than on the side of the doctor who we specifically designate in regard to these terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say more on personality disorders but I do not know if I can add anything to what was said already. Personality disorders refer to those characteristics of personality which are to be found in human beings but which in particular individuals are so extreme as to create difficulties for that individual which causes him or her to suffer or causes other people to suffer as a consequence. Disorder refers to a broad grouping of abnormal personalities and includes among those on the borderline, dependent and paranoid as <Col N="112" /> well as the more commonly recognised psychopath. Behavioural manifestations vary and may take the form of impulsive overdosing, manipulation, aggression or destructive dependency on others.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; is not an exact term but is used to imply the existence of a clinically recognisable set of symptoms of behaviour which persist over time and which are an inherent part of an individual's personality. Diagnosis is made on the basis of observation of a collection of such behaviours and dispositions. There is debate within the medical profession as to the appropriate treatment, if any, for personality disorder.</P>
    <P>The question of whether to include personality disorder as a category mental disorder for the purpose of detention under the new mental health legislation alongside mental illness, significant mental handicap and severe dementia was considered at great length during the consultative process leading the preparation of this Bill. Medical experience suggests that persons suffering from personality disorder are at the extreme end of normal human variation and differ from the rest of us only in the degree to which they are affected by traits shared by all of us. These extreme traits of personality disorder are not symptoms of an illness which can be treated and cured. It is, therefore, considered that personality disorder may not be legitimately viewed as an illness nor does personality disorder amount to insanity.</P>
    <P>In neighbouring jurisdictions, Scotland and Northern Ireland, personality disorder is excluded as a definition of mental disorder for the purposes of detention under mental health legislation. In England and Wales, personality disorder, or psychopathic disorder as it is termed, is included as a definition of mental disorder under the Mental Health Act, 1993. Many representative bodies in England and Wales, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, question its inclusion. In this country, interested parties who submitted views on this matter during the consultative process supported the exclusion of personality disorder from the definition of mental disorder for the purposes of detention under this new legislation. That is the reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said and thank him for the explanation. I agree with him that we do not have to define &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; as being insane but by the inclusion of this section, we are depriving people, particularly with borderline personality disorders, from the help they need. There is no doubt in my mind that a person who has a borderline personality disorder and who is sitting at home, shaking, crying all day, perhaps not eating and is deteriorating mentally and physically needs help and a general hospital or a prison is not the place for help &ndash; it is a psychiatric hospital where people have experience in dealing with these types of problems. <Col N="113" /> Anybody who has studied Kohut, for example, and his work will be confirmed that there is help for personality disorders, particularly the borderline personality disorder.</P>

That is the problem; we are leaving this out and we are going to allow these people to end up in prison. I agree with what the Minister said but we are leaving a most vulnerable group of people with nowhere to go. If the Minister believes the medical profession has too much power &ndash; that was the trouble in the Dáil &ndash; then why do we not change the wording to &ldquo;Such persons as described in<i> subsection (2) </i>shall be brought to a place of safety by any other than a doctor&rdquo;?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Commission shall, within 6 months of its appointment, publish comprehensive guidelines and definitions on what constitutes &lsquo;personality disorder' or &lsquo;social deviance' as described in this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is generous and accommodating in tying in somewhat with the need for a definition. It gives to what I would consider the appropriate authority, the commission, six months from the time it is appointed to publish guidelines and definitions on what has been the subject of discussion for the last few minutes, that is, personality disorder or social deviance.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to social deviance. I am not being facetious but unless we have a definition, people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Nice referendum the other day could be classified as social deviants. They were branded as people who did not have a social conscience. Social deviancy is a very broad term. If children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are not diagnosed as having ADHD, they might been seen as social deviants. We are delving into an area which has many connotations. In the context of a multi-racial society, what we would consider quite normal behaviour may not be considered normal in another context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying we cannot give a correct definition today, but the commission would have the authority and expertise to come up with a definition which is extremely important. Section 2 defines &ldquo;legal representative&rdquo;, &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;, &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; and &ldquo;clinical director&rdquo;, although I know they are not as complex as deviancy. People may argue that, for instance, in the past consenting homosexuals would have been <Col N="114" /> seen as social deviants but that has changed. It is not as if once one defines it it cannot be changed. However, it cannot be left so vague that it is not defined here. Senator Lydon made that quite clear too.</P>
    <P>Defining &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; is more difficult, of that there is no doubt because, as Senator Lydon said, there are borderline cases that could fit and who would need the treatment they could only get in a mental hospital. I suppose clinicians in a way would be better equipped to come up with a definition of &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; but I still believe the commission would have the expertise to deal with that. Linking this point to Senator Henry's previous amendment, a section of society, who can number quite a few, are left vulnerable. In the interests of what Senator Henry said on the previous amendment, it is important that the commission comes up with such a definition.</P>
    <P>Some people who studied the Bill were critical of there not being any form of management available to front-line professionals who have to deal with persons with a personality disorder. Apparently, there is a psychiatric view that those individuals are not amenable to treatment and clog up GP surgeries and the work of social workers and cause crises in communities because in extreme cases they can be destructive and difficult, but that does not mean we should not care for them. What is being sought by people involved in this area is a task force under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the membership of which should include social workers, members of the Garda Síochána, representatives of the Prisons Service and psychiatrists. They could examine, as happened in Britain, the number of people who would be regarded as having a personality disorder and the existing facilities or lack of them, as Senator Henry said, and take account of what has happened in other countries in that perhaps there are alternatives we should be providing for those people outside of hospital care.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important area within the Bill. I would like the commission, within six months of its appointment, to come up with such definitions because it would help to develop the issues further, as suggested by Senator Henry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister. This is a complex area. As Senator Lydon said, one cannot measure what one cannot define. I take the view that one cannot define what one cannot measure. There is a problem in that. One of the reasons there is a difference between the Northern Ireland 1987 order and the subsequent English and Welsh Acts is the movement of professional opinion at that time. This is not something on which one will get a hard and fast line of advice from any group of psychiatrists. I dare say two might agree on it or perhaps only one might. I would be averse, therefore, to putting <Col N="115" /> firm definitions into an Act that may have to change over time.</P>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Jackman's request. There needs to be guidance. I wonder if this matter could be handled by way of the Minister of State giving an undertaking to ask the Mental Health Commission to issue guidelines within a reasonable time to people and to revise them as they need to be revised. We are talking about shades of opinion, shades of grey. It is easy to recognise the two ends of the spectrum, but there is a need to work on the end verging towards the so-called deviant, abnormal or disturbed. Perhaps that is the way to deal with this matter and not to tie us down to definitions in an Act that would be in place for years, which might concretely tie down what is not very clearly grasped yet and might change over the next few years as people adopt different views and more treatments arise. It might be possible to get the commission to deal with this matter by way of guidelines that are repeatedly revised and draw on the experience it gets from the working of this legislation and from experience elsewhere.</P>

I am sure the House and the Minister of State is aware that Senator Maurice Hayes played an important role in the drafting of the Mental Health Northern Ireland Order, 1986. We should, therefore, listen to his words as carefully as we can. I am surprised he did not table an amendment to this section, given that the Northern Ireland order states that people cannot be involuntarily detained by reason of promiscuity or other immoral conduct, which shows how much more strict society is here than in Northern Ireland. They can be put in for that here but not in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 38 and 39, after &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall be entitled to seek psychiatric or legal advice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is more sanguine than I am about the medical profession not being sued. A case of an involuntary admission is a serious matter, particularly for a registered medical practitioner working in the community who does not have long experience. None of us hopes to develop an experience in involuntary admissions. A registered medical practitioner should be entitled to seek psychiatric or legal advice in such cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may say that such a medical practitioner can telephone whoever he or she likes, but one normally has to pay for advice, especially legal advice. Whatever chance he or she may have of getting the psychiatric advice they may want, a consultation, even a telephone consultation, with a solicitor costs money. People should be encouraged to take seriously what they are doing rather than discouraged. That is why I would like a registered medical practitioner to be allowed to seek psychiatric or legal advice in such cases.</P>

      <P>It stands to reason that a registered medical practitioner who is proposing to make a recommendation for the involuntary detention of a person would be entitled to seek psychiatric or legal advice before so doing if he or she felt it was necessary. There is no necessity to insert such a statement in legislation as there is nothing in this section that would prevent a general practitioner from taking such a course of action. I, therefore, suggest that the Senator withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not inclined to do so because who will pay? Someone living in Belmullet might wish to phone or call to a solicitor's office to find out what to do. One might want to get the opinion of a psychiatrist or, perhaps, get in touch with a psychologist. These practicalities do not <Col N="117" /> seem to have been thought out. It is absolutely fine to say the required services can be obtained, but who will pay? This is why I was so cross regarding the question of costing. The only costing that appears to have taken place is that of running the commission of 23 people. That is absolutely splendid but what about the costing of the rest of the Bill? I strongly advise general practitioners to seek help in such situations, but who will pay? Can one be sure the health board will pay? Should the applicant's family be asked to pay afterwards or should the patient be asked to pay when he or she leaves hospital? It can currently cost from £100 to £300 to get a legal opinion from a solicitor? Who will pay for this cost? There is no point telling people they are entitled to do things if it will cost them hundreds of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit fed up because this aspect has been looked at from a civil liberties point of view, and <Col N="118" /> rightly so. Patients are entitled to proper treatment from psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric community health workers, and where are these people?</P>

      <P>I agree it is important for general practitioners to get advice if he or she so wishes. However, we are not dealing here with money issues but with other aspects of the Bill. The Senator's views are worthy of being looked at again in regard to funding. We have already discussed the issue in general terms but we have not gone into the specifics of it. We are not dealing here with the monetary aspect of getting advice but with ensuring that general practitioners are not constrained from asking a lawyer or another psychiatrist for advice on any decision they may be about to make.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (2)(c), line 8, to delete &ldquo;the approved centre concerned,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any approved centre,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it rather odd that the phrase &ldquo;the approved centre concerned&rdquo; should be used in the Bill given that we do not know where the approved centre is. At a stage where we are talking about making an application, we do not have a notion of which centre the patient should be taken to. Perhaps we will take him to Senator Glynn's establishment, St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar, or to a hospital in Castlebar. How do we figure this out? Surely it would be better to exclude such a patient from any centre. I cannot work out how a centre has been approved in advance.</P>

      <P>These subsections ensure there is no conflict of interest in the case of a person who makes an application concerning an involuntary detention. The application may concern the person's employment or financial interests. In the past, there was concern in relation to private psychiatric hospitals. It was feared that certain patients may be admitted for personal or financial gain. The subsections derive from similar provisions in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, <Col N="119" /> designed to ensure that such admissions do not take place. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that reference is made to &ldquo;the approved centre concerned&rdquo; and not to &ldquo;any approved centre&rdquo;, as Senator Henry wishes.</P>
      <P>To avoid any perception of a conflict of interest, it is important that a doctor providing a service in a hospital would not make an application to have a person detained there. There are many other people listed in subsection (1) who could make the application if a doctor was to be in a situation such as I have mentioned. I do not feel, therefore, that these amendments are appropriate and I suggest they be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister of State has answered my question about how we know which centre is involved. I take the Minister's point that we do not want anyone to gain financially from the involuntary detention of others. The only reason for taking out the registered medical practitioner was that in small centres like Mullingar, a large number of local GPs may be on a rota to give medical services to the local centre. We may end up precluding all of them. I do not want GPs to be able to influence admission, but I am trying to think about this matter from a practical viewpoint. There may be 12 medical practitioners in a town which has an approved psychiatric centre. We know that most clinicians provide services on a rota basis, within the community and to institutions. Every one of the 12 GPs may be ruled out. I do not know how St. Mary's in Castlebar facilitates these matters.</P>
      <P>Those in mental hospitals get general illnesses too which are dealt with competently by local family doctors who work on a rota. These are the same people who may have to be involved in the admission of patients. I am concerned that all medical practitioners, or a large number of them, may be ruled out if we are not careful. Some of them may be attached to a centre in quite a peripheral way and do not make more money than they would if they were on call or receiving some sort of honorarium from the institution. If the Minister of State thinks his measures will work on a practical level, that is fine with me, but I am at a loss to see how it can happen. I would like to raise further matters with the Minister of State, but I will not bother as I know he can do nothing about them.</P>

      <P>I thought I understood Senator Henry's concerns until her most recent intervention, but now I am not sure I grasp her argument. I thought we knew what the centre was as it is defined in section 9, which refers to &ldquo;an approved centre&rdquo;. We do not want those connected to such a centre to be involved in admissions, which is fully correct. It strikes me that if one extends this measure to all approved centres so that those from any approved centre can be involved, most practitioners we would like to use will be unavailable. The wording of this section <Col N="120" /> of the Bill is safe enough and should be left that way.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (8), line 36, after &ldquo;grade&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, who holds an appropriate qualification in the field of psychiatry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment about which I have had a great deal of representation. Under the Bill as it stands, an authorised officer does not have to have any qualifications or experience in psychiatry. They are, nonetheless, to be given a great deal of power. The authorised officer should be a psychiatric social worker or a psychiatric community nurse. He should have relevant qualifications rather than coming from the housing department or a similar irrelevant area. There is nothing in this Bill to say that those who will exercise considerable powers must have psychiatric qualifications or experience of working in community psychiatry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Senator Henry's concern that authorised officers should be suitably qualified. This subsection arises from an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil, made to allow the Minister to specify in regulations the grades of health board staff who can become authorised officers for the purpose of this section. Such grades will include paramedical staff, such as social workers, therapists, psychologists and district nurses, but will exclude clerical and administrative staff employed by the health board. It is intended to make these regulations as soon as possible after enactment and before the commencement date of this part of the Bill. Senator Henry's amendment, which would restrict the officer to those with psychiatric qualifications, is unduly narrow. We must ensure that legislation does not hinder the speedy admission of those who need treatment. I am concerned that a narrow definition of an authorised officer would have such an effect. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's remarks represent a big improvement on my understanding of this matter. I would like to see psychiatric training as a prerequisite. Perhaps when the regulations are being brought in the Minister would press this. I am delighted Senator Glynn is here and Senator Hayes who also has experience in this area. We must not underestimate the importance of training within psychiatry. It would be well worthwhile to narrow this a bit more. I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>

However, I would encourage him when he is bringing in regulations to bear in mind Senator Henry's remarks. There are nurses and other paramedics who have no experience whatsoever in the field of psychiatry. In due course one hopes there will be a sufficient number of community psychiatric nurses and others in the community not to be too restrictive. However, it is important that people in this field and exercising this hugely important power should have at least a modicum of experience and training.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 5, to delete &ldquo;24&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;48&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I have put down this amendment can be understood in practical terms. It is desirable that there should not be a long gap between the examination by the registered general practitioner, the local family doctor, and the application. However, there is one problem, that is that the person will not have agreed to go to hospital voluntarily. Otherwise he or she would be going to the approved centre as a voluntary patient. A situation might therefore arise where the person is out and about and trying to avoid those who are trying to have him or her admitted. From a practical point of view we should try to take this into account and allow 48 hours rather than 24. I suggest this not because people may be lazy and not want to re-examine the patient, but because I have known doctors pursue half naked patients along the main Dublin-Cork railway line to try to get them to come into hospital. If such people jump into gardens and run off somewhere, it can be quite a length of time before they can be contacted again, and another examination must then take place for the sake of the law. From a practical point of view it would have been wiser to extend the time limit a little since the person involved may be trying to avoid contact with those who are trying to bring him or her to the approved centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to extend the length of time available to general practitioners to examine a person who is the subject of an application for involuntary detention and to make a recommendation for their detention in hospital. Where an application is being <Col N="122" /> made for the involuntary detention of a person, it goes without saying that this person is probably very disturbed, very ill and causing considerable upset and distress to their family, friends or neighbours. It is vital, when an application is made to a general practitioner that he or she should act upon it immediately or as soon as possible thereafter. Therefore, 24 hours is an entirely appropriate time scale for this. I do not accept that 48 hours would be preferable. Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the amendment not because I want there to be any kind of delay but because I want there to be some hope that obligations can be fulfilled. If a person leaves home at midnight, it is possible that 12 hours will have passed before anything is one. That is the time this sort of thing happens. In this situation lawyers will be able to challenge the involuntary admission on the grounds that the examination took place 30 hours before. This amendment was intended to address the practicalities. However, I will not press it.</P>

      <P>This refers to the Garda Síochána removing the person to the approved centre. I am quite sure the Garda will not want to hold the person in Inchicore Garda station or in Kevin Street Garda station. Would it not, therefore, have been a good idea to specify that the person was to be brought to the approved centre immediately? All this amendment is providing for is that there should be no delay. The previous section was concerned about delay when efforts might be ongoing to get hold of the patient. Now, where the patient is in the custody of the Garda Síochána, there is no provision that they must make haste.</P>

There is no desire on the part of the Garda Síochána to detain mentally disordered persons in Garda stations. My information is that the Garda Síochána tend to transport these people to psychiatric hospitals as soon as possible. I would, however, be reluctant to make the amendment suggested by Senator Henry because other Garda priorities may sometimes intervene. I am sure the Garda authorities would agree that it is not desirable to hold men<Col N="123" /> tally disordered people in Garda stations and that as soon as a car becomes available these people will be transported to hospital with all due speed.

      <P>(3)Subject to subsection (4), the powers conferred by this section may be exercised if&ndash;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a)the court is satisfied, on the oral evidence of a medical practitioner appointed for the purpose that there is reason to suspect that the accused person is suffering from mental illness or severe mental impairment; and</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b)the court is of the opinion that it would be impracticable for a report on his mental condition to be made if he were remanded on bail;</P>
      <P>but those powers shall not be exercised by the court in respect of a person who has been convicted before the court if the sentence for the offence of which he has been convicted is fixed by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)The court shall not remand an accused person under this section unless an opportunity has been given to the Department to <Col N="124" /> make representations to the court concerning the remand.</P>
    <P>(5)Where a court has remanded an accused person under this section, it may further remand him if it appears to the court, on the written or oral evidence of the medical practitioner responsible for making the report, that a further remand is necessary for completing the assessment of the accused person's mental condition.</P>
    <P>(6)The power of further remanding an accused person under this section may be exercised by the court without his being brought before the court if he is represented by counsel or a solicitor and his counsel or solicitor is given an opportunity of being heard.</P>
    <P>(7)An accused person shall not be remanded or further remanded under this section for more than 21 days at a time or for more than 12 weeks in all; and the court may at any time terminate the remand if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>(8)An accused person remanded under this section shall be entitled to obtain at his own expense an independent report on his mental condition from a medical practitioner chosen by him and to apply to the court on the basis of it for his remand to be terminated under subsection (7).</P>
    <P>(9)Where an accused person is remanded under this section&ndash;</P>

    <P>(10)If an accused person absconds from an approved centre to which he has been remanded under this section, or while being conveyed to or from that approved centre, he may be arrested without warrant by any Garda and shall, after being arrested, be brought as soon as practicable before the court that remanded him; and the court may <Col N="125" /> thereupon terminate the remand and deal with him in any way in which it would have dealt with him if he had not been remanded under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to make something out of chapter 7 of the White Paper. I hope Senator Hayes is suitably flattered that I have taken a whole section from the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order, 1986. However, I have substituted Garda for Constable and court for the Crown Court. It is an attempt to protect those who are mentally disordered who have come before the courts and who are in custody, either going to prison or being kept in prison. I do not have the faintest expectation of it being accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>This amendment proposes a scheme of court diversion whereby persons before the court can be diverted to suitable mental health facilities if, in the opinion of a doctor, they are suffering from mental illness or severe mental impairment. Chapter 7 of the 1995 White Paper on mental health contained proposals regarding the treatment of mentally disordered persons before the courts. Briefly, the White Paper proposed that if, during the course of proceedings before a court, the defence or the judge raises the issue of mental disorder, the court will be able to order that a medical report be carried out. If the report indicates that a person is suffering from a mental disorder that is not severe, the person will enter into a recognised recognisance bond with the court that he or she will undergo treatment. The case will be adjourned until treatment is completed. If the report indicates that a person suffers from a mental disorder so severe that it meets the criteria for involuntary admission, the person could be detained involuntarily under mental health legislation. The consultant psychiatrist would inform the court and the judge would adjourn the case until the person had recovered sufficiently to continue the trial or to face sentence.</P>
      <P>These proposals were omitted from the Bill because of the urgent necessity to progress legislation on involuntary detention to ensure this country's compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is the Minister's intention to return to the issue after the Bill has been enacted. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish these proposals had been included because I have much knowledge about how long it takes to have measures enacted. The last Mental Health Bill was introduced 21 years ago but was never enacted. The European convention obliges us to act in this instance. I am glad Senator Ryan was not present to hear the Minister of State's remarks on the urgency of involuntary detention, otherwise he might have sought to reintroduce amendment No. 1 in his name which sought to have the Bill known as the Mental Health (Involuntary Detention) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>There is a human rights and European Court aspect to this. People have a right not to be confined involuntarily unless there are sound medical and social grounds for so doing. This is what the Bill is concerned with. People also have the right to get the proper kind of treatment and not to go to prison when they should be somewhere else.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's difficulties in dealing with this and I am glad he accepts the fundamental basis of the amendment and the necessity for it, but I regret it cannot be accepted. I hope it is reintroduced by the Government as quickly as possible because it deals with a fundamental issue. The courts should be able at a very early stage to divert people from a course which may lead to prison to one which leads to proper treatment and the health care they are crying out for. It would work wonders for prison administrators as they did not have to deal with people who should not be in prison and who need the sort of care that prisons are not equipped to provide. I believe the governor of Mountjoy Prison would also thank the Minister for this.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; has a particular meaning in law. In layman's terms it means as soon as possible and it is a higher standard than that which is required by the amendment. If the amendment was adopted a consultant psychiatrist would presumably be able to defer the examination of a patient until the eleventh hour. However, with the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; the consultant is required to see the patient as soon as he or she possibly can, which could be within half an hour or an hour of the patient's admission. We would all agree that the requirement to see the patient as soon as possible after arrival in hospital should be as precise as possible. Accordingly, the wording in the Bill should stand and the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This is a very important area. One gets complaints from patients that they were not seen for some time. People have told me it was days before they were seen. I do not know the truth of that. The Minister of State's legal advice may be better than mine. That is always being put to me in the House. However, I would have preferred the provision of a time limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of my most important amendments. I do not believe and have no evidence that consultants would wait until the last minute to see people. I would not like that view to be expressed to other Members of the House. The stipulation of a time limit would mean that those brought in <Col N="128" /> late at night would have to be seen by a consultant psychiatrist early the following morning.</P>
    <P>The present provision does not allow for the possibility that people may not be seen over a weekend. This has frequently been raised with me because there can be a great deal of trouble with psychiatric consultant cover in some hospitals which are very short staffed over weekends. All those who work within the service are aware of this. I am disappointed at the Minister of State's response and I stress that this was one of my most important amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 15, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 3, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and inform the medical practitioner who made the application and the applicants immediately&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>From a practical point of view this amendment makes good sense. From his work in family medicine the Minister of State will be aware that there is a constant complaint of hospitals, especially acute hospitals, that discharge letters are not sent and that general practitioners do not know what has happened to their patients until two or three weeks after they have been discharged. In the absence of this amendment the Bill does nothing to rectify this. If the admission order is not acted on, the consultant psychiatrist within the approved centre refuses to make the order but nobody tells anybody outside and there is no obligation to tell the person who made the application for the involuntary admission or the registered medical practitioner. It would be common sense to let them know that this had been refused.</P>
      <P>As it stands, it is impolite as well as inefficient. The people who made the application should not find out that the involuntary admission had been refused through the person concerned turning up on their doorstep and the registered medical practitioner should not have to find out by the person involved turning up at their surgery that evening.</P>

It would be good practice for a consultant psychiatrist who is proposing to discharge a patient to inform the family and relatives of the person as soon as possible. However, it is not necessary to include such a provision in the legislation. The new mental health commission when established will issue guidelines to all those concerned with implementing the provisions of the Bill. It is expected that issues such as this will be dealt with in that context. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), line 4, after &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with at least 2 years experience in psychiatry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is important because the Minister will be aware that currently the non-consultant hospital doctor cohort in the psychiatric service is almost entirely made up of non-EU doctors. Few of them qualified in Ireland or have had their qualifications followed up closely. In a large number of psychiatric hospitals, some people may have arrived in the country the night before. They may be very good doctors, but they have come to Ireland to get postgraduate qualifications and they do not necessarily have any experience in this field. However, they will be in a position to refuse to discharge patients. This is not proper and people with some experience in psychiatry must be there.</P>
      <P>Psychiatry is a different discipline and people get very little experience of it during their training career or intern year. It is important that people who are in a position to prevent the discharge of patients should be at least some way up the non-consultant hospital doctor tree. This would ensure that they have some experience at least in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments propose that a registered medical practitioner who will have power to detain a patient should have at least two years' experience in psychiatry. I do not intend to accept the amendments. First, the registered medical practitioner will be a fully qualified medical practitioner and, as such, will be well capable of taking the decisions required under the Act. Second, the provisions merely enable the doctor concerned to detain the person for a period of 24 hours until a consultant psychiatrist is available to examine the patient. It is entirely appropriate that a decision such as this can be made by a qualified junior doctor.</P>
      <P>Third, it is worth noting that similar powers are given in the section to registered nurses and the Senator does not appear to have difficulty with that proposal. The crucial decision about whether a person should be deprived of their liberty by way of an involuntary admission order is reserved for consultant psychiatrists alone. This is fully in keeping with the recommendations of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>Whoever wrote the Minister's reply had not read the next amendment which seeks a change from &ldquo;registered nurse&rdquo; to &ldquo;registered psychiatric nurse&rdquo;. The Minister said I did not object to a registered nurse, but that is not the case. My view is that it should be a registered psychiatric nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> The whole area of psychiatry is being downgraded in this respect. Nurses and junior doctors do not require training in psychiatry. It appears that anybody who turns up will do. Depriving a person of his or her liberty for a further 24 hours is serious. I referred earlier to Article 44.1 of the Constitution which states that people cannot be detained against their will except under the law. The Bill states that someone who comes in as an involuntary patient can be detained for a further 24 hours in a psychiatric institution by someone who has no experience in psychiatry. This is very bad.</P>
    <P>This is another important part of the Bill because it downgrades the psychiatric service. The implication is that it does not matter who is employed in it. An adequate number of people should be employed with a specific amount of training so that the legislation can be applied properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>The amendment proposes that the registered nurse should be a registered psychiatric nurse. This is perhaps more important than the point in relation to the doctor. Psychiatric nurses have experience of dealing with psychiatric illness while general nurses have little or none. They will have undertaken a small secondment to a psychiatric hospital, but nothing else. However, they will be in a position to detain an involuntary patient for another 24 hours. Twenty-four hours may seem a small amount of time, but it is a long period to a patient who is detained involuntarily and it has caused great distress and hurt in the past.</P>

      <P>The Senator will be aware that the health services in general are currently experiencing a severe shortage of nursing staff. This shortage is particularly acute in psychiatric services in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most concerned that any amendment which restricted the provisions of the Bill to psychiatric nurses alone would inhibit the ability of the services to respond to the shortage in nurs<Col N="131" /> ing staff by employing general nurses in psychiatric hospitals. I understand that some psychiatric hospitals already include both general and psychiatric nurses on their staff. Many psychiatric hospitals also employ nurses specialising in intellectual disability. It would be most unfortunate if a situation arose on a hospital ward where it was required to detain a patient, but a registered psychiatric nurse was not available and the patient could not be detained. The section is designed to ensure maximum flexibility on the part of the hospital staff to take action where required. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Twenty-four hours is a long time to detain people. This is particularly so if staff are inexperienced and when there is such a shortage of trained staff in the psychiatric services.

      <P>It is very important when drafting legislation to ensure that provisions are flexible and realistic. I have already referred to staff shortages in the psychiatric services and in the health services generally. The timeframe of 24 hours is intended as a ceiling, a maximum time during which a consultant must be found. It is expected that in most cases a consultant will examine the patient within a much shorter timeframe. However, I am reluctant to change it to 6 <Col N="132" /> hours given the current constraints on hospital and health boards with regard to recruitment and retention of staff.</P>
      <P>The Senator will note that there is already provision in this section for a shorter period to be prescribed by ministerial regulation, after consultation with the commission.

      <P>In page 15, line 19, to delete &ldquo;21&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;14&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the length of time that a person should be involuntarily detained is extremely important to that person. Waiting for a review is extremely problematic in the light of what the Minister stated when the Bill was first introduced. A period of 28 days was proposed and this was too long for anyone to accept. The Minister then stated that it would be unrealistic to implement the review in a shorter time period but he did change the time from 28 to 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael Members in both Houses decided to propose a seven day period. In deference to the problems in relation to funding, we then decided on 14 days. We did this because we believed that if the application of pressure had caused the <Col N="133" /> Minister to move from 28 to 21 days, then he could well move from 21 to 14 days, in the interest of those in involuntary detention.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry has pointed out the lack of finance available to implement this Bill. The Minister has said that there is a need for substantial investment, trained staff and the use of information technology. Extra funding is required for the mental health sector. The Schizophrenia Association of Ireland has lobbied all Members for a reduction of the period to seven days and that association is an expert in the field. I ask for confirmation from the Minister of a concerted effort to reduce the waiting time for review from 14 to seven days, when finances are forthcoming. Otherwise, I will be forced to press this amendment in the interests of people detained involuntarily. It is a very long waiting time for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that when a person is deemed suitable for detention in an approved centre, we should not sacrifice accuracy for speed. In my experience, the two do not go together. In some cases, it can take much longer than 14 days, depending on the treatment the patient is receiving. The timespan in the Bill is a sensible one and it is the correct approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the length of time for which a person should be involuntarily detained before their case is reviewed has been one of the contentious issues in this Bill. The 28 day timescale for the initial detention envisaged in the Bill came in for some criticism during Committee Stage in the other House. The Minister listened very carefully to all of the arguments made and appreciates the concerns that various interests have in relation to the length of time that it will take to complete a person's review. The Minister also has a duty to ensure that whatever legislation is enacted is realistic and can be implemented. The logistical implications of the review process being proposed under the Bill are enormous.</P>
      <P>At present, there are approximately 2,400 involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units each year. Each one of these admissions will have a review process initiated for it. The Department has estimated that approximately 2,000 completed reviews per year will be required under the provisions of this Bill. A substantial investment will be required in staffing and information technology and comprehensive training for all personnel involved, to ensure that the timescale in this Bill is complied with in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> Having reviewed the issue comprehensively, bearing in mind the concerns expressed about civil liberties and the administrative implications, the Minister has come to the conclusion that 21 days is the absolute minimum that would be required to guarantee a completed review within the statutory timescale for every person who is admitted involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital. The ministerial amendment to reduce the timescale for an admission order and for the completion of a review from 28 days to 21 days was accepted on Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman's amendment requiring a renewal order to be reviewed every 14 days is not acceptable on the logistical grounds already referred to. I agree it would be good practice for involuntary patients to be reviewed regularly by their consultants and it will be a function of the new Mental Health Commission, through the work of the inspector, to ensure that good practice is adhered to.</P>
    <P>If, once the system is up and running, it is found that the volume of cases is actually lower than anticipated and that the administrative process is quicker and more efficient than that anticipated, the Minister is fully prepared to revisit the issue of the timescale and to change the legislation if necessary. This is provided for in section 42 of the Bill which requires the commission to review the operation of this Part of the Act within 18 months of its commencement and to submit a report in writing to the Minister on the operation of the whole process together with any findings, conclusions or recommendations it considers appropriate. I envisage that this report would include recommendations on the necessity for further reducing the 21 day timescale. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Senator is talking about one patient. I am not saying I would not have regard for that one patient who would need that length of an assessment period. My understanding is that it is a lack of resources. By that I mean trained staff not just throwing money at something. We are talking about the necessary personnel, the administration etc. and a team effort. Perhaps the Minister will explain if that is the problem. My understanding is that the period can be reduced if there are not 2,400 individuals. I <Col N="135" /> understand that different elements have to be taken into consideration. Is a lack of funding the reason for the timescale being extended beyond what we would wish, given that the Minister moved from 28 to 21 days? I am of the view that if the resources were available the Minister would have moved to the 14 days. If I had my way I would want it reduced to seven days. I acknowledge that Senator Glynn is aware of difficulties with an odd patient but it is not clear whether the timescale is due to lack of resources or individual need.</P>

      <P>The issue is not monetary, rather it is the volume of cases. As has been correctly pointed out by Senator Glynn, many of these patients need some time for a proper assessment. Nevertheless, as the Minister has said, if an opportunity arises, especially after the 18 months, he would like to move to have the timescale reduced if it can be done. One cannot give a guarantee. It is better to err on the side of caution because it is better to have a correct diagnosis and to administer the correct treatment than to rush into discharging people.</P>

      <P>I see it in terms of 2,400 individual human beings. When I speak of resources I mean personnel. It is shocking that they have to wait that length of time for a review. If I were in <Col N="136" /> that position I would consider 28, 21, 14 and even seven days a lifetime. I am not sure it is specifically the length of time for the assessment of a particular individual. It still comes down to the main issue concerning us, the resource aspect. If we leave this issue, it may be revisited somewhere along the line. I am loath to press it in light of two individual cases mentioned by Senator Glynn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be umpteen cases. The reality is that the Minister has specified that there is a lack of resources. There was no reference to an individual being discommoded due to a wrong diagnosis. I wonder why it would take so long. If that is the case why include a time limit? It appears that a person may not be reviewed. I am concerned about the review. I do not know whether the health service would ever be so well funded that one could give such detailed treatment which would be desirable to each individual. I am not in the psychiatric area but I am concerned that it is due to a lack of resources.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's commitment to revisit this issue and to change the Act if necessary if the volume of cases is lower or if the administrative process is quicker and more efficient. If we let this go, does it mean there is not enough pressure to put in the resources necessary for that section? That is the reason I am concerned. I may revisit this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Once again I am trying to get movement. For an involuntary patient, a week is a long time to wait to be examined. Three days would be enough and would allow for the intervention of a weekend.

      <P>Once again I remind the Senator of the importance of having realistic provisions in legislation. As the Senator is aware, most psychiatric hospitals operate on a five day week basis for rostering of consultants. Routine work is not performed at weekends or on bank holidays. The deadline of one week is designed to include this important reality. To substitute three days could possibly lead to a position where, for example on a bank holiday weekend, a patient could not be examined in the required time. Accordingly I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is bad that a lack of personnel is driving this. Surely if a consultant is away for a weekend, there should be some sort of cover. I thought everywhere was supposed to have consultant cover at weekends. People should have a locum. This is a case of bad practice being allowed to creep into legislation because we are not running a proper service. Of course I am sympathetic to the Minister's problems but someone should be there to cover. If he wants me to insert &ldquo;except at bank holiday weekends&rdquo;, I will do so.</P>
      <P>If someone threatens suicide or there is a problem due to a person's medication, surely there will be consultant cover for the psychiatric services. This is just saying that we will not have adequate psychiatric cover ever. I am a practical woman, but it is very disappointing to see us lowering our standards so much.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (2) between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) at all times, including before the tribunal, is entitled to meet with and be supported by an independent patient advocate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Disability Federation of Ireland contacted both Senator O'Toole and me on this issue. I will let Senator O'Toole speak because Senators have heard enough of my voice all day.</P>

      <P>The issue involved is very clear. The discussions so far have covered the particular problems and pressures which these people are under. In many cases they may be on medication, confused or inarticulate and unable to understand clearly what is going on.</P>
      <P>As always, the ordinary person, and in this case one who is particularly vulnerable, is trying to deal with a bureaucratic process. Any of us who have the slightest interaction with an unusual bureaucratic structure knows that this can be difficult. It can be difficult to phone a Department of State to elucidate a simple item of information or to get through any bureaucratic process which necessitates arguing a case and explaining a position.</P>
      <P>The Disability Federation of Ireland feels very strongly and with some force of argument that such people should be entitled to meet with and be supported by an independent patient advocate who can represent their view where that is helpful. The case speaks for itself and I think there is a question of human rights here. There is the question of the right to be represented, which is always there anyway. I would like to hear the position of the Attorney General on this. If the National Disability Authority were to insist that people could be represented by a friend or somebody established as an independent patient advocate, it would be very hard to resist under the terms of normal constitutional rights. I see no reason why the Minister should be reluctant to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the two Senators wholeheartedly and agree that advocacy has been discussed considerably in other areas of life. This is essential for a group that is particularly vulnerable. I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is common sense. It should not even need to be asked for; it should just be expected. I call on the Minister to accept this amendment for the benefit of <Col N="139" /> the vulnerable group that we are speaking about today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support many of the sentiments expressed by the Senators about having independent advocacy services available to people who are detained in psychiatric hospitals. The development of advocacy services will help to address the civil and human rights of the mentally ill. The Bill makes statutory provisions for legal advocacy for people with a mental disorder by requiring the mental health commission to provide a legal representative to each person who is detained. The Government has recently made clear its support for the development of other types of advocacy services by its commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to assist initiatives to provide advocacy services for people who are involuntarily detained under the provisions of the new Mental Health Bill.</P>
      <P>Some groups in the voluntary sector have been providing informal advocacy services to mentally ill patients and their families for some time. It is envisaged that advocacy services will continue to be provided by the voluntary sector and will be funded by grants from the Department. It is expected that the expertise of the voluntary agencies in this area will be of great benefit in the further development of such services in the coming years. It is estimated that the cost of funding these services will be approximately £200,000 per annum initially.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill to prohibit the development of advocacy services and their use by patients who have been involuntarily detained. As I have already outlined, the Government is supportive of such measures and funding is being made available for the development of advocacy services throughout the country. While I appreciate the spirit of the amendment proposed, I do not accept it, as there is no necessity to have such measures in legislation.</P>

      <P>With due respect, the same argument could be applied to many other items. Could the Minister of State explain why he found it necessary to say that a patient is entitled to legal representation? I would like to hear the arguments set out concisely. I do not really want to hear what the Government has spent on this. I just want to know why it was found necessary to specify in the Bill that a patient is entitled to legal representation. I hope the answer makes some sense in the context of what we have just listened to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that utterly and completely inadequate. In paragraph (d) we are now writing into legislation that a person is entitled to communicate with an inspector. I would think that entitlement existed before it was ever written in there. The entitlement to legal representation also exists whether it is written in or not. A person cannot be denied legal representation. This is quite an extraordinary situation. The Government gave a commitment in the PPF to support the issue of patient advocacy and put money towards it, but then refused to give it due recognition in the legislation where it is most important. The amount of Government expenditure on this is quite irrelevant, except perhaps for the purpose of a press statement or a speech at a local cumann meeting. We realise in this House that there is a money cost involved. The Minister of State knows that we know this and we know that he knows that we know this. With all due respect, there is no need to go round the houses on this matter.</P>
      <P>We need legislative recognition of the Government's commitment, in the PPF and elsewhere, of the right to a patient advocacy service. The Minister of State cannot say there is no need to write it in because it is clear that the Government supports it. He could say the same about entitlement to legal representation or the entitlement to communicate with the inspector or various other items listed under paragraphs (a) to (g). It is not unreasonable to ask for recognition, in the law of the land, of the right to patient advocacy, as sought by the National Disability Authority, in line with Government policy, the PPF commitments and modern European practice. Without any reflection on the legal profession, that facility would be more supportive and more useful than access to a legal representative. Legal representation is fine in the context of a challenge to the legal system, but that is not generally what is involved in the situation we are discussing. It is more a matter of people gaining an understanding of the process and ensuring that things are done in a way which people can accommodate and cope with. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an issue of principle here. Those who think they know everything must learn that they should listen to those who comment on what they think they know everything about. We had a salutary lesson in that regard in last Thursday's referendum. When a body such as the National Disability Authority says that something is worth doing, it is not enough to simply say that the Government does not consider it necessary. At the very least, the Government should give its reasons for that view. A body which is far better informed than the Government on this issue is entitled to a proper response. I do not know whether the Government is concerned about costs or whether the issue was overlooked and, because it is now too late in the process, spurious arguments are being offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> I suggest that the rejection of this amendment has nothing to do with its merits but is simply due to the Government's unwillingness to bring the Bill back to the Dáil because time has run out. The issue involved here is far too fundamental for that approach. I believe that if the Minister for Health and Children was here, instead of the Minister of State, we would have an entirely different situation. It is unacceptable that the Minister of State is put in a position where he does not have the authority to accept amendments and this House is left to live with that entirely unsatisfactory situation.</P>

I had expected that, if any amendment was to be accepted, it would be this one. I do not know why we are sitting here today. It is perfectly obvious since we started this debate that no matter how relevant or sensible any of our amendments may be, they will not be accepted due to the time factor.

It is in keeping with what happens in normal civilised society where people want to help. This measure is being sought by a highly reputable group, the National Disability Authority, which has lobbied all of us. This amendment should be welcomed with open arms by the Minister. It is not a question of cost but of giving support by people who are in a different category to that of legal representation. This kind of support is genuinely needed by people at a <Col N="142" /> very trying time for them. I will be aghast if the amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <P>As I said already, the Government is in favour of advocacy and is supporting it, including the provision of funding to the various advocacy groups. However, I believe the legal advocacy provided for in this Bill outstrips any form of lay advocacy, but people may have different views on that. We are in the early stages with regard to this Bill and advocacy in general. Overall, the Government is moving in the right direction by supporting these groups and is not excluding anybody from advocacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the Government is showing bad faith and is being dismissive of the parliamentary process. The arguments are clearly and overwhelmingly in support of this amendment but the Government has set its face against accepting any amendments today. The Bill is, as it were, being railroaded through, despite the fact that these issues were not given due consideration in the other House. That has been our experience a number of times during this debate. I again stress that this amendment was put forward on the advice of the people who are closest to the situation. Those who have lobbied us on this issue are not seeking anything for themselves. They are not seeking anything other than the best supportive service for people in difficulty in society.</P>
      <P>At a time when the element of social capital in our society is so low, it is just unacceptable that voluntary support groups should be excluded from legislation. That is completely against the spirit of partnership and inclusivity; it is completely against the empowerment of support groups; it is against the interests of the patient in this case and it is completely in line with Government policy. The amendment will be pressed.</P>

      <P>This is another of my amendments to get some sense of urgency into the Bill. I would have thought it a good idea that people should be told within a certain length of time what will happen. We could include here that the patient has to be told within 24 hours a general description of the proposed treatment to be administered to him or her during the period of his or her detention.

      <P>This amendment requires a consultant psychiatrist to give a patient a general description of the proposed treatment to be administered to him or her during the period of his or her detention within 24 hours of the patient's admission to hospital. I am informed that the treatment of a person with mental disorder would vary over the course of their admission and stay in hospital. It may not always be apparent to the consultant psychiatrist at the outset exactly what the nature of the person's mental disorder is and so it may not be possible to give him or her an accurate and detailed description of the treatment proposed. However, it would be good practice to keep the patient informed and that is in the spirit and the purpose of the Bill. As I have said, the new Mental Health Commission will provide advice to practitioners in this regard. Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought this amendment would be useful. A person may be admitted to St. Brendan's, although it is then discovered that they are usually a patient in St. Patrick's, St. Ita's or elsewhere. We know the importance of case studies and case files. We should have made an allowance here. I realise there is a section later whereby one can transfer patients. It would be worthwhile here to say that if a person decides to be a voluntary patient, he or she can go to the <Col N="143" /><Col N="144" /> place where he or she normally goes. The person has made a voluntary decision to stay as a patient. This looks as if one can only be a voluntary patient if one decides to stay in St. Ita's, for example. If a person says that he or she normally sees Dr. Lydon in St. John of God hospital, he or she is not in a position to be sent to that hospital as a voluntary patient. There is a later provision regarding the transfer of involuntary patients.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that the consultant psychiatrist making the admission order in respect of a person would be able to inform that person that he or she may be admitted to another hospital as a voluntary patient. The Senator will be aware that the decision to admit a patient into a psychiatric unit is a decision for the consultant psychiatrist working in that unit. It would not be open to a consultant psychiatrist in one hospital to inform a patient that he or she may be admitted as a voluntary patient to another hospital.

      <P>Again I have to rely on the Minister of State. I hope he will make the point that this practice should be encouraged if at all possible. We know that with psychiatry probably more than any other branch of medicine the relationship people have built up with psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and all the paramedical staff within a unit may be extraordinarily important in their recovery. It is important this is stressed in the regulations because from my reading of the Bill I did not gather that what I proposed was possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2)(<i>g</i>), line 15, after &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall be informed that as a voluntary patient he or she can be detained for 24 hours&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely important amendment. When a person becomes a voluntary patient the person may think he or she is in a position to leave the hospital, whereas under this legislation and having regard to tribunals and so forth, that person might be in a better position to remain an involuntary patient. I do not want people to decide to become voluntary patients on the <Col N="145" /> understanding they can leave immediately having said so and then discover they cannot. This is why this amendment should be accepted. All it does is tell patients the truth, that they can still be detained for 24 hours even though they have decided to be voluntary patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of subsection (2)(<i>g</i>) is to ensure that patients who are admitted as involuntary patients are informed of their rights to be admitted as voluntary patients. I agree it would be good practice to inform a patient at the same time, should the patient choose to become a voluntary patient, that he or she may be detained for 24 hours if the patient's doctor considers his or her mental disorder is so severe that the patient should not leave the hospital.</P>
      <P>The mental health commission once established will advise doctors and hospitals on good practice in this regard. Leaflets might also be produced which would inform patients, whether voluntarily or involuntarily admitted, of their rights. That would be the appropriate way to address the issues raised by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I accept that most of what I have raised up to now has been associated with those working in the psychiatric services. Given all the great civil libertarians in the Dáil, how did this get through and some speaker in the other House did not say that such patients should be told about this? I know of many voluntary patients who inadvertently thought they could leave if they went in as a voluntary patient and then discovered that they could not. In view of the fact that my earlier amendments proposing that those who detain patients should have psychiatric experience were not accepted, I will have to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to be restrained in my langu<Col N="146" /> age. I could not make head or tail of what the Minister of State said and I am not stupid. He seems to be under the misapprehension that patients do not have to be told they could be admitted as a voluntary patient and that this was a matter for the commission to work through.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states that a notice &ldquo;shall include a statement in writing to the effect that . . .&rdquo; and there is a list of paragraphs, the last of which states that the patient may be admitted to the approved centre as a voluntary patient if he or she indicates. The patient, therefore, has to be told that he or she may be admitted as a voluntary patient, but does not have to be told what that term means. That is sharp practice unless it is a mistake, that it is believed it is not necessary to tell people what that phraseology means.</P>
      <P>To any rational person without any further information, a voluntary patient would mean a patient who is in hospital voluntarily. The definition of that is that a patient has come of his or her free will and can leave of his or her free will. That is what a volunteer means and what doing something voluntarily means. It means that one cannot be coerced. In a pretence of protecting a person's civil liberties, this is a form of words that implies one thing but means the exact opposite. It would be better if that form of words was left out. This is dangling the notion that a patient can be a voluntary patient and when a patient decides to become one, saying &ldquo;Tough, you are stuck&rdquo;. The honest approach would be to insert the words &ldquo;24 hours&rdquo;, as that is not what a reasonable person would take the phrase &ldquo;a voluntary patient&rdquo; to mean. That is a reasonable position and nothing would be lost in principle by telling people they have a choice of becoming a voluntary patient, which means that they could be detained for 24 hours and no more. Otherwise, people are being codded.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mhír seo den mBille, ó thaobh dhearcadh mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí de. Cén sórt tacaíochta atá ann do dhaoine a thagann isteach in ospidéal ó na Gaeltachtaí agus gan Béarla ar a dtoil acu? Níl mé sásta go mbeidís in ann an méid atá ag tarlú dóibh a thuiscint go soléir. Bheadh deacrachtaí ag baint leis sin. Tá an Bille de dhíth sa mhéid sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh ábalacht éigin sa mBille chun a bheith cinnte de go mbeadh Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag dochtúirí comhairleacha a bheadh ag comhairliú nó ag deileáil leis na daoine seo ar aon bhealach.</P>
      <P>Would it not be very important, even in a constituency like the Minister's where people would come from the Gaeltachtaí, that there should be some access for them to an Irish language support or structure? For instance, ag féachaint ar thosach na míre sin, deirtear go gcaithfear, &ldquo;give notice in writing of the making of the order to the patient&rdquo;. Ba chóir go mbeadh sin scríofa i nGaeilge dóibh siúd go bhfuil Gaeilge acu mar theanga bhaile. It seems that of all times this support should be available then.</P>
      <P>I have seen this need in my home town and county and it is not unusual. Seosamh Mac Grianna wrote an astonishing book in the Irish language about his experiences in this situation and I emphasise strongly the need for support on behalf of people from the Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní hamháin sin, there is also the situation of people coming from overseas such as asylum seekers or immigrants. Cases were reported in the tabloids recently of immigrants who found themselves in situations similar to the ones outlined in section 16. It may well be that refugee and asylum legislation covers the area of interpretation and support services and immigrants may be covered by other specific <i>ad hoc</i> legislation but i gcás daoine ón dtír seo a bhfuil cónaí orthu sna Gaeltachtaí agus nach bhfuil Béarla ar a dtoil acu agus go bhfuil Gaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga acu it would be absolutely crucial and essential that any <Col N="148" /> advice they received in writing or otherwise should be in the Irish language. That is another reason why the idea of advocacy support which would be provided by a group like the National Disability Authority could be provided as Gaeilge. I would like the Minister's view on this. It is a flaw in this section of the Bill and that is why I raise it now.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole. While the legislation may be there for refugees in the Refugee Act it is certainly not there for Irish speakers. Senator O'Toole has pointed out that in the Minister's own constituency there would be Irish speakers. Because of my own poor Irish I have run into trouble with elderly people from the Meath Gaeltacht occasionally. With elderly people with psychiatric problems there will be even more trouble.</P>

Tagann daoine isteach chucu, seandaoine go speisialta, agus ní féidir leo a mhíniú cad atá ag cur isteach orthu in aon teanga ach amháin Gaeilge. Bheadh sé náireach dá mba rud é go raibh míbhuntáiste de shaghas éigin ag daoine ó na Gaeltachtaí maidir lena gcearta a thuiscint, toisc nach raibh sé de dhualgas ar dhochtúirí nó ar an gcóras rudaí atá bunúsach ó thaobh saoirse an duine a mhíniú dóibh sa teanga a thuigeann siad agus go bhfuil siad compordach inti. D'fhágfainn faoin Aire conas é seo a leagadh amach. Níl mé chun an iomarca brú a chur. Ní bheadh sé ceart go mbeadh ar dhaoine rudaí mar seo a thuiscint agus gan iad compordach sa Bhéarla.

Vulnerable people in those areas are entitled to communication, to be listened to and to be understood, as are those to whom they are speaking.

      <P>Aontaím leis na Seanadóirí ar an bpointe seo. As Senators are aware, the Department of Health and Children is anxious that we should be bilingual. If people require services in Irish or other languages, we will try to facilitate them. As I said in response to Senator Glynn, it is important that consultants should know a patient's background, language and culture when they are being admitted and treated. Provision in that regard has been made by most health boards, who go out of their way to try to provide services in other languages. Although Irish is the language primarily involved, we have run into problems with asylum seekers, as Senator O'Toole has said. Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned similar problems in his GP practice.</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Bill precludes services from being provided in Irish. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, will soon introduce the Official Languages (Equality) Bill. The right of citizens to receive services through Irish is being dealt with and the Bill will come before the House shortly. Health boards are delighted to facilitate people, where possible, regarding the rights they should have and will have regarding their language. If interpreters are required, health boards will provide them without a problem. It is important for the working of the health system that we are in a position to provide such services.</P>

      <P>There is a flaw in this section of the Bill. I would like to hear the Minister state that, where Irish is a patient's normal language of communication, he is entitled to ask for the letter referred to in subsection (1) of section 16.

They cannot be sure of their rights, which may never be explained to them in their own language in their own country. It is really disgraceful. I realise this is not the Minister of State's fault and I do not wish to labour the point. The people of the Gaeltacht are always left last in line for everything and are never looked after. This is a simple matter and the Government, at the very least, should be prepared to put money into ensuring it is possible to find somebody to interpret or translate if the consultant is not compordach leis an nGaeilge. Ní mór le rá é sin agus nílim ag iarraidh a lán ag an bpointe seo. It is another example of the disregard for cearta mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>We are moving from the process of involuntary admission to the process of adjudicating on it. I have searched the Bill and I cannot find a statement that involuntary admission can only be used where a patient declines or is unwilling to be voluntarily admitted, which I would have thought would be a necessary precondition. I have looked at section 8 which describes the steps which must be taken: &ldquo;a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre pursuant to an application under section 9 or 12 and detained there on the grounds that he or she is suffering from mental disorder.&rdquo; It does not say the person has to have demonstrated or shown a reluctance to be hospitalised voluntarily. It seems that anybody may be involved.</P>
      <P>Section 12 states:</P>
      <P>where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is suffering from a mental disorder and that because of the mental disorder there is a serious likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons, the member may either alone or with any other members of the Garda Síochána&ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i> take the person into custody</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion in either case that the person has to be somebody who has declined to go to hospital voluntarily. It could apply to anybody. I may have missed something, but I do not find a section in the Bill which provides that this should apply only to people who will not go to hospital voluntarily. I would like to know where that is written into the Bill.</P>

However, this Bill should specifically apply to people who say they will not go or in respect of whom it be adjudged that they will not go. Many people can be persuaded to go to hospital. I am sure Senator Fitzpatrick has persuaded people who arguably could be a danger to themselves, who are depressed and perhaps suicidal, to go to hospital.

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) assign a legal representative to represent the consultant psychiatrist unless he or she proposes to engage one,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Law Reform Committee of the Law Society for pointing out this and some other important aspects of the Bill. The patient has legal representation, and that is right and proper. However, as a medical practitioner, the Minister will note that the consultant psychiatrist does not have legal representation. There is nothing to stop him engaging a legal representative, but who will pay? This is surely unfair. The medical practitioner who was involved in admitting a patient in the past had no chance of legal representation either. Unfortunately, the tribunal is quite an adversarial system as it is laid out here. The consultant psychiatrist should, therefore, be entitled to legal representation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We argued this earlier today. Consultant psychiatrist means a consultant psychiatrist who is employed by a health board or by an approved centre. Such people have medical indemnity or insurance from the MDU or the MPS, or they are covered by their health board. We had a discussion earlier about narrowing the range of people who could make decisions. Now we see the benefit of it. These people will now be covered by medical indemnity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical indemnity is costing the health service £400 million at the moment. The MDU, the MPS and Senator Glynn's organisation will have trouble when I pass on the good news to them that now they will have to give further legal representation. I thank Senator Fitzpatrick for his explanation, but I would like confirmation from the Minister that the Department will encourage the medical insurance companies to cover all those who have to come before the tribunals because I am sure they will be very anxious to increase their fees accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me emphasise that a tribunal is not a court. A tribunal is an inquiry into the propriety or otherwise of a person's detention. The remit of the tribunal is simply to ascertain whether a person is mentally disordered to the extent that it requires a restriction on their liberty. It is not the task of the tribunal to assign blame or to determine any question in relation to liability on the part of the consultant psychiatrist, the general practitioner or anyone else involved in the detention of a person concerned. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for the Mental Health Commission to assign legal representation <Col N="153" /> to the consultant psychiatrist concerned as he or she is not on trial in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls upon the Minister for Health and Children to establish as a matter of urgency multi-disciplinary specialist breast units for the detection and treatment of breast cancer in all health board areas.</P>
      <P>The Government side proposes an amendment which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the Government's commitment to the continuing development of cancer services in line with the National Cancer Strategy; and welcomes the development of centres of excellence for the treatment of breast disease in line with the core recommendations of the Report of the Sub-Group to the National Cancer Forum entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> While I do not disagree with the Government parties approving the Government's commitment to cancer services, the purpose of the motion, supported by the Fine Gael Senators, is to highlight the urgent need to establish multi-disciplinary breast units because unless they are established in each health board women's health will be at risk. Two weeks ago the Minister for Health and Children provided the House with an up-date of developments regarding specialist breast units but I understood him to mean they would not be established everywhere and certainly not the Mid-Western Health Board region.</P>
    <P>The report of the sub-group to the National Cancer Forum entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease is very detailed. It is the greatest fear of women, especially those presenting with breast symptoms, that they have cancer. In many cases the breast complaint is not due to cancer but there is great anxiety generated by the possibility that there is cancer. This requires that women with breast symptoms receive care in a sympathetic environment and that they have access to highly trained specialists and high quality facilities.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about supporting women's anxieties there must be a firm diagnosis of a benign or instant condition without delay so that the patient is reassured. That is the most important aspect. When the patient has cancer the diagnosis and treatment must be carried out in a systematic fashion and must conform with very high standards of care.</P>
    <P>There are 650 deaths from cancer in women each year and breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer. Although it is rare in women under the age of 30, all age groups can be affected and it is responsible for a high number of premature deaths. Sadly, according to the report of the sub-group to the National Cancer Forum, despite the research carried out in many areas of women's health, the causes of breast cancer are still unknown. However, we know &ndash; it has been stressed repeatedly &ndash; that if there is early diagnosis it is most likely that patients will have a favourable outlook. While high quality mammography is not infallible it can lead to identification of breast cancers when they are very small. This means that the possibility of a cure after treatment can be very high.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that women in the Limerick area do not have access to BreastCheck despite the fact that its services are broadcast regularly on radio. We in the mid-west region feel disadvantaged with regard to the available facilities. According to Cuidiú, within the Limerick area there is a an urgent need for the provision of radiotherapy facilities. Phase two of a specialist breast unit and BreastCheck is also required. In the meantime women must travel to avail of these services.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to consider what is happening in Europe. Last year I attended a conference at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London which has a <Col N="155" /> dedicated multi-disciplinary unit. The facilities are superb and being a public hospital they are open to all public patients. I wish similar facilities were available in Ireland. Europa Donna, to which I have links in Dublin, attended the conference, which made recommendations to other EU countries to have these multi-disciplinary clinics established, to provide breast cancer screening, quality assurance in breast cancer research, risk assessment, including genetic testing, treatment tailoring and participation in clinical trials. A number of Irish doctors, specialist breast care nurses and breast cancer activists attended the conference, which was the second one attended by a delegation from Europa Donna to discuss progress. All are agreed on what should be done.</P>
    <P>Two organisations apart from Europa Donna have come together and will continue to work to stimulate cancer research, to improve the standard of cancer treatment, enhance communication and encourage breast cancer advocacy. The question of advocacy was also debated earlier today on Committee Stage of the Mental Health Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of our membership of the EU there must be an exchange of up to date information to ensure a more uniform method in the diagnosis and treatment of beast cancer. Sadly, matters are not uniform, as I am sure Senator Taylor-Quinn would agree. We in the mid-west feel we have been disregarded in connection with the establishment of a multi-disciplinary unit which has been advocated by all professionals dealing with cancer.</P>
    <P>During a Seanad debate on the 29 March 2001 on the report of the sub-group to the National Cancer Forum, the Minister for Health and Children used aspirational language and I detected little sense of urgency about the establishment of multi-disciplinary breast clinics. He said he &ldquo;accepted the broad thrust of the report&rdquo;. This suggests that the details of the report are not acceptable. It is regrettable the Minister is not present because I would have asked him to outline the aspects of the report he does not accept.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention points raised by others in submissions to the 2001 health strategy. There is more to dealing with cancer than multi-disciplinary clinics, although they are central to the recommendations. In relation to the experience of women who reported breast lumps, as Senator Taylor-Quinn will agree, there is very uneven access to services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The further one is from the capital or centre of population, the less one is likely to be able to avail of any facility.</P>
    <P>There are unacceptable waiting times for mammograms and appointments with consultants for many women, particularly public patients. This is sad. Many public patients are seen by junior doctors and not by a consultant. These facts were given to me and I do not dispute them because they are accurate. The services appear to be worse outside the main cities but even there, the <Col N="156" /> services vary greatly from one hospital to another. There is no doubt that those attending specialist breast clinics appear to have the best experience because they have the support of specialist breast cancer nurses.</P>
    <P>Regarding facilities for nurses who wish to become experts in oncology and breast cancer services, there is a course in UCD but I ask the Minister to clarify whether nurses must undertake it at their own expense if they want to develop further expertise in this much needed area. In Britain, if one leaves one's place of work to undertake such a course, one is paid one's salary while one is gaining further expertise. In most cases, the certification is degree level. I am particularly concerned about this matter because if the Minister is serious about setting up these multi-disciplinary clinics, he must realise they do not only involve consultants. The teams will include nurses who ultimately may have to come from other countries because such nurses are not available in Ireland. If the Minister wanted to set up the clinics tomorrow, the dedicated teams would not be available.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister suggesting these clinics will happen if we know the experts are not available? It is said that money is being thrown at the health services but planning is required. Perhaps this is why the Minister made a vague reference in this regard; perhaps he knows it will not be possible to establish the clinics. If he set up clinics without personnel, they would be only aspirational. I do not like to be negative but if existing breast clinics are under-resourced to varying degrees, I shudder to think how the recommended multi-disciplinary specialist breast units can be created. The bottom line is that women will not have equal access to high quality care. I often wonder if that is because we are women and, in the main, breast cancer affects women. The point is that if breast cancer is detected in time, women's lives can be saved.</P>
    <P>The House discussed the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill and women with private health insurance often have shorter times between surgery and subsequent treatment. There is less delay for such women in having surgery and adjuvant treatment in the same centre. It is sad that women in the public sector are worse off in that regard. Insufficient psychological support is available for patients and their families in what is a testing time. In the mid-west in particular, women must travel long distances for radiotherapy at enormous expense to them. It also involves enormous stress for them and their families. Many of the problems could be resolved by adequately resourcing multi-disciplinary breast clinics.</P>
    <P>A plan to develop all 13 units proposed in the report on the symptomatic services over the next five years should be put in place now. We are not interested in hearing that it will happen next year or the year after. It should be put in place now by the Department of Health and Children in co-operation with health boards. Radiotherapy services and screening pro<Col N="157" /> grammes for older women should be extended nationwide. A health promotion programme should be developed to inform people that cancer is a survivable illness, particularly if it is detected early, although we shy away from it. I hope the Minister will have some answers to the points I raised in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. There are three medical experts on the other side of the House and I am sure they fully support and agree with everything Senator Jackman said. This is a serious issue. It is of huge importance to women because the statistical rate of fatalities from breast cancer in this country is high in comparison to other countries. The facilities under the health service leave an enormous amount to be desired. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, requested a report in 1995. Following the presentation of the national cancer strategy report, a sub-committee was established. However, it is extraordinary that the group in carrying out its report did not consult existing services outside the Dublin area. This is condemnable.</P>
      <P>My constituency of Clare was one of the first to put in place a mammography unit in the general hospital in Ennis. A radiologist returned from one of the top hospitals in England under the impression that the Mid-Western Health Board was to put in place a state of the art centre in Ennis at that time. He and his team have done wonderful work over the years, but when the report was being compiled, it appeared that if one was outside the Pale, one was not deemed worthy of consideration or even asked one's views on the issue. Everything is focused on the Dublin area; it is as if the rest of the country does not exist. This is totally condemnable.</P>
      <P>The bureaucrats and supposed &ldquo;experts&rdquo; who pulled together the report were paid a large amount of money from the public purse to get a balanced view of all parts of the country from people involved in this area. From that perspective, I am cynical and sceptical about the report. The group reported without getting a clear picture or clear views from the medics directly involved in providing the service. The Minister should bear this aspect in mind when he is attempting to put in place a better service throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Detection is vital and I support the idea of maintaining existing units throughout the country and putting mobile units in place. Mobile units will make services more accessible to many people in a similar way to the TB detection units in the past. In that case, vans travelled around the country and people were X-rayed on site in various towns. The units were extremely helpful in getting rid of tuberculosis in its time. In this instance, the mobile units could be extremely helpful in detecting breast cancer in women at an early stage. However, it should only be an ancillary service to fixed services in various hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> The entire west deserves specific consideration because there is a dearth of such services from Donegal to west Cork. I am sure this applies to Cavan, Monaghan and other peripheral areas. They must receive specific attention. An attempt should be made in each general hospital in each county to establish a detection facility and a mammography unit. These services should be put in place in each county hospital.</P>
    <P>I also support the idea of centres of excellence because there are certain problems. Detection is one thing, specific treatment and subsequent dealing with the problem can become in some instances quite a challenge. There is a need for centres of excellence where unusual cases are dealt with. In a number of health board areas some of the finest consultants are being drawn into the centre and their services and skills are being diverted into the regional hospitals at the centre of the health board area. This is happening in Limerick where good people are being taken out of Clare and diverted to Limerick. I have evidence that it is happening in Galway, where good people in Castlebar, the Minister's own constituency, are being diverted to Galway. This is not fair practice nor is it a commendable development.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is a former practising doctor with direct contact with the people and medical professionals of the area and would fully recognise the importance of the provision of service in rural areas. We must never underestimate the difficulty of travelling in rural areas. People who do not have private health insurance and are public patients find it particularly difficult to arrange transportation to the facility. The nearer the facility, the better for them and they are better served by having local units rather than everything centralised in large regional hospitals. Detection of disease is more efficient when the facility is easily accessible to patients. What is vitally important is that women's health is properly attended to. Early detection is vital and will mean that there is less pressure and demand on the centres of excellence from those with advanced illness.</P>
    <P>The staff in the service are excellent and do commendable work often in trying and difficult circumstances. Senator Jackman has referred to the difficulty in the provision of staff. The fundamental issue is to provide skilled and professionally trained staff at all levels within the service and to put them in place in the hospitals. There have been thousands of bed closures due to the lack of professional staff, particularly nursing staff. The attitude towards nurses and their pay rates must be examined. It is an issue that must be addressed if a proper health service is to be provided into the future. Young people are not interested in applying for nursing training because nurses are not being properly remunerated for their skilled and professional work. The provision of personnel, their proper remuneration and the provision of facilities for <Col N="159" /> training staff, are vitally important in the overall strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick </NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's commitment to the continuing development of cancer services in line with the National Cancer Strategy; and welcomes the development of centres of excellence for the treatment of breast disease in line with the core recommendations of the Report of the Sub-Group to the National Cancer Forum entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have been talking about health all day today, about mental health and now breast disease. The one thing that has been neglected is the cultural dimension to mental health. Most of us here are old enough to remember when the person with mental health problems was pushed to one side. I am old enough and long enough in medical practice to know that women and men left it too late to come to any doctor when they were faced with problems in the genital area. I am referring to cancer of the ovaries, the womb, the breast and the prostate. That attitude will only be changed through education. Before any money is expended on systems for showing up any form of cancer, people must first be educated and their family history of cancer must be recorded. The family history is the bottom line for any doctor.</P>
      <P>An interesting book written some years ago by McCormack and Skrabanek questioned the basis for screening and other modern trends in medicine. This is a short book, about 150 pages, and should be read by anyone interested in health matters. It examines the facts as they are and as they were in the past.</P>
      <P>It is not regarded as politically correct to state that one is not in favour of overall screening, but I am more in favour of targeted screening. Any patient with a family history of the disease should be fast-tracked into screening. The discussion tonight is concentrating on blanket screening and the whole GDP of this country could be devoted to that without ever treating anybody. That cannot happen and the screening must be targeted and focused&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the service must be put in place. I agree with the other speakers who say that there is a need for it. Senator Henry, the Minister and I have been around long enough to know that, in the past, people only consulted a doctor when they were sick; now people visit a doctor to find out if they will be sick in the future. That is the way things have changed in medicine. Some screening programmes need to be implemented and not so much screening, but <Col N="160" /> rather treatment programmes. A person who presents with breast cancer or a lump in the breast must be fast-tracked.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be parochial but there is a BreastCheck unit in the Mater Hospital in Eccles Street. There is a cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board area which is state of the art. The Mid-Western Health Board is a leader in this area, thanks to the Senators and the members of the Mid-Western Health Board who lobbied for it. The members of the Mid-Western Health Board&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they prioritise. No matter what the Minister says in Dublin, what the local health board says is what happens. The Minister provides the money and it is up to the health boards to provide the focus. This is what will happen in the future.</P>
      <P>There has been a cultural element in people's reaction to genital cancers. I know of some horrific cases where people delayed far too long in going to seek medical help, possibly through fear or shame, or were cúthail, as they say in Irish. I am glad that those days are going.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of this debate is not that we can achieve anything concrete tomorrow, but we may be a means of educating people to take preventative action where their health is concerned and go for check-ups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick has given some very practical and sensible advice. I understand Senators Jackman's and Taylor-Quinn's concerns following the recent report on the survival rates from cancer. It was profoundly depressing. The Minister, coming from the west, would be worried at the black belt down the west in regard to the survival rates from cancer and that so many more women had mastectomies there who would not have had them had they had been in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick made a sensible contribution about screening and targeted screening. Unfortunately, breast cancer is so common that it would almost be impossible to find a sufficient number of people without a first degree relative who did not have it to make it worthwhile to look at targeted groups. It appears from the genetics that only 6% of those develop breast cancer who have those genes which are specific to breast cancer. It may be useful to use this genetic screening and genetic counselling to deal with people who may develop ovarian cancer because that has the same genetic background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Seanad, and the Cathaoirleach in particular, that I am going to attend the round table on genetic screening and on patentability of genes, etc., in Brussels next week. I would hope to bring back a considerable amount of useful information to the House. While we are in the forefront of scientific development in this area, we in this establishment <Col N="161" /> do not get involved rapidly enough to say what we can do to encourage progress. For example, one part of the meeting in Brussels is about the patentability of genes. This is an issue in which we need to take a close interest because while it may be useful for the pharmaceutical companies here, is it of benefit to the citizen at large? I hope to have further information for the House in this area.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that Dr. Jane Buttimer is no longer leading the BreastCheck campaign. She has done incredible work. In the areas where it has been set up it is excellent. As I have told the House before, a close friend of mine was one of those who was positive and was picked up on the screening. Even the best of GPs would not have found the lump.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick stressed the need for education in this area, education of doctors and patients. It is disappointing that the significance of smoking has not got through to women. It has been clear for a long time that smokers have a higher level of breast cancer because nicotine is involved in fragmenting the DNA within any cells in the body. Those who smoke will have higher levels of cancer. Why has it not been possible to get this message across? All of us have to play a part in it, not just the Department of Health and Children. I applaud the programme on smoking which the Department of Health and Children has brought forward but we need to involve the general public more. Obesity which is one of our modern plagues is a factor. There is scientific evidence from Holland that obesity may be an important factor in altering the amount of oestrogen produced. This is not pointed out sufficiently. Young women are much heavier and fatter than they were even a generation ago. This is of concern and we may have to have a national fitness campaign and, if so, I am sure Senators would lead the way.</P>
    <P>I suggest the programme of prevention has to be wider than screening. Of course I would like to see BreastCheck extended all over the country. However, before doing so more attention will have to be paid to the implementation of services, otherwise there will be screening in areas where there are no services. It is outrageous that Galway has had no radiotherapy unit, although I understand it is coming in October. Even with that and a new medical oncologist appointed, the oncologist has no beds. Given that the population is scattered we should not try to spread radiotherapy units all over the place. The oncologist will have to be given beds. I am aware from my colleagues in the west that there is a delay in the treatment of people in hospital because the CAT scan in Galway University Hospital must be working 24 hours a day. There is an inability to get patients screened to see if they have secondaries. Given the difficulty in getting CAT scans, patients who do not need to be in hospital are kept in hospital for days and there is delay.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the shortage of nurses. This is one of the main problems. <Col N="162" /> Nurses who deal with chemotherapy have a considerable amount of training. We have to look at how we can encourage people to go into these stressful areas. I cannot understand how the nurses in St. Luke's manage to keep going. I would find it difficult to keep up the <i>esprit de corps</i> they have when dealing with patients who are having a rough time. The way in which they encourage patients is remarkable.</P>
    <P>We have a big problem regarding the shortage of radiographers. This affects the breast screening programme badly. In England they do not have such specialised training for radiographers who are to deal mainly with mammography. Could we consider doing that here? Could the matter be discussed with the radiographers organisations to see if this would be possible? BreastCheck has looked internationally for more radiographers, including Africa and Australia, but has not managed to get them. This is always the problem here. We always appear to be behind in training manpower for some specialist problem.</P>
    <P>Professor O'Higgins suggested there should be 13 specialist units in the country for breast treatment. There should not be one more. Would every one of us do everything in our power to stop small groups trying to start specialist units which cannot be supported? It was worrying to note from the cancer figures that some surgeons were doing only about ten cases of breast cancer per year. Anyone who does anything practical will know that one needs to keep up a certain amount of expertise. This would not do.</P>
    <P>I was dismayed at the recent decision by the North Eastern Health Board to send the breast specialist unit to Navan. This will mean trying to get oncologists and radiotherapists there all the time. For better results it would be more logical to put it in the most major centre. We need not have the situation we have now but we will have to wait for better results. The ICA is a sensible organisation. Such groups will have to be enlisted more. Navan paid for a mammography unit ten or 12 years ago but that would be obsolete now and that will have to be explained to patients. It is bad enough to have obsolete equipment in centres which are supposed to be centres of excellence without trying to send people to areas where the equipment is not the best. There is a great need to upgrade the facilities in Cork. While cash is allocated now and then, there is little in the way of planning. We should try to move ahead as fast as possible with developing the centres of excellence and explain to the population why it is being done because it is the best way to reduce the sad mortality rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all singing from the same hymn sheet. The message I have got from the speakers so far is that we have to proceed as fast as possible with the implementation of the recommendations in the report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about specialised units in relation to centres of excellence, the involvement <Col N="163" /> of a multi-disciplinary team is the most effective and caring way of dealing with the issue. I disagree with Senator Taylor-Quinn who said that every general hospital should have its own mammography machine. That is probably contrary to the recommendations for the establishment of specialised centres of excellence to deal with breast disease.</P>
    <P>The multi-disciplinary approach involves not only the surgeons but also radiologists, radiotherapists, breast care nurses, psychologists and social workers. Co-ordination of this programme is critical and if it is resourced and co-ordinated properly, it should lead to early detection, early intervention and most importantly a greater prognosis. If we can implement these recommendations in the multi-disciplinary approach, we can quickly improve the prognosis of women who develop breast disease and in particular breast cancer.</P>
    <P>I come from a nursing background and believe in the continuity of care delivered by the same personnel from the initial assessment right through the whole process of treatment and care. When a person is admitted to a hospital ward, a bond and a relationship develop between the patient and the nurse which can determine whether they have a positive or negative opinion of both the treatment and the other medical staff they will meet during their stay. Where there is a possibility that an individual has breast cancer, the rapport that that patient develops with the nurse is probably the most important relationship that an individual can identify with regardless of the treatment and the prognosis. The key to a multi-disciplinary team is having the personnel from the beginning who go through the experience with an individual and can empathise with her. There needs to be an holistic approach to dealing with both the individual and her family members.</P>
    <P>While I have great respect for all the medical personnel, all the &ldquo;ologists&rdquo; as I call them, the oncologist, radiologist, etc., I feel that nurses are taken for granted. However, the back-up support that the breast care nurses can give to this programme cannot be underestimated not just for the patient but also for the family. The most important aspect of this programme will be the number of breast care nurses who are trained.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman said that there seemed to be very slow progress in putting these multi-disciplinary teams and centres of excellence in place. Senator Henry referred to the North Eastern Health Board. The bones of a centre are already in existence in Drogheda and I was particularly disappointed to hear that the board wanted to transfer it to Navan. It will come before the next health board meeting in July and I hope that sense will prevail and the existing service that needs to be upgraded will be maintained in Drogheda. There is also the need for secondary services or outreach services in other parts of a region, particularly in large geographical areas. <Col N="164" /> Even though it is not in this plan, I support the idea of a main centre in Drogheda and an outreach centre in somewhere like Cavan.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board also plans to have a project manager to oversee the implementation of this programme. I have had some difficulty with programme managers in the past because I am fearful that somebody who is used to providing reports, strategies and draft plans is not appropriate. What is needed is somebody who has worked at the coalface and dealt with patients. As a nurse, I have seen patients from the beginning of their assessment, coming through their treatment and out at the end. It is important to have people who understand what individuals are going through. In dealing with illness and particularly cancer, we must be extremely careful to put in people who really know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>When a woman is diagnosed with breast disease, the initial feelings include fear of death, separation from one's family, the treatment and the loss of hair, image and body organs. The centres of excellence can go the whole way with an individual and that should be the goal. I have no problem with secondary centres but we must look towards centres of excellence. In Northern Ireland, there is such a service available where there are multi-disciplinary teams and also individuals who go to the various centres and are involved in discussions about patients. That is the route we need to go.</P>
    <P>The BreastCheck centre is operational in Dublin. From all the correspondence I have had with individuals there, it is clear they are particularly helpful to a public representative like me, representing women who are very fearful of the unknown and of illness. Their attitude to the patients and the guidance they have given has been second to none.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Minister's commitment to the development of the services for symptomatic breast disease. Other Senators spoke of the difficulty of having qualified personnel to carry out the service. This is not something that can happen overnight, but we should move as fast as we can. Early detection is the key to dealing with cancer in general. These recommendations are very useful and if we implement them we will improve the prognosis of breast cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to Senator Fitzpatrick and was very interested in what he had to say. I also listened to Senators Henry and Leonard. I do not disagree with anything that any of my esteemed colleagues said. I do not see much difference between the provision of multi-disciplinary breast specialist units and centres of excellence. What is a centre of excellence? It is all about access to services that will alleviate the dread and fear referred to by Senator Leonard. The fear and terror is appalling. Most of us have probably had family members touched by it. Any centre of excellence or multi-disciplinary facility <Col N="165" /> should include the services of cancer counsellors. While the problem is obviously a medical one and often requires surgery, a positive mental attitude is important and some people seem to have a better ability to recover than others, because of the support services which they get.</P>
      <P>Only four or five years ago, women in my own area of Clondalkin had the unfortunate experience of being collected by mini-bus and brought to the doors of St. Luke's Hospital, only to be sent home without any treatment. In most cases, the problem was that the machine had broken down. That was not a very reassuring experience for women who were already ill and quite terrified.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow, I will attend the funeral of a close friend who died of this dreadful illness. Even as a private patient, she could not get an appointment for two weeks although her condition was obviously critical, so God help the poor misfortunate public patients. Added to that, she could not get a date for chemotherapy, because the books were already full. She did eventuaIly get her appointments but it was too late. I am not suggesting that the outcome might have been different but nobody should have to endure the stress and terror of waiting for very necessary medical assistance and reassurance.</P>
      <P>Many general medical practices, with perhaps three or four doctors, now include health centres which can carry out most examinations pertaining to women's health, particularly in relation to cervical and breast cancer. A centre of excellence undoubtedly serves a useful purpose, but I suggest that a more local facility, involving GPs, would be less intimidating and would provide more immediate assistance and reassurance. It would also mean that people would not have to wait a month or more for an appointment and then endure long delay and overcrowding at a hospital-based centre.</P>
      <P>It is not right that people who are already suffering should have to endure such additional hardship and stress. I strongly support the idea of locally based facilities. I fully agree with Senator Leonard's comments. While a patient obviously sees the specialist for surgery and other relevant procedures, her ongoing relationship is with her own doctor and nurse. It is at that level that the best support can be provided. On that basis, I strongly support this motion. The objective must be to ensure that a woman is not left without support at a time of great personal trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine anything more distressing than the disappointment of having a hospital appointment cancelled at short notice for surgery for such a dreadful illness as cancer, after one has already packed and psyched oneself up for the event. It is of little consolation that one's hospital bed may have been reallocated to somebody with a greater need. We should do everything possible to facilitate patients at primary and preliminary level, through the services of GPs and nurses at women's health centres. Development in that direction is greatly facilitated by the present trend <Col N="166" /> towards group practices involving a number of GPs, a nurse and a women's health specialist. That system can save long delays for patients and a great deal of trekking from one hospital to another.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance does not have direct responsibility in matters of health policy. I have often been impressed by his use of words, even when taking a dig at my own party. However, that is par for the course.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may have spoken very nicely, but without saying very nice things. I have no doubt that he is as concerned as anyone else in this House to see what can be done to allay the dread &ndash; and that is probably the right word &ndash; which people feel in the situations which I have described. However, I am disappointed that we are not getting support from the Government side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government amendment to the motion in this very important debate. In discussing breast cancer services, it is unfortunate that some of the statistical material is a few years old. However, it is clear that the figures are increasing substantially. The overall figure of over 20,000 new cancer cases in a single year certainly emphasises the scale of the problem and the need to tackle it effectively, with particular reference to those types of cancer which are most amenable to treatment. Considering the level of expenditure and the proportion of hospital resources associated with cancer caused by smoking, it is reasonable to suggest that if this problem had been addressed more effectively, greater resources would now be available to deal with breast cancer.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that early detection of breast cancer, through the screening process, can reduce the death rate by up to 30%. I understand that there are approximately 1,600 new cases of breast cancer in Ireland each year and, unfortunately, over 600 deaths. While there is evidence that breast cancer screening can cut the death rate, the full benefit will not be achieved unless the screening programme is of top quality. If it is not of the highest quality, there will be too many false tests. Many women, who do not have cancer, would be unnecessarily recalled for further tests, causing them anxiety. That is a disaster for any screening programme and caused the closure of some in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>High quality requires a proper population register and what we have is not ideal. The national breast cancer screening programme, BreastCheck, relies on VHI, BUPA and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a database of 90% of the women in the age group. All women should receive an invi<Col N="167" /> tation to come for screening. Specially trained, sub-specialist staff must work in multi-disciplinary teams and quality must be audited.</P>
    <P>The development of services in the regions is important. We see the increase in symptomatic breast disease and people want development on a regional basis. My region spent two years on the board playing politics and fighting over the location of a centre of excellence instead of moving ahead with it. It is estimated that a viable centre of excellence requires a population of 250,000. Public representatives on health boards should look at the bigger picture and at the best service that can be provided by a centre of excellence in whatever location. It should be located quickly where it is appropriate. Women, nationally and in the regions, must be properly looked after. Whether we like it or not, people played politics with it, which was wrong.</P>
    <P>Recently I saw a story in the newspapers that women had breasts needlessly removed. That was a disturbing, worrying report. Every effort must be made to ensure that care is of the best so that women, worried about problems, will be at ease attending doctors and hospitals. Much of that report is not factual. It is unnecessarily worrying. Women are concerned that breasts were removed without cause. I hope that the Department of Health and Children ensures that women, going for tests, can have confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>More nursing specialists in the field of cancer care are needed. There are a few highly trained and efficient nurses specialising in cancer care in hospitals. People leaving hospital after treatment need nurses specialising in cancer care in the community. That must be a priority. I referred to the number who died. We must look at research. Last summer when my board visited Boston I saw the great advances in research there. We should learn from their experience so as to reduce substantially the number of deaths annually. That can be done, and more money made available, if people being treated for other forms of cancer took the necessary steps, such as stopped smoking, so as to free resources.</P>
    <P>This is an important motion and speakers made important contributions. We commend the Department for the money it spent, and continues to spend, on cancer control, research and developing services. The advisory group recommended the development of services for symptomatic breast cancer at a regional level and this should be heeded because it considered what was best for the patients. As politicians and members of health boards, with the Department of Health and Children, we must take on board its views and provide the services in recommended locations. It may not be politically suitable for some because the developments are in another county but we should forget the county and consider the region and what is best for patient care. If that is done over the next few years and money spent wisely on patient care, we will be able to say that we took the right decisions and ensured <Col N="168" /> the best care for those with cancer, particularly breast cancer. This is an important motion and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Jackman and her colleagues for proposing this motion. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on it. I do not disagree with what was said. I take particular cognisance of the views of, what we might call, the expert speakers who have medical backgrounds or direct experience of how the health services work on the ground, like Senators Leonard, Henry and others.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up two points mentioned by Senator Moylan, one of which is lung cancer and smoking related illnesses and deaths, particularly among women. Senator Moylan also referred to a recent newspaper report on the delivery of health services in relation to breast cancer as contained in two reports recently made available to the Government and both of which have been referred to this evening.</P>
      <P>I know we are specifically looking at breast cancer but it is in the context of an increased awareness of and discussion on issues surrounding women's health. There have been a number of studies and reports dating back over the last ten to 15 years, in particular, on the need to address specific health matters relating to women and obviously breast cancer and cervical cancer have been much discussed. One has to say that considerable advances have been made, although there are, particularly at the moment, severe problems in regard to the delivery of the service for the patient.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a point in the context of women's health and smoking related cancers because I am currently sitting on a small sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, as is Senator Jackman. We are looking specifically at issues relating to cigarette smoking. The statistics are frightening, particularly in relation to women. The figure of 600 deaths per year from breast cancer was mentioned but to give a comparison, there are 7,000 deaths per year from smoking, as the Minister will know. Some 90% of lung cancers are preventable. We do not know what causes breast cancer or why we have such a high rate but we know why we have such a high rate of deaths from lung cancer &ndash; it is because of the high incidence of smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of deaths among women from lung cancer, there has been more than a five-fold increase in deaths in the years 1970 to 1990. There is a very frightening trend among teenage girls in terms of the incidence of smoking which is now considerably higher than among their male counterparts. The incidence of smoking among young women in low income groups is between 44% to 45% compared to 31% among the population generally. I simply raise this issue in relation to women's health because we are right to concentrate on and to raise the awareness of issues such as breast cancer. I may use an oppor<Col N="169" /> tunity in the future to raise the issue of women's health and smoking and the increase in deaths among women from smoking related illnesses and in the population generally. It is something that will have to be addressed in a far more aggressive fashion.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Jackman for raising this issue of breast cancer because we all know women and families who have been affected by it. One cannot help but think about it at the moment with the South Tipperary by-election. We lost a great woman to cancer, the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn, and that brought it home to us. We all probably know of somebody at the moment who is suffering. I know a woman in her forties, the mother of two children, who is as we speak at the end stage of breast cancer. One wonders about the incidence of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan referred to a report in last Sunday's <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, to which I would like to refer, a report which has been made available to the Department and of which the Minister will be aware on the incidence of breast removals among women. The document was given to the National Cancer Forum last month and has highlighted a number of issues of major concern in this area. The findings made available to the National Cancer Forum are contained in an independent study drawn up by the department of community health and general practice in Trinity College looking at the statistics surrounding the treatment of breast and colorectal cancer in the country between 1994 and 1998 which, incidentally, are the years for which the most recent data are available.</P>
    <P>Three issues are raised in this study entitled, A Report of the Variations in Cancer Treatment and Referral Practices in Ireland. Using that data the three issues identified included the suggestion that hundreds of women may have had breasts removed unnecessarily due to a lack of facilities in the public health services; second, it highlighted the fact that in this period 1994 to 1998, many older people with cancer were inadequately investigated and treated during the period concerned and, third &ndash; this is very disturbing &ndash; there is a regional variation in the kind and level of service delivered to the public. These are very important issues and I hope the Minister will refer to them because, as we know, there is a major concern about the delivery of the health services generally. However, when it comes to cancer, because it is a terror inducing issue and because we all know people who are and have suffered hugely, we need reassurance on the kind and level of treatment. We need to know it is available to everybody and that there is no regional variation in terms of the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>The second report, which has been referred to by a number of speakers already, was compiled by the Symptomatic Breast Cancer Services Review Body under the chairmanship of Niall O'Higgins, professor of surgery at UCD in St. Vincent's Hospital, which was submitted to the <Col N="170" /> Minister, who will be very familiar with it, in April last year. My information comes from the media and I would be interested in the Minister's response. A number of issues have been referred to by other speakers, including what Mr. O'Higgins describes in the report as serious and significant deficiencies in the treatment of women with breast cancer in some locations around the country. I do not intend to go over all of this as it has been referred to by other speakers but we could all relay stories of women who have come to our offices and who have approached us as public representatives on their experiences of going to St. Vincent's Hospital &ndash; this was referred to by Senator Ridge &ndash; and being left waiting for hours, maybe from 8 a.m. until well into the afternoon, to be seen in a situation where stress and anxiety levels are extremely high. One finds it hard to believe that in this day and age there is still a system of block booking for a particular time. Women diagnosed with breast cancer and women being treated for various conditions are forced to spend hours on end waiting to be treated.</P>
    <P>I know of and have heard reports of the high level of expertise, the care and the diligence of the staff not only in St. Vincent's but right around the country and in Portlaoise as well. As Portlaoise is the nearest centre to my area of North Tipperary, I know of a number of women who have attended Portlaoise and the reports that have come back have been nothing but good in terms of the approach by the experts and staff at all levels from nursing right up to consultants. We know there are deficiencies in the service and that we have a long way to go, particularly in filling the vacancies among the specialists.</P>
    <P>In relation to cervical cancer, I recognise a screening programme is up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board area. I hope the rest of the country will follow suit on the BreastCheck programme, as was pointed out by Senator Jackman. That programme needs to be extended to cover the country as it is the only effective way of ensuring the early detection of breast cancer. As Senator Leonard and others pointed out, it is only through early detection that the high incidence of deaths due to breast cancer can be reduced. Much more remains to be done and we are all at one in our determination to make sure it is done.</P>
    <P>In terms of the delivery of the service, there is a long way to go, particularly in the management of programmes on the ground and of who is put in charge of running them as there are variations from one health board area to another depending on who is managing the programme. We are talking about patients and their families and many of them have children. Our first priority must be to ensure the service is excellent and meets the public's high expectation of this programme and of all levels of the public health service. The Minister is very well aware of this service and it is presenting a major challenge to him or to anyone else who might be in his shoes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I commend the motion to the House. I am happy to support it and I welcome the full debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my inability to be here for a large part of the debate. I had to present Estimates to an Oireachtas committee and between then and now I launched an all-Ireland report on mortality, the first one completed since 1921. The report was compiled by the Institute of Public Health, a North-South body. The Minister for Health, Ms Bairbre De Brún, came down from the North and jointly launched the report with me.</P>
      <P>The report is of some relevance to this debate given that cancer is one of the major causes of death here. The contrast between the report just completed which examines mortality from 1989 to 1998 and the last such report in 1921 &ndash; which is another story about how we are compiling reports &ndash; is fascinating. The 1921 data show that the critical issue in terms of disease, death and illness was infectious diseases. I was struck by the number who died then from measles, diphtheria and even influenza. Tuberculosis was a major killer then. Many of the major killers of 1921 have gone and we are faced with three major killers today &ndash; cardio-vascular disease, cancer and accidents and injuries.</P>
      <P>I recommend the report to Members of the House because there are some striking statistics in terms of occupational class and socio-economic status determining the time one dies. There is a clear correlation between people dying young and their socio-economic status. The other major factor is gender with men having far higher rates of death than women in a range of areas including assault, car accidents, cardio-vascular disease,etc.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to brief the Seanad on developments in the area of cancer care and treatment here. There was also a debate on this issue last month. I am particularly pleased to inform the Members of the Seanad that multi-disciplinary centres of excellence for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease are currently being developed in a number of health board areas throughout the country. I record the significant resources in terms of infrastructure, personnel and services which the Government has put in place for cancer patients since the publication of the national cancer strategy and this is reflected in the Government amendment.</P>
      <P>The 1994 health strategy, Sharing a Healthier Future, set out a framework for the reorientation of our health care system. The reorganisation of our cancer treatment services was an integral part of this strategy and targets were set for reducing the mortality from cancer in the under 65 year old age group by 15% in the period 1994 to 2004. Health care services were to be focused on improvements in health status and quality of life and increased emphasis was to be placed on the provision of the most appropriate care for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> Cancer was identified as one of the major sources of premature mortality in Ireland. The effect of cancer on health status here is striking. There was a clear need to address this and the national cancer strategy emerged as an evidence based initiative to enable high quality cancer services to be developed throughout the country. The two principal objectives of the national cancer strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>There are specific objectives in relation to key elements of the cancer strategy concerning such areas as prevention of cancers for which a cause is known or suspected; access to equitable, effective, quality services throughout the country; improved quality of life for patients; appropriate multi-disciplinary treatment administered safely and in accordance with best practice guidelines; greater co-ordination of cancer treatment services from primary care to hospital care through to rehabilitation and palliative care; promotion of arrangements for appropriate research and education for those providing cancer services and there should be a co-ordinated approach by all those involved in the care and treatment of patients with cancer to ensure that all services are provided in a cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>As the Senators will be aware, a range of support structures were put in place to co-ordinate and take a lead role in the implementation of the national cancer strategy. The first National Cancer Forum, under the chairmanship of Professor James Fennelly, was established. The forum, a multi-disciplinary body, proved to be extremely useful and advised on many issues central to the implementation of the strategy. The term of office of the first forum expired last year and I subsequently appointed Professor Paul Redmond as the chairman of the second National Cancer Forum. The forum is currently examining a number of issues of tremendous importance to the effective progression of the development of cancer services here. Areas such as guidelines and protocols for the care and treatment of cancer patients, information requirements and audit and evaluation of our services are all important component parts of the appropriate future development of cancer services and the forum, as the established expert advisory body, will report to me on these issues. Recent media coverage might lead one to believe that these issues were not being considered at national level whereas in fact they are being discussed and actively considered by this advisory group of experts, the National Cancer Forum. A report in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>last week relates to the 1994 to 1998 period, in particular 1994 to 1997, and there are lessons to be learned from that and applied. There will have to be an evaluation of the period from 1997 to the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area to oversee and co-ordinate the development of cancer services in their respective areas in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards. I reappointed regional directors of cancer services in each health board area last year and these posts are proving to be of great benefit in assisting in the development of appropriate future cancer services.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to report to the Seanad this evening that there has been considerable and tangible progress to date under the national cancer strategy. The strategy has been progressed far beyond the original commitments made in the action plan for its implementation. I will brief the Seanad on these.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the national cancer strategy was estimated to cost £25 million when it was launched. The sum allocated for the strategy in 1997 budget was £6 million. Since then, the Government has invested £54 million in cancer prevention, treatment and care services. This involved investing £11 million last year and almost £19 million this year in these services. All of the commitments made in the action plan for the implementation of the strategy have been fully funded and are implemented or are in the course of implementation. The main implementation elements of the strategy included the areas of cancer prevention, early detection and screening, additional consultant appointments in key areas of cancer treatment and care, and cancer research.</P>
    <P>Cancers occur as a result of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Risk of cancer depends on age, sex, genetic make-up, where and how people live. To some extent, certain aspects of cancer risk are within our own control. There is strong evidence that lifestyle and environmental factors play an important role in the development of cancer. The use of tobacco, the excessive consumption of alcohol and unhealthy diet all contribute to increasing the risk of developing cancer.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public are made aware of the scope for preventing many cancers by making appropriate lifestyle changes. To this end, the health promotion unit of the Department supports an extensive range of initiatives that have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives, including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase one of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age <Col N="174" /> on an area by area basis. In the period January to March 2001 approximately 2,700 women per month were screened at the BreastCheck units and approximately 700 women per month were screened on the mobile unit. Less than 1% of those screened are admitted to hospital for further management.</P>
    <P>The board of BreastCheck has reviewed progress to date and informed me that they are pleased with the uptake of women in the areas screened so far, with uptake having virtually reached its target level of 70%, while meeting the quality parameters set and providing evidence of a significant level of screen detected cancers. The successful roll out of the programme is dependent on a number of factors, including the availability of appropriately trained staff. BreastCheck offers suitably skilled radiographers the opportunity of working in state of the art facilities as well as an attractive employment package. The board has taken a number of initiatives to address the current shortage of suitably skilled radiographers, including an international advertising programme. We suffer here from a historical lack of planning in terms of school, the provision of radiographers and so on, which is a key factor in regard to the current operation of the existing BreastCheck and the roll out throughout the country.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck in conjunction with the school of diagnostic imaging at the faculty of medicine, UCD, have also set up a post-graduate diploma in mammographic imaging, the first of its kind in Ireland. This joint initiative aims to increase levels of mammographic trained radiographers in Ireland and share the experiences of BreastCheck with other mammography services. The board of BreastCheck plans to carry out a feasibility study nationally on the availability of skilled staff for the programme and this is expected to be complete in a number of months. They expect to have a recommendation to me later this year regarding the extension of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Senators and Members of the other House have consistently asked for the extension of the programme. Coming from an area where the programme is not available, I share such enthusiasm and desire. However, it is important to caution that this is not about optics but about real services on the ground. We must ensure the backup services are in place to meet the protocols, guidelines and procedures outlined in the charter that underpins BreastCheck. Subject to availability of radiographers, it would be relatively easy to roll out screening throughout the country but it would be grossly irresponsible to do so in the absence of backup facilities to treat women detected to be treated and so on. We must get this programme right and it must be good quality from day one. So far progress is being made on that front. However, I have repeatedly said to the board that as soon as they come back to me in terms of the roll out of this programme, I will be anxious to pursue it nationwide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Breast screening has a significant part to play in reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer in the country. I am committed to the extension of BreastCheck to ensure that women throughout the country have the highest quality breast screening services available to them. This involves not just screening but the availability of quality symptomatic services so that an equally high standard of hospital care is available for those who may require it following a screening detected cancer.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck is providing an excellent, intensely quality assured service for screened women who believe they are healthy and for the treatment of the women who, through screening, are discovered to have breast cancer. It is essential that this service is matched by an equally excellent service for those with symptomatic breast disease. As the plans for the commencement of BreastCheck progressed, it soon became apparent that the symptomatic breast cancer services in this country were not provided in the manner which would or should lead to the best outcomes for women. International experience tells us that women who are treated in a multi-disciplinary centre, where all the relevant medical expertise is on one site and where there is a minimum number of patients with similar disease treated by the same team, have a greater chance of long-term survival and have less of a chance of their disease recurring than those treated in smaller centres.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these concerns, my predecessor, Minister Cowen, requested the National Cancer Forum to review symptomatic breast disease services nationally. The forum established a sub-group to undertake this task. The report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease was presented to me in April last year. I accepted the broad thrust of the report and established an advisory group to meet with all the health boards to advise and assist in formulating regional plans for the implementation of the report. It must be recognised that there were concerns raised in many areas because of a perceived notion that certain smaller hospitals around the country would be downgraded if they did not maintain their mammography services. I must stress to the House that this report was not about the downgrading or closure of any hospital or service. The report is about the reorganisation and development of breast disease services in centres of excellence to ensure every effort is made to reduce the number of women in this country who die from breast cancer every year.</P>
    <P>Many politicians were involved in campaigns throughout the country. Unacceptable fears were whipped up which did not allow us to present to the people the real rationale and motivation behind what we are doing which is about better outcomes for women. I have provided £4 million in this year's Estimate for the development of seven centres in approximately six health board areas, for example, two centres in the Eastern <Col N="176" /> Regional Health Authority, one in the Midland Health Board area, one in the North Eastern Health Board area, one in the South Eastern Health Board, one in the Southern Health Board and one in the Western Health Board. Funding was provided to these health boards because of their state of readiness. We examined if we gave money to health boards whether their plans were sufficiently advanced to spend it in 2001.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record that I am not happy with the entire development of the services throughout the country. Some health boards have moved faster than others and some have been too slow. It is now six months since I provided the funding and progress is patchy throughout the country. The Eastern Regional Health Authority had consultations with the five hospitals named in the report and they are now apparently preparing a submission for me. Substantial funding has already been allocated in the 2001 Estimate for the provision of services. Health boards will have the capacity to spend some of the money in terms of infrastructure and so on.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has been given funding but it has not yet developed the services. The North Eastern Health Board is still considering the issue even though it was given substantial funding. Initially the health board indicated that Drogheda was the preferred location. However, a vote took place two weeks ago and it was decided that Navan would be the location but that is a matter for the health board. In any event, money has been made available to that health board since last December. The South Eastern Health Board is well advanced, is in a position to draw down the money and has had consultant appointments sanctioned and so on. It was one of the first health boards out of the traps in this regard which is one of the reasons it was selected. The Southern Health Board had no difficulty accepting the broad thrust of the National Cancer Forum report, therefore, we did not have to deal with the same issues as in other health boards. I am advised it is also in a position to draw down the funding. It has drawn up plans in the different units. The Western Health Board recently submitted a plan in regard to the £1 million allocated to it. Like other Members, I am impatient to get these centres up and running. It is only by establishing these centres of excellence and getting them up and running that people will realise the rationale behind them.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women aged 25 to 60 years of age will be screened, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years. The question of extending this programme to the rest of the country is currently under consideration. This is being done in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the expert advisory group on cervical screening. I will revert to the House at a later date in relation to the role of the cervical screening programme nationally.</P>

      <Col N="177" /> As the Seanad will be aware, there were a number of key consultant appointments committed to under the national cancer strategy. There have been 55 additional appointments since the strategy. At this stage, all of the commitments made in the action plan have been met and additional appointments were made in the areas of medical oncology, histopathology, haematology and palliative care.</P>
    <P>New consultant medical oncology appointments have been made or approved in the following areas &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board, the Mid-Western Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. New consultant haematology appointments have also been made or approved in the following major health board areas &ndash; the Midland Health Board, the Mid-Western Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. In addition I have provided funding of £2 million this year to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the further development of oncology and haematology services.</P>
    <P>New consultant histopathology appointments have been made or approved in the following areas &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Mid-Western Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board, the Southern Health Board and the Western Health Board. New consultant appointments in the areas of palliative care have also been made or approved in the following areas &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Mid-Western Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board and the Western Health Board. In addition, funding has been provided to the Midland Health Board for a palliative care consultant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specialist palliative care services, the National Cancer Forum advised that as these important services were at an early stage of development in this country, it would be appropriate to obtain detailed advice on their further development. The Government's action programme for the millennium contained a commitment to develop a national palliative care plan. In this context, a national review of palliative care services was undertaken under the chairmanship of Dr. Tony O'Brien, and a report has been prepared which will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned consultant appointments, there have been additional consultant appointments resulting from the national cancer strategy as follows &ndash; two new consultant posts approved in the speciality of radiation/ clinical oncology at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and additional consultant surgeon appointments with special interest in breast disease and gastro<Col N="178" /> intestinal disease in various locations throughout the country. All of these posts have been sanctioned as a result of an identified need and in a strategic manner. Most of the posts have been filled or are at an advanced stage in the process.</P>
    <P>Statistics available from the national cancer registry show that the number of primary treatments for cancer have increased significantly year on year since 1994. In 1994, there were 12,682 primary surgery treatments for cancer. By 1998, this had increased to 16,470. The number of patients receiving chemotherapy/hormone treatment has also increased significantly from 3,796 in 1994 to 4,974 in 1998. These figures refer only to treatments given for the initial disease and not for any recurrence or for palliative purposes. HIPE data shows that the total number of treatments for cancer has increased from 36,442 in 1997 to 50,063 in 1999. Over that two year period alone it goes from 36,000 treatments to 50,000 treatments. That is a clear indication that we are providing more treatments and that people are now getting treatments that they did not get before. This increase is indicative of the fact that more specialist consultants were treating cancer patients and reflects a more active and aggressive approach to the management of cancer.</P>
    <P>A substantial increase in drug costs has resulted from the more complex treatment options offered to patients. This was not envisaged when the strategy commenced and following consultation with the chief executives and regional directors of cancer services I have made additional funding of £6 million alone this year for this specific purpose.</P>
    <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel including, for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology and technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service. Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that the Government acted quickly on this. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, did this in assessing the case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of £10 million. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. This is currently under way.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I announced an important <Col N="179" /> investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital, with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospitals opened in June 1998, having undergone a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of over £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there.</P>
    <P>I established an expert working group with the National Cancer Forum to examine the future requirements of radiotherapy services nationally. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive its recommendations in the coming months. That is one of the remaining key issues that has to be determined. It can be seen from the background of the strategy three or four years ago that no more than two or three were envisaged. Now the sub-group has been established to look at cover for other regions across the country and how they might link in to the supra regional structure.</P>
    <P>In terms of research, the effective management of cancer requires a fuller understanding of its causes and in this context cancer strategy funding was provided to the Health Research Board to co-ordinate cancer research projects. The signing of the NCI all-Ireland memorandum of understanding in Belfast in October 1999 by the National Cancer Institute of the United States, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland gave cancer research and international co-operation in the area of cancer further impetus. This tripartite agreement facilitates the sharing of information on cancer treatment between the countries involved with particular emphasis on epidemiology and cancer registries, scholar exchange and clinical trials. The recently launched all-Ireland cancer statistics is a joint report on the incidence of and mortality from cancer on the island of Ireland and is part of this initiative. I am pleased to inform the House that I have provided funding of some £500,000 this year to enable these developments commence. This initiative will contribute in a significant way to the understanding of cancer and thus to its effective management.</P>
    <P>As previously mentioned, the second National Cancer Forum established last year is currently examining a number of areas for priority development including the establishment of evidence based guidelines and care pathways for the management of patients with cancer. This will ultimately lead to uniformity in cancer care through<Col N="180" /> out the country which will result in a reduction in mortality and the delivery of more effective and efficient cancer services.</P>
    <P>Seanad Éireann will gather that I am well aware of the need for further investment in cancer services and will continue to identify this as a priority. The national cancer strategy has to date achieved a widespread enhancement of the range and quality of cancer services available and a major improvement in equity of access to these services. We must continue to look ahead, however, and to examine ways of building on the success to date by continual improvement and investment. It is also important that cancer needs will be addressed in the context of the ongoing bed capacity review and the impending new health strategy.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise my commitment to the further development of cancer services in this country. Cancer is a scourge on this society as it is in societies the world over. While it must be recognised that significant progress has been made in the development of our infrastructure and services for the treatment and prevention of this disease, I am equally aware of the need for the continued concerted effort in this area. It is my intention to continue to work with the National Cancer Forum and health agencies to ensure that those people requiring cancer treatment services will have available to them a high quality, equitable service that matches the best available anywhere in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is obvious to anyone who read through what he has said that there is a genuine commitment by the Government, and this Minister in particular, to address the issue of cancer in an effort to ensure that the principles underlining our cancer strategy are fulfilled. We have given adequate resources to the cancer strategy area. We see improved quality of life as one of the key principles and equality of access as another. We see greater co-ordination between all of the services provided as an added key principle.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment particularly on the work that has been one of the most successful initiatives &ndash; the appointment of the cancer liaison nurses throughout the country. Anybody who looks at the work these nurses do on a daily basis, in terms of working with patients with cancer and with families trying to live with a patient with cancer, has to accept that these nurses do a job that can never be adequately paid. Their commitment and dedication to service and their love of their work is something society is lucky to have. I do not believe there is anything like it in any other part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to oncology services, it is absolutely super that the Minister has recognised the importance of providing the necessary funding to support the cost of drugs needed for oncology treatment. I am not as familiar as the Minister with the various consultants and the work they do. Aggressive and innovative treatment has been <Col N="181" /> introduced to Ireland in various centres of excellence, which has made the whole country a centre of excellence. If we match that with funding for continually developing research, we will lead the way as regards cancer treatment services.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out the huge increase in the numbers of those receiving treatment in the last two years. People are getting treatment which has never before been available and they are surviving cancer to a greater extent than ever. A diagnosis of cancer from a doctor is no longer a harbinger of coffins and funerals. We are learning to live quality lives despite cancer. We are beginning to look after our children and older people.</P>
    <P>I wish to take a moment to compliment some people. On an evening like this, it is very important to recognise the fine voluntary work done to raise funds for various cancer strategies. Given this evening's discussion, I think particularly of the national breast cancer research unit based in Galway which works under the direction of Professor Fred Given. A superb fund-raising team has, on many occasions, provided funding for various initiatives when it could not be attracted from the Department of Health and Children. One initiative I was delighted to see was a minimally invasive breast surgery treatment machine, the first such machine in Ireland and the second or third in these islands. If this group had not raised funds for the people of the Western Health Board region, the machine might not have arrived until time had passed and funding arrived from the Department. The work of this group deserves to be recognised.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned bed capacity for oncology services as it shows he is on top of this issue. Continuing investment in chemotherapy and radiotherapy is challenging hospitals as extra beds are needed. The effectiveness of oncology services is taking up extra beds that were previously used in other areas. Better treatment and quality of life for patients mean more resources are being used for a shorter period of time, which is a challenge for hospitals. Other areas of hospitals are being affected, which is why the review of bed capacity is badly needed. I hope the 450 beds in the Western Health Board area which have been applied for will be provided.</P>
    <P>I recognise and compliment the hard work of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, in relation to the radiotherapy unit in University College Hospital, Galway. It is vitally important that the work be completed. I spent the afternoon with someone from Galway who has been receiving radiotherapy in Dublin from Monday to Friday for each of the last six weeks. It is wonderful that the west will have a radiotherapy unit soon. As everyone knows, those affected by breast cancer are often mothers, the stable force at home. Women are getting breast cancer younger than ever and sufferers often have young children. If a patient is in Dublin for four or five days each week, who stays at home to look after the children, to cook meals or to look after the house? We need to bear this in <Col N="182" /> mind at all times when looking at breast cancer strategy and overall cancer strategy and I know the Minister does.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Galway Corporation recently rejected plans for a new private hospital which was to have wonderful features made available to both private and public patients, according to doctors. A new application has been sent to the planning authority and has been recommended by the manager. I hope that the go-ahead will be given on this occasion. I would welcome a greater relationship between public and private hospitals so that if diagnostic services or other expertise are available in a private hospital, they will be shared for the benefit of public patients in the surrounding area. I understand that such a commitment has been made in relation to ongoing developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be disappointed if I concluded without mentioning the development of Merlin Park Hospital, although I admit it is not related to the cancer strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator referring to orthopaedic services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very close to the cancer strategy. As oncology services in UCHG are developing so well, one of the challenges in Galway is to ensure that medical work is done in the central hospital and that elective work can be done in a suitable area in a hospital that is not from the dark ages. I appreciated the Minister's visit to Galway. I hope we can convince whoever needs to be convinced that particular investment is needed in the Merlin Park facility. I thank the Minister for his time and for the effort he has put into this strategy. It is obvious from his comments this evening that we are doing our best to strengthen the cancer strategy. Nobody will ever say that enough is being done, but we are doing our best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's apology. Senators would like to have been to the book launch and I am sure the book makes interesting reading as regards mortality rates. It is unfortunate that the Minister did not hear what I had to say earlier, but I will summarise quickly. I want to underline two key words in relation to this strategy &ndash; management and planning. I accept the Minister's commitment to the strategy and I know he is keen to get multi-disciplinary clinics up and running. The plan is very ambitious and will be monitored carefully. It is being done in the context of the Florence statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contacted Europa Donna and saw a super service in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which is a public multi-disciplinary hospital. The consultants in the hospital were as accessible to the patients as the nurses. The team was integrated totally and was working wonderfully in the heart of London. I was fired with enthusiasm at the time, having seen a multi-disciplinary team and facilities in action. We are in line with our European neigh<Col N="183" /> bours, following the Florence statement that all women should have access to fully equipped, dedicated breast units. I know the Minister agrees with the statement, as a result of which European guidelines regarding a multi-disciplinary approach and multi-professionalism emerged. The statement demanded that national Governments establish and accredit breast units in accordance with guidelines, an aim I know the Minister shares.</P>
    <P>I was a little perturbed by the Minister's comments two weeks ago regarding the women's health strategy. He stated that he accepts the broad thrust of the systematic services report, which suggests to me that he may not agree with some of its detail. I wondered whether there were aspects of it that the Minister did not accept or whether it was just a question of the language.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the broad thrust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously at local level there will be some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes that suggests that there is some difficulty in the detail. I am glad the Minister has clarified that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the cost. There is no doubt that this will be a very costly project. For equipment alone it will be £280,000. This refers to a basic level of equipment for one unit, and it does not include personnel. I calculate that this is .25% of the cost of Stadium Ireland. I cannot help but be political and say that if the equipment is .25% of the overall costs of Stadium Ireland, I would urge the Minister to put the money&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are putting money in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not when one thinks in terms of what could be done if we had access to the sort of funding that will go into Stadium Ireland. There is no doubt that the Minister would not have to push so hard. This will be very expensive. The core personnel alone include clinicians, breast surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, clinic nurses, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiographers, clerical staff and administrative officers. To those must be added essential personnel, including plastic surgeons, clinical psychologists, palliative care, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, clinical geneticists and pharmacists. This is ambitious and will involve huge numbers of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister says consultant appointments have been made or approved, I worry about the term &ldquo;approved&rdquo; and about the timespan. This issue must be prioritised to an enormous degree. The mid-west has been left out. Understandably, the Minister has dealt with areas where the regional directors are proactive and the health boards are more able than in others. However, I am concerned &ndash; I am sure the Mini<Col N="184" /> ster is too but he cannot interfere because it is a health board issue &ndash; about the North Eastern Health Board where everything was signed, sealed and delivered and then, out of the blue, the report was recommended for approval and it was decided that the centre would move to Navan. I hope this will not be replicated in other regions.</P>
    <P>To take the Mid-Western Health Board as an example, I can understand why it would want a mammography unit in Ennis. I see no problem with having existing services there. However, we need a strong information campaign not just for personnel to explain the reasoning behind the recommendations, and not just for the general public, but for health board members. We really need to do a tremendous public relations job on what these centres will do. Given the mortality rates of women with breast cancer, health board members have to be made aware that the basic line is health, and that they cannot be parochial. The Minister might ask me how I would feel if it happened in the Mid-Western Health Board area. I am not on the health board, but that does not mean I would opt out. I hope there will be no prevarication and no politicking with what I believe is the most important issue facing the Minister in dealing with a killer disease.</P>
    <P>On the question of how women feel, there is still tremendous reticence. I go to women's group meetings and advocate that they should have smear tests, breast checks and all the rest, but I would not be first in. We are not talking about socio-economic groups. All women have this awful fear and they cannot wait two or three days for a result, whether positive or negative. It is a situation of horror and shock not just for themselves but for members of their immediate families. It is extremely important that we should have the centres up and running as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in what he is trying to do. I hope he and the Senators on the Government side who spoke tonight will be actively involved in pushing the Minister for Finance to ensure that this is not put aside, because it is an ambitious project. There are 13 areas where multi-disciplinary centres will be established, and they are saving lives. There are other areas of health where that cannot be done, for example in the case of lung cancer because one is so far gone. Early detection is so important &ndash; one can actually save a life because of the availability of screening. We do not have it in the mid-west, nor do we have breast check facilities or radiotherapy. It is shocking that we have to travel so far. They are all deterrents.</P>
    <P>Although I feel very strongly about this, I do not intend calling a vote because we agree in principle with the amendment. The Fine Gael group will be monitoring the pathway by which the Minister follows on what he has said here. We want action. We want planning and management, and we want to see the centres up and running as fast as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 29 and 30, to delete subparagraph (c)(ii).</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled these amendments is that it seemed more logical to have the section so described. As it is currently drafted, it provides that the tribunal is to examine the patients concerned, then to interview the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and to review the records relating to the patient. I would have thought it would be better to interview the patient, then look at the records and review them and interview the consultant psychiatrist. I also thought it would be a good idea if the consultant psychiatrist were allowed to make a statement on the case because it can be quite hard to get an overview of a case from reading case notes.</P>
      <P>It should be possible, if the consultant psychiatrist is not available, to interview his or her locum or the consultant covering his or her work and to allow that person to make a statement on the patient's condition. I did this to avoid any delay in the patient's detention if at all possible, because the consultant psychiatrist just might be unavailable. If a locum or another psychiatrist is covering his or her work in general, I would have thought it would be wise, unless the patient had some serious objection, to allow that person to stand in for the consultant psychiatrist. These amendments are aimed at making the Bill as practical as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision to admit a patient involuntarily, thereby depriving him or her of his or her liberty is very serious and in view of that it is a decision reserved for consultant psychiatrists. I do not accept that an interview with a locum or with the consultant covering the consultant psychiatrist's work would be appropriate in this instance. The consultant who made the order is the person who must defend his or her decision, if necessary before the tribunal, and it is he or she who should be interviewed by the independent consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine but the Minister of State will accept that there may be a considerable delay, for example weeks, because when tribunals are established the person to be interviewed may <Col N="186" /> be on holiday, attending a medical meeting abroad or whatever. Is it proposed to bring such a person home? Time is of the essence with the establishment of these tribunals.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State indicated earlier it would be the consultant psychiatrist in charge of the case. He cannot say the locum consultant would go to the tribunal. If the consultant psychiatrist is in Rio de Janeiro and the tribunal is to be held a week later, is the consultant psychiatrist to be returned or can the locum stand in for him at the tribunal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the Minister of State's position. Will locums suffice? This is an example of my concerns about the practicalities of the working of this legislation. The Bill is not clear. I take the provision to mean the consultant psychiatrist involved in the admission of the patient or the locum consultant concerned with dealing with the patient. Suppose they are in Rio de Janeiro for six weeks, because it is costly to travel there, do we delay the tribunal until they return? Does the person have to stay in hospital for six weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a quandary about this. The tribunal cannot be delayed in view of the 21 days provision. I presume the original consultant in charge of the unit would be called.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>We have no clarity on this because the Minister of State cannot advise whether it is the consultant who admitted the patient or the consultant who has clinical care of the patient who will attend the tribunal. We need to resolve that aspect, whatever about locums and people who are covering. It is very important because we do not know who is the person described in this section. I wonder how we have got to this pass that we do not know which doctor we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Let us say Dr. A admitted the patient while Dr. B provides clinical care. This is possible in even a modest sized unit because Dr. A may only have been covering for the weekend when there was a consultant in charge. However, in all cases in an acute and psychiatric hospital cases are allocated to the different disciplines and specialities on a Monday. We do not know which doctor we are talking about.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with this amendment and I appreciate the Senator's concern that approved centres should have the staff, resources and facilities adequate for the treatment of patients. However, the most appropriate mechanism to ensure that all these things are put in place is to build on the functions of the Mental Health Commission. Section 64(6)(<i>b</i>) will allow the commission to attach conditions to the registration of approved centres, including specifications in relation to the number of staff required to be employed in the centre and the carrying out of essential maintenance and refurbishment work.</P>
      <P>In each case where a condition was attached to the registration of a centre, the practical effect would be that the registered proprietor would have three years to ensure that these improvements were carried out before the centre was due for registration again. If a further application was made for registration and the commission found that these conditions had not been adhered to, the re-registration of the approved centre concerned could be refused by the commission in accordance with section 64(5)(<i>b</i>). The function of the commission ensures that these matters will be monitored, supervised and overseen on a continuing basis. There is a more effective means of ensuring that adequate standards are in place than the provision proposed by this amendment, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 19 is odd. It deals with appeals to the Circuit Court and I presume the doctor will have some legal representation. A patient may appeal, but why is the applicant or consultant psychiatrist not in a position to appeal? For example, he or she may be anxious about the decision of a tribunal to release a patient from involuntary detention. What is the position of the person who has clinical care for the patient that is released even though the consultant in charge of the case has grave reservations? It appears they cannot appeal.</P>
      <P>What will happen if the person leaves the premises and commits suicide or kills somebody? Who is medically responsible in a legal context? The clinician or the applicant who sought the involuntary admission of the patient does not appear to have any right to appeal. It appears only the patient can appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes that an appeal to the Circuit Court against a decision of a tribunal to affirm an order would be open not only to the person concerned, but also to the applicant, usually a spouse or a relative, and the consultant psychiatrist concerned. The sole purpose of the appeal mechanism in the Bill is to protect the interests of the patient. This is the person who has been involuntarily detained. It is not the Bill's purpose to allow friends or relatives to appeal decisions on behalf of the patient. Each patient will have their own legal representative to advise them and protect their interests. I do not understand why a consultant psychiatrist would wish to appeal a decision which affirmed the order he or she made.</P>

      <P>I am not clear about this matter. Is it the case that the consultant would have affirmed the decision? However, the consultant psychiatrist in charge of clinical care is not on the tribunal.

The consultant who will affirm the tribunal's findings is a different person from the person who has clinical care for the patient. That person cannot affirm the decision.</P>

      <P>Yes, but we have already agreed that the consultant psychiatrist's notes and interviews will be brought to the attention of the tribunal. However, this relates to a window in time when a person comes before a tribunal. The clinician may still be extremely worried about the fact that the person will be released. It is right that the civil rights of the person who is involuntarily detained should be to the forefront, but their proper medical treatment must also be a priority. The clinician, who may have been caring for the patient for months, should be in a position to appeal to the Circuit Court &ndash; as the patient can do &ndash; if he or she thinks it is a foolish decision to release the patient. I do not understand the difficulty. It does not involve the same consultant psychiatrist who is on the tribunal.</P>

      <P>No. Legal advice suggests that the consultant psychiatrist serving on a tribunal could not be held personally liable for a decision of a tribunal or for an adverse outcome of a tribunal's decision. Under the Bill, a mental health tribunal will function as a quasi judicial body. Similar to a court, its decisions are made in the name of the tribunal and, as in the case of a court, it cannot be sued.</P>

      <P>Confusion again arises about which consultant is involved.

What about the consultant who was in charge of the patient, not the consultant who is on the tribunal? I do not mind if the matter is clarified on Report Stage, but I want to know why the consultant who has had clinical care of the patient for weeks is not in a position to go to the Circuit Court and say that he or she is very anxious about the findings of the tribunal and he or she does not think the patient should be released. He or she should have a second chance of trying to explain why he or she is so concerned. The patient is entitled to the best medical care as well as their civil liberties.</P>

      <P>It would be a good idea if the court had to hear an appeal within a certain length of time. It would create a sense of urgency if an appeal had to be heard within 28 days. At present, people on remand come first on the court lists. We should try to ensure that these people were considered in the same way as people on remand.</P>
      <P>Recently, Mr. Justice Paul Carney said he would try to ensure that cases involving children received priority. However, no priority is given to these cases. People on remand and people who are involuntarily detained should be in the same category. I thought it would be a good idea if we introduced a sense of urgency into this.

I am concerned that this amendment which requires appeal to be <Col N="192" /> heard by the court within 28 days of being made is not realistic. The Senator will be well aware of the difficulties facing the courts at present. I would be concerned that an undue burden would be applied on the courts if such provision was to be included in the Bill. It is important to remember that the patient's case would have already been heard once by a tribunal and their detention confirmed following consideration of their case by an independent consultant psychiatrist and by the consultant psychiatrist sitting as a member of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I do not think, therefore, it is unreasonable that a certain period of time would be allowed before their appeal be heard. Clearly, it would be desirable for the appeal to be heard as soon as possible, but we must all acknowledge the reality that the courts system is very busy.

      <P>&ldquo;(4)On appeal to it under <i>subsection (1)</i> the Circuit Court shall&ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>unless it is shown by the applicant or consultant psychiatrist to the satisfaction of the Court that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder, by order revoke the order, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) if it is not so shown as aforesaid, by order affirm the order.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is amazing because here the person who is said to have a mental disorder has to prove his sanity. Normally, people are presumed innocent in court and the court must prove their guilt. This proposal is totally the other way around. I do not know what purpose this serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> Imagine a person with a mental disorder who must go into court and prove that he is sane. Why is that not the case in the general courts and those who are innocent must prove their innocence? This is an extraordinary situation. How could a person show, to the satisfaction of the court, that he or she is not suffering from mental disorder? What tests will apply? I must remind the Minister that this Bill is supposed to be in favour of the person. This provision is not in favour of the person. It is giving them a very rough deal.</P>

      <P>In the event of an appeal, the hospital, health board or psychiatrist concerned may be required, at the discretion of the court, to satisfy the court that the patient suffers with a mental disorder. I think that will answer Senator Henry's concerns.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the onus is on the person to prove that he or she is suffering from a mental disorder. I would have thought that it would be the responsibility of the hospital, health board or psychiatrist to establish that the patient was involuntarily admitted and had a mental disorder. Why should the onus be on the person? I would expect that the professionals who have examined the patient and initially diagnosed the mental disorder would have to prove that diagnosis. If the psychiatrist and the health board are asserting that the patient has a mental disorder, why should the patient then have to prove that he or she has not? I see no sense in it one way or the other, particularly in the context of the whole section of the Bill. I would like that subsection to be included to deal with that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments here are concerned with the balance which the Circuit Court must apply in hearing an appeal by an individual patient against a decision of the tribunal. The Bill is premised on the principle that the decision as to the mental disorder is a medical one. It is therefore the tribunal which has the function of review and appeal of the decision. An appeal to the Circuit Court is not a full appeal in the ordinary sense, but rather a new statutory mechanism to challenge the substance of the decision on mental disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position under the Bill is that when the decision is appealed to the Circuit Court, the validity of the original order stands unless it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court, that the original order was wrong. I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that this is the correct balance in the additional appeal mechanism being provided in the Bill. It gives an individual the means to overturn a wrong decision while at the same time giving due weight to the decision of the tribunal. This does not mean that the authorities will have to defend the tribunal decision. The authorities will have to satisfy the court with their answers to the challenge made by the individual concerned. What the present provision means is that after hearing the evidence the court will uphold the original <Col N="194" /> decision unless it is satisfied that the individual is not suffering from a mental disorder.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed by Senators Henry and Jackman would have the effect of having the issue reheard in its entirety. It would allow the court to commence an investigation of the kind already carried out by the tribunal and is considered to be best made by the medical profession concerned. It is also worth reminding the House that this mechanism of appeal is in addition to <i>habeas corpus </i>under the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now down to<i> habeas corpus</i>. It is objectionable to ask a person who has been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder to prove that he or she is not. I find it wholly objectionable. Why could it not continue as in section 18(1) where the tribunal has to satisfy itself that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder? Why could the court not do the same? It is extraordinarily unfair to the detained person. It is unjust.</P>

I see no logic in the proposal for the onus to be on the patient to prove that he or she has a mental illness. The person should be supported in this Bill, not the legalities.</P>

      <P>The amendment refers to proceedings in the Circuit Court where a person appeals a decision of the Mental Health Tribunal in relation to their involuntary detention. Notice of proceedings is served on people who would be directly affected by the matter under appeal. In this case these people would be the consultant psychiatrist whose original decision is in dispute, the tribunal concerned whose decision on review <Col N="195" /> of the admission order is in dispute and the clinical director of the approved centre concerned because presumably the person making the appeal would still be resident in the centre. Paragraph (d) provides in addition for any other person specified by the court to be served notice of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiment expressed by Senators that it would be desirable for families to be made aware when appeals were being taken, I do not think it is appropriate that the person should be obliged to serve notice of proceedings on the family of a patient. While a family may have a personal interest, it is not their decision which is in dispute. The court has discretion in paragraph (d) to notify the family where it deems appropriate.

      <P>&ldquo;(7) All persons on whom proceedings have been served under <i>subsection (6)</i> shall be obliged to attend at the said proceedings.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment requires that every person who is served notice of proceedings in an appeal is obliged to attend these proceedings. In my view this amendment would result in an unnecessary attendance at courts by consultants, clinical directors and tribunals. If the attendance of a person is required at court they can be compelled to attend by a witness summons. Otherwise, valuable health service professionals would spend their time in court when they could be attending to the needs of patients. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sure that it is unnecessary. I would have thought it was an extraordinarily good idea. These are serious issues. We do not know how long the person will be kept in detention waiting to get to the court and yet when they get to the court the consultant psychiatrist who is concerned and treating them clinically does not have to turn up nor does the director of the establishment where they are being detained.

      <P>This section is even worse because the clinical director is transferring people around the place to other clinical directors who may not know the case either and there is absolutely no consultation with the clinicians involved. What happens if the clinician involved considers it a bad idea to transfer the patient? The clinician may say Seán is doing very well and that he should stay where he is. He may also say there is a shortage of beds and that is the reason they are trying to transfer the patient. It may be for the patient's benefit that they should stay where they are. There is nothing in this section which says that the well being of the patient is in any way being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the well being of the patient is central to the whole thrust of the Bill. No matter what one says, a patient will be dealt with by different doctors over a period. In the psychiatric service there is somebody in overall control who has an overview. More than in any other service this is what happens. I do not see that there is a problem in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a big problem. Someone could say there is a shortage of beds and decide to transfer patients down the country. While the position of the patient is supposed to be paramount, no thought for the clinical care of the patient is applied in this section. The transfer of pati<Col N="198" /> ent is just transferring the person around the place like a piece of meat. It is dreadful. It is just transferring them from centre to centre without even saying there would be better care if they sent them to another centre. The patient is sent off if the clinical director decides to transfer them. We have already mentioned a shortage of facilities, a shortage of beds, etc. In a large centre where there may be 20 psychiatrists the person who has clinical care of the patient may not have seen the patient at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that if the clinical director of a centre considers that a patient should be transferred to another centre because that centre can provide the patient with particular treatment which would be of benefit, then he or she shall make the necessary arrangements to have the patient transferred. There has to be a reason for transfer in the first place and this must be in the interest of the patient. The director would be the manager of the hospital in that instance and would have a number of other psychiatrists working with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to leave it at this because I am obviously not making myself clear. The clinician in charge of the case should have some say in the transfer of the patient. The clinical director of a large unit cannot see all the patients. However, that clinical director is the one who will make the decision to transfer the patient. There is a great deal of confusion in this Bill about the independence of consultants in treating patients and it seems that one consultant can be replaced by another. For many years in the health service, we have aimed to have continuity of care for patients. There seems to be very little concern for that in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the psychiatric service is that the clinical director does not wake up some morning and decide that a particular patient should be moved. In psychiatry, generally a consensus decision is reached, unlike any other branch of medicine especially on the surgical side where there is an individual decision. Senator Henry's fear would not be realised. In other areas it may happen but in psychiatry there is always consensus before patients are moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go on. We are very clear about the patient's civil rights but the patient needs proper medical treatment. I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that consensus decisions are made. Independent consultant psychiatrists are supposed to work independently and this Bill should have said the consultant psychiatrist had to be consulted before the clinical director transferred a patient. That would have been for the patient's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases it would be a collective decision to transfer for the benefit of the patient. Patients are not transferred very often and there needs to be a good clinical reason for doing <Col N="199" /> so. A clinical director will naturally consult with the original psychiatrist. There is nothing in the Bill that precludes that from happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 22, subsection (1), line 16, after &ldquo;psychiatrist&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who is not a spouse or relative of the person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the case of involuntary patients, why did the Minister decide the consultant psychiatrist could not be a spouse or relative? With voluntary patients, apparently the consultant psychiatrist can be. Is it not very foolish to have one group of patients treated one way and others treated another way? Why did he not stipulate that the consultant psychiatrist, as is the case throughout the rest of the Bill, should not be a spouse or relative? Why has it changed here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>An important safeguard in this Bill is that the consultant psychiatrist who makes the decision to involuntarily detain a person, thereby depriving them of their liberty, shall not be a spouse or a relative of the person. This is very important to ensure that the power to detain a person is not abused in any way. This amendment and other amendments proposed by Senator Henry require that other psychiatrists who are in contact with the involuntarily detained person be subject to the same safeguard and should not be related or married to a person concerned. These safeguards are not necessary in this case because the psychiatrist concerned is offering a second opinion and is not the treating psychiatrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>If we start dealing with the consultant psychiatrists in one way, we would be wise to go on dealing with them the same way. It is much worse in section 25 where we deal with children. I call on the Minister to revisit that on Report Stage. It is extraordinarily unfair to give one group of patients what I would describe as a better protection than others. I said in an earlier part of the Bill that voluntary patients should be told that they can be detained for 24 hours or longer <Col N="200" /> against their will. The word voluntary implies that someone can get out if they want to, but that is not the case. We are allowing for the possibility that a voluntary patient, who gets into a hospital and then finds he cannot get out, could in fact be related to the consultant psychiatrist. Even from the point of view of family relationships it is not a good idea.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (1)(b), line 3, after &ldquo;approved centre&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have received the strongest representations from people who as children or teenagers were admitted to adult wards in psychiatric hospitals. Some of them told me that they were subjected to sexual abuse by other patients. In psychiatric units, various sleeping quarters open onto the same area and a woman in her twenties told me she was in the same ward as someone who later featured in the newspapers as a paedophile. We must make it absolutely illegal for that kind of situation to occur. It is outrageous.</P>
      <P>We already have a problem with this section of the Bill. &ldquo;Child&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as up to age 18 years, whereas for admission to such psychiatric services as we have, the age is up to 16 years of age. It is not clear where children aged 16 to 18 will be put. From the tearful representations I have had about children being admitted to adult wards, it is absolutely essential to totally separate children from adults who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care. Unless the present practice is made illegal, we will not solve the problem. It will once again be a matter of &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo;, as I have heard so many times in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with Senator Henry. In the Mid-Western Health Board area, there are constant complaints about adults and teenagers being put in the same ward. Quite apart from the paedophile aspect to which Senator Henry referred, there is a basic issue of compatibility. One group may want quietness, perhaps to read, and the other group of teenagers may be exuberant and may want to have loud music or other intrusive activity. The incompatibility is obvious. How could two such disparate groups be put together when they are suffering from problems which demand care, quietness and, perhaps, privacy? The argument is made that there is not <Col N="201" /> enough funding to do otherwise. The issue is that it should be made illegal because that is the only way we will get action on the problem. I support Senator Henry on both of those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senators as to the importance of placing children who are mentally disordered in age-appropriate facilities. That is the policy goal of the Government and we have been taking steps to ensure that adequate resources are invested in child and adolescent psychiatry to allow such places to be available in future. I have referred to the importance of having legislation which is realistic and which is sufficiently flexible to allow for patients to be treated when necessary. The appropriateness or otherwise of a particular centre for the individual child will be a matter for consideration by the court, taking into account the child's circumstances and the availability of suitable places. I do not believe we should restrict the court's discretion in this regard and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the explanation given by the Minister of State. There will not be a push to get approved centres for children unless we have appropriate legislation. We are not talking of vast numbers. Judge Peter Kelly has spoken about approved centres for children with other problems and we have seen the lengths to which he had to go. I cannot accept the Minister's explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of exactly the same frame of mind as Senator Henry. This should be a priority. The Minister of State has indicated that decisions will be at the court's discretion. The lack of child psychiatry services is a concern. I am thinking particularly of young teenagers. Where <Col N="202" /> physical disability is concerned, adults and teenagers are not put in one ward. Each group has its particular needs for independence or quietness or appropriate leisure activities. Failure to take account of that is simply flying in the face of reason. Is it a question of resources or the lack of resources? While I do not have the actual figures, I do not believe that there is a huge number of children involved. It should be treated as a priority issue. It should be made illegal to have such incompatible groups sharing services. Based on feedback from very concerned members of families of both groups &ndash; adults and children &ndash; many patients come out worse than they went into the institutions in question. The situation defies reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999, provides for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. It provides for different legal procedures to be followed with regard to the detention of adults and children under 18 years of age. It does not contain any provisions regarding the age for admission to psychiatric hospitals. Children aged between 16 and 18 are currently treated by the adult psychiatric services. However, the placement of children of this age in adult psychiatric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate. A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for its future development. The group will also examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years, in conjunction with experts from the field of adult psychiatry, to determine how these can best be addressed in the context of future service developments.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (2), line 6, after &ldquo;psychiatrist&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who is not a relative of the child&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most amazing subsections of this section with which I am not very happy. This is where the child can be examined by a consultant psychiatrist who is a relation and who could be the father, mother or uncle of the child or anyone who has had some connection with the child. What I found a very unsatisfactory explanation from the Minister was why the voluntary patient could be examined by a relation. This is very foolish.</P>
      <P>Even in terms of medical ethics, it is considered very foolish to become involved in dealing with one's relations. In the case of a child &ndash; the most vulnerable person possible &ndash; about to be admitted as an involuntary patient, anyone who is a relation and a consultant psychiatrist can examine them and make the report. I know it will go before the courts but it has little to do with the logic of the Bill. I am beginning to become defeated by the logic of this Bill because involuntary patients have to have someone examine them and, indeed, in several other instances, but not in all, the consultant psychiatrist could not be the spouse or relative. In the case of voluntary patients, they can be, although I would have thought it wiser for them not to be. We are back to the involuntary patient where the person examining them can be a relative.</P>

      <P>At least earlier on I got something straightened about who was the authorised officer. Section 26(4) states: &ldquo;Where a health board makes an application&rdquo;. In this case it could be a clerical officer. At least the Minister said earlier when we were talking about the making of regulations about the authorised officer and I suggested it should be someone with psychiatric qualifications that it would not be a clerical officer or an administrative person. That cheered me up a lot and I asked that the Minister press this when the regulations are being made. However, this safeguard is not here for the child. Once again we are talking about the child. This is very bad. The sections states: &ldquo;Where a health board makes an application&rdquo; but a health board is not a living, breathing person. I would have liked it to at least have stated &ldquo;the authorised officer&rdquo; so I would have known that someone would be specified to deal with these cases. This is far too vague.</P>

      <P>Section 25, which deals with the involuntary admission of children, is modelled to a large extent on the Child Care Act, 1991, in its style and drafting. Under that Act, the health board is used as a generic term to encompass all officers of the health board. The use of this term is deliberate to allow the maximum flexibility for health board officials to take action where children's rights have to be protected. This amendment, which proposes a reference to the authorised officer of a health board, is inappropriate because no mention is made elsewhere in the section to an authorised officer. The term is used exclusively in section 9 in relation to the admission of adults.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8) Before the admission of the child, the parents and child shall have the option of seeking the opinion of a second consultant psychiatrist, who is not a relative of the child, and shall be so informed in writing by the Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the court will take into consideration more than a child psychiatrist's report. There is not much more there than that. If the health board applies for a child to be admitted the parents and the child are in an extraordinarily weak position and I would have thought that they should at least be allowed to consult another psychiatrist and should be told so in writing by the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears this amendment is unnecessary. Where the parents of a child object to the involuntary detention of their child, they have a right to be heard by the court as a matter of course and should have the option of seeking the opinion of a second consultant psychiatrist without the necessity for them to be so informed in writing by the court. I understand that in many of the cases where children require to be involuntarily detained the parents are either unwilling to participate in the process or cannot be found. Where the parents of a child consent to the child's admission an involuntary admission is not normally required. The option envisaged in this amendment is always available and it is not necessary to specify it in the legislation. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the case of a child with, say, anorexia nervosa, the psychiatric services and the <Col N="206" /> health board may think the child should be admitted and that he or she is in real danger of death, but the parents could say &ldquo;No, Lizzie is fine, she'll stay at home, she'll get better, she'll be all right&rdquo;. The parents could object in that case. They must have some rights before the court, given the rights parents are given in the Constitution. I wonder if it is constitutional to deal with children in this manner.</P>
      <P>The child care legislation is much better and I hope children brought into hospital in such cases are brought in under it. There is a need to let parents know they can seek a second opinion in such circumstances. Given that this would be a most stressful time for the parents and the child, the least that could be done is that they should be given that information in writing.</P>

      <P>The welfare of a child must be the primary concern of the court. That comes under the Child Care Act, 1991. Section 25 of that Act empowers a court to make a child a party to all or part of care proceedings and to appoint a solicitor to represent the child in any case where the court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child. Section 26 of that Act empowers a court to appoint a guardian <i>ad idem</i> for a child in proceedings where the court is satisfied that this is necessary in the interests of a child. The child is being protected in this situation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(9)A child aged between 16 and 18 years may be admitted to the approved centre concerned as a voluntary patient if he or she indicates a wish to be so admitted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A child aged between 16 and 18 could stress that he or she wants voluntary admission even though the parents are not in favour of him or her being admitted. I tabled this amendment to ensure a little more power is given to an older child in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to be based on section 23(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act, 1997, which provides that the consent of a child aged between 16 and 18 to surgical, medical or dental treatment is a valid consent. Legal advice available to my Department indicates that this provision should not be read as a diminution of the rights of the parents in respect of young people aged 16 or 17, <Col N="207" /> rather its effect is only to provide a defence to civil and criminal liability for those who give medical treatment to a consenting person aged 16 or 17. The requirement for parental consent before treatment can be given to minors still stands. The advice available to my Department is that provision should not be made for the consent of a child aged 16 to 18 to voluntary admission, but that the consent of parents must be obtained. If the consent of the parents is not forthcoming, a High Court order is required for the child's involuntary detention. The inclusion of this amendment would not be appropriate and, therefore, I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>We have all been warned having regard to the Gillick case in England where it was found that a child aged 16 could give consent to treatment if it was shown the child was understanding. The Minister will remember this was a case where a child was prescribed a contraceptive pill and the mother sued because she said it should not have been given. This is a difficult area, but I hoped the Minister of State would have given a little more thought to it because the stigma of being brought in as an involuntary patient is not very good. I would have thought it would be preferable if a child could be admitted as a voluntary patient, if the child so wished, but I understand the problems with the legality of that and I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Twelve months is a very long time in the life of a child. I query the wisdom of allowing detention orders in the case of a child to be repeated for a year. A year to an adult is different from what it is to a child. I would definitely prefer that a detention period for a child could not be more than six months without review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the detention of a child be reviewed every six months. Subsection (10) is modelled on similar sections dealing with the detention of adults. The involuntary detention of an adult is reviewed after 21 days, three months, six months and annually thereafter. The same format is used in this section in relation to children.</P>
      <P>In other contexts Senators have argued strongly for the same rules to apply to children as they do to adults. In this case that is precisely what is in place in the Bill. I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>After what I said, that is a very poor answer. Anyone will recognise that in the life of a child a year is different from what it is to an adult. To say that because I have argued, for example, that the consultant psychiatrist should <Col N="208" /> not be a relative of the child concerned means that I should accept whatever is right for the adult is right for the child is not acceptable.

      <P>&ldquo;(6)In deciding whether and when to discharge a patient under this section, the psychiatrist responsible for his or her care and treatment shall have regard to&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the need to ensure that detention following involuntary admission continues only for so long as is reasonably necessary for the proper care and treatment of the patient, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) that, having regard to the patient's mental disorder, he or she is not prematurely discharged without having received adequate care and treatment for that disorder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in this Bill would be good practice. This is important because there is nothing relating to community care in the Bill. We should try to look towards the future because continuity of care in the psychiatric services is very important. We must ensure that patients have facilities available to them. There are repeated admissions because sufficient attention has not been paid to facilities for people leaving hospital. Hostel facilities are appalling and are probably even worse than the hospital facilities. This aspect should be considered carefully.</P>

      <P>Concern was expressed on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil in regard to the discharge of patients, in particular to distinct but related issues. First, fear was expressed that a patient would be inappropriately discharged without having received adequate care and attention for the mental illness for which he or she was <Col N="209" /> being treated and, second, that the patient would be detained under an involuntary detention order for longer than was absolutely necessary. In response to these concerns, the Minister tabled an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage. The provision in section 28(2) is designed to ensure that consultants will consider those two points before making an order to discharge a patient from involuntary detention. As the spirit of the proposed amendment is already covered in the Bill, I suggest the amendment is withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that the person is in a fit state for discharge. I presume I will be told that it is good practice to do so.

      <P>The legal advice available to the Minister suggests the amendment is not appropriate to this Bill. The implication behind the amendment is that some patients who are legally classified as voluntary are not, in fact, in hospital of their own free will. I am advised it is unwise to make an amendment based on such a premise. A voluntary patient should be there voluntarily and that is what the term should mean. If a person is not a voluntary patient, he or she should be subject to an admission order. I acknowledge there are concerns in some quarters that some so-called voluntary patients may not be in hospital on a strictly voluntary basis. However, the appropriate mechanism for dealing with that particular issue is through the Mental Health Commission which has as one of its functions the promotion of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. The annual inspections of the Inspector of Mental Health Services would also play a role in monitoring this issue.</P>

      <P>(2)The Commission shall, within 6 months of its formation, publish guidelines to assist the Inspector of Mental Health Services in this regard.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward amendment to give the Inspector of Mental Health Services powers where he or she is satisfied a <i>prima facie</i> case exists. It is of enormous concern that a mentally impaired person should be abused, exploited or neglected or at risk of being so. In such a case the inspector should be in a position to initiate Circuit Court proceedings seeking the court's approval to place that person in the care of a relative, health board or voluntary agency. It would be a further help if the commission shall, within six months of its formation, publish guidelines so that the inspector could be assisted in this regard.  </P>
      <P>I understand the whole area of adult care order was problematic. Apparently the Minister envisaged in the White Paper six years ago that the order would be introduced. As was discussed earlier today, there was a need for an ongoing debate on the issue. If there was a debate for the past six years, what was the outcome?

I hope Senator Jackman's amendment, which seeks to address this issue, will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper published in 1995 it was envisaged that adult care orders would be introduced as part of the new legislation. The intention was that where a person suffering from a mental disorder had been or was at risk of becoming the victim of abuse, neglect or exploitation, a court order could be made to place such a person in the care of a relative, health board or voluntary agency. It was felt that adult care orders would be used primarily for persons with an intellectual disability. The Minister acknowledged during the Dáil debate on Second Stage that the provision of adult care orders was not being included in this Bill. He also made the point that the issue was not being overlooked or forgotten and that it would be given further consideration once this Bill was enacted.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons it was decided not to provide for adult care orders in the new legislation. The primary focus of the legislation is to bring Irish mental health law into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to establish a mental health commission to ensure high standards in the provision of mental health services. The second reason was that there is considerable debate among professional psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and social workers as to how such orders could or should work. In Britain the experience of adult care orders has been very mixed. There are fears that where such orders empower the health board to impose compulsory treatment this results in patients avoiding contact with services and, therefore, becoming homeless. The care/client relationship between mental health professionals and their clients may be seriously damaged as a result. Even relationships between patients and voluntary organisations may be damaged where the voluntary organisations are named in the court order.</P>
      <P>The concept of compulsory treatment associated with adult care orders is repugnant to many. In Britain concern has been expressed by social workers and service users about the degree of medical power associated with such orders. There have been suggestions also that service providers may experience pressure to use such orders inappropriately. The care and protection of vulnerable people in the community are important. However, it is essential that any measures that are to be put in place should respect the rights of service users and improve their quality of life. It is not clear at this stage that providing for adult care orders would contribute to this.</P>
      <P>Further research on the experience of adult care orders in other jurisdictions and future consultation between Department officials and representatives of the psychiatric professions and service users bodies is required before proposals on this issue are to be brought forward.</P>

      <P>In page 26, before section 31 but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 6 months of this Act becoming law, lay before the Oireachtas regulations, similar in effect to rules of court, which shall provide for simple and practicable procedures for dealing with elderly persons who are mentally impaired for the sole purpose of protecting the interests of such persons. Such regulations shall not take effect if a motion is passed by either House of the Oireachtas rescinding the regulations within 90 days of the regulations being published.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in the same nature as the last. It provides that within six months of the Act becoming law the Minister shall lay before the Oireachtas regulations similar to rules of court providing for dealing with elderly people who are mentally impaired for the sole purpose of protect<Col N="213" /> ing the interests of such persons. Again it can be rescinded within 90 days of the regulations being published. When reading up on this I was shocked to discover that wardship legislation in Ireland was formed 125 years ago. It is in urgent need of reform. There was a commitment by the Minister, Deputy Martin, that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was preparing to update and modernise legislation. Has the Minister information concerning how this area can be brought into the 21st century?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the points made by the Senator regarding the importance of protecting the interests of elderly mentally infirm people. The principal mechanism for doing this at present is to apply for the person concerned to be made a ward of court. A ward of court is a person with assets in excess of £5,000 who does not have the mental capacity to manage his or her affairs and whose interests are looked after by the courts. The wardship legislation is contained in the Lunacy Regulations Ireland, 1871, as has been mentioned by the Senator. The reform of this Act is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Another mechanism by which the interests of elderly people can be protected is by way of enduring power of attorney. An enduring power of attorney is a power of attorney which subject to safeguards continues in force after the person who granted the power becomes incapable of handling his or her affairs because of mental disorder. While he or she is still capable of making such a decision the person granting the power of attorney appoints a person to act, either generally or in a manner specified, on their behalf should they become mentally incapacitated. This procedure is particularly well suited to assisting people with progressive brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease or recurring mental illness to manage their affairs by a relative and simple procedure. Provision for the enduring power of attorney was made in the Powers of Attorney Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the points made by Senator Jackman on the interests of elderly people who do not fit the criteria to become wards of court. However, I do not believe that the Mental Health Bill is the appropriate statute within which to address this issue. As the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill as initiated I suggest that it be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In page 27, subsection (3)(<i>c</i>), line 16, after &ldquo;patients&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall include advice and representation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that legal representation should be granted with the consent of the Minister for Finance and that a scheme for the granting by the commission of legal aid for patients should be set up. I am concerned that this legal aid may just be for representation on the day of the tribunal or the court. I suggest that it should be incumbent on whoever is providing legal aid to give advice also. That needs to be specified because at the moment finance for legal aid is very stretched. It is difficult on patients, particularly involuntary patients, to have to turn up at court or tribunals without receiving advice. I feel strongly that this is an important amendment although I realise that it will not even be considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another interesting amendment. Here we have the psychiatrist on the tribunal who will decide whether the patient should be detained as an involuntary patient and it does not matter whether he or she is the husband, wife, brother or sister of the patient. We do not specify as we did earlier with the person involved in the admission orders or with the clinician. What is the logic in deciding this? I cannot work it out. It is outrageous in the case of a child that the person can be a relative of the child. I cannot agree to this. The person on the tribunal, the consultant psychiatrist, should not be the spouse or relative of <Col N="215" /> the person who is coming before the tribunal. This is all getting very tedious.</P>

      <P>This is always good news. Lawyers involved in everything have absolute privilege and are exempt from audit, but the rest of us humble mortals are not. It is important that everyone involved should have absolute privilege. I am sure the Minister will have some sort of reply for me, if he will forgive me for putting it like that, but this amendment should be revisited. It is frightfully unfair that some people, such as lawyers, have absolute privilege at tribunals, but doctors and patients do not.</P>

Absolute privilege is a very high standard and does not normally apply to witnesses in court proceedings. I do not think, therefore, that it would be appropriate to apply absolute privilege to hearings of mental health tribunals.

      <P>I thought carefully about this amendment as one naturally wants the proceedings of tribunals to be private. Equally, however, one wants tribunals to be responsible to society. This is a little like the situation regarding family courts, where naturally one does not want the circumstances of cases to be made public. Sometimes it is as well to have witnesses from outside the court. The tribunal can choose to have just one member of the press in attendance.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that tribunals should not be too secluded. If it wants, the tribunal should be in a position to allow bona fide members of the press to attend, along with such other persons the court feels should enter. This is the position as regards family courts where, like tribunals, we sometimes do not understand the seriousness of cases. From time to time, we need to be reminded of what is taking place in courts.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that bona fide members of the press may attend tribunal hearings in the same manner as they can attend court hearings. I do not think this is appropriate. Tribunals will be concerned with the personal and sensitive details of a person's mental disorder and the circumstances of their detention. All those admitted involuntarily will have their admission reviewed by a tribunal; it will not be a matter of choice for them. To allow members of the press to attend tribunals to hear details of disorders would be an unwarranted intrusion of privacy. It would be another matter if a person exercised his right to appeal in the full knowledge that the press may be in court. This amendment, while appropriate in the case of an appeal in a court, is not appropriate for mental health tribunals. Accordingly, I suggest that the Senator withdraws it.</P>

      <Col N="217" /> This amendment has been inspired by my colleague, Senator Quinn, who constantly reminds us of the need to put time limits on reports. I think time limits are worthwhile, which is why I tabled this amendment. There is a problem with the business of reporting to the commission as the chief executive officer seems to give a financial report and the inspector seems to produce a separate report. I do not see the twain meeting at all. By the time I reached this stage of the Bill when I was going through it, I was too exhausted to try to sort it out. Perhaps someone could tell me if financial affairs will be in the report to which my amendment refers. Will the reports of the inspector and the chief executive officer be joined together?</P>
    <P>I was totally confused by the time I reached this part of the Bill and I was getting very tired. The one thing I think is important, which Senator Quinn constantly mentions, is that we make people report within a certain length of time so that we do not end up with historic documents. I think three months is long enough.</P>

Senators will also be aware that in recent years the report of the inspector has been available in the year following inspections. Last year, for the first time, the report was published in July and this year the report will be published in early summer again as I understand it is currently being finalised. I do not favour this amendment as it would impose severe restrictions on the Mental Health Commission and on the new Inspector of Mental Health Services as work is commenced. Good practice will ensure that the report will be made available as soon as possible in the year following that in which inspections took place. I am confident that the current practice will continue under the new regime and accordingly I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> Patients coming to the doctor often give the impression of understanding what they are told but in the long run it may turn out that they have not really followed what has been said. We are talking about ill people who have been involuntarily admitted to hospital. I would have thought it would be better not just to tell them what is happening but to give them a summary in writing that they could read to see if they really have a proper understanding of what is going on. The Minister says that this Bill is all about the better treatment of the involuntary patient. No one in this House is more aware of that than I am, but I would have thought it would be worthwhile to summarise in writing for the patient whatever treatment is proposed.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 71, one of the real problems with psychotropic drugs, regardless of the great advances we have made in them, is that all too frequently they have very serious side effects. They may be addictive. They may have physical effects, some of which are extremely unfortunate. The Minister and I are old enough to remember barbiturates being brought in as magic. Senator Glynn probably remembers that too. Largactyl and even Prozac is worrying. I am not talking about patients being told about the prolongation of the QT interval on their ECGs. I am talking about them being told a particular drug might make them bright yellow in the face due to problems with their liver or that there is a possibility that they may develop a tremor, or that a drug is known to be addictive if there is prolonged treatment with it. We need to be extremely careful about this. Effects are one thing, but side effects are important as well. I would have thought we would be legally obliged to let people know the side effects of whatever medication they are prescribed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we ensure that any obligations placed on doctors by the Bill do not result in unnecessary paperwork or bureaucracy. It is anticipated that as a matter of course consultants will note the patient's consent in their medical notes. There is no need, therefore, for duplication of records in this regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second amendment, the task of providing full information on the nature, purpose and likely effects of treatment would, of necessity, include full information on any potential side effects. That can be done by preparing leaflets that can be given to patients if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary reply. First the Minister says he does not want to create unnecessary paperwork. Then in the rest of his reply he says consultants can give out leaflets, so there will be extra paperwork. Fairly general summaries of treatment could be given to people. That will not do. Will the Minister please look at this again because we are talking about sick people. I would have thought telling people the side effects of psychodrugs was very important. We deal later with psychosurgery and ECT, but <Col N="220" /> we have not discussed polypharmacy and the interaction of drugs, nor have we discussed depomedication which could be very serious because once a patient is given depomedication there is no going back.

      <P>This is a very good idea. However, as we have gone so far as to include good sections which have dramatically improved the Bill since we began, there is more we could do. Why should it not apply to voluntary patients? I am beginning to understand why people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum on the Nice treaty. It appears that unless we are driven to do things by the EU &ndash; it has come up several times on the Bill that we must get it through because of the EU convention &ndash; nothing will happen.

      <P>The provisions of Part 4 of the Bill refer exclusively to involuntary patients and are necessitated by our obligations under international law to ensure that the human and civil rights of people who are deprived of their liberty are protected. A patient who is detained involuntarily may not be in a position to give fully informed consent to treatment and, on the other hand, because he or she is detained, may not be in a position to resist treatment. This is why it is important to ensure that safeguards are put in place. The same concerns do not apply in the case of voluntary patients. The Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services, published by the Department of Health and Children, state that the principles of mental health care delivery encompass the right to refusal of treatment and the necessity of informed consent. These principles of good practice would apply to the treatment of voluntary patients and it will be a function of the new Mental Health Commission to ensure that they are upheld. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

However, it is one of the duties of the commission to ensure that best practice is adhered to in regard to this. We have learned over the years about the various drugs such as Largactyl and their side effects. That is the reason it is important the commission should function in this manner.</P>

There are sufficient safeguards in this Bill and in other areas of law to ensure that psychiatrists will adhere to these provisions.

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 44, subsection (5)(<i>b</i>)(ii), line 43, to delete &ldquo;Part&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Act or under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> It is right that a person who has been convicted under part of this Act should not be allowed run an approved centre but what if they were convicted under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act or similar legislation? Surely that would make them unsuitable? It is too narrow to confine exclusion to convictions under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to extend the range of convictions which would render registered proprietors liable to have their names removed from the register of approved centres. In this regard it is important to remember that in the field of mental health services, the vast majority of registered proprietors will be health boards. Therefore, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is not appropriate since health boards cannot be prosecuted under that Act. Similarly, health boards would not be liable to be prosecuted in relation to other offences under this Act as the offences relate to decisions of individual doctors in relation to involuntary patients. Accordingly, this amendment is inappropriate and unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Private institutions are also covered by this legislation. We know only too well that a considerable number of patients, especially elderly patients, will end up in institutions covered by this legislation. It is a serious matter to be prosecuted under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act and if people are prosecuted under it surely they are unsuitable to be running places where there are involuntarily detained patients. However, if the Department is happy with that who am I to argue?</P>

      <P>In page 48, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), line 21, after &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and qualifications&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 48 is to ensure proper standards. Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) will &ldquo;prescribe requirements as to the staffing including requirements as to the suitability of members of staff of centres&rdquo;. Would it not be a good idea if the suitability of qualifications was also taken into account? At all times there appears to be a lack of concern about qualifications in psychiatry. I know we are short staffed, etc., but it would be as well to ensure that a psychiatric nurse should be on the premises at all times. Something like that at least would be useful. The regulations may have to provide for that. We all hope, as Senator Glynn remarked, that increased recruitment will improve staffing in the psychiatric institutions. It <Col N="224" /> is not enough, however important, that a nurse should show a kind face to the patient. Given the medication that is dispensed in these institutions it would be a good idea to specify that those concerned should be qualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator's concerns that staff serving in approved centres should be suitably qualified.

In the present context I must reluctantly decline to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 80:</P>
      <P>In page 48, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>g</i>)prescribe requirements as to the need for clinical diagnosis prior to administration of medicines and measures to be taken to avoid the over-prescription of medicines, or their prescription for improper purposes,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One would hope in terms of best practice that a clinical diagnosis would be made prior to the administration of medicines and that measures would be taken to avoid the over-prescription of medicines. The Minister will be aware that many of us have been approached by patients and their relatives regarding what they felt was over-medication and polypharmacy. This is the background to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that regulations should be made to prevent the over-prescription of medications or their prescription for improper purposes. I am advised that there is no precedent for such detailed intervention in any area of medicine by means of regulations or otherwise. It would be difficult to define <Col N="225" /> improper purposes or over-prescription where medicines are concerned.</P>
      <P>Safeguards in this regard are already in place through the professional qualifications and standards set down by the regulatory bodies of the various professions such as the Medical Council of Ireland, An Bord Altranais and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. Doctors, nurses and pharmacists have their respective roles in the interest of treating and protecting the patients under their care. They work together to ensure the optimum outcome for their patients. Furthermore, I am advised by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals that accurate, clinical diagnosis is a complex process and it is only arrived at after a period of observation and the taking into account of historical information from the patient or third party sources.</P>
      <P>Persons presenting to acute in-patient care, particularly those coming to care for the first time, do so because of symptoms which are subjectively very upsetting or socially disruptive. Such symptoms include severe depression or hallucinatory experiences, both of which may arise from a number of different clinical entities whose diagnosis may take some time to become evident. To withhold medication or other appropriate treatment until such a diagnosis is made, as suggested in the amendment, would be neither clinically nor ethically justifiable. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 81:</P>
      <P>In page 48, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Without prejudice to the generality of<i> subsections (1)</i> and<i> (2)</i> regulations under this section shall ensure that children, adults, the elderly and adults who are severely disturbed are provided with separate and appropriate accommodation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We dealt with this aspect earlier. Senator Jackman and I believe that children, adults, the elderly and those who are severely disruptive should have separate accommodation. While Senator Glynn cannot say it, I am sure he would give a sympathetic response, particularly to patients who are severely disruptive. It is difficult to run a psychiatric institution when there is a <i>mélange </i>of patients. It would be wiser to insist in the legislation that there must be separate accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. This aspect has arisen throughout the debate and it is an essential element. Perhaps the Minister will respond to it on Report Stage and give a firm time commitment in the context of when it will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of accommodation which is appropriate to patients who use it is a <Col N="226" /> function of the service providers. Under the terms of the Bill, they will be subject to regulation and regular inspection by the Inspector of Mental Health Services. The reports of the inspections will be sent to the commission and, ultimately, to the Minister and laid before the Oireachtas. Provision for funding to improve facilities or to provide them where they are not available is a matter for the Minister, the Government of the day and the Oireachtas. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 50, line 13, after &ldquo;trial&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless it is deemed by the consultant psychiatrist in charge of the patient to be of therapeutic benefit to the patient and consent is given by the patient's next-of-kin.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was prompted by my informants on the Law Society's law reform committee. I understand why the section is framed in such a way, but the purpose of the amendment is to prevent patients being put on major clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies for something that has nothing to do with their condition. However, at the same time, some people may have refractory conditions, such as profound depression, who might benefit from a new drug, but the Bill does not allow it to be tried on patients.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe recommendations state that clinical trials of products or therapies not having a psychotherapeutic purpose on detained mental patients should be forbidden. However, it does not state that they should be forbidden if they think they are for therapeutic purposes and may benefit the patient. In this day of evidence based medicine, we cannot simply say we think, for example, that Prozac is making a patient a little better. We must be able to compare what it is doing. In trying to protect the patient under this section, we may be inadvertently disadvantaging him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem is that one would be unable to run a clinical trial which involved, for example, the administration of an anti-depressant with cognitive psychotherapy in comparison to cognitive psychotherapy without the use of an anti-depressant although it may be of great clinical benefit to the patient. As I pointed out on Second Stage, my secretary, Enda Dowling, brought an article to my attention about the use of fish oils in the treatment of schizophrenia. The University of Sheffield carried out a survey which showed a 25% improvement among those given fish oils compared to a placebo. Nobody would agree that involuntarily admitted patients should be <Col N="227" /> deprived of fish oils if they might be to their benefit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. I understand why the section is included and I applaud the reasons for it. We do not want people to be used against their will. However, at the same time, we do not want to inadvertently disadvantage patients more than any other members of the community. Their illness may be so profound that we may not be in a position to compare other groups who are not involuntary patients. As Senator Glynn and the Minister will be aware, some of these patients are very seriously ill and everything possible should be done to help alleviate their conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate Senator Henry's concern about medical research, the public misgivings about the conduct of clinical trials in psychiatric hospitals are such that this is the most appropriate provision to insert in the Bill at this time. As has been stated, only approximately 10% of patients in psychiatric hospitals are involuntarily detained. The remaining 90% will be available to participate in clinical trials subject to the provisions of the Control of Clinical Trials Act. I have great sympathy with the Senator's position, but we must be open and transparent. Many people are worried about patients who are involuntarily detained with regard to clinical trials.</P>

      <P>In page 51, subsection (2), line 42, to delete &ldquo;12 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 years unless the person was a child at the time of the offence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How would this provision stand up in view of the Sophia McColgan case? In that case, as she was <Col N="228" /> a child and under the duress of her father who sexually abused her, a considerable length of time had elapsed after the offences had occurred. However, she was allowed to take a case. Surely the same should happen with people who have been involuntarily committed. Twelve months is very short and it should be three years for an adult and if the person was a child at the time of the offence, it should be three years after they reached adulthood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to propose that summary proceedings for an offence committed under this legislation may be instituted within three years of the date of the offence. The 12 months time frame which is included in this section is the norm for summary offences. I see no reason for changing it in this particular provision.
