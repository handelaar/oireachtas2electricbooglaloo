      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to review aid to Uganda in light of the abuses of democracy in the recent elections there.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish a task force for Tipperary town in view of the lack of industrial development there.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Social Welfare Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, earlier signature motion, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 20, motion No. 27, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes as a surprise that we are taking all Stages of the Social Welfare Bill today. I understood that we were to take Committee Stage. Perhaps the Leader will clarify that.</P>
      <P>On other business, on the last occasion on which we met I asked for an early debate on Northern Ireland. I believe now more than ever that we should have such a debate. There is no impending or immediate crisis there, but there is effectively a stalemate and a debate would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Leader if we can have a debate within the next two days on the current teachers' dispute. Such a debate might not be helpful if we <Col N="1070" /> were in the middle of delicate negotiations, but clearly there are no negotiations at present. There is an impasse. This is a matter of huge public concern which is being discussed throughout the country and there is an enormous level of frustration. Members on all sides of the House have strong views on the matter and would like an opportunity to air them in this House. I ask, therefore, for a debate on the current dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously asked that time be allocated for a debate on the economic climate. The House should carefully note the series of job losses in the IT sector during the past two months and the lay-off of 1,400 workers in Intel, which has had a significant impact on the economy. The two year low in the Nasdaq and the New York market and the downturn in the American economy will affect our economy. I would like the Minister for Finance to tell us how he sees us being guided through this downturn and his policies over the next 18 months to sustain growth. Ireland is fourth in line in terms of European inflation and it is important that we recognise this in the context of a recent discussion.</P>
      <P>I also seek a debate on developments in the corner of the world between Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia, where we are seeing a re-run of what happened 18 months ago 100 miles north. It is hugely important that Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, takes a serious interest in what is happening there. It would be useful to have a debate at this time to allow the Minister for Foreign Affairs put forward the Government's view on the matter and the direction we will push.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also seek clarification on the Social Welfare Bill. I understood that Committee Stage only was being taken today. I am opposed to the taking of all Stages of the Bill today. On item 2, why is a motion for early signature required for the Social Welfare Bill?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader tell the House what has happened to the electoral Bill, which we were told would be introduced the week after St. Patrick's Day? Given the importance of the Bill and the degree to which it has been discussed in the media and the public arena, I would like the Leader to give a commitment that it will be taken next week.</P>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Manning's call for a debate on the teachers' dispute. The last time the House sat was prior to the Labour Court recommendation. At that time we thought we would know how the wind was blowing, but we now find that the Labour Court recommendation put nothing else on the table. The situation seems to be as entrenched as ever. I would like the Minister to come into the House and explain benchmarking to me. I was flabbergasted to hear Senator O'Toole describe benchmarking as a trip to the ATM, the hole in the wall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like daylight robbery and I thought benchmarking was a more complex issue. I would like to know if the Minister for Education and Science shares Senator O'Toole's view. This is a serious issue and we have reached the stage where the oral and practical examinations are gone by the wayside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to find a formula to resolve the dispute. The megaphone diplomacy taking place between the Minister, the Taoiseach and the union is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a full debate now. Previously it was urged that we should not have a debate as the discussions were at a sensitive stage. They are not sensitive any longer &ndash; or they are sensitive if one&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had an opportunity to have a debate up to now. It is 12 months since this dispute started and I want to underline that two days will be lost this week and three days will be lost next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to agree to allocate time for a debate. If he gives us some commitment in this regard, we will not oppose the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House will compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Department on the important measures taken in recent weeks to prevent foot and mouth disease from entering this country. We hope those measures will continue to be successful in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he continues those measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly people here generally appreciate that the Minister and his officials have <Col N="1072" /> done an excellent job, particularly when compared to what has happened with our neighbours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indeed. Will the Leader arrange for a debate on banking and the provision of banking services? I called for this debate some weeks ago. It is opportune to have such a debate given that a large number of the commercial banks are abandoning small towns and villages and closing down their outlets there. There is an opportunity now for the post offices&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could have supported our Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That was defective legislation. There is an opportunity for post offices and credit unions to come forward and fill the void. A debate in this House would allow us to expand on that. I ask the Leader to afford us the opportunity of that debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Manning and Costello in calling for a debate on the ASTI strike. An issue touched on by Senator Costello which is worthy of airing is benchmarking. There is confusion among teachers and everybody else with regard to what is meant by benchmarking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never obstructive or long-winded in this House. The confusion on this issue is whether it is a measure against the private sector, the public sector or the individual teacher. Clarification on that issue is needed and it would clear the air.</P>
      <P>The other issue I wish to raise is in regard to the local government Bill. We have been promised time and again by the Leader of the House that this issue would be dealt with by April. It will soon be April and no progress has been made on this Bill apart from Second Stage being taken in the Lower House &ndash; I notice it has been taken off the Order Paper there. Will the Leader assure the House that this Bill will be dealt with? We on this side tried to be helpful in every way, including proposing a Bill, only to find we are debarred from it because there is a financial implication. There are many people who are waiting for this Bill to be passed and the Leader should come forward and tell us what is holding it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House and explain why there was no ministerial presence at the EU meeting in Brussels last Monday on human trafficking? I know we were well represented by our ambassador, Ambassador O'Leary, but given the seriousness of the problem &ndash; I believe that the Minister is bringing forward legislation &ndash; it is extraordinary that no <Col N="1073" /> one from the Government could be found to attend that very important meeting. I gather that the financial gains from trafficking people into the EU are greater than from trafficking drugs, and we all know how much money is made from drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support the call by Senators Manning and Costello for a debate on the teachers' dispute, as an ASTI member I have been raising the issue for the past 12 months and I do not have the patience for a debate. I do not think we will have such a debate. I suggest to the Leader that he ask the Minister for Education and Science or the Taoiseach &ndash; the Minister for Education and Science probably will not respond &ndash; to consider the possibility of getting Kieran Mulvey, former ASTI general secretary, to intervene. There are ways and means if people want to solve disputes&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters which can be dealt with much more appropriately in the debate that is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate will not take place. I have been asking for it for the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not know that and I do not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not taken place in the past 12 months and my patience has run out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A request has been made to the Leader for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that Kieran Mulvey intervene because he would understand both sides well from his experience as chairperson of the Labour Relations Commission and former General Secretary of the ASTI. He may be the only person who can resolve this dispute because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science do not seem to be able to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>They should go to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request that we take only Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill today &ndash; I assumed we would take only Committee Stage. A number of amendments have been tabled to the Bill and it seems wrong that the House should debate all Stages of a Bill in one day, except in urgent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the nation as a whole on combating the foot and mouth disease. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come to the House to ensure that we make it clear, particularly to potential tourists, that they can visit Ireland? It is possible to maintain the tourism industry while also maintaining the controls put in place to which we have strictly adhered in the past few weeks. It is possible to <Col N="1074" /> do both but this is not being said. Some of the messages going across the Atlantic are to the effect that Ireland is a no-go area. Let us ensure this does not happen and the Minister should come into the House to outline how we can get the balance right.</P>
    <P>There are 285 days to go before the introduction of the euro. I previously asked for a debate on this issue but it seems that as each week goes by we hear that the country is ill-prepared for the changeover to the euro. With 285 days to go we should debate this issue immediately to remind ourselves of what has to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many definitions of what constitutes benchmarking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I always thought benchmarking was when one scraped one's name on one's desk with a protractor. I came into town today at 11.30 a.m. and witnessed what the television advertisement describes as &ldquo;total gridlock&rdquo;. What progress has been made on the upgrading of the Arrow line for the misfortunate people of Clondalkin and Lucan? This upgrading is to take place but I was disappointed to hear that the date for completion of the work has been put back. We must avoid ending up with anarchy on the streets. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come into the House to give us hope that this ridiculous situation will end soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>If, by some miracle, we have a debate on education, will the Leader ask the Minister to focus on the issue of children with special needs who are concerned about examinations? Will the Leader also inquire as to whether the oral examinations will go ahead? Many people have asked this question, to which there seems to be no answer.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a general debate on the needs of children? Such a debate is necessary given reports that private firms are looking after children who should be in secure accommodation with proper back-up services. We should debate the inadequacy of services for these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is International Anti-racism Day. Will the Leader make time available today to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement of good intent and to outline Government policy on this issue? Perhaps the Minister might also explain why he, or someone deputising for him, did not attend the EU Council of Ministers meeting on trafficking in humans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the comments of Senators on the teachers' dispute. This is a serious matter and it is time the House conveyed to the Taoiseach the urgent need for him to become involved in this <Col N="1075" /> issue to help resolve the matter before a major crisis occurs, particularly for students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I too express concern regarding the teachers' dispute. Both sides should try to find some way of resolving this matter. People must realise that the matter will not be resolved from entrenched positions.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Finneran, concerning the provision of banking and financial services in rural areas. We are in the process of adopting a national spatial policy, yet in introducing the recent financial regulatory legislation to deal with financial institutions, we find that the Central Bank plays a key role in examining financial services. It is within the remit of the Department of Finance to examine this aspect of the matter. It is time for the Government to address this need, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jackman and other speakers who have mentioned the secondary teachers' dispute. Whether one listens to teachers, pupils or parents, they all want those concerned to start talking. Seanad Éireann should send that message to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science who have a duty to govern and lead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point which I would like the Leader to relay to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Yesterday, in Britain, there was a higher number of new incidences of foot and mouth disease than on any other day during the current outbreak. People should remember that fact before they start talking about relaxing regulations or complimenting Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>

      <P>As regards the ongoing threat posed by foot and mouth disease, and particularly in view of the fact that yesterday saw the highest number of cases yet recorded in Britain &ndash; I think it was 47 &ndash; it is absolutely essential that vigilance should be maintained. The Leader should invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the House because urgent clarification is required concerning the Government's precise guidelines on domestic travel curbs. What is being done to monitor the controls that are supposedly in place? Tourism interests in County Kerry are very concerned and confused about <Col N="1077" /> these matters. I thought it was accepted that there was no restriction for people within the country who are not coming from or going to farms.</P>
      <P>On this and all related points, we need urgent clarification. I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to debate this matter and to outline the Government's position.</P>

Perhaps, as a good patriotic gesture, Fianna Fáil should call off its Árd-Fheis, because of the risk involved. Such a voluntary gesture would be in the spirit of this debate and would be in keeping with that party's portrayal of itself as not just a political party but a national movement.</P>

The EU has named our two largest cities as being among the greatest offenders in the matter of water pollution. We know that air quality is deteriorating. Yet, according to this week's issue of <i>The Economist</i>, Ireland is the fifth richest country in the OECD. It is time we had a serious debate on how we use our wealth.</P>

It also provides for compulsory purchase, even where railways are being privately developed. I find both of those concepts very interesting. The House deserves some notice of when that legislation will be taken. I hope the Leader can give me some information on that.</P>
      <P>I support all of my colleagues in calling for wise counsel and a sensible debate on the current crisis in education. It would be easier to resolve this if the Government, as the one lawbreaker in this situation, would restrain its vocabulary. Everybody else has been exercising their legal rights, however intemperately. The Government broke the law, and was found by the Data Commissioner to have done so. I hope he prosecutes.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Toole on showing great leadership by not calling for a debate on the teachers' dispute, which is unusual for him, and also for keeping the INTO out of this dispute, which is causing so much grief elsewhere. I think we should have a debate on the teachers' dispute. It would be appalling if we could not have such a debate on a day when the pupils, who are prisoners of this dispute, are marching the streets. I add my voice to those who want that debate.</P>
      <P>I particularly support Senator O'Toole's comments in relation to the economy and I ask the Leader for an assurance that we will have a debate. It would be timely if the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance came before the House to inform Members of the preparations being made for the next year in the event of a serious recession hitting the United States economy and, thus, affecting the Irish economy. There is no doubt that our booming economy is under serious threat and it is time the House debated the matter.</P>

      <P>We most certainly have not. I support Senator Joe Doyle's call for Mrs. Robinson to address the House. She has done credit to this House and the country in general. The most important work she has done to date was during her service as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mrs. Robinson has exposed the fact that her office at the UN was underfunded. I hope she will live up to her promise of continuing her interest in human rights.</P>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on the traffic problem. Senator Ryan pointed out that No. 7 on the Order Paper relates to railway infrastructure. If such a debate is arranged, the Minister would have the opportunity to provide an update on the metro or underground section of the Luas which was fought for and won in this House.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that this is anti-racism day, will the Leader communicate to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, our congratulations for his clear, unambiguous and forthright statement on this issue in today's newspapers? Commentators have been calling on politicians to take a lead in this area and the Taoiseach was successful in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also congratulate the Taoiseach on his brilliant speech at the launch of the <i>mv Ulysses</i> where he demonstrated that the novel <i>Ulysses</i> is about <Col N="1079" /> an Irishman who is accused of being a politician, devious, cute and scheming, but who, in the end, is discovered to be a visionary. The <i>mv Ulysses</i>, which the House should salute, is the largest car ferry in the world and it will go part of the way to solving some of our immediate tourism problems because it will transport two million cars into this country each year. This is a development of which the Irish can be proud.</P>

      <Col N="1080" /> I welcome Senator Manning's request for a debate on Northern Ireland. I will try to make time available for this within the coming week.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and Ross called for a debate on the economy. As the House knows, the Minister for Finance will be in the House next week for two days with the Finance Bill. That might present an opportunity on Second Stage to discuss that matter in the short term. In the longer term I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate on the economy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the events taking place in Macedonia. I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will allocate time for a debate with the Minister present in the House. In relation to Senator Costello's question on the electoral Bill, I will come back to the Senator on the up to date timing of that Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Finneran and Chambers called for a debate on banking, in particular the changing trends in banking where there will be an opportunity for post offices, credit unions and all other financial establishments to assist communities not only in rural Ireland but also in the bigger towns and cities. The proposal to have a debate on banking is worthwhile and I will agree to have that in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan called for a timescale in regard to the Local Government Bill. Second Stage of the Local Government Bill is now in the Dáil and it is the Government's intention that the Bill will be through both Houses by the summer recess. I will pass on Senator Henry's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come to the House for a debate on the effect of the foot and mouth problem on tourism. I congratulate Senator Quinn on the major efforts he made over the St. Patrick's weekend and all that he has done for tourism in the capital city. I congratulate also everyone who came here for the St. Patrick's weekend for the various events that had to be scheduled over a five day period. That was fantastic and it is people like Senator Quinn, and the spirit in which his committee has worked, that will keep tourism alive over this difficult time. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation will meet tomorrow morning with everyone involved in the industry. I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate at the earliest possible time, perhaps next week, with the agreement of the Whips.</P>
    <P>Senators Ridge, Ryan and Norris called for a debate on transport, progress under the national development plan and the way the various schemes are being put in place. Now that the money has been allocated, this is a worthwhile opportunity to have a review after 12 months and I will allow time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh called for a debate on the needs of children. I will allocate time for that debate also. I will pass Senator Taylor-Quinn's views on <Col N="1081" /> to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senators Finneran, Chambers, Tom Hayes and Coghlan expressed views about the foot and mouth crisis. The spread of that disease is our worst fear. People have been very responsible up to now but there is a long way to go. We can see on our television screens every night the horror that is being experienced. It is unbelievable how an economy and a whole community can be brought to its knees in a matter of hours by this plague. I congratulate the press, television, the media generally and everyone concerned who are playing their part. I agree with the sentiments expressed by many senior figures in the Seanad today and those who are experienced in the field of agriculture that under no circumstances can we relax in terms of the terrible threat facing our shores. If a debate is necessary, I will certainly allocate time for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on the quality of life. I have no difficulty with that. Many debates have been called for and perhaps after the Order of Business the Leaders can agree to <Col N="1082" /> sit on a number of Fridays to facilitate the requests being made here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, issue a statement to both Houses of the Oireachtas, at intervals not exceeding two months duration, on the latest statistical information on the effects of inflation on the measures contained in Parts 2, 3 and 4 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> I welcome the Minister and I am sure he missed me the last time. He will be pleased to hear that he will get two for the price of one because my esteemed colleague will be joining me shortly.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new subsection. It is self-explanatory inasmuch as inflation affects every section of this Bill. This section is very important and it would behove the Minister to present such a report on the measures contained in Parts 2, 3 and 4. I will not waffle on. As I have an extremely heavy cold I will not be speaking very much. However, I will try to make as big a contribution as I can. I will not say anything more on it at the moment because my colleagues in the Labour Party have a similar motion and I may come back in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was widely reported last year that when inflation took its fairly horrendous jump, the Minister sought and was refused a supplementary budget to compensate social welfare recipients for what for them must have been a fairly harrowing drop in their living standards. Given the degree to which people on social welfare are forced by the limited nature of our social assistance and social insurance schemes to live a hand to mouth existence, any change in their budgetary position is quite traumatic for them. The rest of us can afford to dispense with luxuries. In the case of people on social welfare it means leaving a gap in necessities.</P>
      <P>In my view and that of my party, a report such as this would strengthen the Minister's hand in his argument with the less than sympathetic Minister for Finance about the level of funding needed. I therefore ask the Minister at least to address the issue. It would be naïve of me to assume that he will start accepting amendments at this stage but there are issues he can address either in the future or, if he really wants to be radical, now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for putting down this amendment and I guarantee that my Department and I keep a constant eye on the inflation rate. The CPI which comes out every month is an excellent production and when we frame our budget each year we do so on the basis of a projected figure for inflation for the subsequent 12 months as set down by the Department of Finance, which takes into account a myriad of things.</P>
      <P>The expected rate of inflation for this year was 4.5% and last year's was 3%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was wrong. The previous year it was 2% and, equally, it was wrong in that the outturn for inflation was 1.6%, so people gained from a much lower figure than was anticipated. Senator Ryan and some of his colleagues in the <Col N="1084" /> other House referred to reports in the press and to him I say, do not always believe what you read in the paper.</P>

      <P>The Government looked at the issue of inflation, in relation to social welfare recipients and those in paid employment, on a constant basis &ndash; in the latter half of last year it did so on a weekly basis. The Government increased the Christmas bonus from 70% to 100% and it was made clear that it was not done to compensate for the rise in inflation but because a healthier economy meant for the first time the bonus could be increased by that much.</P>
      <P>We also stated at that time, and I stated on many occasions in the Dáil on Question Time, both orally and in written answers, that in the context of framing the forthcoming budget we would take into account the issue of inflation and compensation, and we did so. The expected rate of inflation for 2001 is 4.5% and the weekly rates of social welfare as announced in the budget of last year, and provided for in this Bill, are between 9% and 14.5%. Thus, there are real increases of 4.3% and 9.6% based on the expected rate. In addition, payments to couples are being increased by 7.2% and 11.2% in real terms.</P>
      <P>Since this Government took office it has absolutely adhered to the commitment to increase social welfare payments in real terms. We have done that particularly for pensioners over the age of 66 who have received total increases of between 36% and 41.5%, which represent a real increase of 19% and 24%. Increases generally would be the same, though probably not as stark.</P>
      <P>There is no point to this amendment as my Department monitors the rate of inflation and when we frame the budget we take into account the difference between the expected rate of inflation and the outturn the previous year. I invite Senators who may be on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs to avail of the opportunity to raise the issue of inflation there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was rather long-winded. The essential point being made here is that in recent years the rate of inflation forecast at budget time has been wrong. Last year it was estimated at around 4% but it wound up at closer to 7%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point is that social welfare recipients could incur a loss in real income of up to 2% as a result of inflation out<Col N="1085" /> stripping the forecast rate. Expenditure on social welfare has fallen from close to 10% of GDP three, four and five years ago, to 5%, a point made by Senator Ryan and me on Second Stage of this Bill. Those in receipt of social welfare are getting a smaller slice of the growing cake of this economy. The Government may say that the cost of social welfare has gone down as there are fewer people unemployed, but that is not the way to look at it. The reality is that the Government is spending less money and people are being cheated. When the economy grows, by the rules of natural justice, everybody is entitled to a share of that increased wealth, but unfortunately people who find themselves on social welfare are losing out as the Government diverts less of the available resources in that direction. That further reinforces the point of this amendment which seeks to protect people from the effects of inflation. We simply ask that the Minister monitor the rate of inflation during the year and if he finds that the forecast is 1% or 2% out, his Department has a duty to find a compensatory amount of money at that stage in the year to allow people to keep up with increases in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for the differing commencement dates of social welfare payment increases.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister comment on this. Bearing in mind our experience just before this debate commenced, I am not very hopeful of having amendments accepted by the Minister but I ask him to listen to the arguments made so that in the future he might be minded to change his tack in relation to points raised. It is very useful to listen to the experience of people who, in their weekly clinics, hear about the real difficulties people experience.</P>

      <P>One only has to look at the figures and the dates to see that commencement dates have changed since this Government took office. Child benefit, which was paid in September, is this year to be paid in June. Social welfare payments which used to be paid in June are now being paid in April and the Government has promised that they will be brought forward in line with the tax year. If this amendment had been put forward four years ago, I would accept it, but at this stage we are probably dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>As ever, my esteemed colleague, Senator Leonard, is a great defender of the Minister. That is her job. I would be very interested in hearing at what stage all payments will be made at the same time, particularly in the context of the changes in the tax year. I welcome the fact that the Minister has rowed back very considerably on what were exceedingly long delays, with some people being paid in April, some in June or July and some having to wait until September. There is good news on the disbursement of largesse, but it would be very suitable if all the payments could be made at the same time rather than making sections of the community, often the most vulnerable, wait. Being totally practical, I would imagine this will probably take place immediately prior to the next election which will probably be in the autumn. I do not mind when it happens if it can be given a rationale from the point of view of the Minister agreeing that, in future, increases in benefits of any kind will all be paid on a given date with no first or last in the queue for lawful payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two issues here. Because there are 900,000 people who get paid on a weekly basis, not all the schemes are paid on exactly the same date. Some are paid in arrears and some in advance. That is not what Senators are referring to. The previous Government brought the budget back from February to early December. That meant that the changes in social welfare were even further divorced from the budget day announcement, being announced in the first week in December but not kicking in until the second week of June. We undertook to bring these payments back progressively over a number of years. This year is the first in which social welfare payments will be paid at the same time as tax increases on 5 April. We were criticised because some people got the benefit of tax changes on 5 April while other people did not get their social welfare payments until later, which was not fair. We have dealt with that. We are making the changes effective from 1 January next year, both in relation to tax and to social welfare payments, by bringing them forward by three months in one fell swoop. If my memory serves me correctly, that will cost about £85 million, and perhaps as much as £105 million, because of the increases in this year's budget. Let me put that into perspective. The increases granted in the 1997 budget were paid for 29 weeks in that year. We increased that by two weeks the following year and, two years later, we increased it by four weeks to 35 weeks. This year we are increasing it by another four weeks to 39 weeks, and as of 1 January in the coming year they will be paid for 52 weeks of the year. I would like to think the Senators would <Col N="1087" /> compliment this excellent Government on that achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of closing the differential between the rates of periodic benefit and assistance paid to an adult dependant and the rates paid to a qualifying adult, and of removing any limitation of the amount of payment made to a couple as opposed to a corresponding payment to two adults who are not living together.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government has again made noises about using the dreaded word &ldquo;individualisation&rdquo;. However, it is time we recognised that the myth that two people can live more cheaply than one is precisely that, that the distinction between qualifying people and adult dependants is wrong in principle, and that the terminology is quite invidious. Our amendment seeks that information be provided on the implications of closing that differential and that the Government recognise the anomaly of paying the full rate of benefit individually to two adults who live apart and do not cohabit while, in respect of adults who choose to live together, for reasons of company and all the other reasons human beings tend to live together, there is a financial penalty because one may become a dependant.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explore this because what we need to look at here are not percentages. To cheer him up a little, I concede that the percentages are impressive. However, given the state of the public finances, any Government could have got this far. The real issue is how far we could go with the resources we have, not what is being done. It would be interesting to get a report from this Department on the implications of closing these differentials. That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>The question of the qualified adult allowance has been an issue for some time. Based on research carried out by the ESRI, a <Col N="1088" /> working group which looked at this issue not so long ago suggested that the qualified adult allowance should be increased from an average of about 60% to 70%. The Government has given a commitment to do this over three budgets and has already started in the last two budgets by increasing it to 70%. This was also discussed at great length in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Most Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would agree that we should be moving towards individual payments to people in their own right. That will occur over time, given that so many people are now part of the social insurance system. In the meantime, there are people who do not qualify for payments in their own right. The PPF looked at this but did not come up with any earth shattering recommendations. It was agreed that working groups would be established under the PPF to produce proposals to implement administrative individualisation. That is a nice way of saying that where £100 goes to, say, the husband, and £60 to the wife in one payment, they can just split it and get £80 each. However, that is not what the majority of us mean. The PPF proposed that we should produce proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance system. I referred to that earlier. The Government has gone even further than what was suggested in the PPF in respect of administrative individualisation in relation to qualified adults over 66.</P>
      <P>This is one of the reasons the Government took the fairly major decision in cases where both qualified adults are over 66 years to increase the woman's payment up to the full non-contributory pension rate. We started this year by giving a special increase way above what is normally the case, by giving £15 to the qualified adult. This means, in effect, that an old age couple, where both are over 66 years and one is receiving a payment in his own right and the other is not, will get an extra £25 per week from 5 April. This is a fairly major sum, given that a similar couple in the UK only get an extra £8 per week. A couple who both have a book in their own right &ndash; in other words, two pensioners over 66 years who are both entitled to a pension &ndash; will get a minimum of £20.</P>
      <P>We are moving in this direction and have given an undertaking in relation to those over 66 years. The issue of extending this to the under 66 categories is being examined under the PPF and we will return to it over the next year or two.</P>

      <P>I am a great believer in the use of simple words, but on the odd occasion a rollicking big one adds emphasis. I presume the Minister is working to ensure that we will not continue to rob Peter to pay Paul or to give with one hand and take back with another. I am interested to hear his comments on the amendment.</P>
      <P>The rental subsidy scheme is like an abcess which will, to put it crudely, shortly burst wide open into everyone's face because the cost of rented accommodation has gone through the roof, particularly in Dublin. I will not address this aspect, but I will address the payment of State money to, in many cases, unscrupulous landlords. I appreciate that the Department passes on the money to the health boards for disbursement but, given the vast amounts of money being disbursed, I query the system from beginning to end.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a local authority &ndash; I am happy to say that I am still a holder of the dreadful dual mandate &ndash; and people come to me for advice. What advice can I give a person, given that in most cases the landlord is not registered and is still in receipt of funding from the health board and the State is, in effect, paying one citizen to treat another vulnerable citizen in a deplorable manner? Will the Department reassess the system in its entirety as it is not the way to go about housing people in any reasonable way? There is no rent control in the private sector and the bill to the Department is escalating every year. I cannot see any value for money in the scheme for those who operate it and recipients. The only people who are gaining are in many cases unscrupulous landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, if only because it gives us an opportunity to refer to the appalling circumstances where people are chasing unhealthy accommodation where damp is running down the wall and fungus is growing. The conditions in such accommodation are disgusting. A few weeks ago I visited a woman in receipt of a rental subsidy who had to use a dehumidifier to take gallons of water out of the atmosphere. I accept that it is matter for the local authority to examine the property and say whether it is suitable, but this woman had nowhere else to go and she could not afford the high rents being demanded by other landlords. It is the responsibility of the Government and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to <Col N="1091" /> break the log-jam in relation to the provision of affordable public housing, a matter of concern to the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
      <P>The issue of rent control in the private sector must also be examined. To date it has basically been ignored and has not been made a priority. People are entitled to shelter. I am not talking about a tent in the middle of a field or accommodation with a roof and walls but no windows to prevent the rain from coming in. Rather I am talking about basic decent, dry and warm accommodation where people do not shiver from the cold. The Minister knows these problems exist. This is only one small way of acknowledging it and saying something can be done for those victims in society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators that there is a serious problem in relation to the rent subsidy scheme. Part of the problem is that while money is distributed from the Department, the responsibility is on health boards and local authorities. What is needed is a greater correlation of plans within local authorities and health boards to ensure the subsidy is distributed properly and to those most in need. If such strict regulations were to be imposed on landlords in regard to the quality of accommodation, which at times leaves much to be desired, people would be put out on the streets. Without wishing to take away the blame from the Department, the problem has to be addressed through the local authorities and health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and particularly the rental subsidy scheme for private accommodation which has become a necessity because of the absence of local authority housing and the increasing difficulties in procuring accommodation. The scale of the subsidy has to be increased. What is the basic income that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regards as untouchable in terms of rent payments? It used to insist that any income in excess of the supplementary welfare rate would have to be the contribution of the individual recipient towards the rent. At least that is how it used to be in the Southern Health Board area. Even if one had a social welfare income of, say, £95 per week, the only income the health board would leave one with is the £84.40 of the basic supplementary allowance and the balance would have to be one's contribution to the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big issue here. Does the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs believe people can live on what <i>The Irish Times</i> and most of our newspapers would regard as a good price for a meal for two? Does he really believe that anybody can live for a week on that amount? That is how we should look at this as a society. That health boards still say the basic reference point is the supplementary welfare allowance which means that one of the consequences of <Col N="1092" /> availing of the rent allowance is that one is catapulted back into a fundamental poverty stricken situation. I believe there is a possibility of sending guidelines. The income that should be regarded as untouchable ought to be what the Government regards as the target for all social welfare recipients in terms of its strategy and health boards should not expect people to pay out of their basic income towards the rent of their accommodation. The problem cannot be solved by subsidising people's accommodation and at the same time driving them back into the poverty we are trying to eliminate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments. This amendment relates to the clawback issue which has been exacerbated by the greater than normal increases in social welfare payments in recent years. The rent supplement was looked at recently in consultation with all the various groups involved &ndash; the health board officials and local authorities. The recommendation was that the scheme be taken over by local authorities so that, as Senators advocated, there would be a better connection between the payment of the rent allowance and delivery of the accommodation and also a better connection with the local authority on the basis of its duty to provide housing for those people.</P>
      <P>The report has been accepted and it is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The first year of a person's entitlement to rent allowance will be the responsibility of my Department but after 12 months it will become the responsibility of the local authority who will have to get funding from my Department to administer that scheme. The proposal to move the scheme out of my Department, which was welcomed by virtually every local authority, is caught by some difficult industrial relations issues because people in the health boards are on different scales from those in the local authorities. There are developments in that area and we are trying to bring the rent allowance into some better connection between local authorities and the delivery of housing accommodation needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation has been somewhat exacerbated by the greater than normal increases. Up to now pensioners who are on SWA rent or mortgage supplement did not get the benefit of the additional increase as it was automatically clawed back by way of reduction in the SWA supplement. As part of this year's budget, which is included in this Bill, I announced that the first £5 of these additional budget increases in social welfare pensions will be disregarded for rent and mortgage interest supplement. As a result, instead of a reduction of £2 per week in the rent and mortgage supplement, single pensioners will see an increase of £3 so that overall they will be £13 better off as opposed to £8 if there was a clawback. Instead of a reduction of £10 per week in the rent and mortgage supplement, pensioner <Col N="1093" /> couples will see a decrease of £5 per week, so that overall they will be £20 better off. All other payments &ndash; one parent family payments, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other schemes &ndash; are not affected by the issue of clawback. The rent and mortgage supplement will not be affected where the weekly payment rates are increased by £8 for a single person or £15 for a couple. It is an issue which caused some difficulty and we have endeavoured to address it in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue in relation to disability benefit and disablement benefit because this is the section that deals with increases in all these benefits. Disablement benefit is a payment made for an occupational injury. I have in mind, since I come from County Roscommon, people who worked in the coal mining industry. Most of these people because they suffer from pneumoconiosis, a miner's lung disease, are paid a certain amount of disablement benefit along with the disability benefit to which they are entitled. Miners in Ballingarry and Castlecomer are also affected. While the number involved is not great, it affects hundreds of people in those three locations. The disease has to be prescribed under regulations made in 1983. Not only do some of these suffer from miner's lung disease but they also suffer from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, all directly related, according to medical evidence, to the fact that they worked underground and inhaled coal dust or silica.</P>
      <P>Pneumoconiosis is the only prescribed disease for miners. However, miners also suffer from related diseases for which they receive no additional disability benefits. Such benefits are paid at a percentage related to the incapacity resulting from the disease. A review of prescribed diseases will take place under the Occupational Injuries (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations, 1983, and I urge the Minister to carefully examine these issues. He has inherited this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have attended appeals hearings with people who worked in the mining industry. The appeals officers were generally fair-minded and said they would like to help. They recognised that people had asthma or emphysema and that the medical evidence suggested that miners were suffering from miners' lung disease and related diseases. However, the legislation did not allow the officers to increase the level of disability benefits to take account of the incapacity suffered as a result of occupational injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister make an input into the review which is under way? I urge him or his officials to reflect the facts I have raised. The Minister and his predecessors inherited this situation as the <Col N="1094" /> matter has not been reviewed since 1983 which is a long time ago. Will the Minister examine this issue with as much sympathy as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue in the House and for raising it privately with my officials in advance which allowed us to look at the matter. The Senator is correct that a working group, headed by the Department's chief medical adviser, has been set up to examine the list of prescribed diseases and occupations outlined in the 1983 regulations. Bronchitis is not a prescribed disease under the regulations nor is mining a prescribed employment in respect of occupational asthma.</P>
      <P>The group will make recommendations on amendments, deletions or additions which could be made to the list and I assure the Senator that his concerns and the facts he outlined in at least one case he brought to our attention will be taken into account in the context of the review. I will keep a close eye on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to challenge society in general, but does the Minister think that £89 per week for a widow or widower is the sort of figure we should boast about? I would make this point no matter who was in Government but there is a need to lift our sights in terms of what constitutes the basic levels of income on which we expect people to live.</P>
      <P>Percentage increases conceal many things, and I do not mean deliberately. We should state that a payment of £89.10 per week for a widow or widower is not acceptable and that it is a national objective to achieve an acceptable level of basic income for everyone which is higher than the Government is giving people on unemployment benefit. What is the problem with doing so quickly?</P>
      <P>The country is awash with resources and the budget for unemployment benefit and assistance has been dramatically slashed. The Government thinks it achieved this on its own but we will not go off on that tangent. What are the political or other objections to the redistribution of those resources towards people, such as widows, whom we expect to live on £89.10 a week? I hope the Minister wishes to talk about this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to table silly motions about increasing payments as they will not be accepted. However, there is an issue of what we as a society regard as an acceptable income on which people should live. No one believes that £89 per week is acceptable any more than they believe that giving a widow or widower an additional £17 per week for a qualified child is a satisfactory figure. This is not a political issue but where are we, or the Government, going on this issue?</P>

The sad fact is that more than 20% of the population live below the 50% poverty line outlined in the national anti-poverty <Col N="1095" /> strategy. We must remember that those dealing on a daily basis with the effects of poverty, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, sought social welfare increases of £14 per week.</P>
      <P>Our amendments cannot place a charge on the Exchequer but it should be incumbent on the Government to try to ensure that the anti-poverty strategy's objectives are achieved within the lifetime of the Government. Does the Minister believe this will happen? Everyone welcomes the increases but when faced with the stark realities and when we know of the difficulties with accommodation, a fundamental issue is the achievement of equity. Will the Minister expand on his beliefs in this regard?</P>

      <P>There is no one better than I to give history lessons. Senator Ryan stated that percentages can disguise increases but I can quote him chapter and verse on this issue.</P>
      <P>This is the first Government to set down targets for social welfare payments. When the Government took office four years ago the old age pension was £78 per week and we gave a commitment to increase it to £100 per week over the five years of the Government's term. There is still one year to go in that period and it is at a level of £106. We will go further in the coming budget which will well exceed the prediction of £100 over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      <P>We also agreed with the social partners that the lowest rate of social welfare payment will be £100. The increases announced in this budget are well on the way to reaching that figure over the lifetime of the PPF. The increases in social welfare payments in recent years are well ahead of anything we could have expected a couple of years ago. Senators should remember what it was like four years ago when the increases given were very small in comparison to those now being given.</P>

      <P>No, let us be fair about this. The Government has managed the surplus extremely well in that it is providing for a rainy day. Of the surplus we have had over the last two years, we have already put £5 billion into a fund which will pay for the pensions of all of us in years to come <Col N="1096" /> when the State will not be able to afford those pensions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but it is the prudent thing to do. So this Government, which the Opposition says is awash with money, is providing for the future pensions of the country. It is not spending all the money but is keeping it for a rainy day. At the same time we are also providing increases in social welfare pensions which are well above the percentage increases in the rate of inflation over the period. I cited the figures earlier. We are looking after people today as well as potential future difficulties.</P>
      <P>About 10,000 single invalidity pensioners and those on other smaller schemes, under 66 years of age, will be receiving an extra £14 per week. Couples will receive between £20 and £25 per week. Those figures should be compared to what is being given across the water in Britain. There is a huge surplus there but it is not being spent on their people. The poor old age pensioner in Britain has to put up with a meagre £5 per week and only £3 next year while a couple will receive £8 as opposed to our £20 to £25.</P>
      <P>People appreciate that the increases we have given over the last four budgets have raised social welfare payments cumulatively. Despite what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and others might say, there is a genuine acceptance that the increases have been extremely generous and well received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To use a schoolboyish phrase, may I say that he started it? I agree with the Minister concerning my colleagues in the British Labour Party; they have been extraordinarily conservative in dealing with one of the biggest political issues. The state in which British pensioners were left by Thatcherism is a very sensitive issue and one on which British public opinion has strong views. The British Labour Party has been slow to do something fundamental about it. We agree on that. The figures suggest that, nominally, we are the fifth richest country in the world, although I do not think that is quite the case. We must look around us, not at Britain which seems to have walked away from social democracy, but at the civilised countries of northern Europe. We must examine the sort of incomes they give people, particularly the elderly. In spite of the gloom and doom warnings from the OECD, such countries still believe they can fund a generous system of support for their old people, even as their populations age a good deal more rapidly than ours.</P>
      <P>The Minister has half conceded my point, which is that many of these payments are objectively far too low. It is not a matter of considerable weight to me that the PPF picked £100 per week as a figure. Nobody can argue that an income of £100 per week is sufficient to give somebody a dignified life, yet our target should be a figure that can give somebody a dignified life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> The level of inequality in this State is horrendously excessive. We need to take action at both ends of the scale, by raising the income of those at the lower end and by using the income of those at the upper end to fund that. Inequality is not just a convenient sociological topic; it brings with it strains in society for which future generations will pay. I have absolutely no doubt about that. It is one of the functions of Government to reduce the level of inequality. The most civilised societies of northern Europe, in particular the Scandinavian countries, have dramatically lower levels of inequality than we do. Before somebody says that inequality is the price we pay for economic performance, let us not underestimate the economic achievements of those countries with all the extra social concerns that their Governments take into consideration.</P>
    <P>In 1999, Sweden was the most successful country in Europe at attracting direct foreign investment. It attracted investment equivalent to 25% of GDP. The way in which Sweden has targeted inequality as a social evil should make us ashamed. There is no correlation between our inequality and any of the other economic development objectives we seek. The Minister should address that point instead of addressing what should or could have been done four or five years ago. I do not understand why the Government believes it is necessary to phase in over a period of years the basic dignified income to which every citizen should be entitled. I could understand that approach being taken in times of budgetary stringency, but I cannot accept that the correct balance has been struck between prudence in dealing with the national debt and the medium-term concerns about our ageing population. We should not make provision for ourselves in future when it involves making inadequate provision for those who are currently poor. It could have been possible to do much more in the budget.</P>
    <P>Percentages cloak the fact that we are talking about increases that are no more than most of us would spend, without thinking, on a bottle of wine. That is the gap in society between us &ndash; and I include myself, other Senators and the Minister &ndash; and people who have to live on less than £90 per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not believe me, but I am trying not to be particularly political about this matter. The Bill has nearly passed all Stages and we are not going to change it now. We need to understand in greater depth what it is in the Government's philosophy that makes it necessary to phase in some of these increases. That is what I would like to know. I cannot understand why, because the country has considerable resources at its disposal. There would be few more popular issues than using some of those resources to ensure that nobody is expected to live on an income which we all recognise is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not labour the point with the Senator, other than to say that, cumulatively over the period of this Government, those people who are at the lower end of the scale have done measurably better than over previous periods. It may be said that is a result of the better resources which we now have. That is true, but one must compare the level of increases which have been given with the previous levels.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to social welfare as a percentage of our gross national product. The reality is, as I have said many times in the other House, that the best way out of poverty is by giving people employment. That is what this Government has succeeded in doing over the last four years. Because huge numbers of people have gone into jobs, not only are they not a burden on the State in terms of social welfare payments, but they are now contributing productively to the State.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point that percentages can tell one story or another. However, the reality is that the social welfare budget has increased from about £4.5 billion when I came to office to £6.2 billion this year. As a percentage, it has obviously fallen because national production has greatly increased. The Government stands on its record in this regard. We can discuss the issue of adequacy at another stage if that is permitted. This Bill relates to this year's increases, which must be seen in the context of this Government's full five year term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been boasting of the increases which the Government has given, but everything is relative. In real terms, this country is at least one quarter richer over the last five years since this Government came to office. We have enjoyed a net rate of economic growth greater than any of our European partners and this is seen as one of the best performances in the world. Every party in the House has contributed in some way to this achievement over a period of some 20 years. However, the fact is that people on social welfare are not 25% better off today than they were five years ago.</P>
      <P>I know we do not live in an ideal world but, in a just society, everybody should get their fair share of the cake. If those at work benefit by 25% over a period, then those relying on social welfare payments should also get a 25% increase. That was the general theme of Senator Ryan's comments and it is certainly my philosophy and that of my colleagues. It is not valid for the Minister to boast of the increases given over the last few years when, in fact, the amounts given were less than what was justified by the level of real net growth in the economy. That money was spent elsewhere. This Government had other priorities. Tax concessions were given to people on the higher rates, to an unprecedented level. In many cases, we are giving more money to people who are already better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The Minister has said, and of course it is the philosophy of his party, that we must encourage more people to work and that we must reward people in responsible positions, because they are the motors and drivers in the economy. That is the theory, though not everybody fully agrees with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>One can push that theory too far. It may be the philosophy of the Minister's party but those of the just society age in my party do not fully agree with it. We believe that provision has to be made for people who find themselves depending on social welfare, due to ill-health, unemployment or other reasons. I heard a debate on a radio programme last night on the introduction of social assistance for the first time by Lloyd George in 1909, when this enlightened thinking was met by benighted opposition, even as long ago as that. It is amazing that the ghosts of those arguments are still with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not go off on too many tangents, however much the Minister may tantalise us. Economic growth began before this Government came into office. Tax cuts the Government has introduced, particularly in the top rate, have absolutely nothing to do with the continuation of that growth. I defy the Minister to find anybody else who thinks that tax rates are too high, outside of the ideological ranks of Irish economists, who have had that view for the past 30 years. Even in the United States, where tax rates are half ours, economists still say they are too high. That is just the position of economists and it is also the position of our Department of Finance. I heard a senior official say that reducing tax is always a good thing in itself. That is a tangential argument.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands, which has an unemployment rate lower than the US and similar to ours, at about 3.9%, spends dramatically more than we do on social welfare, as a proportion of GDP. They are providing their old people with dignity and their children with a decent quality of life, while we are deciding otherwise. I do not just blame the Government, though I think they could be the leaders in this regard. They are followers and tokenists, rather than drivers towards equality.</P>
      <P>The real issue is whether we believe that inequality is a bad thing and that we should do our best to minimise it. Are we to be a country of ostentatious affluence and embarrassing poverty, or a country in which there is less of both, for the sake of everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not unduly concerned with amendments, as I do not believe in rehearsing issues which have been dealt with in the other House. There are philosophical issues which the Minister has not addressed. It is too trite to say that, because our unemployment fell, social welfare also fell as <Col N="1101" /> a percentage of GNP. Other European countries have similarly low levels of unemployment. The most appropriate example is the Netherlands, which has sustained much higher levels of social expenditure and has not got our level of child poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>The Dutch were being condemned to obscurity 20 years ago by economists, who even coined the phrase &ldquo;the Dutch disease&rdquo;. Despite what the economists said, a very compassionate society prevails there, which has managed to achieve lower levels of unemployment than the United States. What better performance can you get than a country which is growing, which has low unemployment, a balanced budget and provides a level of services that we do not even dream of? That is what we should aspire to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat what I said earlier. It has to be viewed in the context of what has been provided over the lifetime of this Government. I can only answer for my period in office and that of this Government. The Senator may be correct in saying that growth rates did not start with this Government. One must then ask what was the priority of the previous Government, who presided over a period when there was sizeable growth if, as claimed, it started before we came to office. What was the priority of each Government at a particular time? The previous Government decided to give £1.80 to old age pensioners. More importantly, however, it decided, as a matter of policy, that it would link social welfare increases for one year to the rate of inflation. When it has been in office, my party has &ndash; even during the bad times in the 1980s &ndash; endeavoured to give increases above the rate of inflation. I am not prepared to listen to lectures from Senators about my party's philosophy on catering for the needs of the less well off.</P>
      <P>In the not too distant past, the rate of unemployment in Sweden rose to 10% which prompted the Government of that country to adopt a policy of retrenchment with regard to its social spending. It was forced to do so because it could not afford to continue with its existing level of spending. The same happened in the Netherlands in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are rewarding people for their work while, at the same time, catering for those who cannot compete in the workplace. I refer here to old age pensioners, who have received massive increases. In fact, when one takes into account the various free schemes, etc., the level of those increases is probably the highest in Europe. A similar position obtains in respect of carers and those on disability payments, who have obtained more in terms of increases than their counterparts in <Col N="1102" /> other EU countries. We can debate this until midnight, but I stand on my record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to revisit matters that have already been discussed. However, the fact that section 5 deals with social assistance amplifies the point I have been making, namely, that the definition of the income on which we assume a destitute person can live is £84.40 per week. That is the rate of supplementary welfare allowance payable to a single person. As a society, we should be embarrassed about that and no amount of discussion about the level of increases given excuses that fact. One of the problems of society in this country is the refusal to raise the targets at which we aim. I accept that the Government of the country to which the Minister referred reduced its social spending. However, its system, which was then three times better, is still twice as good as that which obtains here. That country has a philosophical commitment to minimising inequality which Ireland lacks.</P>

It is only in recent years that matters have changed. That is why we are trying to catch up with other countries. I reiterate that my party's record, particularly in relation to the less well off in society, is second to none in the State. Any objective examination of the position will bear out what I am saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to restrain myself but the introduction of the adjective &ldquo;objective&rdquo; is far too provocative. I take it the Minister believes that Seán Healy, CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are not being objective when they state that there are problems with the Government's record? They state that things they thought could and should have been done were not done. CORI has actually indicated that it feels betrayed. I know that the Minister is not going to accept the validity of the criticisms put forward by Members of the Opposition. However, it is somewhat rich to state that there is some objective criterion of which the Minister is apparently aware but which the rest of us cannot find. The truth is that what could have been done was not done and what has been done is inadequate. Why is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that management of the national debt is important. However, someone took a decision that people on £84.40 per week <Col N="1103" /> should be obliged to wait at least another year before they are given their dignity. I do not know any objective commentator who believes that is a good idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>CORI and the other organisations were part of the PPF negotiations and they signed up to the agreement. The commitments in the PPF agreement are quite stark and it clearly states that the lowest rate of social welfare would reach, over the period of the three budgets to which the agreement applies, a figure of £100. We are well on the way to achieving that. The public statements issued by CORI subsequent to the signing of the PPF agreement are not factually correct. Other organisations that were involved in the negotiations objectively agree that what the Government has achieved in the first budget relating to the period to which the PPF relates more than fulfils the commitments it made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing a personal childcare payment of £20 per child per week.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government took into account the various discussions that have taken place during the past 12 months in relation to child care payments, child poverty and assisting families in meeting their child rearing costs. I have stated on numerous occasions that there are as many views on how to proceed in this regard as there are Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas. On many of the occasions when I met representatives of lobby groups, they left my office arguing among themselves with regard to how we should proceed. The Government has decided that over the next two years £1 billion will be invested in the child benefit scheme, which, in its view, is the fairest way of assisting families in meeting their child rearing costs.</P>
      <P>We have given a commitment that, in the next two years, there will be an increase in the rate of child benefit for each of the first two children of £25 per month and an increase of £30 per month for the third and subsequent children. A number of Senators and Deputies have inquired about the two rates of child benefit. Research carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and other groups suggests that larger families are more likely to be on or below the poverty line and, therefore, the second rate is geared towards these families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> We must put the increases in child benefit in context. I have no intention of making a political point&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it is important to place on record the fact that four years ago the increase given for each of the first two children was £1, while that applying to the third and subsequent children was £5. In addition, as a result of complaints, we have moved back from September to June the date from which these increases will be made. The cost involved in doing this will be substantial. We have also undertaken to consider the possibility of bringing forward further the date from which child benefit increases are payable as time progresses. That is the Government's position in respect of this issue.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a child care payment have been abroad for some time. The proposal in the amendment is along the lines of that put forward by a particular lobby group, but it does not include the proviso contained in that group's proposal that the payment should be taxed. For some reason, those who tabled the amendment did not adopt that approach. Perhaps it would not have been politically acceptable to do so.</P>
      <P>Last year there was a substantial increase of £105 million, or 25%, in child benefit. This represents an increase of £8 and £10 in the monthly rates, which was not a huge amount. However, in conjunction with the £25 and £30 per month increases this year and next year, we will reach a stage where the ultimate payment for each of the first two children will be approximately £117 per month and £145 for the third and subsequent children. There will, therefore, be a massive repayment.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on this because it was the fairest way in that the sum is tax free, it is money in the hand, mainly to the woman in the house, and it is paid to families irrespective of whether any of the family members work. All research has shown that it has a major effect on child poverty because it goes directly to the family as an untaxed payment.</P>

      <P>That is the truth. My personal position since I was elected to this House 20 years ago has been that child benefit should be dramatically increased far more than it has been and made taxable. I suspect I would lose that argument in the Labour Party but I have no intention at this stage in my political career of changing my mind. The Minister added to my knowledge by telling me who was the other member of the Labour Party who took a similar view. I had forgotten about that and I was delighted to know I was not alone on that issue. I do not want to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6 before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of bringing the child benefit for twins into line with the provision for multiple births of 3 or more children.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this matter but we recognise that people with triplets have additional difficulties and expenses. We suggest that as triplets are recognised, there should be some recognition that having twins is an additional problem. My late mother-in-law at one stage had six children under the age of six, including two pairs of twins, and I heard enough about the difficulties of that to have considerable sympathy with this amendment, apart from moving it.</P>

I remember seeing a film a long time ago called &ldquo;Three Into Two Won't Go&rdquo;, in which this matter was aptly demonstrated, although the film was not about twins. This is a small gesture to make and the lobbying for it has been consistent and extensive, and for persistence alone, Mrs. Hilliard in Lucan should run in the next local elections. I hope the Minister will accept that this is not an unjust or unreasonable request. A multiple birth is a multiple birth, whether it is two or four.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for tabling this amendment. I inherited a situation where multiple births were treated differently. My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Woods, gave an explicit commitment in our policy document prior to the last election that we would increase the child benefit for twins by 150%. That is what we did in my first budget &ndash; we did more because we changed the small grants that were made available previously to children of multiple births, particularly triple and other multiple births. I have made it clear over the intervening years that in my first Social Welfare Bill we complied fully with our pre-election promises but that it was an issue we would come back to over the lifetime of the Government. We had other commitments that we had to fulfil in our election manifestos.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated on Committee and Report Stages in the other House that this is an issue which needs to be addressed and it is something that will be on my agenda over the next year or so. I echo the sentiments expressed by Senators in relation to the persistence of Mairead Hilliard who has written to me on more than one occasion and also to members of my parliamentary party. I will give a commitment to the Seanad that this issue will be on my agenda over the next while.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the extent of child poverty and the feasibility in the context of the existing surplus funds within the Exchequer, of increas<Col N="1107" /> ing child benefit to £100 per month per child.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving a commitment in relation to the previous amendment.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is an important issue. To refer to the figures alluded to on Second Stage, 25% of children are living in poverty. We already talked about those people who are living below the poverty line, as described by the anti-poverty strategy committee. We have to see child benefit as the best way of providing a basic income for those children. There is confusion from time to time about child benefit versus child care. Child care costs are a separate issue. We are talking about the costs of rearing a child. Were we to examine the figure of £100 per month per child we would be well on the way towards alleviating the problem of poverty. We are talking about caring for the most vulnerable people in society so I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I accept the argument that can be made in relation to the use of child benefit to address the problem of child poverty as opposed to the child care issue. The reality is that the Government had to examine all the difficult issues and we were keeping one eye closely on the issue of child poverty and all the research in that area. No more than Senator Ryan and others, I have been an unashamed proponent of the child benefit route in relation to assisting families with child rearing costs because it has the major effect of addressing the child poverty issue.</P>
      <P>Consistent poverty over a relatively short period has dropped significantly, as has child poverty. More needs to be done on child poverty. This is being looked at in the national anti-poverty strategy and the benchmarking working group set up under the PPF is looking at the adequacy of child payments. Obviously, the Government decision to put all its funding into the child benefit route second-guesses what will come out of the benchmarking group. Child poverty is an issue which is firmly on the Government's agenda.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue which is sometimes lost. The Minister is right in saying that child benefit is one of the most effective routes of dealing with child poverty. No one disputes that. The perception is that increasing child benefit is also the solution to the crisis in child care. Has the Government considered reminding employers that if they need an ever-increasing workforce, they have responsibilities towards family friendly provisions?</P>
      <P>My recollection is that every single proposal to increase parental leave or anything to do with looking after children produces a howl of protest from IBEC. It is time that it moved on and the Government could encourage it to move on, if it wants an increasing level of participation in the workforce by men and women. The price to be paid is to accept that employees have responsibilities towards their children just as much as to their employment. It simply cannot be dealt with by funding for child care, however generous. There must be an acceptance that a child may get sick. Even in the most perfect of social welfare systems, like in one of my beloved Nordic countries, there is no way of legislating for provision of support all the time. My three children grew up in a household where both parents went out to work virtually all the time. We had good child care, but a child minder cannot miraculously appear if a child gets sick at six o'clock in the morning and needs someone to look after him or her.</P>
      <P>We must arrive at a stage where, if social partnership means anything, there has to be a lot more than payment, although much payment is needed. Employers must accept that employees have a right and an obligation to look after their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator on this occasion. A number of changes to the taxation code were made to assist major employers, particularly in providing child care facilities on their premises. Even though the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made changes in the budget before last which did not entice them to do this, he made other changes which might have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another leg of the Government's assistance to families is the commitment in the national development plan to provide about £300 million over the period, with £104 million fast-tracked or front-loaded this year to bring up the supply of child care places. At the end of the day, this is the only way in which the cost of child care will decrease for families. All research shows this. As I said before, we are starting from a low base on child care. One thing sadly lacking is the availability of child care places. That is why the <Col N="1109" /> Government has provided this heavy investment, probably more than can be spent in this year, to increase the supply and, to assist on the demand side, it is giving money to families irrespective of the choices they make in relation to their working life.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of extending the social welfare free schemes to widows and widowers with dependent children and of raising the widowed parent grant to £2,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in the other House, representations from the Opposition and my own parliamentary party have been received about widows. We have looked high up and low down at what we could do. In one budget, we increased the bereavement grant from £100 to £500. In a subsequent budget we brought forward a widowed parent grant of £1,000 which means that a widow, or widower, with children on the death of a spouse gets £1,500.</P>
      <P>We looked at the issue of free schemes but all the advice we got, particularly from the review of them, was that they were generally designed for people over 66. If we changed the position for widows it would cause difficulties with knock-on demands, particularly from other single parent families. For those reasons, we returned to an original proposal, to bring widow's payments up to the level of old age pensions. For that reason, the Government is giving a special increase this year to widows of £12.90. This is the first step in bringing widow's payment up to the level of the old age pension. This is the fairest way to proceed. Over the years it has been argued that widows ought to be paid at the old age pension rate. The budget and this Social Welfare Bill have started this process by giving them the special increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having looked at all the issues, I ask the Senators to accept that it is not just a simple matter of allowing all widows to avail of free schemes. There are many knock-on effects which would cause difficulties in the entire social welfare system and would raise many anomalies. The <Col N="1110" /> fairest way is to increase the payments to the old age pension rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on amendment No. 22 but I support the thrust of the Labour Party's amendment also. We refer specifically to the free travel pass, free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance. The Minister referred to the widows and widowers who have no income except social welfare. They merit special attention. I am conscious of the difficulties involved. One could write a major thesis on the anomalies and difficulties that pertain on the social welfare system. The executive summaries of the reports from the Department are difficult enough. The finer detail is unbelievably impenetrable on occasion, but I appreciate that is the nature of the system, much of which is inherited.</P>
      <P>Perhaps a special reform committee could be established to work out a system to be applied on a yearly basis, and thus take care of some anomalies. I appreciate the Minister's positive comments in this regard and I hope he considers the difficulties of those who are widowed and find themselves on a limited income.</P>
      <P>There is no heating in this House or in the ante-room at the moment. If we were in school, we would be sent home, although I am not asking for that to happen. Something is wrong in this House when staff, civil servants and Members are expected to sit in the cold. I am prepared to sit it out, but I trust something will be done to avoid a recurrence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments, although I do not want to repeat what has been said. During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in previous years, I have said that widows are forgotten. I live in a rural area, where this phenomenon is most evident. Many widows live alone and depend on non-contributory widow's pensions, as their spouse may not have been in insurable employment, for example if he was a small farmer. The widow's source of income may be a farm which she is not very good at running, or the non-contributory widow's pension. She might not receive any fringe benefits like the living alone allowance, which is given to those over 65 or 66. It should be given to a widow living alone who is over 55.</P>
      <P>A particular form of poverty can be attached to such people, who may never have worked outside the home and who suddenly find themselves tragically widowed. The same is true of many widowers in the countryside, whose wives die and leave them with young families. Their only income is the widower's or survivor's pension. The fact that most of these people are under the age of 65 or 66 means that they are not eligible for these schemes as a special concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> The Minister's response today was positive. I have less experience of urban situations than rural ones. Widows often visit me at my clinic to talk about their low level of income, and there is nobody I understand better. It is clear that social welfare has only reached out to these people to the minimum degree, and I ask the Minister to look at this closely in future budgets. I do not know if he will have the opportunity, not that I wish him any ill.</P>
    <P>I believe that widows are being forgotten to a greater extent than any other category of people who depend on social welfare. They are not a large group numerically. The widow or widower living in a rural area, who depends solely on a non-contributory payment, should be particularly considered. They may have been self-employed and were not making or could not make a self-employed contribution. The Minister should believe me when I say that they now find themselves in a bind, a true poverty trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could continue with wish lists forever, but in a time of increased prosperity it is time to look at the number of units covered by the free electricity allowance. It worries old people, particularly in cold weather, that they will exceed dramatically their allowance. It is not a huge allowance, as 200 units per month is a small amount of electricity, which many of us would barely notice at the end of a bill. There is a case for looking at this, as it is one of the simplest and least risky ways for old people to keep themselves warm. It is available to them easily, as they can buy electric heaters cheaply if they are sure they will not have an enormous and horrendous electricity bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators and I accept Senator Ryan's point in relation to heating, which is why we extended the fuel allowance. It can be argued that we should have increased it by more than £5, but I share the view of the fuel schemes review. It is better to give people more money in their weekly payments for 52 weeks every year than to give a higher increase for a shorter period of 26, now 29, weeks. I am also conscious of the sudden death phenomenon, whereby April comes and people lose the additional free fuel allowance of £5. The effect would be even bigger if the drop was £10. The review of schemes in relation to free fuel suggested we would be better off giving higher general weekly increases.</P>

      <P>This amendment comes back to something I raised earlier about family-friendly work. Judging by the way international commentators look at us, we have achieved some of our prosperity because of the flexibility of labour in facilitating economic activity. Now that a level of prosperity has been achieved, we need to restore balance and give greater room for manoeuvre to those whose flexibility was a contributor to our prosperity. Women need such space when it comes to maternity leave. This amendment asks the Minister to look at the possibility of extended payment of maternity and adoptive benefit for women.</P>

      <P>As a result of my suggestion, the adoptive benefit payment and the period were increased. For some reason it was not part of the examination under the PPF. Senators will know that we have increased the level of payment and the number of paid and non-paid weeks. That was according to the agreement set down by the social partners. Senator Ryan is correct that some groups want more and some want less. The Minister for Finance and the Government have already indicated that the issue of paid parental leave will be addressed. However, it must be done in conjunction with the social partners and subject to their agreement.</P>
      <P>As regards the maternity and adoptive leave benefit, at my exhortation we endeavoured to introduce that earlier than was originally intended because representations were made by all sides of the House and by members of the public involved in this area. The original intention on budget day was that it would come into effect on 5 April. We introduced it as quickly as possible subject to various time limits set down by the leave legislation. The regulations were introduced immediately after the Christmas recess and passed by both Houses on 8 February. They came into force on 8 March, which was International Women's Day and a nice coincidence.</P>

      <P>In page 10, after line 42, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report detailing the implications of:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) extending maternity leave to 20 weeks, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) introducing paid paternal leave for 5 days.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are similarities between these two amendments. This amendment refers to paid paternal leave for five days and to the extension of maternity leave to 20 weeks. I welcome the fact that maternity and adoptive leave have been increased from 14 to 18 weeks. However, I would like a greater acknowledgment of life in our communities. There would not be anyone complaining about child care but for the fact that it has become an economic imperative. There are <Col N="1114" /> honourable exceptions in the Oireachtas and among voluntary pressure groups which have called for the extension of maternity leave and the introduction of paid paternal leave. We would not be having a debate on child care benefits and payments but for the fact that women are needed in the workplace and we must entice them back. Children are usually cared for by the mother. However, that is not the way all couples want society to develop. An increasing number of men are more than willing to accept responsibility for looking after young children.</P>
    <P>It is only a gesture to introduce paid paternal leave for five days. I do not accept the Minister's point that we must wait for the social partners to agree on this. It would not take much to contact a few bodies and find out that they would be only too delighted to agree to it. They might say they would like ten or 15 days, but they want an immediate response. We should acknowledge the role of parents. I am tired saying that children have parents, not just mothers. If the parents wish to accept the responsibilities which are rightly theirs, they should be encouraged to do so. Whatever about allowing unpaid parental leave, it is unrealistic to expect young people who are under severe pressure because of mortgages, etc., to take unpaid leave. It is fine if they choose to do so because they can afford it. I ask the Minister to examine this suggestion carefully and urgently. It is ridiculous to wait for a long discussion on this issue because people want an immediate response.</P>

      <P>As regards paid parental leave, the Government has already indicated that it wishes to progress this matter. Despite what the Senator said, we must do that in conjunction with the social partners as that is the commitment we made under the PPF. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a working group is due to be set up. He has sought nominations from various interested groups for the working group to carry out this review. It is expected the working group will commence its deliberations shortly. The question of paid parental leave will be examined in the context of that review.</P>
      <P>As regards the Senator's proposal to introduce paid paternal leave for five days, paid parental leave can be made in a number of ways. Employers, the social welfare system or a combination of both might be required to carry the can. If the five day proposal was introduced, it would have to be paid by the employers because it would be extremely cumbersome and difficult to set up a system under the social welfare system to pay five days. It would be better for the employer to continue paying people. Under existing legislation they are obliged to pay three days parental leave for urgent family reasons. However, the Government is committed to examining this issue and to bringing forward proposals in the context of the social partnership.</P>

      <P>The child care systems in some of the former repressed European countries and France, although not in Britain, were designed to support the mother and the family during the first year of a child's life. A number of years ago women who had babies stayed in hospital for almost a week which gave them time to recover their health. However, women now leave maternity hospitals after two or three days in a public hospital. They need the emotional and physical support of their partners.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why we need to set up further commissions and advisory bodies. I am beginning to wonder why we need a Legislature when outside commissions and bodies seem to run the country and we cannot move forward until we get an agreement. I do not see any need to seek an agreement to provide a simple and basic necessity, such as five days paternal leave and extending maternity leave to 20 weeks.</P>
      <P>We are probably so far behind because we were not industrialised and women did not work. That does not mean that we should not try to catch up as rapidly as we can. With the burgeoning costs of child care and the fact that it is quite difficult to secure an affordable and suitable place where a parent would be happy to leave their child, it is not excessive to give maternity leave of up to 20 weeks. I do not know who is on the commission or what advisory bodies are involved. However, I suggest that both adoptive mothers and mothers who have given birth be given 20 weeks, which in the European context is very small.</P>
      <P>All Governments and this one in particular should be far more family supportive. Earlier today, Senator Ryan called for a debate on the quality of life. The quality of life is deteriorating in many ways due to outside factors over which we have no control. In the case of helping parents of newborn children, their quality of life can be improved by agreeing to our amendment.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important amendments we have had. We have to show that the Tánaiste is incorrect when she says we are spiritually nearer to Boston than to Berlin. We really must look at this from a European point of view. As Senator Ridge said, even ten years ago when I worked in a maternity hospital, women stayed in hospital for perhaps five days after the birth of a child. Now they are generally out in three days and frequently in two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The early discharge from hospital is not the only problem. The extended family is no longer there to help the mothers. It would be very useful for a mother going home to perhaps another small child to know at least that there is adjacent help from her family. It is quite interesting to talk to some of the refugees who come here. After they have given birth, they are absolutely astonished by the lack of support women here have from their extended family. They expect women, as they would in their own country, to be able to <Col N="1116" /> go out to a cherishing nurturing family who would receive them with the precious child. Here a mother may frequently return to her home, which may be miles away from any member of her family and if her husband or partner does not work for a sympathetic employer they may be totally isolated.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is sympathetic to these ideas, but I suggest the matter is quite urgent. Every survey that he must have read shows the importance of the bonding of the young child with its parents. It is at this early stage that we must put money into our society rather than wasting it and having to put in extra money to solve problems later on. There are good reasons for the child as well as the mother and the father to have as generous an allowance as we can provide at this time.</P>
    <P>It is good that Senator Leonard is here. Family sizes are smaller so we will not constantly have to do this for families of six; it will be two to three children in general.</P>

      <P>From listening to the discussion, one would think that this has been a contentious issue among the public. I have many friends working in maternity hospitals who are women of child bearing age. They are very pleased with the changes in this year's budget and particularly with the extra month of unpaid leave. They recognise the value that is being placed on them as women who wish to return to the workplace and are appreciative of the changes that have taken place. The Minister has said that he will look at paid parental leave.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh mentioned that children have two parents. However in the context of the mothers, the women who are gaining from this budget are extremely appreciative. That needs to be recognised.</P>

      <P>While Senator Ridge may say we cannot set up more groups, the reality is that the changes in maternity benefit which are welcomed by people outside this House were agreed at partnership level because there are conflicting elements. The same is true of paid paternal leave. The Government will be pushing the issue of paid parental leave because we believe it is one that has to be tackled. We are starting from a low base and we are trying to catch up quickly with the paragons throughout northern Europe whose standards those with a social conscience would aspire to. It will take time and will need to be done on an incremental basis.</P>

      <P>There is a huge issue over maternal and paternal leave that goes well beyond childbirth. Is it entirely a coincidence that Europe in general has lower levels of teenage pregnancy, teenage abortion and marital breakdown than the United States?

This is not just about the immediate period around childbirth.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report considering the implications of:</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a)increasing the respite care grant to £1,000 to all carers including those who are excluded by virtue of a means test, and </P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b)removing the disqualification, whereby carers in receipt of social welfare payments are excluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance in special circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks information on the implications of increasing the respite care grant to £1,000 for all carers, including those who are currently excluded by virtue of a means test, and of removing the disqualification whereby carers in receipt of social welfare payments are excluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance in special circumstances.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's estimate, there are over 50,000 carers, 20,000 of whom are eligible to receive the carer's allowance. I spoke at length about the respite care grant on Second Stage. I mentioned that I have some degree of personal experience of this, and I do not propose to refer to that again. What we do know is that time and time again it is the carers, those looking after people on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, who have the burden, the stress and the strain of looking after relatives and who find it a really difficult task who, as it is said colloquially, are the first to go. I know of one Alzheimer's patient who was cared for as long as possible within his own home by his wife. They were not particularly elderly, and it makes it even more sad that somebody who for many years was in reasonably good physical shape was deteriorating mentally. We all know how difficult it can be to cope with the fact that the sufferer is not recognisable as the person to whom one grew so close over many years, and how difficult that is for the carer to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that bad cases make bad law, but these are real tragedies for the people involved. They have to cope with the tragedy of dealing with somebody who has a disability when they at times feel quite helpless themselves. Many people believe they are not doing nearly enough and that they should do more. Such people need the benefit of respite care. A sum of £1,000 might buy a short holiday, but it is necessary to ensure that the household is looked after in one's absence. It really would be a humanitarian gesture to extend the grant to that extent and include those who are currently excluded by virtue of a means test. In <Col N="1120" /> the vast majority of cases we are talking about people on low incomes who are, perhaps, just above the income limit, and they are scraping along as best they can. The supports within the community are not as good as they might be. These people need respite from a very difficult job, and they need to know that the people for whom they care will receive very good care in their absence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, emphasising the primacy of the consumers' need for food safety, calls on the Government to bring forward a radical re-evaluation of the management of food and environmental safety by the institutions of the State with a view to putting in place a single, integrated system of management in the consumers' interest.</P>
      <P>In a nutshell, we are demanding that the Government set up, independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, a Department of food headed by a Cabinet Minister with full and specific responsibility for the promotion of a good food policy. It is necessary to have such a Department in order to give due primacy to food quality and safety at this juncture and to promote, maintain and engender consumer confidence in food products. It is also necessary to protect the best interests of the thousands of workers employed in the food industry and to enable Ireland to enhance and sustain its fine reputation as a producer of good, clean, healthy and wholesome food.</P>
      <P>Consumer confidence in food quality and safety has been severely eroded in recent years. This is mainly due to the high profile scares arising from the outbreaks of BSE, E.coli and salmonella and the issues surrounding chemical residues, illegal growth promoters and the contamination of animal feed. The most recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease has compounded the problem and focused attention on what needs to be done.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that historically the primacy of the producer was paramount &ndash; to an extent, this served us well &ndash; and that we have had good and progressive Ministers for Agriculture in many ways, it is critically important at this juncture that we put in place a balancing Department which will resonate to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and which will guarantee food quality and safety. It is time for a cultural change with a much stronger focus on consumers' safety and interests. We must become much more consumer focused and cultivate a culture of food safety. To enable this to happen we need to have a specific Department which will develop a modern dynamic food policy and all that it entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Central to the success of an emerging policy is the establishment of traceability of all food, food ingredients and foodstuffs. To enable a system of traceability to be put in place and to be kept in place all sectors of the food chain from farm to fork should be licensed. A substantial investment must be made in research and development so that we can be kept abreast of developments in food and the new insights into food safety. We must also make a major investment in staff training to enable the objectives of the proposed Department to be fully realised.</P>
    <P>Food safety controls must be clearly defined in the modern context and communicated clearly to everybody directly involved in the food sector and all citizens. These controls must be stringently and consistently enforced. This did not happen in the past and it endangered much of what is essential to the well-being of the country. Farmers and the owners of meat processing factories must be subject to stringent controls. If they are found to be in breach of these controls severe penalties must be enforced and, if necessary, licences must be revoked on the spot. If we are to be serious about this issue and make what we are asking for happen we will have to be stringent about enforcement.</P>
    <P>We were not strong in terms of enforcement in the past and lessons were not learnt from what emerged during the beef tribunal hearings. We cannot allow this to happen again. The malpractice and culture of the blind eye and nod and wink must be eradicated forever from all elements of the food industry. Never again must a small group of cowboys be allowed to put at risk an important industry, the jobs of the people who work in it and the health of those who consume its product. This must be brought to a halt.</P>
    <P>In addition to producers, processors and retailers, consumers have an obligation in this area. They must be made realise they have a part to play in the integrated approach to the promotion of food safety. They must be responsible for the storage, handling and proper cooking of food. It is only in this way that there can be a coherent, top-down, bottom-up food policy covering all sectors of the food chain, including feed production, primary food production, food processing, transport and retail sale. The food production chain is becoming increasingly complex and this is why we cannot neglect investment in research.</P>
    <P>Shopping has become fraught for the average housewife because of the lack of a proper traceability system and proper labelling. Consumers are unclear as to what they are buying. I pay tribute to the approach taken by our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, in the context of the operation he runs so scientifically and transparently. His operation is a model of best practice. That is what ought to be in place up and down the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> Consumers have a right to expect information on the origin, quality and composition of what they are buying. It is particularly worrying that consumers are buying chicken fillets, brought in cheaply from parts of south-east Asia, sprinkled with salt and labelled with something like a shamrock, which is sold in the pretence that it is a product of this country. That type of malpractice will have to stop.</P>
    <P>We live on an island but in terms of open borders and common food policies we are far from being an island. If we are to put in place the kind of system that we in the Progressive Democrats are arguing for, there must be uniformity of practice and systems throughout the EU member states, which are the greatest producers of food and drink in the world. For protection here there must be stringent control at Border points and communication between different Border points to ensure that what happened recently, and probably has been happening for a long time, will not continue to happen.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a fine tradition of grass-fed cattle, good food and great cooking. I think of our great restaurants and their good reputation and how central that is to our tourism industry. That reputation must not be put at risk but must be enhanced and continued into the next generation. That will not happen if the responsibility for food remains within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. If these objectives are to be achieved there must be a separate department and a Minister for food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. His presence is important in that it highlights the role of the Department of Health and Children in many of these issues and not just the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>This issue has been brought sharply into focus by the foot and mouth crisis. We must understand the trauma that is causing to many farmers in the United Kingdom. I have no doubt many farmers here are also anxious. One does not need to be a farmer to appreciate how traumatic it must be to lose a herd one has spent many years building up. Obviously, there is still a requirement for vigilance as we are not out of the wood yet. I hope all the measures being taken will be effective and that the disease will not beat the vigilance shown by the Minister and his officials and everyone who has worked hard to prevent it. The crisis has highlighted broader issues on which it is useful to dwell. Perhaps we might return to this in a calmer atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we taken on board the critical importance of ensuring that the food produced both at home and abroad, whether in the supermarket or from the wholesaler, is good, wholesome and what it proclaims to be? To accept that the consumer rules as the ultimate arbiter of what is produced and how it is produced and the environmental conditions of production, shipping and so <Col N="1123" /> on is the <i>sine qua non </i>of modern food production. Much lip service has been given to consumer primacy.</P>
    <P>Despite the statements to the contrary the farming industry and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have been fighting something of a rearguard action over an extended period to protect producers at the expense of consumers and sometimes at the expense of the country and our international markets. I recall the debate about the beef hormones. In 1989 I attended a large farming meeting in Portumna for candidates in the European election from Leinster, Munster and Connacht. There may have been 500 farmers present and I will always remember what took place. When a candidate from the Munster constituency stood up and said it was anti-national to talk about using hormones, that it was damaging to our international markets and should not be spoken about, he got a warm reception. I stood up, and being the naive politician I was, and perhaps still am, said the people who were anti-national were the people who were using these materials and not the people who were talking about them. That was met with absolute silence. It taught me a lesson which has remained with me. There have been many debates about agriculture in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn frequently reminds us that he has not heard a word about the consumer in some of the debates that have taken place here. There have been debates about the safety of beef hormones and whether they should have been allowed and the difficulty of competition with the United States. For the most part, the debate missed the point which was that if European consumers decided, as they did, they did not want beef with hormones, that was the end of the debate. It was up to us to produce beef without hormones and that eventually came to pass.</P>
    <P>When Bord Bia was being established I sought to amend the 1994 and 1995 Bills to include a consumer on the board. On each occasion that amendment was not accepted. As Ministers of State, Deputies O'Shea and Deenihan resisted that proposal. It was not until the third Bord Bia Bill in 1996 that that proposition was accepted. It is a proposition that should be universal.</P>
    <P>This bring me to another important point, the power of consumers as a group. Relative to other interest groups the Consumers' Association is not powerful. When it comes to a contest between the farming organisations and other vested interests and the Consumers' Association, we know who is likely to win.</P>
    <P>Consumer affairs is lumped in with labour affairs and international trade. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who has responsibility in that area, is highly effective and one of the most effective of the Ministers of State but he reports to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural <Col N="1124" /> Development has operational responsibility for food safety but the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, whose mission is &ldquo;to protect consumers' health by ensuring that food consumed, distributed, marketed and produced in Ireland meets the higher standards of food safety and hygiene&rdquo;, has a co-ordinating role. It is under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children and has a co-ordinating role but the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development carries out the work on contract, on its behalf. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has no more than an auditing role and not an implementing role; implementation is for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difficulty of a conflict of interest needs to be resolved. People of my generation were brought up to believe that production was good and it was in the national interest to produce as much as possible from the land at a time of food scarcity in Europe. We responded extraordinarily well to that challenge, to the extent that we now have surpluses. People of my generation in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have not come to terms with the change that has taken place. We are still motivated by the need to maximise production. That contradiction has been highlighted most dramatically by the foot and mouth disaster in the United Kingdom. Producers are stretched to breaking point by the need for maximum output at minimum cost. The cost price squeeze becomes so great that animal health, quality and all the other aspects of production go well down the line even to the extent of cutting corners and flouting the law. This has created a culture which is not confined to rogue meat factories. Angel dust, sheep smuggling, switching cattle ear tags, destroying mountain grazing and battery production are some of the manifestations of this culture.</P>
    <P>We have to resolve the fundamental contradiction between the Department's role as the promoter of production and the regulator of the industry. This would allow us to promote environmentally friendly production which, in an Irish sense, is almost equivalent to organic production. There are major international benefits to selling our food in that context.</P>
    <P>It took prison sentences to sort out the problem of angel dust and it may take prison sentences to sort out some of the smugglers and others who remove tags and behave illegally and contrary to best practice. This all comes back to the issue of traceability to which much lip service is paid. The foot and mouth crisis has shown traceability to be little more than a public relations invention with the exception of the few supermarkets and butchers, and I include Senator Quinn, who can stand over what they sell and who know from where their meat comes.</P>
    <P>We should have implemented electronic tagging. Computerisation has been talked about frequently in this House but it has taken too long to <Col N="1125" /> introduce and is only now coming to pass. It is incredible that the Department's plans for tagging individual sheep were resisted for reasons which did not just concern the effectiveness of tags. This begs the question of whether some of the resistance was as much to do with claiming headage payments to which people were not entitled as to any concern about the value of such a scheme. Some of the traceability standards for beef and milk must also apply to sheep.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the value of the Single Market because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The Single Market has been of immense value to this country. No matter how difficult it is to say so in the context of what is going on, we still need the Single Market. However, we also need the protection of that market at European level. There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the Single Market in that Europe, and not just national authorities, has a role.</P>
    <P>If one was shipping meat to the US there would be a US vet in the meat factory in Kildare checking the meat. If the meat was going to an Islamic country an Islamic butcher would be present. Does Europe have those kinds of standards when it comes to food entering the EU?</P>
    <P>I could say much more about this subject but time is of the essence. The bottom line is that some coherence must be brought to bear on our largest national industry to ensure it can compete effectively on international markets, that we can sell and stand over our food and that domestic and foreign consumers can have absolute confidence in the food produced in this country. The regulatory authority must give full backing to that concept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I also welcome this motion and thank the Progressive Democrats for tabling it. The motion is timely and, unfortunately, very topical and comes on the heels of the proposed European food authority. It is important that there should be a convergence between the two as there is no point in legislation applying to one country if it is not applicable throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>Just over a year ago Commissioner David Byrne unveiled plans to establish a European food authority as the centrepiece of a Commission White Paper on food safety. In the past year it has been hard to avoid the publicity regarding food and food safety. People are concerned and there are misconceptions abroad regarding the problems in this country.</P>
      <P>On St. Patrick's Day I received a telephone call from friends in the US. These people are not Irish but have visited this country on a number of occasions. They asked if we in Ireland had to stop eating meat. I told them, even though there were no cases of foot and mouth in Ireland, that it would not affect the food chain. This point is not understood in the US and shows the widespread misconceptions about our food safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> This motion is timely. In the past year we have seen the dioxin contamination of food in Belgium, questions about the safety of genetically modified foods and the quarrel between France and the UK over the EU ban on British beef. In one of the first speeches made by Romano Prodi after becoming President of the EU Commission he stated that winning back consumers' confidence in food would be one of the main tasks of his tenure in Brussels. The announcement that the Commission was seeking to set up a European food authority came on the heels of that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Commission advocates the establishment of an independent food authority modelled on the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products which is based in London. The new authority will be primarily involved in risk assessment, the provision of scientific advice, opinions and recommendations and communicating with EU consumers on food safety issues. However, one of the problems with the proposed EU legislation is that the authority will have no decision or law-making powers. The Commission's explanation for this is that such powers would require a change to EU treaties and would be an unwarranted dilution of democratic accountability. This is a feeble argument against enhancing consumer health and ensuring the continued viability of the European and Irish food industries.</P>
    <P>We may have to look to the US for the blueprint for an effective food authority. The US Food and Drug Administration should be the model for future European food agency legislation. It may also be the model for Irish legislation if the Minister of State takes on board this motion. The FDA has built up an enviable reputation for protecting the interests of consumers as well as having the confidence of the food industry. It has significant powers, a large staff and a broad range of activities. It can be sued for its judgments while also being able to institute legal proceedings. The FDA boasts that it protects the health of 274 million Americans at a yearly cost to the taxpayer of $3 per person. With more than 360 million people in the EU, £2 to £3 per person would be a small price to pay for protecting European consumers.</P>
    <P>We should be looking at the effectiveness of the American legislation. European legislation seeks a less radical solution to the issues of food safety by creating an authority which will be unable to give final judgments on issues regarding EU food policy. Placing many of the EU scientific committees within the ambit of this authority would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>The Commission also argues that, over a short period of time, the authority will establish itself as an authoritative point of reference for consumers, the food industry and national food agencies. At present, EU scientific committees with limited responsibilities and resources have earned a worthy reputation for producing authoritative <Col N="1127" /> scientific advice. The recent furore over the French decision to ban EU beef demonstrates that unless scientific advice is acted upon it is virtually useless. The European Commission must come up with some system whereby the recommendations of the new European food authority will be adhered to by all member states. If legislation must be introduced, it should be radical. We have seen the benefits of radical restrictions over the past few weeks in preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease to our country. Half measures are not good enough in any area relating to food safety.</P>
    <P>The rapid alert system for food emergencies, which is activated when the health of EU consumers is under threat from a food safety problem, operates in more than one member state. It should become part of the remit of the new authority and such a rapid alert system could also be introduced here. The system came into play during the dioxin contamination in Belgium, but it was severely hindered when the Belgian authorities delayed the provision of relevant information to the Commission for many weeks.</P>
    <P>We have a vast area to explore and the widespread public concern about food products must be assuaged. The Government will have to introduce legislation to achieve that. I hope the motion before the House will bring the need for such legislation into focus. The motion is a timely one which will stir up much public debate. The public is very conscious of food contamination and all it implies for public health. I wholeheartedly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, my primary concern is public health and the safety of food consumed by the public. I am pleased to have this opportunity to advise the Seanad of the initiatives being taken to improve consumer confidence in the safety and wholesomeness of the food we eat. I thank Senators Quill, Dardis and Gibbons for tabling this motion.</P>
      <P>Across the world the trend is for national Governments and trading blocs to change their approach to food safety. Gradually we are seeing a move away from prescriptive detailed requirements in legislation, as more emphasis is placed on risk analysis procedures and on general rulings. Risk analysis is now a basic feature of modern food safety programmes. It comprises three separate but related parts, namely risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. This has meant a readjustment for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job of national Governments is evolving to one of inspecting and verifying that food safety management systems are operating effectively. At the same time, we must ensure that our control services continue to meet these challenges. Never before, it seems, has food hygiene and food safety been so close to the top of both the public <Col N="1128" /> and political agendas. It has long been recognised that laws and the enforcement of laws are not sufficient in themselves to ensure the best standards in food safety. Education and enforcement must go hand in hand. An essential element in the provision of safe food is adequate knowledge and education. All of us today recognise the need for education in food hygiene and for the need to overcome or remove the ignorance which can result in poor hygiene practice or, worse still, food poisoning outbreaks.</P>
    <P>Food scares are nothing new. For many years we have been warned about the dangers of using unpasteurised milk, the need for proper hygiene in the home and have been advised on the proper cooking of food. Only recently, however, BSE and E.coli 0157 have emerged. If we add the threats caused by drug-resistant salmonella strains and antibiotic residues in pork, it is little wonder that consumers treat vague reassurances with scepticism.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 January 1999 under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The Food Safety Authority is a major catalyst for changing the food safety culture in this island. The authority is an independent agency whose function is to ensure that food produced, marketed or distributed within the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The authority was the first in Europe to be set up with this status, independent of industry and sectoral interests. Its independence is very important to consumers. Some 1,900 professionals are currently engaged, either full-time or part-time, in food control services, working to protect consumer health. A major function of the authority is to co-ordinate the efforts of these professionals to maintain the highest standards of safety and hygiene.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that customer confidence, both at home and abroad, in Irish food products needs to be paramount. We in Ireland must be in a position to give independent and verifiable assurances as to the quality and purity of our food products. For this reason, the Government established the Food Safety Authority as a statutory, independent and science-based body, overseeing all functions relating to the food safety regulation of the food industry. This model is being followed in the European context, where the European food authority is being set up on a similar basis by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>At European level, the White Paper on Food Safety was published by the EU Commission in February 2000. This White Paper reflects the European Commission's priority of ensuring that the highest standards of food safety are set and maintained throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>One of the principal proposals of the White Paper is the establishment of a new European food authority this year. The principal objective of the European food authority will be to contrib<Col N="1129" /> ute to a high level of consumer health protection in the area of food safety, through which consumer confidence can be restored and maintained. At national level, several European Union member states have already established national food safety agencies and Ireland is to the forefront in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for the enforcement of food safety legislation. This responsibility is discharged by means of service contracts with the agencies which have responsibility for food control. These agencies include the relevant Government Departments, 30 local authorities, health boards and organisations such as the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority is advised by a board which consists of ten members, each of whom has been appointed by the Minister for Health and Children. The board members are independent of industry. The Act provides for a scientific committee of 15 members appointed by the Minister to provide independent scientific advice to the board. There is also a consultative council of 24 members, 12 appointed by the Government and 12 appointed by the board, which represents consumer and other interests in the food sector.</P>
    <P>Service contracts with 44 agencies were entered into and came into force in 1999. Each contract includes details on the work that the official agencies undertake on behalf of the authority to ensure compliance with, and the enforcement of, food safety legislation. The authority has functions in relation to research, advice, co-ordination of services and certification of food. It has all the necessary powers to follow the food chain as far back as necessary in order to deal with any situation giving rise to concerns about the safety and hygiene of food. Its officers have full powers to enter premises, seize documents and samples, issue improvement notices and closure orders, and to prohibit the sale of food considered unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In addition, the authority works with industry and training professionals to improve, harmonise and co-ordinate food safety and hygiene training throughout the country. Food handling plays an essential role in the prevention of food-borne disease. It is widely recognised that food handlers through poor personal hygiene, poor handling, or handling food while medically unfit, may allow food to become contaminated. Educating food handlers to adhere to good personal hygiene and good practices is therefore essential. It is equally important that employers recognise their role and ensure that food handlers have, or are given, the knowledge they need to do their work.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority has a number of initiatives under way which are aimed at protecting public health and reducing the incidence of food-borne illness. These include a campaign aimed at raising standards of food safety and hygiene practices among people working in the <Col N="1130" /> fast food sector. A breakdown of data from 1999 shows that over 50% of the reported outbreaks were associated with the catering end of the food industry, most notably the fast food sector, including take-away restaurants. The authority has produced a guide for take-away premises because of the relatively high risk associated with ready-to-go meals.</P>
    <P>Changing lifestyles have increased the demand for fast food premises, with the emphasis now on speed and convenience. This trend is reflected elsewhere in the world in that 56% of money spent on food in the United States goes to purchase foods eaten or prepared outside the home. This trend is also evident in Ireland. The &ldquo;food to go&rdquo; sector is enjoying a rapid growth as retailers are responding to changes in lifestyles by providing ready-to-eat meals and by expanding the range of convenience foods they supply.</P>
    <P>Some staff working in this area may be untrained and inexperienced in food hygiene practices. In many such premises, there can be a rapid turnover of staff, which can result in poor hygiene training and knowledge of good hygienic practices. It is imperative that employees know what causes food poisoning and what they must do to prevent it. These details are provided in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's range of publications and publicity materials.</P>
    <P>Another major initiative relates to the catering sector and the use of eggs, which have been associated with outbreaks of salmonella food poisoning. The Food Safety Authority has collaborated with the Egg Association and Bord Bia in developing a quality assurance scheme that incorporates strict disease control and monitoring measures in flocks. The authority now recommends that caterers should use eggs which are either pasteurised or sourced from proven salmonella controlled flocks, such as those in the Bord Bia egg quality assurance scheme. In this context, the very significant reduction in the total number of reported cases of food poisoning caused by salmonella, from 1258 in 1998 to 635 in 2000, should be noted.</P>
    <P>New threats to food safety have emerged over the past two decades, fuelling consumer concern. A number of major food safety crises and scares have also eroded confidence in the safety of food. The authority aims to be a key player in making Ireland &ldquo;the food island&rdquo; of Europe, a centre of excellence for agricultural produce with the highest standards of production, processing, retailing and catering practices. One very welcome development that augurs well for the future has been the establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board on an all-Ireland basis. In December 1998, it was agreed in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that an agency with responsibility for the promotion of food safety &ndash; the Food Safety Promotion Board &ndash; would be established as one of the North-South Implementation Bodies. It was agreed that the functions of the board would <Col N="1131" /> include the promotion of food safety, research into food safety, communication of food alerts, surveillance of food-borne diseases, promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories and developing cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board was formally established in December 1999 and its headquarters will be in Cork. The creation of this board enhances the opportunity for the island of Ireland to become a centre of excellence where food safety is concerned. Contaminants and food scares do not recognise borders. I look forward to working with the Food Safety Promotion Board in the future.</P>
    <P>We are blessed with an environment that is still among the cleanest in Europe. This, together with the natural advantages conferred on us by climate and soil, makes us one of the most favoured places in Europe for the production of clean and safe food.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, I am aware of how health and the environment are closely interdependent. It is important that we do everything we can to sustain and promote a clean environment, to enhance the health and quality of life for our citizens and also for future generations. The measures which we take now in Ireland to protect and improve our environment will have long-term benefits for the health and well-being of generations to come.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that in developing our economic and social infrastructure we do what is sustainable and not detrimental to the health and quality of life of our citizens. We launched our own proposal for a national environmental health action plan and we have a pilot local environmental health project under way in the north western region.</P>
    <P>The current time is a very challenging and interesting one to be involved in the food business in Ireland. The internal market boundaries in Europe have been removed and the nature of statutory controls is changing. In adapting to the changing environment, the Government has invested substantially in the food control systems employed and operated by the health boards. Additional resources have been provided for extra field and laboratory staff, for computerisation and training.</P>
    <P>The globalisation of food distribution systems and the increasing demand for convenience food have lengthened the food chain, with added opportunities for contamination to occur. The upward trends in the purchase of pre-prepared foods for eating at home, and more people eating out, mean that consumers are increasingly entrusting the safe preparation of their food to somebody else.</P>
    <P>Across the European Union, national governments are evaluating their food safety controls and enforcement mechanisms to ensure the highest levels possible of consumer protection. I need <Col N="1132" /> not remind the Seanad that for Ireland the stakes are particularly high. Food production and tourism are major elements of our economy and both depend crucially on a favourable international perception of the safety of Irish food. Therefore, Ireland has a vital economic interest in becoming, and remaining, a centre of excellence in food safety. The guarantee of safe food for all is a shared responsibility. In protecting the food chain, from farm to fork, the Government, industry and the consumer must each play their part.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the Seanad on this important issue and I thank the Senators for bringing forward the motion. I assure the House that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, will continue to work towards reducing the incidence of food-borne infection and the maintenance of the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the relationship between agriculture and food. While the economy has made great progress and diversified significantly in recent years, we still rely heavily on the agri-food sector. The agriculture and food sector is our main natural resource industry. In developing the sector, we are guided by the vision of agriculture encapsulated in the term &ldquo;multifuctionality&rdquo;. This means an agri-food industry that is sustainable, competitive, supports the countryside and rural life while prioritising consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The agri-food sector is a main source of employment in rural areas and a major source of net foreign earnings for the economy. Government policy towards developing the agri-food sector has been set out in the plan of action 2010, which envisages an industry which offers farm families sustainable livelihood options, thus ensuring the maintenance of the maximum number of farm families on the land; which has the necessary strength and capabilities to compete successfully within the EU and on our main third-country markets; which is focused on meeting consumer demands, particularly for the highest standards of food safety; values rural environment as the basis of thriving rural communities and as our natural resource base; and develops a consumer oriented competitive food sector. This vision is firmly rooted in the principles of the European model of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The rapid level of globalisation occurring in the food industry is placing sustained pressure on our farmers and our food producing base. The next World Trade Organisation round will in all probability intensify this pressure. Increased competition for market share among retailers is also forcing suppliers to reduce costs. In addition to securing our home market, the future of our agri-food sector can only be guaranteed through continuous and reliable access to export markets on which we rely so heavily. We know only too well how access to markets can be jeopardised by foot and mouth disease, swine fever, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The strength of our food industry is its closeness to the raw material base, agriculture. Consumers cherish this closeness and favour the shortest possible supply chain. These close links should be strengthened rather than weakened. Evidence from throughout the EU and elsewhere illustrates that the development of agriculture and food should come within the remit of the same Department or Ministry. I refer Members to recent changes in the Federal Republic of Germany in relation to this matter. This Government has placed food safety under the control of the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The development of the closely related agriculture and food sectors has been assigned to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we have taken the right approach because the Food Safety Authority of Ireland deals primarily with food safety, which should not be confused with food quality. Food may be of good quality, but it may be impregnated by all sorts of hormones or antibiotics. I reiterate that we have taken the correct route because the Food Safety Authority is an independent body, completely separate from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Quill, Gibbons and Dardis for tabling this motion. In particular, I thank Senator Quill for her generous comments about me.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey referred to misunderstandings. Foot and mouth disease poses no threat to the health of humans. This is something people fail to understand. The Senator stated that someone telephoned him from America about this matter. I understand that the Bord Fáilte office in New York received telephone calls last week from the parents of children travelling to Ireland with high school bands seeking assurances that they would not eat Irish meat during their time here. This shows that people totally misunderstand the position. The motion also refers to environmental issues. In that context, people misunderstand the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> genetically modified foods. Such foods give rise to concerns about the environment, they do not promote fears about food safety. Dr. Patrick Wall has pointed this out on numerous occasions. There is no doubt that people misunderstand the position and we must face up to the challenge of educating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was involved with the leaving certificate applied course, teachers used say to me: &ldquo;God preserve us from people who say that X or Y should be a separate new subject in the curriculum.&rdquo; They were reacting against the fact that subjects were continually being added to the curriculum, without any being removed. The same applies to Ministers. On occasion someone suggests that a new Minister should be appointed to deal with a particular area, but they do not state that another Minister or Department should be <Col N="1134" /> removed. However, these calls sometimes make sense. The reason for this is the way Government works. In theory, Departments are simply part of a greater whole and they work together in close collaboration to achieve agreed national objectives. In practice, however, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In practice, what happens is that a Department falls into the grip of the people with whom it deals. Senator Dardis commented upon this matter. Sooner or later a Department becomes an advocate for those who are its clients. The Department of Finance has become so powerful because there must always be some body to adjudicate between competing interests. In no instance is it more true that a Department has become the servant of its clients than in the case of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Farmers often regard that Department as their enemy, but the truth is that it is the best friend they will ever have. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development makes decisions with the farmers' interests in mind. That is a simple truth, borne out over many years. There is nothing wrong with this because farmers are an important part of our national economy and it is correct that someone should speak for them at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>The arrangement to which I refer comes unstuck in situations where the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has power over decisions that range over wider interests than simply those of farmers or over decisions where other interests may come directly into conflict with those of farmers. It is then that the system falls apart because the decisions are always taken from the point of view of farmers, even when that is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The main battleground in this area is over the word &ldquo;food&rdquo;. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has always fought for control of anything connected with food because it shares a misconception with the agricultural community. That misconception is one which sees food as an end product of agriculture. It sees the food industry as merely part of an agricultural distribution chain. That conception of food flies directly in the face of a worldwide reality, namely, that food is a customer-driven commodity. If one wants one's food industry to succeed, it must follow the market and not be driven by the concerns of the producer. This fact has become increasingly true in the past 30 years as the world has changed to become increasingly driven by market forces and the needs of customers.</P>
    <P>For 20 years or more, we tried to resist that reality in Ireland. We tried to pretend we could develop a food industry that was producer-driven rather than market-driven. Eventually, we fell so far behind that the expert group to which Senator Dardis referred was established approximately ten years ago to advise on how Ireland could improve its food marketing on world markets. Bord Bia was set up as a result of the work of <Col N="1135" /> this group. I remember that period quite well because I was a member of the expert group in question. I was also the author of its minority report, which said that Bord Bia should not come under the aegis of the then Department of Agriculture. My message was that it should come under any Department &ndash; for example, the then Department of Industry and Trade or the Department of Health &ndash; but that it should not be under the control of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I lost the battle to which I refer and the food industry suffered as a result. However, it made me all the more determined not to lose the next battle which arose five or so years later, namely, the battle to establish the Food Safety Authority. Blinded as always by the word &ldquo;food&rdquo;, the Department of Agriculture engaged in a long campaign to have the Food Safety Authority placed within its remit. The Government of which the Minister of State is a member was not in power at that stage and I am sure no one would blame it for that. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development takes the view that anything connected with food should be under its control. Fortunately, it did not win the battle and the Food Safety Authority went to the only place where it could be independent of the vested interests, namely, the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State indicated, this is mirrored at European level where responsibility for food safety does not lie with the Commissioner for Agriculture. At European level, food safety is clearly and correctly seen as a consumer issue, not a public health issue or a side-show to agricultural production, to be run and controlled as the producers wish. However, food production remains within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. There is even a Minister of State with responsibility for the safety of food before it reaches the farm gate. This is because we insist &ndash; I am not sure we are correct in this regard &ndash; in separating responsibility for the safety of produce on the farm and what happens to it when it is transported elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not get me wrong. There will always be a responsibility on producers to ensure that the strictest standards in regard to food safety are met. I see nothing wrong in having a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development responsible for encouraging farmers to meet those standards, but that is not the same as making a Minister responsible for food safety. A Minister with that remit needs to be more removed from the interests involved.</P>
    <P>What is the answer to all of this? That brings me to the motion put down by the Progressive Democrats. I do not claim to have the ultimate answer but I offer this thought as something to build upon. We should have somebody at Cabinet level whose brief would be to look after the <Col N="1136" /> interests of the customer in all those areas where those interests come under threat of any kind. That is why I believe there is something in the motion about which I was not sure at the outset. That brief would include food safety and could include the environment. In fact, it could include anything that affects the members of the public who come under threat when vested interests are allowed to call all the shots. If we appointed such a Minister and gave him or her real clout, it would send a strong message to the citizens that the Government is genuine about acting in their interests. There is meat &ndash; a good word to use &ndash; in this motion. Let us give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to keep the House up to date on a document published a few hours ago in Britain. This is a report on a beautiful little village &ndash; I saw it on television &ndash; called Queniborough in Leicestershire. Five people died from variant CJD in that one village, and nobody knew the reason. An investigation was carried out in the past year, the report of which was published this afternoon. The report states that a link was found between those deaths and an association with one butcher's shop, and the manner in which the slaughtering took place in an abattoir in the area. I mention this because there is an automatic assumption that someone in my position would say that it happened on a farm but this report, which was published only this afternoon, appears to suggest that food safety is very difficult to pin down to one area. We should not divide the food safety areas between what happens on the farm and what happens subsequently.</P>
    <P>The motion deserves attention. There is a challenge we have to face up to and it gives us the opportunity to take the first step on the road to meeting that challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House this evening. In the words of Senator Quinn, I am delighted that the common-sense decision was made that food safety should come under the Department of Health and Children. Tensions have already arisen, however, between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Food Safety Authority. Tension can be beneficial and it will remain for many a long day between food producers and consumers, and that is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed by the food producing industry because there is so much at stake in this regard. Some years ago I visited a sunny area of the Continent. While shopping one morning for the usual items required in an apartment, I picked up a litre of milk and a pound of butter which I assumed were of Irish origin. They were wrapped in what looked like Kerrygold packaging, including the logo, but when I got back to the apartment and opened them I discovered they were produced in northern Germany. They had literally stolen the Kerrygold packaging and the dairy products were being passed off as Irish. It was only on reading <Col N="1137" /> the small print, which was in German, that one discovered they were produced in Hanover in northern Germany.</P>
    <P>They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. That incident happened ten years ago, and I do not know if the practice would stand up today. At that time Ireland had an excellent reputation in continental Europe for producing beef and dairy products in pristine surroundings, with good grass, and it was a plus for us. Kerrygold was a premium product abroad and that is probably still the case. Those foreigners were copying what we had done because we had a name for producing good quality food and the consumers abroad were prepared to pay a premium for that food.</P>
    <P>The lesson for the food and agriculture industry is that quality sells, and I hope when Senator Dardis is replying&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Senator Gibbons mentions that agriculture and food production, from the field to the fork, should be a team effort. There should be no dangerous solo runs like the one we saw recently on the part of a gentleman who brought in sheep from Carlisle, ostensibly to go straight to slaughter but which were found on a farm. We are always told in politics that numbers make power but here was a person who rocked the food industry to its foundations with one solo run, and we are paying the price ever since. What message is that to send abroad to people who buy our products? Our food industry is over 50% export based, perhaps more, and it should not send the message abroad that we cannot be trusted in terms of the food we produce and export. We have enough reports to back that up.</P>
      <P>We appear to be exporting more lamb than we are producing. Some years ago the Austrians got caught badly when somebody noticed that the exports of Austrian white wine were far greater than the amount of wine produced. Following an inquiry it was found that one company in Austria was importing Algerian white wine by the train load, bottling it and selling it abroad as Austrian. It took the wine industry in Austria years to recover from that practice. We should learn a lesson from that and not allow our food exporting industry to go down that road because it would place too many jobs and family incomes in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority has a huge part to play in terms of quality control from the field to the fork and the export market. As Senator Quinn mentioned, we do not want people abroad to get the wrong idea about food safety. Imagine parents in America ringing their children in Ireland and telling them not to eat Irish food. That is a spin we can well do without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Dardis said in his contribution. Are we engaging in too much concentrated food development? There is heavy <Col N="1138" /> stocking of land &ndash; not all land is made for heavy stocking &ndash; and battery production of pigs, hens, eggs. etc. Should we examine that development? I know there are constant demands, as Senator Quinn said, for cheaper food but there is a limit in terms of quantity versus quality. That is an area which the Food Safety Authority should examine. We have to strike a happy medium and not allow the demands for quantity to override what is our strongest trump card &ndash; quality food. The American feed lots can produce beef far cheaper than we will ever produce it. The huge collective farms, which are still in Eastern Europe, can produce far greater amounts than we can. We cannot compete on that score but we can compete on quality.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quill said, there must be total transparency in food production. It must be transparent and available to the consumer on the package. Some years ago all hell broke loose when it was proposed that ingredients on packaged foods should be on the label. That was a battle which had to be fought tenaciously before we found out what we were eating.</P>
    <P>As a Senator and public representative I can pontificate but at the end of the day unless the consumer feels safe with the food that he or she is eating, they will walk away from it. Whether we like it, the consumer is king and queen when it comes to the purchase of food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Progressive Democrats motion, but I do not think that the debate has gone as far as they want because they want to set up a department of food. Having seen what happened in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development recently, there is a loss of consumer confidence. It would be worthwhile to disassociate food and agriculture. We must attempt to restore people's respect for Irish food.</P>
      <P>The scandals over the past 20 years destroyed consumer confidence. As many Senators said, they believe that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is just a producer. That is important but, as Senator Fitzpatrick said, if people do not have confidence in the food and do not eat it, there is a serious problem.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, is here this evening because I know the time and thought he put into this matter. His background as a general practitioner makes him ideal for dealing with it.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority did its best in the recent scandals to give consumers confidence that someone is working on their behalf. When it was set up, there was a mighty struggle by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to have responsibility for it. It was with great difficulty that it was set up under the control of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the authority has to be so active because we have had one drama after another recently. It is one of the most over-<Col N="1139" /> worked bodies within the Department of Health and Children. I congratulate everyone who works in it. I was sorry to see the spat between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who is an extremely affable man, and Dr. Pat Wall about the BSE scheme whereby we were killing animals over 30 months old. It was a meat trade support scheme but there were people, myself among them, who thought it was a food safety scheme. That should have been made clear at the beginning. People asked me why it was safe to eat food that was tested and unsafe to eat food that was not. They thought there must be something terribly wrong with much of the meat. Clarity at the beginning would have been useful.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board is also extraordinarily useful. The debate should be expanded so that it is not just the presence or absence of bacteria or toxins in food that is discussed. I am delighted with the all-island food consumption survey which the board initiated. It was carried out by the Irish universities nutrition alliance which involves the department of clinical medicine, Trinity College, the nutritional science department of food science, technology and nutrition, NUI Cork, and the University of Ulster's Northern Ireland centre for diet and health.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the survey of the food we eat over a week shows that our diet is becoming less rather than more healthy. Astonishingly, 25% of people took food supplements &ndash; a generation ago that would have been considered unusual &ndash; but they were not always taking the right supplements. I recommend that Members of the House read it. Often when we produce reports we think that we have done something useful, but unless we see what action should be taken, we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>If the Progressive Democrats' proposal for a department for food is accepted, it could directly improve our food consumption by having a more varied and balanced diet. Then we could avoid the situation that arose in the past ten years where, astonishingly in 1990, 7.8% of the population were obese, that is, very fat. It is when the body mass index&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be going into the body mass index. Members can do this as mental arithmetic on the way home. It is your weight in kilograms over your height in metres squared. The Minister, Deputy Moffatt, can see that it is simple. If he applies the formula he will see what his body mass is &ndash; it should be about 25, but that of many people is higher than that. If it is over 30, it is serious. Today 20% of the population have a body mass index of over 30. This is amazing&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something we must address as a serious health issue. We relied too much on fat for food energy intake and did not take enough carbohydrate. Our meat intake is reducing. I have not bought meat for five years. Now that I have discovered the Celticisation of lamb, I am more anxious about that. In one year, 3.2 million lambs were born here but 3.7 million were slaughtered as Celtic lambs before they become hoggets which, I believe, is at a year old. There must have been many going back and forwards across the Border to achieve that. It was not, as Senator Quill said, a question of a few thousand lambs being brought here recently because of the improved price here. It is an astonishing increase.</P>
      <P>The survey reports that only 55% of people ate beef. Meat products as a whole were eaten by 70% of people and poultry was eaten by 35%. Vegetable consumption was better than I expected &ndash; 50% ate vegetable or pulse dishes. Peas, beans and lentils were eaten by 75% of people, which is a good intake of vegetable protein, and cheeses were eaten by 74% of people. It would be interesting to have the information from ten years ago to see if meat consumption has declined. I do not mind what I am told about a reduction in beef consumption. The meat counter in the supermarket in Blackrock is much smaller, whereas the fish and vegetable counters are bigger. If I hear of anyone else trying to take the best land in north Dublin to set up dumps I will go mad. I do not blame the farmers there.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, I would like to praise Bord Glas and Bord Bia for their great work. They have their shoulders to the wheel trying to do the best they can. I cannot say the same for meat producers and meat factories, however. I will not describe them as farmers because I would not refer to those involved in the worst practices as farmers.</P>
      <P>Genetically modified organisms were also mentioned. A very good interdepartmental report on GMOs was sent around, and I recommend it to Members of the House. It points out that we have no evidence of plant DNA ever getting into animal DNA. We need to be constantly reminded of that. Perhaps there are problems with regard to allegenicity when a nut gene is put into something else, for example, or if antibiotics are put in as markers. I can understand such problems, and we should look very carefully at them. The GMO debate is an environmental one to a large extent. Everyone should have the choice whether to eat them because the consumer is king and this is a market economy. I congratulate the Progressive Democrats for putting down this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had something to say on this matter, but I have lost my train of thought. I am glad to speak on this motion which was put down by three Progressive Democrat Senators. I <Col N="1141" /> welcome Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who is charged with the responsibility of food safety in the Department of Health and Children. The last time he was here I referred to what he said as an address and not as a speech. I found it extraordinarily informative and I brought it with me tonight and I invite Senators to read it again. I recall wondering that evening if the national press would carry one line of it; perhaps they did, but I did not see it.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister of State's presentation was excellent. It set out what the Department of Health and Children was doing with regard to disease controls, management of food safety products and ensuring that our food is safe. This evening, likewise, he set out in great detail the work that has been done. We have enough legislation with regard to food production and food safety as over 80 separate measures are in place.</P>
      <P>Before I move on, I would like to repeat a thing or two. We have had many debates on BSE and foot and mouth disease, and substantial agricultural control legislation has been enacted. In 1987, Deputy Joe Walsh was appointed as a Minister of State, and I invite Senators to remind themselves what agriculture was like during the 1970s and 1980s. If this motion was before us 15 or 20 years ago, I would have had no problem understanding it and may have supported it. Deputy Walsh set about improving agriculture production, presentation and processing in 1987 to give consumers a high quality product for the first time. He had to reorganise the dairy industry and set about streamlining the beef industry, which was difficult.</P>
      <P>The success of the dairy industry is now internationally recognised and the high quality of the Irish product is unquestionable. I think we can do the same with the meat industry. I have difficulty relating to the separation of agricultural production which basically involves the production of food for consumers. As a farmer, I am engaged in the production of food. If I cannot ensure the quality of the produce the consumer wants, and which fits in with existing controls, I will be out of business. There will be no place for me as a primary producer in the system, and the same applies to all Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>There are people who will make a pound if it is there to be made, regardless of how they do it. I am not talking about that type of person when I speak of the high standard of the dairy industry and the beef industry. Agriculture must look to meet high standards of production, although one can always point to holes. I wonder if future legislation introduced by a Minister with responsibility for food will deal with those who bend and break the laws. We need to follow the route we are on, provide the necessary education and stimulate the industry to produce to a higher standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, the EU has not served us well. When the Treaty of Rome was signed, there was a deficit in the production of food in Europe. World <Col N="1142" /> War II was over and a new system was introduced. We joined the EEC, as it was, in 1973, and the marketplace for Irish produce became intervention. We lost the game then, but the blame cannot be placed on Irish farmers. The blame should be with the processor who became lazy when he had an open intervention market.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned that he took part in a debate on hormones in the midlands. I represented my party in a similar debate in Cork. Perhaps opinions differed in the south, but the use of hormones was not popular that night. The eminent gentleman who promoted them, and we all know who he was, lost his seat, although I am not saying I had anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>Free trade, the free movement of animals and goods, animal welfare and the food that is coming into this country and into Europe are relevant to this debate. I have mentioned in this House on four or five occasions that it cannot be said with certainty that food imported through Europe is of a high quality. I spoke quite heartily on the fact that many imports into Europe come from South America, the Far East, Asia and Africa. This food finds its way here, on to the plate of the consumer. We must deal with that through effective controls at European level which currently do not exist.</P>
    <P>There was an outbreak of swine fever in England recently. That happened when a piece of meat was thrown over a fence to where pigs were eating. Where did it come from? We know where swine fever is prevalent. The source of foot and mouth has been traced to waste food containing meat. It is time to ensure that Europe sets standards. We have high standards here which we must implement. We will not encourage people to set standards unless we are prepared to pay for quality products. Will the consumer buy a quality product? </P>
    <P>I read recently that Senator Quinn has introduced a system whereby he can guarantee the customer absolute traceability through DNA testing. He is employing a firm called IdentiGEN which is headed up by an eminent professor in Trinity College. We have the capacity and the capability to give consumers what they want, if we have the will to succeed. We need a European approach to a problem that has resulted in food products being filtered into Europe. I am sure Members have seen the advertisement, for example, for Irish smoked bacon. Does it say it is an Irish product? It strongly suggests the smoke is Irish. If the bacon was Irish, it would say smoked Irish bacon. Where is the origin of that meat? Until we are prepared to answer such questions, we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State is pleased with what the EU is doing in relation to the tobacco industry, although I might not be because I smoke. The EU is funding the growing of tobacco to the tune of 1 billion. Is that health related? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a timely motion and I congratulate the Progressive Democrats on tabling it. I support its sentiment. However, I am not certain it can be implemented because the issue we are discussing is so wide and complex it would not be possible to put it under a single system, although I agree it could be an integrated system of different parts.</P>
      <P>The issue of European standards is the key, but we must look at them with a jaundiced eye. Many of the European standards are out of touch and unrealistic. They were put together by bureaucrats without the advice of people who work in greenhouses and on farms, who sell food and who work in butchers, abattoirs, etc. I want the Government to set up a group to look at European directives and legislation on food and to indicate those many aspects which seem to be totally ridiculous.</P>

      <P>Straight bananas, unshapely apples, oversized tomatoes, etc. That is not just newspaper babble. I live in north County Dublin and I am surrounded by apple farmers and market gardeners. The amount of good food which is thrown out because the cucumbers are the wrong size, the tomatoes are too large and the apples are unshapely and will not get a grade to get into the Dublin market is horrific. That is wrong and immoral. This issue must be addressed. Over the years we have sold off large amounts of food to the Third World or to eastern Europe to get rid of our dairy or food mountains. We are destroying a huge amount of good food all the time.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Government to send a runner around Europe with a camera to visit all the great food stores and to look at the vegetable displays in any large supermarket in Provence and the south of France where people admire the glorious food. One will see pallets there on which there are pieces of food which would be unacceptable in the Dublin market under EU directives but which the French farmers blithely ignore, as they do everything else. We are at the wrong end of that. I ask the Minister of State to take that on board. We must look with a jaundiced eye at what should be taken out of European legislation and, having done that, we should put forward proposals on what should be done.</P>
      <P>We should look at the Abattoirs Act. Europe is spending £1 billion a year on proposals for the traceability of beef, yet it introduced legislation which makes traceability almost impossible. If an animal is killed in a central abattoir, the local butcher in Dingle can go to Tralee and buy a side of an animal which has come from some place 60 miles in the opposite direction. It may be good or bad but he or she does not know. We want people to buy off the grass in their own locality. We want them to kill the animals they know and to buy from the farmers they know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> We saw in the 1980s and the early 1990s that the oversized beef produced as a result of growth promoters made a fool of farmers and consumers. It pushed up the price as artificial growth promoters and hormone injections had to be bought. This added to the cost of the initial purchase price of the animal and thereby reduced the profit. I keep reminding farming friends and the farming lobby that we learned in primary school that profit equals the difference between the selling price and the purchase price plus the costs in between. If the purchase price and the cost of items such as growth promoters are reduced, one can still sell at a lower than expected price but have a larger profit. It seems like a simple approach to the world but they should do that.</P>
    <P>There is a food shop in the middle of Sligo town, close to the Minister of State's constituency, called Cosgrove's. I ask any person who is interested in food to visit it. It is a tiny grocery shop which has the best food from all over the world. That shows what a small industry can do in parts of the world which produce a quality product. There are many such industries in Ireland. I recently bought in that shop beautiful air-dried venison from north Donegal which would grace a delicatessen anywhere in Europe. That was the first place I saw it. Three or four years ago the owner of the shop told me that air-dried meat was not produced in Ireland. Any such meat comes from Italy, Spain, Portugal or southern France. I am delighted that venison is now being produced in Donegal because it is a niche market. I want people to look at the possibilities.</P>
    <P>The other area being unnecessarily damaged by European standards is the cottage food industry. That is almost becoming a black market industry operating in a twilight zone. Just because something is made in a back kitchen it is not necessarily unhygienic. We should look at standards for commercial production and have different standards for what I call cottage industry. We must let the consumer know what he or she is buying.</P>
    <P>This is parallel with a craft industry as opposed to a commercial industry. Producers of craft items can only make small quantities and they cannot produce in multiples as a large company can. The same is true for a cottage industry. The person near Ballina with 90 beehives set in heather is producing a quality honey which would sell anywhere in the world. We all agree on that. That should be welcomed, developed and encouraged by Europe, but it is not happening. It is part of what we should be doing. There are companies who are trying to get this together and who are managing to make progress.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to take this on board, to look at the European regulations and identify the changes we want to make. The bureaucrats are never challenged on these issues. They bring in a small piece of legislation and because nobody is bothered, we just put up with it. When all 150 of <Col N="1145" /> them are put together, the whole face of an industry is changed.</P>
    <P>The environment is a huge issue. The necessity for clean water has been raised in this House by Senator Dardis's party on many occasions. Clean water leads to a clean environment and that is hugely important. We should start talking straight to people about issues. There is a debate over incinerators and I do not hold a brief for either side. I believe that incinerators are far safer, cleaner and more acceptable than any kind of dump and it is time that people were told that rather than frightened with the kind of nonsense that is talked about. That does not take away from the importance of getting people to manage their own waste.</P>
    <P>I say to the IFA, as we now have them on the run, as it were, on the question of sheep tagging, that vets should be more welcome on farms. When a vet finds a reactor or some cattle with disease, it should be seen as a victory for the system rather than looking for somebody to be knee-capped, which is often the kind of reception that vets unfortunately get when they bring bad news to a farmer about a reactor herd etc. We need to change attitudes.</P>
    <P>I welcome to opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate the proposers of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for State. I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate. We have had an extremely good, positive debate and the contributions were very interesting.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole makes the case for the motion very strongly when he talks about the niche markets that exist throughout Europe but most obviously here. We have lost many of these because of the direction of European agricultural policy since we joined in the early 1970s. The environment has changed dramatically since then. At that stage, there was a need for increasing production and the farming community reaped the benefits of that. Thereafter, intervention became a very big part of farmers' income and we continued to produce to put into intervention. Now we have headage payments etc. Intervention effectively no longer exists but the emphasis is on producing.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural policy of Europe, there has never been any effort to produce food for consumers. That is where we are going wrong. That is why it is particularly important to separate the whole area from agriculture. Agriculture should be based on farmers producing raw material for the food industry. It should be developed in that way. We need a strong agricultural policy based on where we see Irish agriculture going over the next ten, 15 or 20 years. I am not sure that such a policy exists and this worries me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need a strong, properly funded consumer body with teeth, which will give instructions to the agricultural industry outlining what <Col N="1146" /> we need and making it clear that we do not need vast volumes of the products of yesterday. This must be focused in a coherent way.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by Senator Quinn's suggestion that rather than having a Minister for food at senior level, we should have a Minister for consumer affairs. There is great interest in that and I will talk to him in more detail about it.</P>
    <P>We have made some very positive steps in recent years. Having the Food Safety Authority within the Department of Health and Children is very welcome, but it is an area that needs to be given more rein. We need to be more forceful about funding it. The Food Safety Authority has done extremely good work but it needs to develop on that. It needs to have the opportunity to direct policy back towards agriculture.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators and the Minister of State for their contributions and I look forward to further debate on the matters raised in this motion. Given that nearly all Senators were in favour of the thrust of the motion we may see some developments in the future.</P>

      <P>The committee was discussing amendment No. 16 requesting that the carer's respite grant be increased to £1,000 and that carers in receipt of social welfare payments not be excluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance in certain circumstances.

      <P>This is a very important amendment on a very important subject and this Government is committed to carers.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office the carer's allowance, for which I am responsible, has been increased by 200% from £36 million to £108 million and it will go up even further next year. The number of carer's allowance recipients has gone up by 81% and, as a result of the budget, will increase again. Not only that, I was the Minister to introduce the carer's respite grant of £200 and over the last two budgets we have increased it to £400, the view being that it would be progressively amplified. To agree to increase it to £1,000 would cost £11 million for existing carers and £35 million for the estimated 33,000 carers not in receipt of carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The issue of the two payments has been examined in the review of the carer's allowance published in 1998 and the view was that the current position should continue and only one should be made. This is the case generally throughout the social welfare code, the only exception being a concession given to widows to allow them to go back to the workplace, whereby they may claim half a disability benefit. My record as Minister in this area has been second to none.</P>

      <P>I would have to go into two pages to show all the amendments but in any event I hear what Senators say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have increased the disregard fairly significantly. In fact, the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs asked me, in the run up to the budget, to increase the disregards from £75 to £150 and from £150 to £250, and I <Col N="1148" /> did that. I would like to think that in the next budget we will look at the disregard again in order to bring more people into the carer's allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>I would have thought the Minister could accept this amendment because all he is being asked to do is to prepare a report so that we could see the implications of increasing the respite care grant. In fact, he is being asked to have others prepare a report; he does not have to do it himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Senator that the financial implications of increasing it for the existing people are £11 million and if the figure was expanded to 50,000, which represents a guestimate, it would be £35 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has said the implications do not sound so huge. Respite care can mean all the difference in terms of being able to keep someone at home. I am always sympathetic to carers because in child care one sees the child get older and things improve, whereas frequently those who care for the handicapped and the elderly see a worsening year by year. The only relief they can get is respite care. In these days of so much money could not the Department come up with the sum involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá brón orm go rabhas beagánín déanach agus tá súil agam nár chuir sé isteach ró mhór ar an Aire.</P>
      <P>This is a touchstone issue. It is £35 million, if we accept the Minister's figure, and he has more resources at his disposal. This country is populated by heroes and the most visible manifestation of that is the huge number of people who care heroically for children who are handicapped, for parents who are old and in need of long-term care or for partners. It is not the romantic kind of heroism; it is the practical kind. This allowance is a gesture by society &ndash; and that is all it is &ndash; to that heroism.</P>
      <P>We spend perhaps a few hundred million pounds to defend ourselves from foot and mouth disease, and rightly so. We can spend huge amounts on this and that so why is it that contributing to the real heroes of our society is always characterised by a penny pinching attitude? So what if it will cost £35 million? That is 1.5% of the budget surplus which is being used to pay off the national debt. That is the issue. Is doing this more important than paying off a bit of the national debt? I have no objection to paying off some of the debt &ndash; it is probably a reasonable idea &ndash; but the real question is whether it is more important economically and socially to spend £35 million to improve the lives of these heroes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are modest amendments. I am constantly embarrassed by the things we still do to people. One meets an elderly man pushing his elderly <Col N="1149" /> spouse in a wheelchair and on asking why they do not get a motorised wheelchair one is told that it would cost £2,000, that they are both on social welfare and that the health board has said that if they can produce £1,000 it will provide the other £1,000. That is not relevant to this. We are in a society which has limitless funds for so many things but which puts obstacles in the way of what is, relatively speaking, a small expenditure of £35 million. That is a huge sum of money to most people. It is the margin of error of the Estimates of most Departments in this State. It is money that could be directed at people whom we all acknowledge are among the real heroes in Irish society, the people who put practical care into our society &ndash; I have written about them often.</P>
    <P>What we are saying here is that this small increase for them is not huge in terms of cash, but in terms of the limited resources they have it would transform their lives. I do not understand why the Minister refers to review groups and so on. The review groups do not have to do what carers have to do. There is a huge need in issues like this to insert some reality into them because, in the general area of social policy, whether on homelessness, social care or income maintenance, the realities are different from the assessments of academics and professionals. This is an issue on which I genuinely believe the Minister is mistaken. The amount of money is not enormous, but the difference it would make to lives of ordinary people is huge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a relatively small amount of money in budget terms, but it would mean much to people who are involved as carers. The Minister reminded us that it was he who introduced the carer's allowance. However, this is something many people have been looking for, and we are looking at this in the context of a society that is much better off, a society that is talking about building a national stadium for £1 billion. What are our priorities here? I have no objection to a world class stadium for Dublin, but I object to penny-pinching in regard to issues like this when we could make a real difference to the lives of people who are on the margins, people who basically do not count. By enabling people to continue to care for invalids, elderly relatives and so on, we would save the State money because if people who are cared for within the family home had to be cared for in a nursing home, the cost to the State would be enormous. Recognising the job carers do and enabling them to continue to do it is what we are talking about here. The benefits of doing that are incalculable, and it can be done for a relatively small amount of money. That is the context within which we should look at these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the previous speakers have said in relation to this modest concession in terms of means testing for carers. Senator Keogh has just made the point that care <Col N="1150" /> provided in the home and the provision of a carer's allowance paid to a carer would cost the State about one quarter of what it would cost to care for a person in a State-run senior citizens' home or hospital. Currently there is a scandal about nursing home subventions and the State will now apparently have to compensate hundreds of thousands of people who were asked for money when the law provided that a much greater level of nursing home subvention should have been provided for in these cases. The Minister should, in every way possible, encourage the care of people in their own homes and within their own families as far as possible. We still have a wonderful caring culture. People leave work and give up a good income that could be three times the value of a carer's allowance to look after their elderly parents. However, some monetary compensation is necessary because they cannot live on air alone. That willingness to care is a precious part of our culture and it should be encouraged. However, by being mean-minded about small things that are really at the edge of this scheme we are discouraging it, with the result that many people feel very frustrated.</P>
      <P>The Minister should think anew on this. I am aware that his budget for the current year is set out, but this is something he should consider more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We all appreciate what carers do. I was probably the most vehement a couple of years ago in seeking to have the respite care grant increased. We all empathise with carers. No one party has a monopoly on caring. The main priority of the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs was to seek an increase in the income disregard this year because of the number of people who really need it but are not benefiting. I appeal to the Minister, perhaps by way of compromise, to agree to look at the possibility of increasing the respite care grant again this year. I appreciate that this year's budget and priorities have been laid out and that this Bill contains improvements for carers. However, nobody would say we have accomplished everything for carers. We all appreciate the job they do, seven days a week, 365 days a year. They deserve whatever we can do to make life a little easier for them. At the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs we prioritised the issue of increasing the income disregard for this year. Perhaps it is something we can look at again in the coming year.</P>

      <P>In answer to Senator Ryan, money is not limitless. There is always a limit on money. No matter how big the budget is &ndash; there was twice as much available to me this year as last year &ndash; it is still a little like the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Priorities must be decided. Are Senators saying that we should have spent the money we put into carer's allowance this year on the respite grant? Does that mean we should have <Col N="1151" /> taken it away from the increase in the disregard in relation to carer's allowance or from child benefit, or from old age pensioners? It is a matter of balancing all the priorities.</P>

      <P>There is always a limit on the amount of money. Since I came to office the number of recipients has increased from 9,000 to more than 17,000 and will further increase to 22,500 as a result of the budget changes. In addition, every one of them is a recipient of all the free schemes, which was not the case prior to this.</P>

      <P>The Government introduced the respite care grant, which has been increased progressively by £100 every year. As I indicated in the other House and earlier today, doing away with the means test is not the best way to target resources at those most in need. It would mean that a millionaire Senator who is a carer would be able to get the same amount of money as a poor Senator who might be pulling the devil by the tail.</P>
    </Speaker>

This is one of the reasons I introduced the innovative new carer's benefit scheme way ahead of its target date. This non-means tested scheme which is based on stamps record will, over time, become a significant scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the Government has penny-pinched This is only one aspect of caring. I fully accept Senator Henry's point that the Department of Health and Children has the primary responsibility in relation to caring for people and carers and ensuring there are respite beds in hospitals. A 200% increase in the resources allocated to this area over four years is not penny-pinching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers found fault with the carers' review which covered all schemes. I am obliged, as set down by the previous Government, to carry out expenditure reviews of all sectors. My Department has been the best performer in terms of expenditure reviews and we have been able to use them &ndash; I hope the Department of Finance is not listening to this &ndash; to change the schemes for the benefit of people. All the recommendations, bar two, of the carers' review &ndash; they were positive recommendations &ndash; were implemented in the first budget. I have with me the long list of <Col N="1152" /> changes made. One of the changes which escaped many people is that the carers of children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance are now eligible to apply for a carer's allowance. A huge number of people in receipt of domiciliary allowance with children between the ages of two and 16 years now qualify for the carer's allowance. This was a huge benefit for people with children with a disability.</P>
    <P>In addition, my colleague, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, did away with the anomaly which no one could understand and which had existed for years whereby people with children under two years could not qualify for a domiciliary care allowance. Following this change parents with children up to 16 years on domiciliary care allowance were able to get a carer's allowance. I also introduced all the free schemes for people in receipt of a carer's allowance. We relaxed the residency rule under which one had to be literally living on top of the person for whom one was caring. Within six months we relaxed the rules further after the matter was raised by many Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for one minute that there has been penny-pinching. I fully accept that more needs to be done not only by my Department, but also by the Department of Health and Children. Rather than abolishing the means test, the best way of dealing with the issue is to raise the disregards. We raised the disregards significantly this year so that a couple on an income of £15,100 can qualify for the maximum carer's allowance and all the free schemes, while a couple on an income of £25,000 can qualify for the minimum carer's allowance and all the free schemes. By raising the disregards progressively &ndash; I have given a commitment on this &ndash; we will get to a situation in the not too distant future where a family on the average industrial wage will qualify for the maximum carer's allowance and all the free schemes plus, I hope, an enhanced respite care grant.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;15.The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of increasing the respite care grant for recipients of carer's allowance and benefit to £1,000.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I want to make clear the purpose of the amendment. It is not about demanding an immediate increase in the carer's allowance or the immediate abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance. Rather it asks the Minister to prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of abolishing the means test. Such a report would contain much of what the Minister said, however contradictory it might be. He told us that he disapproved of abolishing the means test because it would mean a millionaire could be paid the carer's allowance, while in the next breath he told us he was introducing a carer's benefit which would not be means tested and which, presumably, the self same millionaire could avail of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Social insurance contains many ideas and has a long history going back to Bismarck. The Minister said the basic reason he was opposed to a non-means tested carer's allowance is that it would allow millionaires to avail of it. However, in the next breath he said he is introducing a carer's benefit which he admits millionaires can avail of provided they have made the appropriate contributions.</P>
      <P>We are recognising the heroism of carers and I do not care whether we do it through benefit or non-means testing. The only difference is that the current generation of carers find the means test to be a profound affront to what they do. The idea that in a few years' time they will be able, provided they make the appropriate contributions, to avail of it without a means test is a further affront to them because they know it is simply a way of delaying the inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also means that carers who are in a position to pay contributions will be treated differently from spouses &ndash; in most cases they are women &ndash; who will not be entitled to a carer's allowance because they never went out to work. Even though they do the same job of caring the Mini<Col N="1154" /> ster is saying that in one case they will not qualify for a carer's allowance because of their income, while the income will not matter in another case because they have the appropriate number of contributions. This is a contradictory argument.</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes that the scheme should be based on means, the whole idea of carer's benefit is a nonsense. However, if the carer's benefit is a way of funding a scheme to provide non-means tested carer's allowances, it would be better to immediately abolish the means test and require people at work to pay the carer's allowance through their social insurance contributions. Otherwise he is contradicting himself. He does not often do this but he has done so in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek a little latitude as I wish to digress slightly to another area of concern in relation to the carer's allowance. A new concept was introduced over a year ago that the cared for person must undergo a medical examination or be subject to the decision of the medical assessors of the Department before the carer's allowance is paid. It was generally accepted that the elderly person was suffering from some degree of infirmity and so long as there was bone fide a person to provide care, generally a member of the family, the carer's allowance was paid. I have come across a number of cases through my constituency work of people being frustrated having waited for months. In 2000 there was a backlog in the medical assessors' office of the Department in relation to the carer's allowance that was nothing short of a scandal. People waited for months, some died while on the waiting list for the medical assessors to give their decision as to whether they had a degree of illness or infirmity that qualified them to be regarded as a cared for person. Throughout the country there are elderly people&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hoped this plea for latitude would fall on the receptive ears of your good self as a good friend and colleague. It is a serious point and it is good that it be ventilated. If the Minister listens to what I have to say and is influenced and speaks to that section of his Department about delays and their interpretation of what is illness and infirmity, we would be doing a good service for carers and the cared for people. Throughout the countryside there are elderly people who appear to be in good health but they have a degree of infirmity which means it is unsafe for them to live alone and they need the <Col N="1155" /> assistance of a carer to guarantee their general welfare and safety. Elderly people who are not infirm, in the sense of needing a wheelchair or being bedridden, are at risk in terms of their safety and need somebody to live with them and to care for them. That was the principle when the scheme was introduced and medical certificates were not demanded. People were eligible for the scheme on age grounds. I ask the Minister to look at that issue because there is a problem and no doubt there are still delays in decision making by the medical assessors of his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligibility criteria were changed some time ago at the behest of some of the lobby groups who were unhappy that assessments were made at desks. An applicant would submit an application form with a doctor's certificate and the assessment was made without any examination. The reason was to protect people who were refused at a desk. My understanding is that there are no grave difficulties in that respect. If the Senator can produce evidence of recent cases I will undertake to look at them. I hazard a guess that if there is any delay it is due to the huge increase in the number of applications as a result of the change in the disregard and the many changes which have taken place in recent years. Applications have increased by 81% to date and as a result of the changes in the disregard this year an extra 5,000 will be eligible for carer's allowance plus 3,000 existing carers will get an increased payment.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Ryan, I am not contradicting myself. Perhaps Senator Ryan does not understand the difference between social insurance and social assistance.</P>

      <P>There is no situation where any social assistance payment is other than means tested. That is the rationale behind social assistance. Social insurance is on the basis of contributions paid right across the system, irrespective of means, where people are entitled to a payment as of right. The carer's benefit was requested by all the carers' associations and lobby groups and was a recommendation in the carers' review in 1998. If my memory serves me correctly, it was a commitment in Partnership 2000 or was about to be a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I recall Peter Cassells calling for this carer's benefit only to be told the decision was already announced to implement it even before it was included in the particular agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difference between social insurance and social assistance. I am also aware that a carer is a different category of person from any of the recipients of either social insurance or social assistance because they <Col N="1156" /> are not getting support either through insurance or assistance for themselves. They are getting support to enable them care for somebody else. Therefore, to produce precedents based on what social assistance is for &ndash; which is to help an individual or an individual family to survive &ndash; or social insurance is to ignore the question. The Minister quotes all the lobby groups. Does he believe the lobby groups on behalf of carers are happy with what he has done? They told me and virtually every Member of the Oireachtas they were not happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with a means test, which the Minister has demonstrated, is that a couple on £25,000 can be eligible for some of the carer's allowance plus the free schemes. For a couple with a family and a mortgage £25,000 is a low income on which to have to find some way of making provision for a dependant. It is conceivable to argue that on my own income level one could afford to do this without the assistance of the State. The cost of this is so high that it would not be worth while having a means test because what one would save would be minuscule. This is the continuing argument about means tests generally but in this case it is a particularly compelling argument. That is why I ask the Minister to get an independent person to look at this. The amendment simply asks for a report. I do not know why we cannot have reports to contribute to the debate, to advance the issues the Minister says are compelling &ndash; which I do not believe. I am disappointed at the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I suggest the Senator read the carers' review of October 1998. In relation to the lobby groups, a couple of weeks ago a conference was held in Newry of carers on the island of Ireland where they had speakers from Ireland, the UK and elsewhere. The unanimous view was that carers in the Republic were cared for in relation to supports from the Department of Health and Children and my Department far more than those in the UK and in Northern Ireland. Similarly, one of the lobby groups was in Wales recently and freely admitted and the people in Wales were of the view that the supports here were far better than in Wales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 19, before section 16, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of identifying key areas of disadvantage, both urban and rural, with proposals to give additional social insurance and social assistance supports to the population of those areas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is worth exploring the issue of whether differentiated payments should be available to communities that are suffering from disadvantage. It is already present in terms of the island allowance, but there is an argument that families that have to live in areas of multiple disadvantage need a considerably greater income if they are to be assisted to escape from it. I am moving the amendment in the hope of receiving enlightenment from the Minister who is in an enlightening mood tonight. We now know that he is an anarchist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to live in a rural part of the country that was once described as severely handicapped but is now called severely disadvantaged. That is an EU definition under the Common Agricultural Policy. There is no doubt that there are enclaves of poverty in rural areas and while I am not an expert in urban poverty, I recognise fully that it exists. To its credit, CORI has drawn attention to the levels of rural poverty. There are such enclaves where average income is barely 40% of the national average, and less than <Col N="1159" /> that in many cases. The income in such enclaves probably represents less than 30% of the average EU income.</P>
      <P>In 1989, the first national plan that was prepared for our application for EU Structural and Regional Funds was the best one in that it dealt in some detail with income structures in the various regions. The low income levels in many communities in the west and northwest regions were extraordinary but, relatively speaking, their position has not improved greatly. The proposed idea, that an in-depth look should be taken at these disadvantaged areas, is a good one. Areas of greater structural disadvantaged will thus be discovered. One will find people living on incomes who are not even getting social assistance, either because of pride or because they have a small farm and are deemed to have means that, on the face of it, would not appear to qualify them for social assistance. Very often these people will not stand up for their legal entitlements because of pride. Little is known about this matter which has not been greatly investigated or studied.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ryan for tabling this amendment. In a sense, it is related to amendments Nos. 32 and 33 in my name, relating to income support for small farmers who are, typically, very severely disadvantaged people in rural settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many supports in my Department for disadvantaged areas. The community development programme touches about 100 geographic areas and gives the necessary supports in that respect for community development. In the national anti-poverty strategy, there are targets in relation to urban and rural poverty, all of which have been examined. In the recent PPF, there was a Government commitment, which CORI strongly supported, to bring forward the RAPID programme. We did that and it has identified 25 distinct geographic areas. It so happens that those are all urban areas, which emerged from the particular methodology which had been agreed with the social partners. The Government has agreed that a further programme would be brought forward, additional to the PPF commitment, to identify rural areas and smaller towns. In those areas, there will be a much greater concentration of effort on bringing forward the national development plan in all its aspects, in conjunction with the community development boards. The amendment which Senators are proposing is not necessary because there is a huge effort being made to target those areas which are most disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put a case on record which I know to be true. It concerns a woman whom I regard as an outstanding coper. She juggled her limited income very well, but invariably there was a disaster every two or three months, when some unexpected item of expense caused an income <Col N="1160" /> deficit. She then started a procession from one agency to another, statutory and voluntary. She always said that her best source of help was the GP who could prescribe more tranquillisers so that she could cope with the stress of her income problems. One of the defining moments in her life was when she discovered the cost of the tranquillisers and that if the State had paid her a similar amount, she would not have needed the tranquillisers in the first place.</P>
      <P>Providing services is, of course, most important, but giving people incomes in their own hands is a major part of alleviating poverty. All my children attended primary schools classified as disadvantaged because of their location. About 40% of children from well-off families got the benefit of the extra expenditure on schools that were classified as disadvantaged. Frankly, those of us on the board of management did not tell the parents of that classification, as some of them would probably have taken their children out of the school if they knew. We just said that we had got more money. However, there is a case for identifying people who live in difficult areas and giving more money to the copers among them, many of whom are women, so that they can deal with their own issues in their own way. That is better than providing services, such as that of the GP who prescribed endless amounts of medication, at a cost which would have solved the problem in the first place.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;19.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the feasibility of introducing a free schools meals scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The restrictive nature of the school meals system is well known and is a matter of great concern to many families, having regard to the length of the school day for children and the issue of child poverty, to which we referred earlier. Teachers are concerned at the inability of some children to participate in class due to a lack of nourishment. The amendment simply asks to have the feasibility of extending the parameters of the scheme examined. Many children get no more than a sandwich and a glass of milk and they are unable to learn because they are hungry and lack energy. The more disadvantaged children in our society are particularly vulnerable. They are the ones who may go on to have their own problems and to create problems for others. The amendment seeks to explore ways to ensure that as many as possible of our children are adequately nourished at school in body as well as in mind and spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Minister has already worked out whether it is feasible to have a free meals scheme for school children. We should look at this area again. The breakfast clubs which operate in some disadvantaged schools have been a great success.</P>
      <P>In the earlier debate on food safety, I referred to the national nutrition survey of adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years. In the case of school children, we might well find that there are more children than from disadvantaged areas who have not got an adequate diet. We should try to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been actively considered in my Department. The school meals scheme run by some local authorities in urban areas is an old scheme dating from 1914. The expenditure is in the region of £700,000 per year. It has outlived its usefulness, in my view. Accordingly, I asked the Department, in conjunction with all the user groups, to look at possible changes. This examination is still ongoing but from the indications so far, I believe we should proceed along the lines of the breakfast clubs run by local communities in conjunction with the school authorities and teachers. I have visited one on the north side of Dublin and an excellent one in Drogheda which got substantial funding from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund to put in the infrastructure and my Department allocates <Col N="1162" /> money towards the running costs. I would like to believe that these clubs will be the model for the future.</P>
      <P>As a result of initial indications last year, I invested a sum of £100,000 &ndash; I accept this is a small amount of money &ndash; to assist the breakfast clubs that had begun operating without any assistance from the Department. That amount has been increased to £300,000 this year and I would like to believe that in the lead up to the next budget we will perhaps, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, carry out a fairly major examination and bring forward proposals for the extension, if possible, of the community led scheme nationwide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There are a number of school meal projects which are already up and running and which are being funded by my Department. Quite a number of other projects have applied to the Department because they know we have this money available. These projects are community led and must be encouraged from the bottom up. We hope to bring forward proposals before the end of the year so that these could get up and running and be provided with State funding, in due course. I cannot guarantee that this will occur before the beginning of the school year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;19.&ndash;The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a review of the social welfare provisions available to those who are seeking asylum and the need to increase indirect provision for this group of people to £20 per week for adults and £10 per week for children.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to an issue of much wider significance in our society. The difficulty is that many of those to whom the amendment refers are unable to seek employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are prevented from doing so. That is a great pity and this anomaly should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are asylum seekers and refugees in my constituency who would much prefer to be working. These people do not want to be a burden on the State, that was not their objective in coming <Col N="1163" /> here. They have come to Ireland in search of asylum and are seeking to set up home here because they were oppressed in their country of origin. Their objective is not to live off the State, but to contribute to society and help ease the labour shortage by availing of the employment opportunities on offer. It is mean spirited to give these people, who are prevented from obtaining gainful employment and who are hanging around looking for things to do, an amount of pocket money which does not allow them to buy very much. The objective of the amendment is to encourage the Government to take more immediate action in respect of this matter. In my opinion refugees and economic migrants are completely different. Regardless of this, however, their cases should be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the needs of school children, but the amount of money given to the asylum seekers and refugees whose children are attending school here does not allow them to pay for school trips or other activities in which those children want to be involved. The children to whom I refer are, to a certain extent, discriminated against because, unfortunately, racism is a fact of life in our society. They want to be seen as part of that society and we should take steps to remove anything which separates them from their peers. The amendment is a modest proposal designed to make their lives somewhat easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what I think about his views on various matters, the Minister is a pragmatist. I cannot see the pragmatic logic behind informing 5,000 or 6,000 people who happen to be living here for one or two years that we will accommodate them but that they will be compulsorily idle and that they will be paid a maximum disposable income of £15 per week. That amount would only buy one a pint and a newspaper. These people are obliged to do nothing all day, which is a recipe for prejudice.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to go beyond the terms of the amendment and to approach the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and inform him that far from telling people who come here to seek asylum that they cannot work, we should stipulate to them on their arrival that they can remain in this country while their application is being processed on condition that they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform often refers to the &ldquo;pull factors&rdquo;. However, I do not believe there is a scrap of evidence that allowing asylum seekers &ndash; who, in the main, are probably economic migrants &ndash; to work would make our existing problems worse. In my opinion allowing them to work would alleviate many of our difficulties because they would quickly be in a position to find accommodation of their choosing and would cease to be counted among the ranks of those who live in fixed bed and breakfast accommodation. I suggest that, apart from accepting this amendment, the Mini<Col N="1164" /> ster should discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the issue of allowing these people to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan on this matter. I accept that this is not the Minister's area, but there is a shortage of nurses in Ireland at present despite the fact that there are nurses from, for example, Nigeria living here. These people cannot obtain work in our hospitals because of delays in processing their cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept some of the arguments put forward by Members. However, this is not an easy issue for any Government to deal with. The amounts paid to asylum seekers and refugees &ndash; £15 and £7.50 &ndash; which were set last April are currently under review. They are being examined in the context of the level of payment and the administrative arrangements for their delivery. At present, these payments are delivered by my Department. The fact that asylum seekers and refugees are obtaining, as of right, £15 and £7.50 does not prevent them from obtaining any other reasonable expenses under the exceptional needs payments scheme, which is run by the community welfare officers. I know from experience that many people are receiving exceptional needs payments through the community welfare system.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of asylum seekers in receipt of social welfare payments such as unemployment assistance, one parent family payments, etc, and some of them, following the Government's decision last July, are allowed to work. In addition, asylum seekers, many of whom have children, are entitled to receive child benefit, as of right and based on their children's residency here, and they will benefit from the substantial increases in the rates of payment which will take effect in June of this year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 19, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;19&ndash;The Minister shall, within three months after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a feasibility study into doubling the fuel allowance scheme during the winter months.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the weather we have experienced over the past few months, many people are saying this is the worst winter we have had in a long time. Knowing the way old people suffer from the cold, it is terrible that they have to eke out their fuel allowance. That is harking back to the days <Col N="1165" /> before we all had central heating. Many old people do not have central heating. They rely on coal or whatever method of heat that is available to them and we should be more generous in the allowances we give them. Food, heat and shelter are important basic requirements which we all take for granted and we should be more generous with this allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The Minister made great play earlier about the increases in the weekly allowances to pensioners, etc, but the cat was let out of the bag when he said that when he was considering fringe benefits such as fuel allowance and so on, it was felt that the weekly allowance should be increased rather than fringe benefits such as the fuel allowance. In other words, old age pensioners were supposed to provide their fuel out of that additional £10 per week. That is not altogether a cost of living increase.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that since the free fuel scheme was taken over by the Department some time in the mid-1980s &ndash; prior to that I understand it was operated by the health boards &ndash; it was fixed at £5 per week but it has not been increased since that time. In that 12 or 15 years, however, the price of fuel has effectively doubled. It is derisory and insulting to give somebody £5 per week to buy one bag of timber, turf or coal and, while welcome, the Minister's concession this year in increasing the period from 26 to 29 weeks is paltry.</P>
      <P>That is one of the failures in the budget in terms of the outreach to elderly people. I knew two or three elderly people in my area who died from hypothermia. One person whom I knew, who was living alone, died this winter from hypothermia. That is little wonder if those people were depending on the fuel allowance to keep their houses warm. As Senator Keogh said, this is one of the coldest winters we have had at this latitude for many years. Due to global warming we had a series of relatively mild, wet winters but this year was the exception. There were many hard frosts and record low temperatures, especially after Christmas and, for the time of the year, in recent days.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance should be at least £20 per week to keep apace with the national fuel scheme which was introduced in the early 1980s or the late 1970s. That scheme was operated at the time by the health boards. To have the derisory sum of £5 per week in place for so long is inexcusable and it would not cost much to increase it to £10 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to broaden the debate slightly and in this case I am talking from experience because my mother would be in the category to which I want to refer. I hope she will never be short of the money to provide fuel because one assumes her children will look after her, but I want to talk about the principle. There is a cate<Col N="1166" /> gory of people who are not in receipt of any social welfare payment, for example, public service pensioners, and an allowance such as the fuel allowance is not available to them. We are talking about a diminishing number of people and it is worth thinking about this matter.</P>
      <P>I want to make a second point in relation to those people and older people generally. I do not know who came to the conclusion that it was better to increase the payment generally because my experience of older people is that they worry about money all the time. It does not matter how much money they have; they still worry about money. Even the Minister's hypothetical millionaire's widow will worry about money. If we say we will provide them with £10, £15 or £20 worth of fuel per week, which will not come out of the budget they have to manage but will be provided to them as of right, they will know that they will have whatever form of fuel they choose in their back yard all the time. That would be one less issue for older people to manage and it would make life easier for them.</P>
      <P>Somebody obviously came to a different conclusion when they recommended to the Minister that the best way to proceed was to increase payments generally. I am sceptical about that. We should be telling old people that they do not have to worry about heating because there is a large enough electricity allowance available and enough fuel will be provided to them as of right every week during the year so that they will always have loads of turf, coal or whatever fuel they want. From what I know of old people, that is an easier system and makes life less difficult for them rather than the alternative of giving them a larger income and telling them to manage it. That is putting an extra worry on the plate of older people.</P>

      <P>To answer Deputy Connor's question, to double the allowance from £5 to £10 would cost £41.5 million. I examined this issue this year and last year. My Department has been very workmanlike during my tenure, and it is a compliment to my staff, but they carried out an expenditure review which examined this issue in 1998. One of the main conclusions reached by the evaluation group was that the current rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that the price of fuel has increased in the past year. That was one of the reasons I looked at the issue very carefully this year but again it goes back to the amount of money available. It is the issue of the loaves and fishes. I could have put £25 million towards increasing the payment from £5 to £7.50 but any public representative, and even Deputy Ryan's mother, will say that the greater the amount of increase, the bigger the drop in their weekly income come April. This allowance is not just <Col N="1167" /> used to buy fuel, so a £10 reduction in their weekly income in April is felt by older people. Therefore, rather than put the money available into the fuel allowance I decided to increase the primary payments which means that people are getting a larger amount for 52 weeks of the year than the fuel allowance, which is now paid for 29 weeks; we increased the period by three weeks, which is welcomed. We also examined the possibility of concentrating some of the money we might have on the three winter months of the six months period but again we came down on the side of leaving it as it is because people's incomes are reduced by a certain amount over a certain period. It is an issue we will have to come back to. I think that ultimately the best thing &ndash; and it will not happen next year on its own &ndash; is to phase this out and phase the payment gradually from 29 weeks to 52 so that it is paid all year round.</P>

      <P>The freezing of CDAs, as with the previous Government, is based on research done by Combat Poverty and other agencies which suggests that all available money should go to child related payments. They recommend that CDAs be frozen because they are a disincentive to work as they are lost when people commence employment. Any money available should go to child benefit and we have done this. We continued that policy in recent years up to this year with the substantial increases in child benefit. There were 30 different rates of CDAs and are now only three which have been frozen for a number of years based on that policy.</P>

    <P>This is a simple amendment. We all know the difficulties encountered by families when children return to school. The beginning of the school year is particularly difficult and expensive. Often people think they have allowed for every item of expenditure and then find they had not thought of some purchases.</P>
    <P>It is expensive nowadays because children are bombarded by messages resulting in their making demands of their parents which can be difficult to realise. People in large families do not have the wherewithal to meet all the demands whether directly related to school or not.</P>
    <P>This is a way of alleviating the difficulty of those from large families or the disadvantaged. It is a simple amendment which the Minister should consider, if he has the figures. We want to increase the allowance and are not being prescriptive about the amount.</P>

      <P>This is again the area of marginal people in marginal work who are not well paid. There is still a large number of such people in society. On the issues like the back to school allowance, as well as supporting what Senator Keogh said, I suggest that the Minister talks to the Minister for Education and Science about how we fund education. It is not just people on social welfare who find things like the beginning of the school year difficult. There are many parents who struggle to meet all sorts of extras &ndash; the secondary schools who send the polite note looking £50 for this or £100 for that, the primary schools who say they are short and want everybody to bring in a pound or two a week.</P>
      <P>I think in terms of a poverty strategy which says the best way to deal with poverty is to have people in jobs that earn a worthwhile income. Dealing with the crises that people have at Christmas or the beginning of the school term is part of that strategy. The Minister should look not just at the back to school allowance but at the way we fund parents putting children through education. For many people it is a huge burden despite the pretence of free education.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I had a brief informal dialogue at the end of the Second Stage on the mobility allowance and how it affects people applying for tax relief for private transport. The generous but correct provisions in relief of excise duty and VAT on fuel made available for people who are physically handicapped to enable them to buy and use private transport are important for their independence.</P>
      <P>People eligible for £45 per month mobility allowance were delighted when the Minister for Finance announced with a flourish that he was doubling it. They were taken aback to discover that there was a clawback. In the initial way it was reported, if they availed of the tax relief for private transport they would not get the mobility allowance. The Minister explained it to me, and I may have misunderstood, that the £45 will continue for people who get the tax relief for private transport but only those not availing of tax relief will benefit from the doubling of the mobility allowance. I said to him that it was mean minded. I have no idea why it was done other than the well known fact that the Department of Finance does not approve of the generous tax relief for handicapped people with private transport. This is part of their continuing campaign to claw back some of it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 21, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&ndash;The Minister shall, a soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of allowing depreciation of capital expenditure to be permitted as a cost item for the purposes of the farm assist income assessment, particularly where it involves investments in environmental control measures.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am little surprised that amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are related, as they refer to two different schemes, but we will deal with both of them.</P>
      <P>Last year, I raised the matter of the farm assist scheme for lowest income farmers. It is a social welfare payment for farmers whose enterprises are totally uneconomical on their own. A couple of years ago this scheme was seen by the Government as the answer to another of the many serious depressions in farm prices. I believe that it was introduced in the budget of 1999. It was a bit of a swindle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It replaced the so-called farmer's dole. New assessments were made of farmers who had been in receipt of the old allowance. Many people lost out, which was wrong as most should have won on a scheme set up to respond to a drop in farm incomes which was particularly acute among small farmers. The assessment of means to determine eligibility for this scheme is unfair, because farmers are not allowed to claim as an expense investment in fixed assets, like environmental or waste controls or winter housing for cattle. They are not allowed to claim these as a depreciating cost. People who make claims for tax relief are allowed to claim against depreciating assets and are consequently given tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By implication, one speaks of profit when speaking of a tax return, yet this scheme is supposed to be for those who do not make money on their farms. The State believes it is helping by giving them this social assistance, but they are not allowed to claim against the expense of fixed items. To claim against the replacement of stock is allowed, which is fair enough. The IFA raised this contentious issue, as did I during the debate on last year's Social Welfare Bill and when I was a Member of the Dáil. This problem also applied <Col N="1171" /> to the farmer's unemployment assistance scheme, which this scheme replaced.</P>
    <P>The Government rightly insists that all farmers have proper environmental controls in place, regardless of the scale of their operation, but to do so costs a lot of money. In my amendment, I call for a report on the implications of allowing depreciation of capital expenditure to be permitted as a cost item for the purposes of the farm assist income assessment, particularly where it involves investments in environmental control measures. We insist that they make major expenditure on environmental control measures like waste management, control of pollution and control of effluent, and rightly so. It is fair, however, that they be allowed to write it off as a depreciating asset, as is the case under the tax code. This would improve their means in applying for farm assist. I ask the Minister to seriously look at this important point.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 32, we ask that forest premia be disregarded for the purposes of farm assist. I mentioned on Second Stage that we have a policy to establish forestry covering 17% of this country's land mass by 2030. I do not think that 7% is covered by forestry at the moment. We are doing things to encourage the achievement of the objective of 17% coverage by 2030, such as the exemption from declaration for tax purposes. I must declare an interest as I have a small area of commercial forestry, from which I earn a small income of around £300 per year. It is nice that these earnings are tax-free. If my total farm income came from forest premia, I would not have to declare it for tax. Small farmers on the farm assist scheme, however, have to declare their farm assist premium, which might amount to only £400 or £500 per year. If we assume it is £500, a very little amount, it would mean £10 per week extra to the farm assist allowance were they allowed to write off that premium against their means.</P>
    <P>If the tax return is for income tax they do not have to declare it &ndash; it is free gratis. It is a disadvantage when they apply for this scheme however, which is merely intended to keep them out of poverty. The arguments I have made regarding these two concessions are unanswerable. The Minister cannot successfully debate these issues to the contrary, as there is so much evidence concerning the way these matters are treated for tax purposes. This problem obviously proceeded from somebody in the Minister's Department not understanding the relationship between the scheme and the tax system. It will not cost a lot of money and is simply a question of fair play.</P>
    <P>The scheme also improves environmental protection on farms, which I fully support. We ask farmers to deploy best environmental practice, including those on small farms where there are <Col N="1172" /> low levels of intensity of agriculture. If they adhere to this and make the investment, we should not penalise them. I rest my case, and I hope that the Minister has heard well what I have to say. This matter is not open to debate. It is an argument I cannot lose, and I do not say that arrogantly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor spoke of anomalous matters with regard to means testing, which is a matter I raise most years. The reason I know about this is that it happened to an aunt of mine who has been dead for four or five years. If a person in receipt of social welfare benefit or assistance has an accident and is compensated for losses that arise, the sum of money they are given is used to assess means and thereby reduce their social welfare payment. It seems extraordinary that this happens, and indeed it happened to my aunt, and makes a mockery of the concept of compensation. It surely cannot be an expensive item.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that an elderly person should go through the trauma of a court case and be awarded £20,000 or £30,000, only to discover their previous income from social welfare is reduced by a proportionate amount to take account of what is called &ldquo;new means&rdquo;. The &ldquo;new means&rdquo; is actually compensation for a loss that had been incurred. I do not expect the Minister to solve it now, but I mention it as an anomaly like that raised by Senator Connor. It deserves to be looked at and is not an expensive issue.</P>

      <P>Wearing my other hat as a solicitor before I came to this House, I often encountered clients who were very annoyed when it was published in the newspaper that they received compensation. It meant that the social welfare authorities would quickly follow them to take back some money. That has always been the way, because people cannot be effectively be paid twice in relation to particular instances.</P>
      <P>I understand the concerns of the Senator. On the other hand, the Department did not hear about those people who settled their cases privately unless they declared the money. There have been generous changes in relation to the capital people can have before their means tested payment is touched. It is only fair that cognisance is taken of the fact that someone gets a massive amount of money in compensation, which ultimately is the taxpayers' money, because up to that the means tested payment they were getting was to assist them as they were on low income. However, that is not the point of this amendment.</P>
      <P>This issue was raised in recent debates on the Social Welfare Bill. Depreciation of farm buildings is not and has not been taken into account in the social welfare code in any assessment.</P>

The IFA has been in contact with my Department on this issue and discussions are ongoing. We are taking cognisance of some of the points raised by the IFA and by people such as Senator Connor. This issue is being considered.</P>
      <P>The forest premium scheme is designed to replace farm income from the change of use of land from ordinary farm activity to forestry. It is unlike REPS and the compensation payments made under the SACs which compensate farmers for the material and work they put into the land to comply with the basic agri-environmental regulations of the SAC plans. The payments under the forest premium scheme would equate to other types of farm income and that is why they are regarded as income and assessed as such, as opposed to the system in relation to REPS and SACs. I cannot concede on that issue as that is the way the system operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply which is totally inadequate and deliberately misses the point. If a farmer is forced to make a capital investment in his farm, it will have a depreciating effect on his income. That is accepted under the tax code and it should be <Col N="1174" /> accepted under the social welfare code. It would be accepted if this matter was approached fairly and justly.</P>
      <P>As regards the forest premium, I forgot to mention that the first £3,000 of REPS income is disregarded for someone on the farm assist scheme. The Minister said it is different, but it is not different. It is a generous payment made to the farmer by the European Union and it does not cost the Exchequer. These schemes, such as the beef premium scheme, the suckler cow scheme, etc, often increase the incomes of small farmers and that is used by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to reduce the level of farm assist. In other words, we are making money out of the money the farmers are drawing down as a result of our membership of the EU and under the provisions of the Common Agricultural Policy. That is unfair in every way and that is why I must put this issue to a vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not change the position this year, although I made the same point last year. I hope this gesture tonight will make such an impact on the Minister or the Department that this issue will be addressed next year. My argument cannot be defeated because there are comparisons with the tax system and with the disregard for the forest premium under REPS.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 21, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the feasibility of allowing individuals who were prevented from making voluntary PRSI contributions due to insufficient income at the point where compulsory social insurance cover was extended to the self-employed in April 1988 to be permitted to do so now.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> This relates to an anomaly resulting from the introduction, in 1988, of contributions for the self-employed, including farmers. This was very good but originally to qualify for the minimum old age contributory pension one had to have ten years of contributions. When Deputy De Rossa was Minister for Social Welfare that was very contentious for many who did not have ten years to go to retirement age. They were 56, 57 and 58 years of age and were required by law to make contributions, yet they found that having reached the age of 65 that they could not get a <i>pro rata</i> pension. That was corrected in the budget for 1997 when the first steps were taken to give a <i>pro rata</i> pension to people who had made at least a number of contributions. The Government has continued to improve that and last year those with five years of contributions qualified for a<i> pro rata</i> pension.</P>
    <P>Even among those who were eligible to contribute for ten years there were quite a number who were not legally bound to do so if their income was below a certain level. There were many farmers who made a contribution in five of the ten years that their income was at a certain level. They now find that they do not qualify for a pension purely because the system did not allow them to make a contribution. It is for them that I make the case in this amendment. While much has been done to make the system more just we need to go a number of steps further, this being one of them. These people would have paid their £300, or whatever the sum might have been, each year but their income did not require them to do so. They never knew that they were robbing themselves of a contribution that was necessary for them to qualify for some form of contributory pension upon reaching 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>This is about correcting an unintentional injustice which resulted from a scheme that was not well thought out. We ask the Minister to go the final step on this occasion, close all the loopholes and correct the unjust aspects of the system. There I rest my case having made an argument that is difficult, if not impossible, to gainsay.</P>

      <P>I commend Senator Connor for tabling this important amendment. Quite a number of people are caught in this way, particularly small farmers and, in some instances, a number of very small business people. In 1988 when this measure became compulsory a number of small farmers, whom I know personally, were not notified by the health boards which were the agencies whose responsibility that was. The result is that there are people caught in this catch-22. When Deputy De Rossa was Minister he undertook a study of this and advancements have been made in relation to those who paid five years of contributions or more, but I concur with what Senator Connor has said. It would not be a great cost to the State to take care of the handful that this relates to, most of whom have had their cases highlighted over the years. There are records of <Col N="1176" /> those affected and it would be a great relief to them.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, assets are disposed of to qualify for the non-contributory old age pension and that leaves many in a vulnerable position, feeling insecure and threatened. This would be a huge relief to them &ndash; we are talking about people whose earnings are very small. At one time there was serious economic stress and some were simply not in a position to make the contributions. The Minister has made a lot of progress in his Department in recent years and I appeal to him to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Connor.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects in relation to these two amendments and to a certain extent the two previous speakers have spoken on both of them. In 1988 the Minister decided that it was appropriate that people on low incomes &ndash; the figure chosen was £2,500 &ndash; should not have to pay a contribution. They probably could not afford to live if they were required to contribute out of such a sum. The figure was set on the same basis as for employees who were not required to pay a stamp up to a figure of £2,500 at that time. That was the then figure set for old age non-contributory pensions so that anyone on or below that would not have to pay. It has not been increased to the advantage of many in the intervening years. All those whose incomes remained under £2,500 would have been entitled to apply for unemployment assistance, small holder's dole or, now, farm assist.</P>

      <P>Previous speakers said that Deputy De Rossa actually brought in the <i>pro rata</i> pension, but that is not the case. This Government brought that in. I well remember telling my dear colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, when he was going on the Rodney Rice programme one morning, that the Government was strongly considering the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>pension for those who were excluded from the self-employed pension because they were over 56 in 1988 and therefore did not have the minimum ten years' contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well recall Deputy De Rossa swallowing his tongue, or his false teeth, if he has any, when Deputy O'Keeffe announced that the Government was going to do this. He disbelieved it and went so far as to ring my Department on the Monday to find out if this was true because when he was Minister he rallied against it. He accepted <Col N="1177" /> the advice of the officials hook, line and sinker, but this Minister did not. He decided that as a commitment had been given in our pre-election manifesto we would look after those who were unfairly excluded because they could not accumulate contributions over ten years. We did so by bringing it back to five years. Many people have been included as a result of that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because we have gone further than we promised prior to the last election when we said we would help people who had been marginally affected. That promise was not in any way to give them a <i>pro rata</i> pension or a special rate pension, which we have given them. Despite pressure on previous Governments of every hue, they did not capitulate, including Deputy De Rossa as Minister. I have capitulated. Deputy Proinsias De Rossa did allow people who had made a contribution to get back the portion of the payment related to old age pension that they had made over that period. The people were, rightly, not satisfied because they had been compulsorily required to make contributions, even though the ten year limit meant that they could not qualify, being 56 years of age in 1988. The proposed amendments are in no way required because the Government has made amazing changes in this area in order to give people who were excluded the ability to apply for a pension.</P>

I give this Minister credit for what he has done, but there is unfinished business here, and I am only asking him to address that rather than ranting on with this mantra of self-congratulation and boasting about what he has done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this relates to section 29 or to section 30. My comments relate to Part 5 which has to do with the alignment of the tax and calendar years. The Minister has said that for understandable reasons it may not be possible to pay people on 1 January and that the money will be paid later. However, people on social welfare do not have the spare resources to wait two months. One way of dealing with it would be to pay an increased bonus to people coming up to Christmas to compensate them for the inevitable delay. From what the Minister has said, we might be talking about an increase of £20 a week. That is a large amount of money in terms of people's incomes, and to leave them waiting for two months is to make their situation quite desperate. They are not like the rest <Col N="1180" /> of us who can go to our comparatively friendly bank manager and ask him to hold on because we have money coming. People do not have those resources, and one solution would be to pay them an increased allowance at the end of the current year to cover them for the two months it will take the administrative system to catch up on the euro and other problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be factual and fair to everyone, including myself. Comments were made as to why we pushed the budget as far as 5 December, given that we are bringing in the social welfare and tax changes on 1 January. Irrespective of whether we picked 5 December or an earlier date, say in October, we still would not have been able to deliver payments on 1 January because of the quite difficult system of post office books which are changed twice a year. We would have needed to announce the changes in July in order for payments to be made on 1 January.</P>
      <P>The sizeable number of people who receive their social welfare payments through electronic fund transfer will be paid on 1 January. If people want to be paid on 1 January they can have their payments made through electronic fund transfer. The vast majority of people on social welfare are paid by the book process, swipe cards or cheques and there will inevitably be some delays.</P>
      <P>We have increased the Christmas bonus this year from 70% to 100%. It is a separate issue. Everyone does not receive the Christmas bonus so it would not take care of the situation to which the Senator referred. The Senator can take it that the Government is endeavouring to keep the time between the budget and the delivery of payments as tight as possible. The Government has agreed, because of the difficulty with post office books, to allow further investment in machinery by the company awarded the contract to ensure that it is able to able to deliver within a much shorter time than heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective commentators who suggest that the date of the budget has something to do with the next election are not anywhere near the truth. It is simply a matter of administrative convenience. One objective commentator concluded that the next election was the only reason he could see for the date of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of those objective commentators prophesied that the Government would not last until the end of the summer of 1997. A number of people believed the Govern<Col N="1181" /> ment would announce a budget in October and go to the country in the autumn. We did not do that and caused much surprise among the political wizards around the House who are not politicians. In any event, the Government would not announce a budget in December. This is a good indication that we will do what we have been saying for a long time, that is, we will endeavour to see out our full period in office.</P>

The introduction of the euro will be an enormous shock for society generally and a particular shock for people who are badly off and in many cases, by definition, not well educated. Does the Department have any measures which will help people to understand the implications of the changeover to the euro? I am not a successful self-employed businessman who thought the value of his money would be reduced by 20% because the euro would only be worth 80 pence. I am concerned about people who believe they will be ripped off.</P>

People will gain in social welfare terms as a result of changeover to the euro. I fully accept the Senator's point about the difficulties which exist, particularly when one thinks back to the confusion which existed about the introduction of decimalisation. There will probably be further confusion on this occasion and I assure the Senator that we are keenly aware of this. Major work is being undertaken and there will be an information campaign in the not too distant future so that people fully understand the situation in relation to the changeover to the euro.

      <P>I also thank him for his fairly comprehensive responses. One of the misfortunes of being a member of a small party is that one ends up dealing with many Ministers. While one does not ever get cross with a Minister for not accepting amendments, it is annoying when he will not deal with the issues raised. In fairness, the Minister dealt with all the issues raised by the Opposition. We may not have agreed with the way he dealt with them but he did not duck or avoid any of them. This is to credit and it makes everyone's life a good deal more pleasant.</P>
      <P>On a personal note, somebody close to me had dealings with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs twice during the past four or five years. In contrast to the situation 15 years ago, the Department is a model of efficiency. I am sure there are anomalies but my family's experience of the Department is of a good quality service provided quickly and efficiently with the minimum of fuss. Whatever my views about policy, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has advanced considerably in terms of the efficiency with which it deals with its customers.</P>

      <P>I will be seeking an extension of time. The matter is about the elections in Uganda a week ago and the issue is that Irish aid to the extent of £19 million is being given to this nation. The President of Uganda is Yoweri Museveni, a man for whom this country has had great regard, and rightly so, for many years. The President of Uganda took over at a very difficult time after 15 years of tyranny, after atrocities in the reign of Idi Amin, and economically he has done an extremely good job for that country. It would be absurd and churlish in making a point about what happened in Uganda last week not to acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the economic achievements have been almost unprecedented in many developing African countries. There has been a 20% drop in the poverty level in Uganda during this man's rule. He introduced free primary schools which is a great achievement in a country as poor as Uganda and there has been fairly consistent economic growth. It has been a stellar country, one of the stars of Africa and of the developing countries in Africa in recent years, but there has been an underlying political trend which is alarming &ndash; there has been one president for 15 years. One-body states are not regimes of which this country can positively approve. While we have, with due care, given £19 million, which was doubled in the past year, to this country we do not appear to make the same demands on Uganda as we made on other countries in terms of foreign aid. The problem here has not been what the President has done with the money, but that Mr. Museveni has been the darling of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Africa for many years and many of the blemishes of his foreign and internal policies obviously have gone unnoticed and uncorrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October on a Dublin visit he was feted and treated to a banquet, probably a State ban<Col N="1185" /> quet. He was given all the honours due to a head of State from an autonomous independent country. After that, almost concurrently &ndash; I am sure it is a coincidence &ndash; the President of Uganda gave full support to Ireland in its quest for a seat on the Security Council and managed to influence many other countries to support Ireland. I am not necessarily saying there was a <i>quid pro quo</i> in terms of the £19 million but there are obviously very close links and we have a reason to be grateful to the President of Uganda for supporting us on the Security Council.</P>
    <P>It must have been with great horror and shock that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at that Department, who are absent, heard of the elections last week held by the President of Uganda, who has done so much for that country, because those elections were improper by international standards. This was a presidential contest between the President and an opposition party. The reports which have come out, which are authoritative, are of ballot rigging, intimidation and ballot stuffing, and that police took over from polling agents. What has happened? Where is the protest from Ireland, the great champions of democracy? All we seem to do is give the President more money. There were reports that ballot papers were filled out and of serious intimidation. It is not good enough that bilateral aid should be given unconditionally, not just in terms of the way it will be spent, but in terms of the regime it is supporting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's reply should acknowledge the economic responsibility the President has shown but should issue the strongest possible protest that we in Ireland who have taken the moral high ground in democratic systems in the past on Iraq and South Africa and in relation to foreign affairs matters in other countries will no longer give aid to countries which do not abide by appropriate democratic standards. Uganda does not come into that category. I hope the Minister's reply will not be a collection of euphemisms, garbage and misleading illogical statements which simply serve to cloud the issue. What I hope he will say is that Uganda has for long been a priority country for Ireland's aid, we acknowledge it has been a one party State during that period, we are deeply shocked by the fact that the President of that State has allowed himself to be re-elected in a manner of which we disapprove strongly and that we are now reviewing the matter with a view to reducing or eliminating aid to Uganda until we are satisfied the country is run on proper democratic principles.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I appreciate that you noted I was formerly Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development at the Department of Foreign Affairs. On occasions substitute Ministers come into the House. Senator Ross is aware <Col N="1186" /> that this is common practice not just in this House, but also in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bad practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is not something to be encouraged but such situations arise. The Senator asked about the whereabouts of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. The Minister of State is ill and I was asked to substitute for her. She is the appropriate Minister of State to deal with this issue as she has responsibility for the considerable aid budget.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I wish to outline the Government's position on aid to Uganda. The development programme in Uganda makes a material difference to people's lives and contributes to the economic development of the country as a whole. I will come back to the question of our aid programme in Uganda later but I will first address the recent presidential election.</P>
      <P>We have been closely following developments in the election in Uganda and have been receiving regular reports from our embassy in Kampala. The election was monitored by observers from a number of countries, as well as by personnel from foreign embassies, including our own and those of EU member states. In addition, an NGO umbrella group &ndash; the NEM group &ndash; deployed 17,000 monitors throughout Uganda who were present at most polling stations.</P>
      <P>The assessment made by our embassy and by this wide range of observers is that the election was imperfect but essentially fair. The observers acknowledged that there were malpractices, some of which were quite serious, in a number of districts perpetrated mainly by supporters of President Museveni. However, these were deemed sufficiently restricted not to have altered the overall outcome. The NEM group, in a preliminary assessment, described these incidents as random and judged the elections to have been carried out generally in accordance with law. In other words, despite the flaws, the outcome is judged to reflect the will of the people.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless we are perturbed that there should have been such incidents during the election and by reports of intemperate language used by the victorious side following the election. For instance, there were allegations of linkages between the opposition and the former dictatorial regimes in Uganda. Additionally we are troubled by reports that the opposition candidate, Dr. Kaizza Besigye, was prevented from leaving the country over the weekend. Our concerns on these matters will be conveyed to the Ugandan Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, all of this needs to be looked at in two contexts. The first context is the one already mentioned, namely, the judgment by the wide array of observers who were deployed around the country that, notwithstanding serious incidents in <Col N="1187" /> a number of districts and bearing in mind the tension arising from the fact that this was the first serious challenge to the incumbent President, the election was essentially fair and the outcome reflects the public will. The second context is the fact that governance in poorer countries is itself a development issue and that against the background of the chaos from which Uganda has emerged in a little over 15 years and the general instability in the region, this open election between two strong contestants can be seen as a significant and positive step in the evolution of functioning democracy. Additionally, it is not inconceivable that this rumbustious electoral process, which was the first serious challenge to the President, will further the development of a strong opposition.</P>
    <P>It is important to support this evolution in governance. Considering the chaotic situation from which Uganda has emerged in the past two decades and the problems in governance in so many parts of Africa, one should accentuate the positive. In that regard one must note the following, all of which have emerged in recent years. First, Uganda has a free and open press with one newspaper consistently critical of the government and a network of independent radio stations around the country. Second, Uganda has a well developed system of functioning decentralised government based in turn on a strong, vocal civil society which is outspoken in its comments on government policy.</P>
    <P>Third, the eradication of poverty is the core aim of a partnership approach agreed between the Ugandan Government and the donor community. There is significant progress to report. The percentage of the people in Uganda living below the poverty line has fallen from 56% in 1992 to 35% in 2000. This in turn arises from consistent strong economic growth of between 5% and 8% over the past five years. Fourth, Uganda has shown strong leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS and has set standards for other African nations in the fight against the disease.</P>
    <P>As Uganda has striven in recent years to create an enabling environment for development and for the emergence of democracy, Ireland, with most western donors, has become a committed partner in its development efforts. We have committed resources to assist Uganda's economic and social development through a strong aid programme through which we will spend £19 million in 2001 on health, including HIV/AIDS, education, water and sanitation, roads, the productive sector and governance. The budget will be spent in accordance with a three year strategy negotiated with the Ugandan authorities which is based on an agreed assessment of needs.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress the need to take a balanced view of what has happened in Uganda. An electoral process, however flawed and worrisome, has given an essentially fair result. This has taken <Col N="1188" /> place against a background of growing openness and respect for rights bolstered by significant economic and social improvements. Uganda has a long way to go to achieve full development in every sense but its efforts so far deserve our continuing support.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross suggested that I would return to my own Department and that this issue would be forgotten. That is not the case and I will ask my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to closely examine the content of the Senator's contribution. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development I am concerned about the quality of our aid programme. I have outlined the Government's position and I have no doubt it is well focused. As Minister of State I visited many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Zambia, the more troubled regions of Somalia, Rwanda, Sudan and other areas. I have nothing but admiration for the dedicated staff we have in these countries who provide quality aid programmes. The World Bank, among others, has singled out Ireland for its focused aid programme.</P>
    <P>I saw at first hand how our quality programme works but I respect the right of Senators to raise questions about the political context in which this aid operates. It is important that we are vigilant as to how our aid is used in the poorest regions in the world. That will be done and it is important that we constantly review our aid programme. However, I have nothing but the highest admiration for those people, including the Minister of State, who are delivering our aid programme which has significantly increased in recent years.</P>

The Minister of State spoke about the malpractices which did not affect the overall outcome. That may or may not be true although the estimates are around 15%. Can he assure me that the concerns he has said would be conveyed to the Ugandan Government will be made public so we know the wording used and the extent of the protest?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for responding to this matter on the Adjournment. The need to establish a task force for Tipperary town, in view of the lack of industrial development there, has been brought to my attention, and that of others, over a number of years. Tipperary is an historic town but it has suffered many job losses over a long period. Some years ago, the Tamberan plant closed with the loss of 350 jobs. Many other plants, including 7-UP and Kiely's Bakery, were also affected.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of initiatives to establish factories, particularly the Pall Corporation and the Tipperary Co-op, which are progressing well. However, Tipperary town has a decreasing population at a time when other areas in the county are expanding due to the Celtic tiger. There is an urgent need for an advance factory to be built, but that message is not getting through to the proper authorities. That is why I am asking for some agency to be established to assess the problem initially and then to set out the required solutions.</P>
      <P>Tipperary town has a huge amount of pride and on a community basis it has established what many other areas have not. It has one of the most successful recreation centres in the country, the Canon Hayes centre. In co-operation with south Tipperary County Council it has added a swimming pool which has been named after Mr. Seán Treacy. Many other community initiatives have taken place there. If Tipperary town got some support it would benefit more from the economic growth that is taking place in other areas. I would like to hear the Minister's response on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Senator's concern about the need to promote greater industrial development in Tipperary town which, unfortunately, experienced job losses in recent years in a number of foreign-owned and indigenous enterprises. This impacted adversely on the economic and social life of the area but, despite these job losses, significant progress has been made in generating new jobs in the Tipperary town area. This progress has been facilitated by strong community participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> In particular, I refer to IDA Ireland's attraction of overseas companies, such as Pall Corporation and Continental Promotions, which are providing valuable employment in Tipperary. IDA Ireland is working closely with the new owners of the former Namco factory with a view to attracting a new project and is also promoting industrial sites for projects. A further priority for the agency is the provision of an advance factory for Tipperary town and this matter is being pursued in line with the recommendation of the Seagate Task Force report.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also participating strongly in promoting industrial development in Tipperary town, including, for example, financial assistance for the enterprise centre, and for Tipperary Mushrooms, a joint venture between Tipperary Co-operative Creameries and Monaghan Mushrooms, to develop the mushroom industry in the area. This latter project is expected to create 100 jobs over the next three years, with further substantial employment in the mushroom growing sector.</P>
    <P>The South Tipperary County Enterprise Board, in co-operation with local development interests, has also had considerable success in promoting the establishment and expansion of enterprises and training-management development programmes in the Tipperary town area. There have been 17 new start-up projects in the past five years. The establishment of the community enterprise centre, including the provision of incubation units and a training centre for teleworking, and the provision of additional tourist accommodation, have also been important local initiatives in generating employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The proposed high-tech IT enterprise centre in the town, which is being promoted by the West Tipperary Enterprise Development Association and is being financially supported by a number of State agencies, including the county enterprise board and Enterprise Ireland, should be of considerable benefit to the area.</P>
    <P>FÁS has also played a significant role in addressing the training and retraining needs of workers in the area and in the promotion of community-based projects.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and balanced regional development. This is undertaken in a way which develops the resources and potential of each region. The development agencies are focused on achieving this aim through their regional development strategies and have deployed additional resources at regional level with a view to achieving a better distribution of industrial investment in the regions.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the agencies and local development and other interest groups in promoting job creation continues to impact positively on Tipperary town. The agencies work closely with the South Tipperary County Development Board and South Tipperary County Council, as <Col N="1191" /> well as other local interests, to facilitate an integrated development approach and promote a favourable environment for business in the area. In these circumstances and given the focused agency approach in co-operation with local development interests and the progress to date, I do not consider it necessary to establish a specific task force for industrial development for Tipperary town. I am confident that the combined <Col N="1192" /> efforts of the State agencies and local interests will result in the continued social and economic development of the area. Clearly, in such circumstances &ndash; similar circumstances arose before &ndash; we will, of course, review developments over the coming months to assess the requirements of the area.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 March 2001.</P>
