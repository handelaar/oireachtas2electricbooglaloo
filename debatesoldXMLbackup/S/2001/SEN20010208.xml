      <P>I have notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to set up a task force following the closure of Dawn Dairies, Moate, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to expedite approval for the Ballina, County Mayo, water supply scheme, stage 3, in view of the serious shortfall of water in Ballina and the need for pipe replacement and a new reservoir.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the delay in setting up a forum on traditional medicines and natural health products.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Cassidy and Caffrey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Avril Doyle may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, statements on the Nice summit, to be taken from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 <Col N="122" /> minutes, and Senators may share time; No. 3, motion re Maternity Protection Act, 1994, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 for one hour; and No. 4, motion re the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, to be taken with No. 3 for the purposes of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senators are still offering at the conclusion of time allowed on No. 3, will the Leader adjourn rather than conclude the debate so the matter can be resumed at a later stage? Will the Leader indicate the legislation he proposes to introduce this session? Yesterday he stated there would be a large volume of legislation and that some Bills would be initiated in the Seanad. Will he give the House some specifics as to the realistic timetable for this session?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader also arrange a debate on the relocation of the Abbey Theatre which was raised in the House yesterday? However, the important issue is not so much the relocation of the theatre as the role it plays in national life. The Abbey Theatre receives a very high level of subvention and many people wonder if it justifies its existence and the role we expect of a national theatre. Perhaps the debate on its relocation could be widened to consider the role of the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Debate on the Nice summit and related matters will be ongoing and Senators may be offering at 3 p.m. I appreciate that the Leader has extended the time somewhat, but if the debate is not concluded at 3 p.m. we should resume at a later date.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Norris raised the issue of the relocation of the Abbey Theatre. I agree with the Senator's comments and we should debate this issue. The House should immediately become involved in this issue. Perhaps we should debate the matter next week to give us time to prepare information and examine the background to this decision.</P>
      <P>Apart from the demand that the Abbey Theatre be a cultural beacon, it also has a responsibility to the area in which it is located. It is not good enough that this decision has been taken. The House should offer a view on this matter within the next week. It is unacceptable that the theatre should take this so-called unanimous decision to move without reference to taxpayers who are, effectively, its paymasters.</P>
      <P>There are proposals for the development of the north side of Dublin and many other areas which include the construction of theatres such as in Tallaght, Blanchardstown and other areas. The Abbey Theatre is a crucial element in the cultural life of the north side of the River Liffey and we should strongly indicate our views on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>You are correct, a Chathaoirligh, I got carried away. On a number of occasions during the last session Senator Quinn raised the issue <Col N="123" /> of inflation and anti-inflationary measures which, no doubt, will be referred to during the debate on the Nice summit. There is a need for a continuing debate on the impact of the budget, our economic direction, the impact of the State's financial and fiscal policies, how the social partnership process is working and related matters. Will the Leader arrange for such a debate in, perhaps, two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I also agree with the call to extend the debate on the Nice summit. Such an extension will be necessary as we have not yet seen a draft treaty. It is good that the Taoiseach is coming into the House. This matter is of considerable concern and may require a constitutional amendment by way of a referendum. We should discuss the matter on an ongoing basis and we should certainly return to it once we receive the draft treaty.</P>
      <P>We are only now seeing the enormity of the decision to relocate the Abbey Theatre. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, recommended the refurbishment of the existing site and made £50 million available for that project. The Office of Public Works and the Abbey Theatre's architects also recommended refurbishment of the existing site. Treasury Holdings offered a site on the north side of the River Liffey in the new Spencer Dock plan which has just been put on display by the Dublin Docklands Authority. However, the board of the Abbey Theatre went against all these recommendations. It is highly irresponsible for the board to act in this fashion and we should consider asking it to step down.</P>

      <P>The Gate Theatre will be the only cultural entity left on the north side. The tourist office has been transferred from O'Connell Street to Andrew Street, which is a move from the north side to the south side of the city. Everything is moving to Dublin 2 or Dublin 4. I would like an early debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for advising me. The commission on teaching and learning, which was announced by the Minister for Education and Science, is important. We should invite the Minister to come into the House to discuss such issues as teachers' salaries, the professional development of teachers, teacher training, structures in education, educational access, discrimination and the two-tiered system, which we discussed yesterday in Private Members' time. Now that the commission on teaching and learning has been established, I ask <Col N="124" /> the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to hear the views of Members on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I caught your eye yesterday, a Chathaoirligh, but the fact that I did not means I must get my cataracts examined again. You were extremely indulgent to Members yesterday. I want to speak about the Ombudsman's report as I am the only former ombudsman in the House. It is an impressive report. The depth of research, the period over which the discussions took place and the trenchancy with which it is expressed makes it an important report. We have been lucky with the ombudsmen in this State. The Ombudsman is a lonely position. He is an officer of the Oireachtas and the least we owe him is that his reports are debated quickly in this House. The Ombudsman is neutral on policy issues, but important policy consequences are unveiled in the report as a result of changes in society. I suggest that, as well as having a debate on this report in terms of administration and the constitutional interest of relationships, another debate should take place on the care and treatment of elderly people who need in-patient hospital care.</P>
      <P>I also support colleagues who pressed yesterday for a debate on the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. This office has been set up to protect the most vulnerable patients in the health care system, and we owe it to them to do that.</P>
      <P>Despite the initial cautious response &ndash; it might be overdoing it to say that &ndash; of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the issue of a police ombudsman, I would like a debate on it. The day has long gone when any great agency in any society should be allowed to police or investigate itself.</P>
      <P>One of the most distressing things I saw during the recess was respectable men whose papers were not in order being put in jail and brought to court in handcuffs. I am pleased the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said that will not happen again. For too long we have been looking at this as a criminal justice and an immigration issue. I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue of labour force economics and community relations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader urgently to give an explanation to this House for the reason the European Commission put a ban this morning on T-bone steaks of Irish origin but not on those of British origin. It astounds me that, while we have been told our beef is safe, we are now being told we may not sell certain beef which Britain may sell. I am not sure who should give us this explanation but it should not be the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Yesterday the scientific steering committee in the EU, on <Col N="125" /> which we are represented, made a recommendation to the Commission to ban T-bone steaks from a number of countries, with the exception of Britain and Portugal because they have different standards. How did that happen? I do not know who should give us this explanation but it should not be someone who represents the beef or farming industry, it should be someone who represents consumers who are worried and concerned that we have different standards from those in Britain.</P>
      <P>It appears that Britain banned all cattle over 30 months from getting into the food chain. We said we would allow cattle over 30 months into the food chain on the condition that they were tested. A number of retailers in Ireland have adopted the standard in recent years of not allowing cattle over 30 months into the food chain. We have had a different standard from that in Britain, and the European Commission now says that beef is safe in Britain but not here. We should have an urgent debate on this issue so we can put the minds of consumers at rest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to the House to discuss the recent report from the national seaweed forum which outlines the tremendous potential of this natural resource for job creation and to sustain communities. As the main shareholder in the semi-State body, Arramara Teoranta, it would be interesting to hear his views on its plans for the development of the resource in the future. He should be invited to the House to outline his views on the future of this industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I and many other Senators raised the issue of waste management and the urgency with which we must address it. I was not full of confidence this morning when I heard the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, speaking on this issue. He had little to say except to cast doubt on whether we would be able to deal with the issue. I hope the Leader will arrange for a debate on this issue next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made good points. Agreement was reached yesterday to a debate on the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions. I appeal to the Leader to extend the debate to include the matters raised by Senator Maurice Hayes so we can get to grips with this important matter for the elderly and dependent people in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Quinn's astonishment at the proposal by the EU to ban T-bone steaks. The case was well put this morning on the radio by the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association when he said it was inconceivable that one would not be able to eat a T-bone steak in Lifford but would be able to do so in Strabane. That does not seem to make sense. Many of these decisions are increasingly being made for perception purposes rather than relat<Col N="126" /> ing to the substance of the issue. We are dealing with agricultural legislation this morning and although the connection is peripheral, there is a scheme for the destruction of animals. Perhaps, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, there should be flexibility this morning to ask the Minister for his views on this issue. The Minister has indicated that Ireland will seek a derogation and I am sure the House will support him in that. It is a matter for consumers to decide if they want to eat T-bone steaks, and if they wish to do so, they should not be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are regular requests by Members for a debate on waste management which tends to focus exclusively on the absence of landfill and the alternatives to it. However, it is worth putting on the record that we also have an appalling record in terms of liquid waste in that 30% of our sewage is untreated. The most recent figures show that our output of sulphur dioxide and of oxides of nitrogen are well above the European average. We get away with that because there is a convenient wind from the Atlantic Ocean which blows it elsewhere, without which we would be suffering from quite serious air pollution.</P>
      <P>We have a waste crisis and enormous effort is necessary to address it. Blaming other people, and in particular local authority members, will not solve it. The problem requires national action as it is a national crisis. It is the most likely reason our economic development will be brought to a sudden end.</P>
      <P>The other issue which may bring our economic performance to an end is the performance of the EU. I suspect I am the only Member of the House who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in every treaty regarding the EU. While I thought the most recent budget was cruel, daft and entirely wrong for these times, we are quite capable of dealing with such matters ourselves. We must have a debate on our relationship with the EU rather than solely on the issue being raised by the EU. In the past 12 months there have been two instances of the EU picking on small states while large states get away with precisely the same thing. They picked on Austria while Italy has had neo-fascists in Government and they are picking on us while the Italian economy is in a far greater mess than the Irish economy could even become in four or five years. The issue is one of pushing around small states, which is not what the EU is supposed to be about. The issue is the institutional arrangements in the EU to protect the interests of small states. From what I can find out about the yet unprinted&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points which could more readily be made in today's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Nice treaty makes the situation worse, but since it is still not available we can only get people's <Col N="127" /> versions of what it contains. We do not know whether it makes the position worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are questions which the Senator can pose during the debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Nice summit and the fact the Taoiseach will come to the House. However, will the Leader agree to a debate on the wider issues of enlargement? I have asked for this many times. An EU of 27 states has profound implications for Ireland and should be discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the Abbey Theatre, but the vestibule of the original theatre has been lovingly preserved by Daithí Hanley, a former city architect, who has offered it to the State free of charge and who would love to see it incorporated into any new design for the Abbey. It is a gem which has been sought eagerly by many universities in America, but he has refused to sell it. It would be a shame if it was lost to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the proposed local government Bill come before this or the Lower House inside the next two weeks? In the last session the Leader gave an assurance to the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>Time and again I have asked for a debate on incineration and waste management. In view of what has happened in Galway in the past few days, where Galway Corporation accepted the waste management programme, including incineration, it is time the public were assured or that their concerns were brought to the fore regarding the possibility of any dangers from incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked for a debate on the Abbey Theatre and I am glad there has been further demand for such a debate today. We should seek to debate as soon as possible not only the location of the theatre but, as Senator Manning requested, the role and remit of the Abbey Theatre as our national theatre, how it fulfils that role, how it relates to and serves the theatrical needs of people in parts of the country outside Dublin and how it is funded by the Exchequer and the Arts Council. Examination of these wider issues is necessary and demands a day long debate as it is an important issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Quinn for a debate on the BSE disaster, which is what it has become given that the EU has said T-bone steaks from Ireland should be banned. We need the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House. I have repeatedly asked the Leader to bring him to the House to discuss this issue. I understand Senator Dardis's point that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will be in the House this morning, but the precautionary principle is beginning to go mad and we need the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House so we can discuss the <Col N="128" /> risk analysis. Were it not for the almost probable fact of transmission to humans of the prions which cause BSE and new variant CJD, we would not have this problem. Therefore, it is a public health issue and we must have the Minister for Health and Children in the House to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Members in calling for a debate on European issues. Keeping in mind that there is a Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which Senator Lydon, my distinguished colleague, is a member, and a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, what has happened in the European context over the past few weeks has focused people's minds on the relationship between Ireland and Europe as never before. This is an excellent development as for too long people's eyes glazed over whenever we talked about European matters. In that context I ask the Leader to give consideration to increasing the frequency of debates in the House on European matters notwithstanding the work of the joint committees. I am talking about using the mechanism initiated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of inviting people to the House. Jacques Santer was here on one occasion, the only person from the Commission at that level who has visited the House.</P>
      <P>Finally, and I am not being a poor mouth, in the context of regional development I attended the launch in Sligo last Monday of Enterprise Ireland's regional industrial strategy. I understand this is part of a rolling launch by Enterprise Ireland. In light of the report it published for the north-west &ndash; I understand there are similar reports for other regions &ndash; will the Leader consider initiating a debate on regional strategy in advance of the Government's launch of its national spatial strategy? Those of us who live in the regions are very concerned about the ratios of expenditure on infrastructure and economic development in general between the BMW region and the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on BSE, in particular the handling of the issue at EU level. I agree the announcement this morning is driven more by PR considerations than considerations of public health or the future of the beef industry. It may be a measure designed to restore public confidence, like the slaughtering measure, but it is having the opposite effect. There is a genuine crisis which must be addressed urgently, and I hope the Leader will respond to the calls for a debate from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding waste management, which I raised yesterday, I too heard the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on radio this morning giving quite a broad ranging interview. He is capable of giving such an interview on RTÉ radio and of speaking to the nation, and I hope he shows the same courtesy to Members and comes to the House at an early date so we can have a wide-ranging debate which is clearly necessary. He should listen to members of local <Col N="129" /> authorities and get feedback from them. We need to get a leadership position from the Minister. I was astonished to hear him say that new legislation being brought forward this year will contain a provision to put a tax on plastic bags, something we initially heard about two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on tourism, particularly with regard to hill walking and tourists walking through private property. Hill walking is becoming very popular but many people are trespassing on private property against the wishes of landowners. In some cases, tourist boards have featured such walks in their literature. We should have a national policy on this matter because landowners could be in trouble if somebody falls and is hurt, or if their dog worries sheep or cattle. Such walks must be regulated properly and farmers must be compensated for the use of their private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by my colleagues for a debate on BSE and particularly the banning of Irish T-bone steak. Donegal County Council discussed this issue last week and we have arranged a meeting with the Minister for next Wednesday. While most council members were happy with the cattle destruction scheme which was introduced by the Minister, there are other problems they wish to discuss with him. I was astounded to hear on the radio last night about the banning of Irish T-bone steak.</P>
      <P>I also support yesterday's call by my colleagues for a debate on the National Roads Authority. I accept that much work is being done and the authority is providing substantial funding. When I approached the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, however, he told me it was a matter for the National Roads Authority, yet when I approached the authority it pushed me back to the Minister. I find it difficult to understand that.</P>
      <P>My complaint concerning the authority is that substantial projects are receiving priority while smaller ones that could be done with much less money are being left behind. I would mention, in particular, the N56 which traverses west Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take 20 years before we get to small projects, such as the N56 in west Donegal, and there will be no roads in the area at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call by Senator Chambers for a debate on the seaweed industry. The report by the national seaweed forum indicated substantial <Col N="130" /> potential for that industry. As the main shareholder in Arramara, the Minister should attend the House for a debate because while there seem to be substantial supplies, there are also difficulties in the marketplace about which I would like to hear his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on BSE. Such a debate is needed because there are conflicting views as to the purpose and benefits of the cattle destruction scheme. While I suppose the banning of Irish T-bone steak will be mentioned in today's debate, we need a separate debate on all the issues relating to BSE.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole raised the question of the debate on the Nice summit which the Taoiseach is attending from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. I would have no difficulty in adjourning that debate if speakers are offering to participate. Senators may share time during that debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Lydon expressed strong views in calling for an urgent debate on the role of the Abbey Theatre as our national theatre. They mentioned the enormous cost it represents for taxpayers. I have listened to requests for such a debate, both yesterday and today, and I am pleased to inform the House that on Tuesday, 20 February, I intend to allow an all-day debate on this matter. It is a serious situation when £100 million of taxpayers' money is being spent, in addition to the millions that have been spent on that theatre in the past. I take the point that Dublin must be allowed to develop equally and that we must no longer permit a &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;have not&rdquo; situation. The north inner city of Dublin has long awaited its development opportunity.</P>

    <P>Senator Hayes called for a debate on the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions. I intend to allow open-ended time from 2 p.m. next Thursday to discuss the report on this serious situation.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn, Dardis, Ryan, Henry, O'Meara, Bonner and Rory Kiely expressed serious concerns about the EU Commission's ban on T-bone steak. In five minutes' time, the Minister will be in the House. I take it that the principal spokespersons can make the point.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be in the House in five minutes' time. It would be an ideal opportunity if spokespersons for the various groups would refer to that, and perhaps he will be forthcoming. Many people are extremely concerned about the ruling to ban T-bone steak. As the Deputy Leader of the House said this morning, one cannot eat a T-bone steak in Lifford but one can do so in Strabane. It does not make sense. We pride ourselves on our green and clean environment. Whatever has to be done will be done in the interests of safety, but I have no difficulty in eating Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Senators Chambers and Bonner called for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to attend a debate on the national seaweed forum. I have said that I will allocate time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Jackman, Ryan, Coogan and O'Meara called for a debate on waste management. As I said yesterday, I give my word to the House that this will take place. That is a bit rich, however, coming from people who have not been members of local authorities and who do not understand the commitment of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is a former secretary of LAMA.

The greatest single-issue challenge to local auth<Col N="132" /> orities is waste management and I am pleased it is being addressed by local authority members of all political parties.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan inquired about local government legislation and I understand that it will come before the Dáil in the next week or two. We will have it passed in the Seanad, I hope, before Easter. Members can inform local authority members, the General Council of County Councils and LAMA, that the House will take no longer than two weeks to pass the legislation, after which it will be sent to the President for signature.</P>
      <P>Senators Lydon and Mooney called for a debate on the proposed enlargement of the EU. I will certainly allocate as much time as is required for this matter. The request is a most worthwhile one. Senator Mooney also called for a debate on regional development, particularly in the BMW region, and on the Government's regional strategy policy. This is a very worthwhile subject and I will allow time for it to be discussed.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell mentioned the importance of hill walking and tourism. I will raise this matter at the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation this morning, which will be attended by many of the top people involved in the tourism industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be in the Seanad. I have always taken the view that it is a very good procedure to introduce legislation in the Seanad, have it debated by the learned Senators and have some public debate on it before it goes to the Dáil. It is much better to accept helpful amendments and amendments which will strengthen the legislation here not least because I was a Member of this great House in former times, although I have no plans to resume membership.</P>
      <P>While waiting in the ante-room I was in a position to listen to some of the erudite contributions on the Order of Business. One of the matters raised was the banning of the T-bone steak and our ability to have T-bone steaks on this part of this island in the future. Ireland feels this action is totally unjustified and we have put in train a measure to seek exemption from it. We feel it is unjustified not because we say so, but based on the EU scientific steering committee's criteria. For example, in July of last year, the European scientific steering committee carried out an independent evaluation of our controls. It found that Ireland had, to use the technical term, an optimally stable set of controls in place to protect public health and to ensure food safety. We are, therefore, in that optimally stable category which is the lowest risk category in Europe.</P>
      <P>We had a further audit, which happens regularly and which we welcome, around Christmas. The findings, which were issued in January, concurred with those of July 2000. In effect, it meant we had an effective feed ban and that the feed ban &ndash; in other words, meat and bonemeal recycling &ndash; was effectively in place. It was satisfied as a result of visits to milling establishments and so on that there was no cross-contamination. That effective feed ban and that optimally stable categorisation by the European scientific steering committee has been in operation and effectively enforced since 1998. Prior to that, the time temperature combination and the pressure combination in males was at a lower level so there was a complete tightening up in 1997 after the 1996 House of Commons statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the EU standing veterinary committee decided to ban T-bone steaks in Ireland and in a number of other countries. However, it exempted the UK and Portugal, for example, and some countries which do not, officially at any rate, have a BSE case as yet. It is unjustified based on the EU's criteria and it makes no sense to us whatsoever because we have put the con<Col N="134" /> trols in place. Those controls have been audited by the EU and it is now saying that even though we are optimally stable, it is going to ban T-bone steaks.</P>
    <P>As regards T-bone steaks in younger cattle, for example those under 30 months of age, all the scientific data available to us and all the research shows that no infected animal has ever been found under 30 months of age. All the beef available in Ireland at local abattoirs is under 30 months of age. Any beef going into the human food chain over 30 months of age for export &ndash; it is under 30 months of age for the domestic market &ndash; is tested. Farmers have the option of testing animals over 30 months of age before they go into the human food chain.</P>
    <P>The most effective precaution one can take is to remove the specified risk material and this is not just somebody in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development saying so, it has also been said by the most eminent authority on this subject, Professor Michael Gibney of Trinity College, who was chairman of the scientific steering committee and is still a member of this committee. The specified risk material is removed from all animals going into the human food chain, as is the case in relation to all animals in Ireland. We have sought an exemption from the ban on T-bone steaks and we are confident that we will get that exemption.</P>
    <P>The frightening thing is that a decision was taken before Christmas to introduce a destruct scheme. Many people, including myself, are unhappy about the destruct scheme. Virtually everybody sees no sense in destroying good healthy beef, but that decision was taken, and there is a degree of panic in relation to these decisions. It is important that scientists and researchers give us, the policy makers and decision takers, a sound scientific basis for making decisions and not run off making one decision one day and another decision another day.</P>
    <P>I opened a conference in Malahide this morning run by the Teagasc food centre there which was attended by the most eminent people from all over the world. The discussion was on a most serious problem, e.coli. Salmonella is also a serious problem. The incompatibility of this so far as the EU is concerned is that it is concentrating almost exclusively in the food safety and public health area on BSE to the extent that one would think there was no other problem affecting human health. At the same time the greatest killer of tens of thousands of people each year in the EU is related to cigarette smoking. The EU implements polices each year propagating and promoting tobacco growing on which it expends in excess of £1 billion each year. It is about time the scientific authorities in the EU had a more balanced approach to public health. We all want food that is safe, pure, free from any residues or harmful micro-organisms and conditions that affect human health. We support those totally but we want a coherent approach to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> From a marketing point of view &ndash; and I do not want any confusion in relation to this &ndash; it effectively means we cannot export bone-in-beef to the UK which is still our biggest market where consumption has been quite high. This means it will be more difficult to get back into Egypt and the very valuable third country markets there because of this decision. It is a negative position from two points of view, reassurance of the public which is most important and from a marketing point of view it makes life extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill which is designed to implement a commitment I have given to the farming community by improving the system for considering appeals. The Bill is a relatively short and straightforward one. Its purpose is to further improve the service my Department provides to its clients by strengthening the rights of recourse available to farmers wishing to challenge decisions made by the Department regarding their entitlement to benefit under any of the direct payment schemes.</P>
    <P>Most Senators will be aware that my Department already runs an appeals unit which has been considering appeals in relation to the headage and premium schemes since 1995. The purpose of this Bill is to reinforce the independence of that service by putting it on a statutory basis and to widen the range of schemes coming within its remit. I should add that I am fully satisfied with the competence and impartiality of the existing appeals unit, and I want to put on record my appreciation of the quality and industriousness of their work over the years. I want also to ensure that the service is accepted unequivocally by the farming community as independent of the decision making process within the Department.</P>
    <P>It was for that purpose that a commitment was included in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to &ldquo;establish on a statutory basis, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an independent, accessible, and properly resourced appeals unit whose remit will include all FEOGA schemes paying directly to individual farmers&rdquo;. I have taken the opportunity to include within the scope of the new office not only all these schemes, but also all relevant nationally funded schemes.</P>
    <P>I am availing of the opportunity to implement an undertaking I have already given to the Oireachtas by making provision for the input of the appeals office into my decision making on whether to refuse or revoke a certificate of approval under the national beef assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I would hope the House will receive this Bill in the spirit in which it is proposed, that is, as a measure to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the appeals process, an objective that is shared by all of us. This is not a particularly complex Bill and most of its provisions are self-explanatory. I propose to give a short commentary on the main points and to set out the rationale behind them where this would be help<Col N="136" /> ful. I have taken care to build on the model already laid down in statute in respect of the social welfare appeals office which has been operating effectively since its establishment in 1990. I intend that my Department's appeals office, with the approval of the Oireachtas, will follow very closely the model laid down by the social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>The independence of the agriculture appeals office is its crucial aspect. While the staff of the office will be recruited from within my Department and its funding will likewise, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, be provided from within my Department's Vote, this Bill provides that its operational independence will be total. Here again I have been guided by the successful precedent established by the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of appeals officers by the Minister. Their function will be to make determinations on appeals made by affected persons against decisions taken by the Department in respect of the relevant schemes. Affected persons mean farmers who have applied under the relevant schemes &ndash; those schemes are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. The Schedule lists 28 schemes and consists of all the direct payment schemes currently in operation together with their immediate predecessors where there has recently been a substantial change in the structure or name of a scheme. The practical benefit of this provision is that all the direct payment schemes can be considered by the appeals officers. It has been an undoubted limitation of the current appeals unit within my Department that it can consider only headage and premium schemes. This Bill seeks to extend that coverage to include such other major schemes as the REP scheme and the early retirement scheme as well as the miscellany of smaller schemes, still very important, designed notably to facilitate on-farm investment. The list of schemes can be expected to evolve as the structure of direct payment schemes evolves.</P>
    <P>Appeals officers shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of their functions. This is the core of the Bill. Decisions taken by the office will be binding on the Department. There will be no ministerial or departmental authority to intervene in the decision making process. Managerial accountability will be preserved by the requirement that the chief appeals officer shall submit an annual report to the Minister and provide such other information as the Minister may require. In this way the Minister can inform himself as to the position in relation to the management, organisation and staffing of the office and make changes in those areas if he considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>Collectively the appeals officers and their support staff will be known as the agriculture appeals office. Following the practice in respect of the social welfare appeals office, the word &ldquo;office&rdquo; is not built into the Bill but will nonetheless be the name of the organisation in its everyday oper<Col N="137" /> ations and will be the name appearing on the letterhead and so on. The office will be headed by a chief appeals officer who will be designated by the Minister. The chief appeals officer will be the director of the office. He or she will also have a deputy, again to be designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not go into details on the appeals procedure, providing instead that, as in the social welfare appeals office, these will be laid down by regulations. These regulations are now almost complete and will be published shortly after the enactment of this Bill on the assumption that this House and the Dáil will approve it. Gearing the appeals office into action will not be delayed for lack of procedural regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill expressly provides for the holding of oral hearings and also stipulates that an appeals officer, when considering an appeal, may decide the case as if for the first time, that is, he or she is not restricted to considering the grounds on which the appeals decision was made. The appeals officer will therefore be able to take a broad view. Section 8(4) provides that the decision on an appeal shall be made as soon as practicable, having regard to any guidelines laid down in this regard by the Minister. It is my strong concern, and one that is, I imagine, shared by every Member, that appeals should be processed as quickly as possible. The guidelines I will be issuing in this connection will, therefore, tend towards a short interval for deciding appeals rather than a long one. I envisage a turnaround period of 12 weeks, which is a reasonably tight interval in the circumstances, but I am reluctant to stipulate a precise deadline for all appeals because some appeals with be straightforward and simple while others will be complex. Senators will recognise that cases vary in complexity and it would be imprudent to commit a statutory process to deliver a result within a timetable which would not in all cases be realistic. In preparing the guidelines my concern will be to minimise the time taken to process an average appeal while recognising that certain complex cases will take longer.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that subject to exceptions to which I shall refer, the decision of an appeals officer shall be final and conclusive. The purpose of this provision is to ensure finality in the matter within a reasonable length of time. The appeals office will be an expert tribunal with statutory responsibility to determine the matters referred to it. By the end of the appeals process the application will have been considered in depth twice by specialist officers having been initially considered by the deciding officer whose decision is being appealed and a presumption of accuracy and reasonableness must attach to the decision emerging from the that process.</P>
    <P>Mistakes are, of course, made and they are made on both sides. That is the reason for an appeals mechanism in the first place. An applicant may nonetheless take the view that the appeals process was vitiated by a mistake of law or unreasonableness or lack of fair procedures. In <Col N="138" /> those cases the appellant may appeal the decision of the appeals officer to the High Court. Provision is also made for internal revision of a decision within the office, either when new evidence comes to light or the director considers the decision was wrong because of error of fact or of law.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is primarily concerned with direct payments schemes paying cash entitlements to eligible applicants, I have taken the opportunity to widen its scope so as to also confer to the appeals office functions in relation to the national beef assurance scheme. When the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill was considered in the House, Senators took the view that decisions taken under the terms of the Bill be brought within the remit of this appeals mechanism. The scheme operates under the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act, 2000. The core of the Act is the laying down of the requirement on the part of every herd owner wishing to trade in beef that he or she obtain from the Minister a certificate of approval to do so. Where the Minister proposes to refuse such a certificate he or she must give notice to the herd owner of that intention. Section 15(2) of the Act provides that the herd owner may, on receipt of such notice, make representations to the Minister within 14 days of the date of issue of the ministerial notification. Section 16(2) provides for similar giving of notice and the right to make representations where the Minister intends to revoke a certificate already issued.</P>
    <P>In the course of the passage of the Act through the Dáil, I gave a commitment to bring within the remit of the appeals office this question of the refusal or revocation of a certificate of approval. I have come to the view that the best way to ensure the effective input of the appeals office is to provide that any representations which the Minister may receive under sections 15(2) of 16(2) of the Act must be referred by him or her as soon as may be to the director of the appeals office for advice and that before deciding whether to proceed with a refusal or revocation the Minister must have regard to the director's advice which must be delivered within 28 days. We are the only country in Europe to have a statutory national beef assurance scheme. It could be expected to be helpful to us in our deliberations in Europe. The scheme is coming into immediate effect.</P>
    <P>Setting up a statutory appeals mechanism under the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act has the effect of taking all the schemes coming within the ambit of the appeals office out of the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. This is the inevitable result of section 5 of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, which precludes the Ombudsman from any role in relation to matters in respect of which there exists an independent statutory right of appeal. That would be an unsatisfactory outcome, given the valuable functions the Ombudsman performs in protecting the rights of the recipients of public services. For that reason I am making <Col N="139" /> provision for the retention by the Ombudsman of his or her functions in relation to the relevant schemes. This is achieved by adding appeals officers under this Bill to the First Schedule of the Ombudsman Act, 1980. The appeals officers will thereby become persons whose decisions may be investigated by the Ombudsman in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Preserving the Ombudsman's role in this way is consistent with my intention, to which this Bill gives expression, that the establishment of the agricultural appeals office will reinforce the rights of the course available to clients of my Department where they are dissatisfied with the Department's decisions on applications they have made. In this connection the Bill also provides that the reasons for making the decision made by the appeals officer shall be notified in writing to the appellant. This provision may not be strictly necessary in that the appellant has this right under section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and probably also has it under common law. Nonetheless, it is useful to state it expressly in the present context to reinforce the openness of the procedures and I now seek the approval of the Oireachtas to enshrine this in statute.</P>
    <P>The appeals mechanism I am proposing in the Bill goes beyond the valuable consumer response facilities provided for by my Department, which has been innovative in drawing up and implementing a consumer service programme. In addition to the customer service action plan, the Department has developed the farmers' charter and, more recently, in conjunction with the farming representative organisations under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the protocol on direct payment schemes. These initiatives are evidence that the Department is committed to providing a professional and client friendly service. Demanding deadlines for making payments have been laid down and have, by and large, been met. The targets in the current protocol extend beyond rigorous payment deadlines into procedures for the conduct of inspections and so on. The country is acknowledged as being the European leader in this respect.</P>
    <P>In considering the questions of appeals, the severity of the penalties, especially with regard to innocent errors, has caused grief and dissatisfaction in farming circles. I share what I know is the view of Senators that some penalties which the Department is required to impose are harsh, to say the least. Senators may be aware that on foot of a commitment given in the protocol on direct payments I raised the question of simplification of all of the schemes under the CAP, with particular reference to proportionality of penalties. I raised this matter on a number of occasions at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers. Following from a Council of Ministers request late last year the Commission has set up a working group representative of all member states, includ<Col N="140" /> ing Ireland, to look at how the CAP arrangements can be simplified.</P>
    <P>My Department had made a vigorous approach to the Commission in which it was supported by UK and French colleagues arguing that the reasonableness and proportionality of certain penalties be investigated with a view to ensuring that farmers are not unduly penalised for relatively minor defaults. By that I mean forgetting to sign a form or failing to tick a box. They can lose up to two years' payment, which is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>A separate working group is now being established with the remit of recasting the regulation governing penalties. I am convinced that the overall arrangements can be simplified by making more use of database information in the processing of applications. However, I do not wish to give the impression that it will be an easy task to bring about a change of policy in relation to the proportionality of penalties at European level. The institutions have shown they are difficult to convince on these issues.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the appeals officers will be appointed and assume their functions and that the director and deputy director will be designated soon after the enactment of this Bill, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas. I am anxious to give visible and practical effect to the commitment I have given to the farming community and to get the new office into full swing without delay.</P>
    <P>I repeat my concern to provide the farming community with an appeals mechanism which will meet their demand for visible independence, wide scheme coverage and prompt attention. To establish that mechanism is the purpose of the Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minster's comments on the BSE problem which we discussed earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The degree of panic, particularly among farmers, in relation to the BSE crisis is a big problem. When making decisions in relation to cattle pur<Col N="141" /> chases or sales, people do not know what direction to take. This is causing panic which the Minister needs to address. I acknowledge he has being doing his utmost to deal with this problem at a national level.</P>
    <P>A few issues need to be addressed, particularly in relation to the consumer aspect. RTÉ carries an advertisement showing a stumbling cow which it has been asked on several occasions to change. The Minister should make a direct approach to RTÉ to have this advertisement changed because it is sending out the wrong message. Whenever anything about BSE crops up, this same cow falling all over the place is rolled out. This is not acceptable because everyone is doing their best and people's livelihoods are at risk in relation to the BSE crisis. Given that this is a food producing country of which we are very proud, our national television station should be called into question in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is the widespread concern among small local butchers in relation to the levy they pay under the destruct scheme. I ask the Minister to address this matter because it increases the cost of meat to the consumer at a time when we are trying to promote the consumption of beef and prove the quality of our meat. In reality, if a housewife goes into a butcher's shop in any part of the country, whether Cork, Tipperary or Dublin, the vast majority of the meat for sale is young heifer beef. Given that housewives are not assured this meat is safe, it is imperative that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, on a once-off promotional effort, spend some money to try to drive home to our own consumers that the beef they buy across the counter cannot be affected by BSE because it is all under 30 months of age. This is an important point which needs to be emphasised before we start worrying about overseas markets, even though they are extremely important. We need to cement our market at home and I believe the Minister should consider this important aspect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for which farming organisations have been calling. The general thrust of the Bill is welcome because it will alleviate many hardships. People will now have an independent forum in which to air their problems. As soon as payments are made every year, politicians get representations from farmers who have money docked from them for whatever reason. Given that premiums are now such a big part of farmers' incomes, it is important that the payment of this money is seen to be fair.  </P>
    <P>When one examines in detail the Bill, there are many questions which need to be asked. I have major concerns about the independence of this appeals mechanism in relation to the Department. While the Bill states that responsibility will lie with the Minister, I question the independence of an authority which is set up by the Department to examine the Department's own decisions. I ask the Minister to consider setting up a board of governors to administer the proposals in the Bill. <Col N="142" /> If people are to have confidence in the authority, they must be in a position to say that it is totally independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. To be successful and to ensure people have confidence in the authority, it must be seen to be totally independent of the Department. The Minister should consider six people, whether representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Oireachtas or the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to sit on an independent board of governors to oversee this appeals body. This is a major body, employing a staff of 30, not a small number of people. In order for the authority to be independent, it needs to stand alone from the Department. I ask the Minister to give this proposal genuine consideration because I want the authority to be successful. I believe every Member of the House wants the authority to be independent and successful so that people can have confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is the number of people who have been penalised in the past. I ask the Minister to look at cases which were brought to attention over a number of years. Many of my constituents &ndash; the Minister may be aware of them because they probably went to him directly &ndash; who had a genuine case to relate came to me regarding this issue. Severe hardship was imposed on people. The Minister should give consideration to some of these hardship cases which left people minus thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>I question why the disease eradication scheme is not mentioned in the Bill. At a time when disease is so prevalant, whether bovine TB, brucellosis or BSE, it is important that people are allowed to appeal some decisions in relation to disease eradication. I have instances of hardship cases in my constituency in this regard. There is nothing more devastating for farmers than having their whole herd wiped out for a technical reason. Sometimes there are good reasons for this, but the omission from the Bill of the disease eradication scheme must be questioned. I ask the Minister to have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I have received correspondence from the farming organisations in recent days in respect of a number of issues. For example, the ICMSA believes that a time limit within which cases should be dealt with should be set down. That is very important because there is nothing more frustrating than having an appeal drag on. A time limit should be established in order that decisions can be made promptly.</P>
    <P>Will oral hearings be taken in private or will politicians or Teagasc advisers be able to make representations at such hearings? I am not sure whether this matter is dealt with in the Bill but I ask the Minister to ensure that it is addressed. Politicians or other representatives such as solicitors etc., should be allowed to attend oral hearings because many people will be daunted by the prospect of appearing before the appeals board. I request that people be allowed to be rep<Col N="143" /> resented by the individuals to whom I refer at oral hearings.</P>
    <P>People must always be provided with a detailed explanation of the decisions taken in their cases. I welcome the Minister's comments regarding the harshness of penalties. The penalties attaching to the REP scheme are particularly harsh. The REP scheme has proven to be extremely good for the environment, but the level of its success will only be recognised in the future. Major changes are taking place in our environment and a huge clean-up process is in operation in the areas to which the scheme applies. I hope the Minister will be successful in highlighting to Europe the fact that the penalties involved are too harsh. We must fight to ensure that the penalties attaching to the REP scheme are changed because they are overly harsh.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board the points I have raised, particularly in respect of the independent board of governors. I welcome the establishment of the appeals board, particularly as farmers are so dependent on the various schemes for their incomes. Farming has changed dramatically in recent years and the days when people sold cattle or milk to earn an income are gone. The cheques farmers receive in the post are now their main source of income. It is good that the independent appeals unit is being put in place, but I again request that the Minister take on board the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor is well versed in this matter. I know that the Minister will do everything possible to rectify this anomaly. People are also concerned about the destruction scheme and there are conflicting opinions about its worth. However, the scheme is in place and there is no doubt that consumer confidence in the beef industry must be restored.</P>
      <P>As Senator Hayes stated, farm incomes are dependent on the payment of premiums. It is, therefore, important that farmers complete their application forms correctly. However, there is no doubt that mistakes, which can be costly for farmers. can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, on his proposal to establish an agriculture appeals <Col N="144" /> office to provide, on a statutory basis, an appeals mechanism to deal with appeals from farmers wishing to challenge decisions of officers of the Department regarding their entitlement to benefit under the specified schemes which are listed in detail in the Schedule to the Bill. I am inclined to agree with Senator Hayes about the disease eradication scheme because people are dissatisfied with the level of compensation they have received in respect of this scheme. Those people should also have the opportunity to make an appeal to the new office and I would like the Minister to consider this matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new office will give effect to a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to establish, on a statutory basis, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, an independent, accessible and properly resourced appeals unit whose remit will include all FEOGA schemes paying directly to individual farmers. The agriculture appeals office will build on the work of the Department's existing non-statutory headage and premia appeals unit. That unit was established in 1995 on foot of commitments given in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  and an undertaking in the charter of rights for farmers. It currently deals with appeals under the livestock headage and premia and arable aid schemes and is staffed by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>In April 1999, the all-party Oireachtas committee on the strategic management initiative, in its report on quality customer service in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, recommended the establishment of a properly resourced, accessible and independent appeals system similar to those operated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Minister, while fully satisfied with the competence and fairness of the current appeals unit, is anxious that the service is accepted by the farming community independent of the decision-making process within the Department. The new office is designed to meet this objective and improve the appeals system.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers that the range of schemes falling within the remit of the current appeals unit is unduly limited and proposes, consistent with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to extend it to include all FEOGA schemes paying directly to individual farmers. I am sure he will consider including the other scheme I mentioned within the remit of the new unit. The extension to which I refer will bring the rural environment protection scheme, the early retirement scheme, the on-farm investment schemes and other schemes within the scope of the new office.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in addition to conducting reviews of decisions made in respect of payments under the FEOGA direct payment schemes, with full authority to modify or reverse the original decision taken in the Department, the appeals <Col N="145" /> office will also have advisory functions in relation to the national beef assurance scheme. Section 13 of the Bill makes provision for such functions in respect of a proposed refusal or revocation of a certificate of approval under the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act, 2000. A certificate of approval, which is granted by the Minister, authorises the relevant keeper &ndash; a herdowner or trader &ndash; to trade in beef. The National Beef Assurance Scheme Act provides that if the Minister intends to refuse an application for this certificate or to revoke a certificate already delivered, he must give notice of that intention.</P>
    <P>Section 15( 2) and section 16(2) of the National Beef Assurance Act provided that on receipt of notice an appeal could be made to the Minister within 14 days. He gave an undertaking to bring within the remit of the appeals office a refusal of a certificate under the national beef assurance scheme. He considers it best that any relevant representations should be referred to him by the appeals office. His decision must be made with regard to its advice which should be delivered within 28 days.</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order bring further schemes or aspects of schemes within the remit of the appeals office. This enables inclusion of those which might replace the current headage and premium schemes.</P>
    <P>The appeals office and its powers will be similar to the social welfare appeals office. It will adjudicate appeals from farmers dissatisfied with decisions regarding their entitlements. The adjudication will be conducted by officers appointed by the Minister. One will be designated chief appeals officer and will act as director. He will report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the appeals office is that appeals must be lodged in the time specified by the Minister. Each appeal will be assigned to an officer who will adjudicate. An appeal officer's decision may be reviewed by the chief officer. There is a right to an oral hearing without a fee. Apellants have the right to appeal to the courts on a point of law. The ombudsman can investigate cases dealt with by the office.</P>
    <P>The office's decisions will be binding on the Department. The Minister and the Department cannot intervene in decision making. This is important for the office's success. The chief appeals officer shall report annually to the Minister or as often as the Minister requires on management and staffing. All the staff remain officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by Senator Hayes, it is estimated that it will require 32 staff. This figure has been reached by reference to the social welfare appeals office. This compares favourably with six in the existing appeals structure.</P>
    <P>Farmers must be advised regarding the proper filling out of the necessary forms. I read in the<i> Irish Independent's</i> farming supplement on 6 February &ndash; which, like many other publications was not available in the Library, to the disadvantage <Col N="146" /> of rural Deputies and Senators &ndash; that around 30% of reconciliation forms were not returned on time. It is important to return these forms which are essential to traceability under the beef assurance scheme, especially for the purpose of reassuring the consumer about quality. From experience I know that these forms are complex and time consuming. Many mistakes are made. Farmers should be assisted in this as it is important to their incomes.</P>
    <P>The penalties in this regard, re REPS for example, are severe. Farmers are often penalised up to 90%, according to the report in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> This is too severe for being late with an application. The Department was not satisfied with some forms with which farmers had assistance. I have found Teagasc helpful and their services should be used more widely.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will have the desired effect. Farmers should get what they are entitled too and I hope the appeals system operates effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am incensed at how our consumers have been let down by this morning's announcement and I know the Minister is concerned. He is a representative of the farming industry but I am concerned about consumers. Regarding T-bone steaks, the announcement says that &ldquo;the derogation in respect of Portugal is, like in the UK, based on the evaluation of the national measures in force to eradicate BSE and an additional testing programme of all fallen stock.&rdquo;  How are our standards less acceptable? I know the Minister will make a good case to get Ireland included in the derogation but the damage is done.</P>
      <P>How did this come about? That we have standards which are less than Britain's has let down the consumers of Ireland. Something must be done immediately. Why did the scientific steering committee make this decision? This must never happen again. Whoever advised us has failed. Someone must have known that things were better done in the UK.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a totally inadequate Bill. Despite the fact that I fully agree with the principle behind it, I intend to vote against the Second Reading unless the Minister can satisfy my concerns. I vote against in order to highlight the fact that the Bill, as conceived, is incapable of delivering on its promises. It purports to set up an independent appeals process but the detailed provisions are such as to finally and fatally undermine that very independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 enshrines the promise of an independent appeals process. It provides that appeals officers shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of their functions. The Minister will rely on this privision to demonstrate that it will be an independent appeals process, but this section is not enough to guarantee independence. In comparable legislation, with one exception, the requirement for independent performance is <Col N="147" /> backed up by a framework designed to deliver that independence.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred today to the social welfare appeals office. I do not know enough about that but in this legislation compared to almost all other appeals legislation the requirement for independence is backed by a framework that will undermine rather than help it. Independence is the whole point of creating the function. The director of agriculture appeals needs to be distinct, separate and independent from the system that is being appealed against. While it makes sense for the office to be under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture it makes nonsense of the enterprise to put the office and staff under its total control as proposed by the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <P>We have precedents for setting up an office that, despite operating under the aegis of a particular Department, is required to be independent in its performance. The obvious case is the Ombudsman. Others are the Data Commissioner and the Director of Consumer Affairs. The same basic strategy was followed in the legislation setting up these offices yet this Bill ignores that strategy. The strategy is to declare an office created. Having created the office the legislation then determines how the holder of the office is to be appointed and specifies the process by which the holder can be removed from office.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs, who is appointed through the Civil Service Commission, can be removed by the Minister. However, the Minister has to state reasons for the removal to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Ombudsman can be removed only on foot of a motion passed by both Houses. The mechanisms for removing a post holder may vary but the principle is the same. The person cannot be removed at the whim of a Minister. It is a variation of the arrangement under which judges cannot be sacked and exists to underpin the independence that is expected in the performance of the post.</P>
    <P>A further arm to the legislative strategy used in setting up these posts is that in having created the office one attaches to it particular powers and functions which are executed by the office holder. The effect of this is that the only link between the sponsoring Department and the office is the office holder. Everything should flow through that link. There should be no interaction between the Department and the office except through the office holder. The office holder has control over the appointment of staff and they are responsible to the office holder in the performance of their duties. They are employed by the office, not the Department. These features of the legislative strategy are there for a definite purpose. They provide a framework for independence and performance while maintaining and retaining the minimum level of democratic control.</P>
    <P>The success through the years of the offices of the State created in this way provides a compelling argument that this is the road we should fol<Col N="148" /> low. We have a cluster of precedents backed up by a success record, yet in drafting this Bill the Minister has chosen to ignore these precedents. He is badly advised in doing so. The result, if he proceeds, will be the creation of an appeals process without credibility. It does not deserve credibility.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the Minister may appoint such and so many of his or her officers as he or she thinks appropriate to be appeals officers for the purposes of this Act and every person so appointed shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister. Section 3 provides that one of the appeals officers shall be designated by the Minister as the chief appeals officer who shall be known as the director of agriculture appeals.</P>
    <P>In these two sections the Bill seeks to create a structure that makes nonsense of the requirement under section 5 for the appeals officers to be independent in the performance of their functions. Section 2 gives the Minister unfettered power to appoint and remove appeals officers at a whim. There is no safeguard against being removed because the Department does not like the way an appeals officer performs. That is frightening. To be credible a safeguard must be provided just as it is in the legislation providing the precedents we should follow.</P>
    <P>A farmer appealing against a decision of the Department of Agriculture will find it difficult to believe in the independence of the appeals officer hearing his case if he knows the officer holds his job &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo;.  Will he not be inclined to believe that the appeals officer is unlikely to rock the boat? Any farmer who watched the series &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; will remember how the permanent secretary used to get his way with the Minister's private secretary. He would gently remind the private secretary that his promotional prospects and his future career depended on his playing ball with the Department. To impose an independence requirement on people who are locked into the Department's promotional and hierarchical structure is to expect a level of saintliness that no legislation can guarantee. Rather than expect the impossible we should follow the precedents that already exist.</P>
    <P>There is worse to come. Section 3 gives the first mention of the director of agriculture appeals. Rather than setting up an independent office, the holder of which would be the boss, this Bill makes it clear that the director is nothing more than a title. There is no attempt to vest the appeals process in the director. There is no specification of his or her functions. It does not even specify that the other appeals officers are responsible to the director and it gives him or her no function in appointing them.</P>
    <P>In regard to every one of the safeguards we find in the legislation providing precedents this Bill falls short. I described it at the outset as inadequate. I now go further and say that the appeals process set out in this Bill is nothing short of a sham. This sham will not convince the farming community it is intended to serve. I appeal to the <Col N="149" /> Minister to take this Bill back to the drawing board. He should persuade his people to look at the precedents and follow them. Then he should return to the House with either a new Bill or amendments for Committee Stage that will create the basis for a credible independent appeals structure. If the Minister is anxious to give credibility to this Bill, he should rethink the aspects I have highlighted.  </P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn regarding yesterday's announcement from Europe on BSE. As an exporter of agricultural products, we need to be cognisant of what European consumers think. Irish consumers have never been well served by consumer organisations. They are in a state of total confusion, which is added to on a daily basis. Yesterday's actions of the scientific steering committee created further erroneous confusion. This country's procedures cannot be questioned, especially when compared to those of Portugal and the United Kingdom. We test all meat from animals over the age of 30 months that we put on the market. All available scientific methods are being used.</P>
      <P>As far as can be ascertained scientifically, the beef we sell is safe, although safety can never be fully guaranteed. In my business I am often asked to judge whether a tree is in danger of falling. It would be quite easy for me to say that a tree should be felled because I could not guarantee that it would not fall. A similar attitude prevails in the beef industry. No matter what measures are introduced to provide safety, niggling doubts remain. Consumers are being badly failed by Europe and by the industry, because their confusion is being disregarded.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to argue for the reversal of yesterday's outrageous decision. The fact that we are the major beef exporting nation in Europe makes me wonder as to the motives behind the decision. Consumers face a greater risk from microbes such as salmonella and f2&gt;e coli than from beef.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, which is worthwhile and badly needed. I congratulate the Minister and his Department. Unlike Senator Quinn, I see one weakness in this Bill. Section 8(1) states, &ldquo;.the <Col N="150" /> decision shall, on notice of appeal being given to the Director, within the prescribed time and in the prescribed form, be referred to an appeals officer&rdquo;. My problem relates to the time it may take to decide on an appeal. Section 10(1) states:</P>
    <P>The decision of an appeals officer and the reasons for making that decision shall be notified in writing to the appellant. The Minister may issue guidelines to appeals officers with respect to the time within which a decision of an appeals officer should be notified to an appellant.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a timeframe of four weeks be specified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assured this House during debate on the national beef assurance scheme that an appeals system would be established. This House discussed the structure of the appeals system. I am glad that the Minister, with the Commission, his Department and the Government, decided upon the statutory establishment of an appeals system.</P>
      <P>At a time when the processes and functions of agriculture are at a delicate stage, there is a need for assurance. Many factors are putting pressure on the agricultural industry and are surmounting the appropriateness of this Bill. The Department of Agriculture has a huge influence on the finances of a large proportion of the people. This Bill should uphold the principles of natural justice, openness and transparency. It will include payments from FEOGA and various other rural development schemes. This Bill's incorporation of all payments to farmers by the Department of Agriculture is is a welcome move.       </P>
      <P>Farming organisations have often criticised the inflexibility of the Department. Departmental officials have always attempted to be fair within the scheme and the regulations. However, the flexibility allowed in some appeals was very limited. The scheme's structure was very strong in that it did not take account of innocent mistakes made when people were making applications for claims. Like all other sectors, agriculture is so regulated that people who made mistakes were deducted money for two years. I know of people who had to rear six, seven and eight children, pay a mortgage and run a small farm but no flexibility was shown. My colleagues and I have strongly requested the Minister to set up the appeals system.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made important points regarding the independence of the scheme. The appeals system is set up on the basis of openness, transparency, fairness and natural justice and it is important that these principles apply throughout the process. It is important that few cases go to the Ombudsman. If the appeals system in successful and if natural justice is at its core the Bill will allow us to function properly and satisfy the concerns and needs of the farming community. I welcome the section of the Bill under which the Ombudsman retains the right to examine cases. To some extent this ensures the principle behind the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I also welcome the principle of the Bill, but I share the concerns expressed by other Senators regarding the independence of the system. Will the Minister examine the system for appointing appeals officers which is well established in other areas, such as in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? If there is any question as to the independence or integrity of the appeals system it will negate the purpose for which it will be established.</P>
      <P>It has taken a long time for the Department to produce the Bill. Three years ago I was vice-chairman of the strategic management committee chaired by Deputy Roche. The committee reviewed the quality customer services programmes of all Departments. The first programme we tackled in 1998 was the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's customer services plan. The Secretary General was very good and gave his time to the committee. In addition, farming organisations, farmers and the Commission all made their case. What was clear from these submissions was that, after delays in payments, the one bugbear regarding the Department was the absence of an independent appeals system.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General gave the impression that the EU would not allow an independent appeals system. This is all documented and I refer Senators to Deputy Roche's document. The impression was given that the Commission was reluctant and that it would be very difficult to establish an independent appeals systems under current EU structures. However, the view expressed by the Commission's representative was completely at variance with that of the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>There was always a reluctance within the Department to go down this road. The Department even blamed the EU and its systems, such as the cheque in the post scheme. However, the Commission's representative stated that it had no difficulty with an appeals system so long as the results of the appeals respect the terms and conditions of the different schemes. However, that goes without saying as it is taxpayers' money and we have to be seen to be accountable for how money is spent.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing problem with the manner in which the Department handles appeals from farmers. I will not go into the different schemes as they are there for all to see. Farmers felt they were being criminalised for human errors by the attitude of certain departmental officials at different levels. Human error was automatically equated with fraud. What was done was appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> Apart from mistakes, the length of time it took to respond to queries before a cheque was issued was totally unacceptable to a large number of farmers who were totally dependent on the cheque in the post for their net income. This was particularly the case for dry stock farmers, but it also applied across the board.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to be pejorative when using the word &ldquo;bureaucrats&rdquo;, but when viewed by a farmer in a muddy field in the middle of January looking at the barren landscape, the bureaucrats in Dublin could not understand that farmers were totally dependent for their income on the whim of someone taking out the file and resolving the matter. Officials did not even indicate to farmers that there was a problem or the nature of the problem which gave rise to the review of the case. Farmers knew nothing other than they did not have their cheques.</P>
    <P>From time to time public representatives' clinics have been full with cases of delayed payments. The Minister must be more aware of that than any of us as he must have been plagued by this issue. I will give a personal example of what I am talking about. I have an independent income, my family is reared and we have not had to depend on the cheque in the post, even though we always welcomed it. We joined REPS six years ago. The first payment came through and we filled in the forms. However, in each of the following four years I had to battle from March until almost Christmas Eve to get my cheque. We had done nothing wrong and I had letters from the Department to prove my case. However, the matter went round the house several times. If my family had been depending on the payment as our sole income with, perhaps, five children in school and no other income, we would have faced a crisis. However, we were poorly treated and there were delays in rectifying matters whereby four different people had to have a say. This continued even when the section moved to Johnstown Castle. This went on until last autumn when I received my last cheque and I laughed.</P>
    <P>Each year the query was the same. I pointed out that it had been resolved in the second year and showed the letter from the official who is now in the Ombudsman's office. He wrote to me outlining that the file was in order and that I was entitled to my payment. However, every year the matter went through the hoop and I received the cheque eight months after I should have done. In the end I laughed and told the official I would get my cheque. Each year he or she would say I would not get a cheque but each year I received it as I knew I was right.</P>
    <P>However, not everyone is as contrary or persistent as me. Thankfully we were not dependent on these payments. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who was helping thousands of others to get their payments yet I could not even get mine until the eleventh hour. How did or does the ordinary farmer who does not have time to pursue to system as I did survive?</P>
    <P>The system must be independent. The Bill <Col N="153" /> amends the Ombudsman's Act but does not state that the right to appeal to the Ombudsman is still vested with the farmer if he or she is unhappy with the appeals system. The right to go to court is mentioned but not the right to an Ombudsman's review. Will the Minister clarify that this right still exists if there is still a disagreement after a farmer has gone through the appeals system? I presume the reason the Ombudsman's Act is referred to is that this right is there. The change made in the Ombudsman Act is not clear. Perhaps the Minister will put on the record that the right to review by the Ombudsman remains.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill. I ask the Minister to consider much of what Senator Quinn said. If this is not independent and seen to be so by the farming public and those who have a cause to use the offices, if the appointments of the appeals officers are not seen to be strictly independent and if the system for replacing appeals officers is not seen to be strictly transparent and understandable, we will bring into disrepute a system which has been years in coming. I commend Deputy Roche's committee for the work it did in highlighting the need for this system. There has been a clamour across the House for an appeals system and at last we have got it. I would have loved an independent agency to handle all the money coming in by way of European schemes and cheques. The farmers will take comfort from the appeals system. There is a list of questions the ICMSA and the IFA want answered and I ask the Minister to refer to them when replying.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate what he is doing in Europe to help farmers who sold healthy young prime cattle in November and December before the destruction scheme with the top up money was introduced. They took a severe hit in the autumn sales of beef. It is an ongoing sore and I would love to know the Minister's views. He has indicated to the ICMSA that he will ask Europe about it. Who will he ask in Europe? Who will I table a parliamentary question to in support of his request for Europe's concession? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the concern expressed by the Minister and everyone else about T-bone steaks. I intend to continue to have my T-bone steak, regardless of what any bureaucrat in Europe says because it is the best food. I am surprised concern has not been voiced about cheap imported German beef which was identified in a processing plant in the Twenty-six Counties &ndash; I think it was in Monaghan &ndash; in the past few days. Now that we are issuing licences for the production, processing and importing of goods people who import material of doubtful <Col N="154" /> quality should have their licence revoked immediately. Penalties must be introduced to stop this practice because it brings into disrepute the good name of Irish beef. I call on the farming organisations to lend their weight to this and I invite the Minister to pay particular attention to it because it is doing damage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the independence of the appeals system. However, I disagree with Senator Quinn because I do not want this Bill to be similar to that related to An Bord Pleanála or the National Roads Authority which is not answerable to any Minister or Government the people elect. I would rather the democratic process prevails over all else. I do not mind who the Minister is or to what party he or she belongs once the democratic process is protected. I hope Senator Quinn does not mind me saying that. This Bill, like the Social Welfare Bill, is part of the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Gibbons said about the timescale. I understand the difficulties with mapping etc. Perhaps the four weeks Senator Gibbons mentioned is too short but the 12 weeks provided for in the Bill is rather lengthy. The point has been made that these 28 schemes are solely income related. They are there to assist farmers and to provide them with a source of income. Farmers depend on these payments. I depend on the small cheque in the brown envelope, which has been improved. I hope the Minister ensures we continue to get it on time. The Minister has ensured in the past two or three years that the payments under these schemes will be made quickly.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed about plans which are not signed under these schemes. This means the farmer is left without recourse to anything and without knowing who is responsible for the plan. My planner in the south is a Teagasc adviser and he signs all the plans which are required to be drawn up under these schemes. Doubt has been expressed about whether some independent people sign them. I urge the Minister to ensure that the people involved in drawing up plans do their job properly because farmers' livelihoods are at stake. If a plan is found to be faulty, the planner, who accepted £300, £400 or £500 to draw it up, must accept responsibility. I ask the Minister to include a provision in the Bill that the people involved in drawing up plans must sign them and accept responsibility if there is a fault.</P>
      <P>The independent board must be objective and sympathetic and understand farmers' requirements. Farmers do not set out to defraud people when filling out forms. They may put a tick in the wrong place or write the wrong number but that should be seen as a genuine mistake. I am delighted the Minister and his officials are bringing the penalties into line with the extent of the crime. The crime is a mistake.</P>

      <P>If a person makes a genuine mistake and it is accepted as such, there should not <Col N="155" /> be a penalty. Part and full payments come into question when an adjudication is made. If a payment is due, it should be paid within a specified time. I ask the Minister to ensure that is included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Everyone who makes an appeal should have the right to an oral hearing. These oral hearings should be regionalised, rather than all being heard in Dublin, so that farmers' needs are met. Therefore, I suggest the line &ldquo;an appeals' officer shall hold an oral hearing&rdquo; be included.</P>
      <P>This is a good and worthwhile Bill. It has been sought by the farming organisations and by many people. I am chairman of a committee which assisted in convincing the relevant powers that it should be done. It is not an adverse reflection on departmental officials, but there is a perception that such an independent body should exist and I am glad it is now coming about.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Like Senator Quinn I am not very enthusiastic about the Bill. Far too frequently the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development appears to be policing itself, and this is another example of that, particularly given that the appointment of the chief appeals officer, who will be the director, and his or her deputy will be made by the Minister. These are grace and favour appointments and there will be great difficulty in anyone having the view that this is an independent appeals authority while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has such total control over the appeals procedure.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I wish to address the BSE problem, which I have always described as a disaster as we have been going from bad to worse over the past few years. The banning of Irish T-bone steaks, something I do not eat much, is patently ridiculous. The precautionary principle is foremost within the thinking of those in the Commission and on the various scientific bodies, but for a very long time I have been urging that we address this as a public health problem and examine the risk analysis factor. I said this to the Minister at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs where Deputy Walsh said that, when asked, the Spanish Minister for Agriculture said he was dealing with the BSE crisis in his country on his own. I regret the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has also been dealing with it on his own. We should have been hearing much more from the Minister for Health and Children. New variant CJD is not contracted from eating beef, but from eating infected beef. However, people now have the notion that one can get if from eating any beef. We badly need a proper public health debate on this, led by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very serious issue is the disposal of the remains of cattle being slaughtered, which is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will have to get <Col N="156" /> tough and tell his two Cabinet colleagues that there are people in the Seanad who expect to hear from both of them. I expect to hear from the Minister for Health and Children regarding the public health issue and from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding disposal of these animals. The issue concerns these Departments and it is not helpful that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is thrashing around in the middle.</P>
    <P>It is also very worrying that there is no clear line of division of responsibility between the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food Safety Authority and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which causes great concern among consumers. This is why the Minister's two colleagues must talk about the areas for which they are responsible. One is responsible for the Food Safety Authority and the other is responsible for the Environmental Protection Agency. I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has good knowledge in the area, but it would be good if his two colleagues gave us more information.</P>
    <P>I understand the concern of Senator Hayes about the stumbling cow. My real concern is that a stumbling cow will be pictured beside a newspaper with today's date, like they do with hostages, to show that they still exist. That would be really serious and it is why I regret that the plea by Mr. Pat O'Rourke of the ICMSA to have older cows killed sooner is not examined. The incubation period is between two and ten years, so we could have many five to seven year old cows which are fit and well to look at but which are incubating the disease. I wish this matter was a priority, but apparently that cannot happen at present.</P>
    <P>It is very good that the Commission has banned mechanically removed meat as it was a disgusting problem. The good fortune we have had in not having so many cases of new variant CJD may be due to the fact that that process was not used so much here in comparison to England, where it was very popular in the making of all sorts of pies, sausages etc. The traceability schemes must be enforced as they are most important.</P>
    <P>This disaster is costing us a fortune, not just in the area of agriculture. The destruction of cattle scheme will probably have a final cost of about £1 billion. What is the cost of the disaster to the blood bank? Not only are there huge increases in the cost of producing a unit of blood &ndash; it was increased by 25% the other day &ndash; but there is a serious situation as a result of having to refuse so many people as donors, resulting in the cancellation of elective operations throughout the country, which is disastrous. I am extremely concerned about the possible threat to the dairy industry and the foolish considerations being given to the fact that the disease could be transmitted through milk. I have found no scientific evidence for that, nor have I yet found scientific evidence &ndash; I have asked about it several times in the House &ndash; of transmission through ground water, something <Col N="157" /> raised by Commissioner Fischler. Perhaps Senator Doyle will ask the Commissioner about that when she meets him as it was an incredible statement with no scientific basis.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill. Senators have said the appeals system will exist to deal with penalties which are considered too harsh. However, what if the appeals director considers the penalties are too lenient, which could happen? There are still some appalling cases of farmers thinking they can do what they like in terms of food. Premiums are paid for by taxpayers who are entitled to feel that those people who receive them are fulfilling their obligations under the various schemes. Therefore, we must take on board the fact that an appeals officer may decide the penalty was not half enough. For example, I recall a man in west Cork who was injecting slurry etc., pretending his herd had tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>How long has the tuberculosis scheme been in operation? Recently I received figures from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which show there are still herds presenting with bovine TB, which is spread to humans. There are people, particularly in the west, who now and then get TB from infected animals. Those who are paying for premiums are entitled to know they are getting somewhere. I was a small child when the TB eradication scheme was introduced, not to mind the brucellosis scheme. There are still herds infected with brucellosis. I am always being told about the role of badgers in this regard, but there are also badgers in Northern Ireland which does not seem to have the same problem with tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>

      <P>The <i>Dry Stock Farmer</i> and Teagasc's <i>Farm and Food</i> magazines are both excellent and I keep them in my waiting room. My patients find them very interesting too. However, every solitary article on beef is about quantity, not quality, and this is very serious. We have to be able to say that we are producing quality beef. The research done at Moorepark showed that grass-fed animals have a better form of fatty acid. My own profession has been critical of the quantity of red meat we eat in this country and the possibility of it being an important factor in heart disease. It must be stressed that the issue concerns the weight of cattle. Animals do not seem to be finished until they are an incredible size. I do not know why we cannot sell younger animals on the basis of quality. I recommend this month's <i>Farm and Food</i> magazine which contains two excellent articles about different qualities of beef.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="158" /> Every time we discuss BSE schemes in the House most Senators talk about the compensation farmers will receive rather than the future of farming which looks very gloomy the way things are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the principle behind it is an excellent one which we should all support. However, I do have some reservations about it to which I will refer in a moment. Like other Senators, I want to comment on the BSE issue, the crisis of confidence in elements of the food sector and the effect that is having not only on the industry but also on consumers. Today's news from the European Commission only adds to our sense of incredulity about how the Commission is dealing with this matter. The destruction scheme announced before Christmas has been met with astonishment by consumers and producers alike. It was presented as a measure designed to restore public confidence in the quality and safety of our beef but, in fact, it has had the opposite effect. I wonder what level of thinking is going on in the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Another speaker referred to a panic reaction by the European Commission and I would agree that there is a certain amount of panic in the Commission's reaction. Presenting the destruction scheme as a public health measure on the one hand while describing it as a market intervention measure on the other can only have the effect of undermining public confidence. It also raises a crucial issue in the debate which is the potential conflict between trying to maintain the industry while ensuring that consumers' concerns about food safety are placed at centre stage. Increasingly I am doubtful whether that can be done by the same Department. I am not saying the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is not doing a good job. In many ways, my heart goes out to him because of the disastrous things that are occurring at the moment and the sense of crisis that has enveloped the whole sector. However, we must consider the need to divide the issues of agriculture and food in order to protect the agricultural industry while at the same time ensuring that the public has confidence in the food sector. I hope that things get better and will not get any worse. I am not sure they can get any worse.</P>
      <P>Senator Gibbons listed all the food safety issues that have come our way in recent years. Food safety has to be one of the most critical issues facing Irish agriculture and it shows no signs of going away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for inviting me to open this debate on the outcome of the European Council which was held in Nice last December. I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, for arranging the debate. It is vital that there should be the fullest possible discussion of the Treaty of Nice which is very important for the future development of the European Union. I intend to outline in some detail the main aspects of the treaty, to place it in context and to say a little about the Government's approach to the next items on the European agenda.</P>
      <P>It is now a little over eight weeks since the Nice Council ended. We spent four long days and nights negotiating the new treaty, setting a record which I hope and expect will not be challenged during my time as Taoiseach. Having reflected over the past eight weeks, I remain satisfied that the agreement reached was a good deal for Ireland and Europe, despite the claims I have seen that the summit was badly handled and that the outcome of the negotiations lacked coherence and ambition. These criticisms are unrealistic and miss the point. At Nice, we had a very difficult task. Some of the issues on the table were so difficult that the previous Intergovernmental Conference, at Amsterdam in 1997, had failed to take a decision. Against this background, reaching agreement was a very substantial achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of the treaty may seem dry and technical but we should not forget its broad political context. The objective of the negotiations was to prepare the Union's institutions for enlargement. That objective has now been achieved. It was essential that we came away from Nice sig<Col N="161" /> nalling to the accession candidates that the way ahead was now clear. I will return to the enlargement at the conclusion of this statement, but first I want to set out the main elements of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference at the outset comprised the Amsterdam &ldquo;leftovers&rdquo;&ndash; the size and composition of the Commission and the reweighting of the votes in the Council, and the extension of qualified majority voting as well as some related institutional issues. Flexibility, or enhanced co-operation as it is also not known, was added to the agenda during the process.</P>
    <P>The Government approached the negotiations in a positive light. We wanted to make a genuine contribution to the development of a Union capable of meeting the challenges of enlargement. However, in doing so, we also sought to ensure that the essential characteristics of the Union were maintained. Ireland has, over the years, benefited from the ways in which the Community's institutional balance and unique decision-making processes protect the interests of small states.</P>
    <P>Ireland sees the Commission as central to that institutional balance. As I made clear in advance, a key negotiating objective at the Intergovernmental Conference was to ensure that the Commission would remain both effective and representative. As is well known, a number of the larger member states were concerned about the ability of the Commission to undertake its task effectively with 27 or more members and argued strongly for agreements now on a sharp reduction in its size. Smaller states, including Ireland, felt that at this stage it would be damaging and premature to make such a drastic change. I argued that we could not anticipate the nature of developments in the Union over the next decade and so should not now make a definitive decision.</P>
    <P>What emerged was a very satisfactory compromise. Some movement was required on all sides but I believe we have protected our basic interests. As we wanted, the powers of the Commission President over the management and organisation of the Commission were increased. Furthermore, it was agreed that all member states will for now continue to be entitled to nominate a Commissioner, as will new members when they join. Only when the Union reaches 27 members will there be a review of its composition. The review will set a lower ceiling but the arrangements to be agreed must be based on the total equality of member states. There is, therefore, no question of smaller member states being relegated to a secondary position. Whatever is agreed, Ireland will have the same exact rights as any other member state.</P>
    <P>It was a major achievement to nail down acceptance of the principle of equal rotation. Ensuring parity on the Commission between all member states, however large or small, could not have been guaranteed on a future occasion. That was something of which all the small and medium-sized countries were certain. If we had waited seven or eight years and had come back <Col N="162" /> to it, we would not have got equal rotation. I have not met anybody or even read anything by anyone who has argued that we could have. I think that was unanimous in all the parliamentary debates in January which I have seen.</P>
    <P>On the second related Amsterdam &ldquo;left-over&rdquo;, the reweighting of votes in the Council, we adopted a relatively flexible approach. I wanted to ensure that a qualified majority would require the support of a majority of states and a majority of the Union's population.</P>
    <P>As I anticipated, this turned out to be one of the most protracted and difficult parts of the negotiations. The compromise which was eventually agreed, while complex, will not make it harder in practice to reach agreement on specific proposals, as some have said. The reality is that positions within the Council on any given issue rarely if ever divide on a large-small basis. From an Irish point of view, the drop in our share of the total vote, already inevitable in an enlarged Union, will be minor.</P>
    <P>In an enlarged Union of 27 members, a substantial decrease in the number of areas where unanimity will continue to apply is a prerequisite for the efficient functioning of the Union. In recognition of this and taking account of our other negotiating priorities, we adopted a strongly supportive position on the extension of QMV and, in advance of Nice, we made a determined and successful effort to reduce our list of exceptions to a minimum. In the end, the Union was able to agree to 30 articles moving to QMV.</P>
    <P>Our positive approach was demonstrated by a proposal we made to provide a clear legal base for the Union's social protection committee. We made this proposal to give further momentum to the work begun at the Lisbon European Council on Social Protection and felt that it complemented the steps taken in relation to social exclusion in Amsterdam. I was pleased this was agreed in Nice.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what some people suggest, moving away from unanimity, or the so-called national veto, as it is referred to in some countries, does not in most cases threaten a country's basic interests or national sovereignty. When it comes to votes on a QMV basis, in the majority of cases, Ireland has been on the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side and use of QMV has made it easier for us and like-minded partners to get a decision we want. More importantly, QMV has enabled Europe to build a single market and common policies which have been in the long-term interests of all the member states of the Union. Ireland has, of course, benefited greatly from these developments.</P>
    <P>There are, however, instances where it is appropriate to insist on unanimity. This is the course we took in relation to taxation. I am pleased we held our line on this, despite constant and heavy pressure from the Presidency to accept QMV. It is not that we oppose common action on some aspects of tax, such as anti-fraud measures, it is just that we believe that there needs to be a guarantee that such action needs to <Col N="163" /> respect the fundamental requirements of all members. Moreover, on the basis of our experience, we are convinced that there needs to be an openness within the Union to a number of alternative socio-economic models and taxation philosophies, taking account of the traditions and situations of the member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice also includes provisions which make it easier for sub-groups of member states to co-operate more closely on a given matter if they so wish. These provisions will be subject to a range of safeguards which will protect the rights of all states to opt into or stay out of such arrangements and will ensure that key policies of the Union, for example, in relation to the Single Market, will not be damaged. I would like to make it clear that Ireland is not opposed in principle to closer co-operation. Ireland would not be adverse to participation in such co-operation where we felt that it would be in the national and European interest.</P>
    <P>While closer co-operation may apply to aspects of the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, we and other like-minded states ensured that military and defence matters are specifically excluded. While I am on this issue, I want to make it clear that only changes in the Nice treaty relating to foreign, security or defence issues are of a minor and purely technical kind. They in no way alter the scope or basis of the EU's capacity and competence in this area. All over Europe, even parties which have been sceptical about the EU recognise that the Nice treaty is directed towards enlargement and will accept it for this reason. The biggest potential losers from any scare-mongering about Nice would be precisely those peoples and countries which suffered most from the Cold War. This would be unforgivable.</P>
    <P>In the context of enlargement, it was clear from the outset that every existing member state, except for Germany which has been under-represented relative to its population, would have to accept a reduction in its representation at the European Parliament so as to accommodate the accession states. In the event, I am satisfied with the outcome that will leave us with 12 MEPs in an enlarged Union. While it was important that all member states had to play their part in accommodating new member states, it was imperative that the burden be shared on an equitable basis among member states. The proposal from the European Parliament would have involved a drop to nine MEPs for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nice also agreed changes to the working methods and composition of the Courts of Justice and of First Instance, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Affairs Committee which will prepare them for an increase in the size of the Union. We were happy to support these changes.</P>
    <P>With regard to ratification of the treaty, I have said from the outset that our approach to the negotiations was to see the best deal for Ireland <Col N="164" /> and the Union and thereafter to consider the procedures necessary for ratification. The question of whether a referendum will be required is under urgent consideration. The Government will take a final decision when the formal text of the Nice treaty has been finalised by EU legal experts and the advice of the Attorney General has been received. We will soon be in a position to take that decision. However, I have asked that officials ensure that the preparatory work necessary for a referendum is put in train to give the Government the full range of options as to timing. As I have indicated elsewhere, I continue to think it is most likely that a referendum will be held and that it would be best to move sooner rather than later. I am confident that the people, if called upon to vote, will make clear their solidarity with the enlargement candidates and their continuing support for the development of the EU.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, at Nice we also agreed a Declaration on the Future of the Union, establishing a process for taking forward issues such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Catalogue of Competences, the interrelationship between national parliaments and the Union and the restructuring of the treaties. There is to be a further intergovernmental conference in 2004. The Swedish and Belgian Presidencies are to initiate preliminary consideration of the agenda and the modalities by which it will be taken forward. At the conclusion of a fully inclusive consultation process there will be a further declaration at the EU Council in December 2001 under the Belgian Presidency which will provide a road map for the work to be carried out by way of preparation for the 2004 conference.</P>
    <P>These issues raise very important questions about the future direction of the EU. Since Nice, a number of interesting and important contributions have been made. The Government believes it is vital that Ireland plays its part in this debate and to enable us to do so we will be considering how best to facilitate wide ranging national consideration of these issues in the run-up to 2004. It will be necessary in this process to ask ourselves quite searching questions about the kind of European Union we want to see.</P>
    <P>At the same time, and here I agree with Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, we must not allow preparation for another Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, and a debate about constitutional and institutional issues, to distract from the major practical tasks facing the Union in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>For example, next January will see the introduction of euro notes and coins. This will be both a huge logistical and practical exercise and a symbolic moment of great impact. If it goes well, as I believe it will, it will make the importance and success of the European project come alive to all our citizens in a very tangible way.</P>
    <P>Even sooner, next month, the first annual spring employment summit takes place in Stockholm. This will seek to monitor and accelerate the progress we are making on the broad economic <Col N="165" /> and social goals set for the Union at Lisbon last March, namely, to become the most dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010 while also achieving greater social cohesion. This requires action across a wide range of issues, from research to economic liberalisation to responding to the ageing of Europe's population. The intention is that Heads of State and Government should take a strategic overview of what is happening both nationally and at EU level. Essentially we have to find ways in which Europe can become more competitive as a global economic player while protecting the values of solidarity and inclusion.</P>
    <P>Another great project facing the Union is enlargement. As I said earlier, the whole point of Nice was to prepare the Union for this. The way is now clear for the enlargement negotiations to accelerate and intensify and I know that this is a priority for the Swedish Presidency. Given the hope that the first negotiations can be concluded in 2002, the time is approaching when some hard decisions will fall to be taken. I am determined that our vital interests must be protected in the negotiations but, at the same time, we need to be generous and understanding towards the applicants.</P>
    <P>Of course, membership should only be granted to those states which are capable of meeting the challenges involved and which have objectively met the appropriate criteria. It would do nobody any favours to act otherwise. However, that said, I hope and believe that the first accessions will take place within a few years. As I have consistently stated, I believe that enlargement is in the interests of Europe as a whole and of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enlargement goes right to the heart of what the European project is about. We in western Europe have played our part in assisting and encouraging change across our shared continent. We are now called upon to extend our partnership within the European Union to embrace the prospective new members. The European Union has an historic duty to underpin freedom and democracy and to promote prosperity and partnership throughout Europe. It was itself founded for those very purposes.</P>
    <P>However, enlargement should not be seen as just a moral and political imperative; it is also an economic opportunity. Already the levels of Irish trade with and investment in the applicant countries are rising sharply. The expansion of the Single Market by over 100 million new consumers will create many new customers for our goods and services.</P>
    <P>I am well aware from my own visits to the applicant countries, most recently to Malta and Cyprus, that they have a particular interest in our experience within the Union. Ireland is seen as a small state with an historical experience not totally different from their own, which, having started from a long way back, has made the best possible use of the support and opportunities given to it to catch up with the European mainstream. When, on my visits abroad, I am able to <Col N="166" /> tell our story, to compare the statistics of today with those of 30 years ago, or even ten years ago, I always make clear just how much we owe to the Union and just how unimaginable our current prosperity and self-confidence would be if we had not had the chance to grow within the EU framework.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective, the EU balance sheet has been overwhelmingly positive. I am convinced that others deserve the same opportunities we got a generation ago. The Nice Treaty opens the way to enlargement and it is above all for that reason that I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him given that he has a heavy schedule. We appreciate the time he has taken to come and discuss this issue. The Nice Summit and the whole post-Nice process is critical to the future of Ireland. Regrettably it is very hard to interest the Irish electorate in that fact and even the popular media in the issues that will impact on our country, quite considerably and largely positively, in the years to come. I welcome the outcome of Nice. I regret that in many areas it fell far short of our expectations and that there were casualties. In responding to the Taoiseach's fine address I shall address a few of those points.</P>
      <P>Nice is considered a success from the point of view of the applicant countries. It put in place the necessary procedures to allow accession to go ahead. That had to happen. We talked of leftovers in Amsterdam but while there were not technical leftovers in Nice there were major shortfalls. Any criticisms should always have at the top of the agenda that we applaud the fact that from an applicant country's point of view, Nice was a success.  We are not churlish in any way in questioning the rights of any country that meets the criteria to join the Union. As a small open exporting nation we welcome the enlargement of Europe. I preface any remarks I make with that strong point.</P>
      <P>The main casualty of the Nice summit was the French Presidency. There were also serious implications for the future working methods of intergovernmental conferences generally because of President Chirac's aggressive style of chairmanship. It is easier for me than the Taoiseach to say this. Even the Taoiseach has warned against a repeat of Nice. He has warned against a repeat of Nice as a process, so we must call a spade a spade.</P>
      <P>The Commission also left Nice very badly bruised having been sidelined by the Chair at critical stages of the negotiations. Given that morale is already low in the Commission it faces a difficult few years. Indeed, Prodi faces a hostile media at present and it appears this will continue. That is not in Ireland's interest but it is a fact we must recognise as a backdrop to any of our discussions on Nice and the whole post-Nice situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The Taoiseach dealt with all the major areas in relation to Nice. The Amsterdam leftovers were there plus all the accession requirements.</P>
    <P>I mentioned I have concerns about the whole process of intergovernmentalism. If Nice is the outcome of intergovernmentalism we do not need any more. We have to look at the post-Nice agenda and towards another process for discussions among the member states particularly on reform matters, perhaps an institutional conference rather than an intergovernmental conference. An inter-institutional conference is being touted in Europe. That would mean Commission, Parliament and the Council would have an input structured along the lines of a convention. It would have to go to an intergovernmental conference for final ratification when the issues had been debated in public. One of the big criticisms of intergovernmentalism is that it happens behind closed doors. The Commission was side-lined by President Chirac but the Parliament does not have a right to contribute. It is represented and in attendance but is not part of the debate in any sense. In view of the reduction in unanimity in terms of voting and hopefully an extension of co-decision, even though I am critical that it did not extend far enough, there is a major parliamentary deficit looming if we do not get this right. I am not sure what major institutional reforms are required to ensure that enlargement works and that there is not massive destabilisation, socially and economically.</P>
    <P>What structures will we put in place to debate the problems? The system of intergorvernmentalism as an effective process emerged badly scarred from the Nice Summit. There is a void at present. If Intergovernmental Conferences are not the way forward what system will encompass the concerns of all and allow everybody to contribute openly rather than behind closed doors?</P>
    <P>The reweighting of votes was mentioned. With respect to the Taoiseach's opinion, there is a general view that the new complicated system will make it very difficult for voting to be an efficient and effective process. Instead of simplifying the voting procedure in an enlarged Europe we have complicated the decision making process. That was not the intention going into the Nice Intergovernmental Conference. The Taoiseach maintains it will not be more difficult but I maintain it will be more complicated. The truth lies somewhere in between. Time will tell. What has been decided is unsatisfactory. There were strongly held views on the way to proceed and a compromise emerged.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that 30 Articles would move to qualified majority voting. Not all of them have co-decision as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for giving up the veto or unanimity. It was hoped that as the list of topics to be decided on the basis of a unanimous vote was reduced in favour of decision by qualified majority voting, the safeguard of the Parliament vote would be operative in co-decision. That is in Ireland's interest and I regret it is a <Col N="168" /> major shortfall in terms of what was expected on co-decisoin. The requirement on the European Parliament to vote in co-decision along with the Council of Ministers is an extra safeguard, especially where a veto is lost. It ensures that a democratically elected public forum can take care, not only of Ireland's interest but the broader Union interest.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the sacrifice of the veto is not as contentious as it had been built up to be before Nice. By virtue of its structure, intergovernmental decisions mean it is Ireland versus France, versus Germany or whoever. Each Minister or Prime Minster bats for their own country and they look over their shoulder to their national media and electorate. A <i>communitaire</i> approach is required or we will never resolve the problem of reform. If the Taoiseach is sent out to bat on certain issues he can only go as far as the Irish position will allow in terms of what is acceptable to the electorate at home. The French and the Germans have the same dilemma, albeit that they may operate from a different menu of choices. The system does not lend itself to reform on a Union wide basis. At Nice the interests of each country were paramount while the Union was a very poor second. We did not get the required result in terms of Community reform.</P>
    <P>Alarm bells sound among many at the suggestion of a two tier Europe. Some want it because they wish to get ahead much faster on a range of issues where their development will allow. Others are more nervous of the various streams converging. We already have a two tier Europe covering major areas, such as the euro zone and the Schengen Agreement countries, from which the UK and Ireland are excluded. Instinctively I do not like the idea, but I must acknowledge that it appears to work reasonably in major areas. However, I urge caution because there is as much a negative as a positive involved. We could find ourselves on the wrong side as quickly as the right side. It must be watched carefully. The risk of the acceptance of two tiers is that some of the applicant countries might find themselves on a third tier, so we must be careful that countries are not classified into different tiers where it becomes difficult for them to progress on to the mainstream European bandwagon.</P>
    <P>I accept the Taoiseach's points on security and defence issues and I applaud the stance taken on them by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Nice. Indeed, I was proud to support his view when the matter was discussed in the European Parliament. He did Ireland a wonderful service while not upsetting any of the people at home.</P>
    <P>Following the Nice summit it was agreed that the number of Irish MEPs in the European Parliament should be reduced from 15 to 12, which is better than might have been expected. The Minister said the proposal from the European Parliament would have meant the number dropping to nine. That was never debated or agreed on the floor of the Parliament. A draft proposal from the constitutional committee &ndash; to the best <Col N="169" /> of my knowledge it does not contain a member from Ireland &ndash; proposed a table of reweighting the number of seats in the Parliament on a national basis to accommodate enlargement. On that basis Ireland would have emerged with nine members. It was never agreed by the Parliament in plenary session. I, and I think other MEPs, tabled an amendment to the draft proposal to the constitution as soon as I got a copy of it to ensure we could safeguard the best possible position, with a floor of 11 or 12 members. The Nice Summit has got rid of the doubt surrounding that debate.</P>
    <P>Will the new reweighting of parliamentary seats for member states be applicable from 2004 and 2009? The answer might be of interest to some of the Taoiseach's colleagues.</P>

      <P>It was the best decision Ireland could have secured given the size of the country. I support the Taoiseach's views on institutional changes. Given the history of referenda in this country I am not in favour of holding one unless it is decided by the Government's legal advisers that it is necessary. In that case the Government should hold one, otherwise the ratification of the treaty will be challenged.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns, post-McKenna judgment, about the ability of the Government, aided by most of the Opposition, to convince the Irish people. I accept what the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said last week that because of the current little ranker between Commissioner Solbes and the Government in relation to our reprimand, given that the public does not know what is being done wrong in terms of economic success and does not understand what is upsetting the Commission at the moment, it will make it difficult to hold a referendum on Nice hot on the heels of this public, rather unseemly dialogue between the Commission and the Government. While I accept the main points made by the Minister for Finance, and accepting that we have breached the criteria, it would be of enormous benefit if we could make amends and be seen to accept the point being made diplomatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is every likelihood that the Irish question will be debated next week at the plenary session in Strasbourg. When this was mentioned to me, I said I would be very pleased to talk about the success of the Irish economy for the past ten years, because I can point out many good aspects. I accept that technically we have breached X, Y and Z, but let our success story be a way forward in relation to other countries, particularly some of the smaller accession countries. I do not say this in a combative way, but there is room for a little diplomatic handling of the situation next week. Perhaps there could be a few signals that we accept the principle of the point, but our story was such that if we did otherwise it would have been twice as bad in terms of the impact on our inflation. I do not have to tell the Taoiseach, who <Col N="170" /> made his political career by resolving conflicts in other Departments, how to resolve this public conflict between the Commission and Ireland which, in the long term, will do us no good if we are macho for the sake of being macho on the issue. He should use his best skills of diplomacy to resolve this public conflict.</P>

      <P>This issue will be discussed next week during the plenary session in Strasbourg. One can speak on any subject on the Prodi debate, which is like a general debate here. It will arise under the Bulman economic report when there is a question specifically on Ireland. We will be lucky if we do not have to address the issue three times next week in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and appreciate his coming here this morning. We must look very carefully at the lessons to be learned from German reunification. In opening the European Union, in the real spirit of the Schumann money project, to the accession countries, and reminding ourselves why the European Union came about, there is an absolute logic why we should extend European membership to central and eastern European countries once they meet the relevant criteria. However, in doing so, we must learn from the German reunification process. It hurt Germany much more than it ever expected in terms of economic and social destabilisation. Enormous preparation is needed in relation to the different cultures, the different stages of the economic cycles and the different stages in terms of technology and so on of these countries.</P>
      <P>We cannot under-estimate the difficulties of the enlargement and accession process, while welcoming these countries to our midst. In the long term, this will be to Ireland's benefit. I have no doubt that as a net exporting country the shop and supermarket shelves of another 109 million citizens of Europe are there for us. This is an exporter's dream so we should get out there and market the best of Ireland and the best of our produce. However, we must not underestimate the possible destabilisation, the impact on the euro and the social problems that will result initially if we do not have the institutional reforms in place to cope with the problems that will inevitably arise before we get to the point we are at now in relation to the current 15 member states.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House as it is always an honour to have him here. It is a mark of the regard with which he holds <Col N="171" /> this House that he has come here to discuss these issues.</P>
      <P>I have called on a number of occasions for a debate on enlargement of the Union because the public in general is not aware of the profound implications of enlargement for this country. Even as late as this morning, I called for a debate on this issue. Why was the Nice Summit so important? It was important because its purpose was to prepare the Union for enlargement. The number of members will double in the near future. That is worth repeating because it is not commonly recognised by many people. In the not too distant future, we will have twice the number of members of the European Union that we have at present. It is almost as if the founding fathers were starting all over again. It is not a little bit here and there or a country here and a country there. The proposed enlargement is a profound undertaking and the Union which will inevitably evolve will be very different from that which now exists. Its aims, aspirations and so on will be the same, but it will be a richer Union. It will be multicultural and rich in its diversity, with a lot to offer everyone.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in Nice was on re-enforcing stability and democracy and particularly incorporating into the democratic system the countries of eastern and central Europe, some of which even today are only beginning to witness the fruits of their newly found freedom, countries from the cockpit of Europe such as Chechnya, Czechoslovakia and Hungary which, having had the mantel of oppression lifted from them, are now eager to join the other European democracies. It is incumbent upon us to welcome them into the fold as quickly as possible. It is a wonderful opportunity for us in Ireland to extend the hand of friendship and to strengthen our economic and political relations with the aspirant countries, particularly those of a similar size to Ireland. We must recognise that the Union's interests and our interests are from here on inextricably linked and we must recognise the huge potential of a Single Market of 500 million people, greater than our wildest dreams even a few years ago and a wonderful opportunity for us to export our newly found expertise, high technology and software, of which we are now the world's largest producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in going to Nice, while having a clear obligation to protect our vital national interests, also had an obligation to reach conclusions on institutional reforms, a need which was recognised but not resolved in Amsterdam. They responded magnificently to the challenge and deserve our congratulations. The Government approached negotiations in a positive light and against the background of the priority we attach to the earliest possible enlargement of the Union. In doing so the Government sought to ensure that the essential characteristics of the Union were maintained. The Taoiseach mentioned some of these aspects, but it is no harm to <Col N="172" /> mention them again. There will be no change in the size of the Commission until 2005, at which time the larger member states will give up the second Commissioner, and there will be a review when the Union reaches 27 members. The weighting of votes was one of the most protracted discussions in Nice. Ireland retained its ranking with Denmark and Finland, each having seven votes out of a total of 345 when we have a Union of 27 states. Together with the United Kingdom, Sweden and Luxembourg, Ireland will continue to insist on the retention of unanimity for all aspects of taxation. Ireland will be left with 12 members of the European Parliament in an enlarged Union. This figure was signalled in the negotiations prior to the summit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in the Dáil on 12 December last during a debate on this issue:</P>
    <P>While some media reports have cast the Nice outcome as one of victory for Ireland in terms of the retention of the Commission, the retention of unanimity on taxation matters, the number of MEPs we secured and the explicit exclusion of military and defence matters from the new enhanced co-operation procedures, I would rather consider the Nice Treaty as a victory for the Union and the applicant states.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer &ndash; I have spoken about it on many occasions at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs &ndash; is that of keeping the public informed of developments. The greatest problem which could affect the Union would be a decline in public support for it. If the public ever ceases to accept that more can be achieved collectively than by a single member state going it alone, the cohesion of the Union will be threatened and, perhaps, destroyed. It will, therefore, always be necessary to have an accurate, clear, concise and continual flow of information to members of the public with regard to current and impending developments. It is so easy for ill-informed sources to drip feed rumours with no foundation about certain social issues or defence matters, namely, that Ireland will be obliged to join some form of huge nuclear alliance.</P>
    <P>The development of a European security and defence policy is significant in enabling the European Union to play a greater role in achieving its objective of maintaining peace, security and stability in Europe. It is essential for Ireland to be centrally involved in helping to shape future changes and in ensuring that they move in the direction we would like to see them take. We continue to actively and constructively participate in European responses to the crisis management challenges which can arise. An important step in this direction was taken by the European Council at Nice with the approval of the Presidency report on progress made in establishing the European Union's capability to undertake crisis management tasks. The developments in European security and defence policy had their basis in the <Col N="173" /> implementation of provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty. This report was, therefore, adopted outside the context of discussions on the draft Treaty of Nice.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long history &ndash; over 40 years &ndash; of involvement in peacekeeping with the United Nations and is now a member of the Security Council. Rather than shirk responsibilities in the area of security and defence, we should be centrally involved and, as stated earlier, we can then shape the way we want matters to proceed. This is just one area in respect of which misinformation continues to be drip fed and about which we must comment on occasion.</P>
    <P>It will be the task of Government to ensure a continual flow of accurate and honest information. This, in turn, will ensure the support of the public for the Union. The Taoiseach referred to the fact that the details of the treaty may seem dry and technical but that we should not forget its broad political context. We can only do this by providing the public with the type of information to which I have already referred. If the public obtains such information, I believe it will continue to support the Union and will allow its institutions to work for a democratic, economically viable and war free Europe. If Mr. Schumann were alive today I am sure he would say that is the reason the Community was established in the first instance.</P>

As an Independent I do not have to be quite so polite and the term <i>salade nicoise</i> comes to mind when one considers what happened at Nice. The reports which appeared in the newspapers do not give the positive, rosy glow the Taoiseach managed to bestow upon the Nice Summit. For example, on headline indicated that the &ldquo;Vote-grab by the Big Five leaves smaller states outgunned and outraged&rdquo; while the article over which it appeared stated that &ldquo;the proposals had prompted revolt from the smaller delegations&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister, said it was a &lsquo;slap in the face'.&rdquo;  Then there was the behaviour of some of the senior officials, particularly Mr. Chirac who is widely reported as having bellowed into Mr. Prodi's face, in respect of a civil servant from the Commission, that he should &ldquo;get that little functionary out of here&rdquo;. Mr. Prodi protested and stated that he would have his officials about him when he needed them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The reports do not suggest that it was a very well tempered meeting. In my opinion, it was quite fractious.</P>
      <P>The significant thing about this debate, which I hope will be reasonably widely reported by the media, is that I believe discussions are taking place and decisions are being made about which the general public knows very little. I do not believe there is much knowledge abroad about the kind of discussions that have been taking place. There are a number of specific items which must be considered.</P>
      <P>The first of these is the position we have taken with regard to the right to a Commissioner. It may very well be that we had to yield on this, but there is no question or doubt that our position has been weakened. After the adoption of the Nice treaty, we will no longer have an automatic right to a Commissioner in the future. This may be a practical necessity but it will mean that we will need to build bridges with our partners in Europe and maintain good relationships with them. That, perhaps, makes the position regarding the reprimand somewhat tendentious and difficult and it will require the skills of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and, if I may say, all the little functionaries &ndash; who we in Ireland at least value even if Mr. Chirac does not &ndash; to bring about a successful and cohesive approach to matters. We have yielded and we have been flexible in respect of this issue and I hope this will produce some degree of goodwill among the other states .</P>
      <P>There is then the question of qualified majority voting. This is a complicated area. Many people do not fully appreciate what is involved. To them, QMV is merely another set of three initials. It is worth placing on record, in condensed form, what it means and how it will affect us. In essence, QMV is a rebalancing in favour of the larger states, particularly Germany which did spectacularly well out of the Nice Summit. The business section of <i>The Irish Times</i> outlined what is involved in very succinct terms when it stated:</P>
      <P>From now on, decisions will not only need the support of at least 73 per cent of the votes under the Council of Ministers' elaborate, weighted voting system. They must also have the backing of member-states representing at least 62 per cent of the total population of the EU.</P>
      <P>This means that Germany will need the help of only two large states to block any measure, whereas each other member-state would require more allies. Germany's population of 82 million, combined with that of either France or Britain, accounts for 41 per cent of the EU's total population. Between them, France and Britain can only muster 35 per cent of the EU's population &ndash; not enough to block a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> There is a substantial element of veto now residing in the three principal players in Europe. We must recognise that fact, accept it and understand what is involved. Again, we will be obliged to rely in this regard on the diplomatic skills of the Taoiseach and the others to whom I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The most critical point about the Nice summit is that although we yielded in respect of the areas mentioned, we managed to reserve our position regarding a veto on taxation. That is absolutely vital and I am glad we succeeded in our efforts. One of the principal supports of our current economic strength is the fact that we retain independence in this area. For example, we have the International Financial Services Centre, with its advantageous tax system, which has attracted multinational corporations to establish operations here and also substantial investment from the United States. If we were prepared to sacrifice our independence in relation to taxation matters, it might lead to a substantial decline in the fortunes of the International Financial Services Centre. I am extremely glad that we protected this right.</P>
    <P>The reprimand is to be delivered at a time when we have yielded in many areas and the regulations of our economy have been sacrificed in many ways to central control. Given that we no longer have the kind of levers we had in the past in terms of regulation of the economy, it is vital that we retain the capacity to rule our own house in terms of domestic taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Although some people abroad would regard the language used by Irish politicians as inflammatory, we are quite right to defend this position. The message should go from this House to Europe that this is a matter on which we stand firm and that all sides of this House support the Government in retaining our independence. We should not cravenly kowtow to European bullying. As Senator Doyle has said, the Irish public may be naïve and I may certainly be naïve in economic matters but simple people reading the newspapers would certainly take the view that we must be doing something right with this economy. We are one of the strongest economies, if not the strongest, in the European Union. If we are getting it so right, why should we be the first state selected to be reprimanded? Should it not be the other way round? Should Europe not be looking at us and examining the way we handle our financial affairs to see if they cannot learn from us?</P>
    <P>There has also been a shift in terms of power. The President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, and his successors will have the capacity to sack Commissioners if they are seen to fail in their duty. I welcome the capacity to remove inefficient Commissioners. About a year ago, the Commission got itself into quite a disastrous situation but there was no capacity to remove these people. Should it not be the European Parliament, rather <Col N="176" /> than the President of the Commission, that has this capacity?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the summits move permanently to Brussels. This was recorded as being part of a last minute deal in the early hours of Monday morning in order to persuade the Belgians to come on board.</P>
    <P>I have worries about the codification of the Rapid Reaction Force. Alarms go off every time I hear of Partnership for Peace, PFP, RRF and the rest. There is a growing military element under so many different headings and they are coyly hidden under these little acronyms. There is no doubt that we are being walked into a military alliance. Ireland should be very careful not to become part of a process in which the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations are undermined and replaced by these other things. When I look at our colleagues in the European Union, I really doubt if people in this country want to be associated with them.</P>
    <P>Reports have appeared in the last few weeks concerning the French during the war in Algeria in the 1950s. At that time, this democratic European government consistently denied that there was any torture, any murder or any calculated disappearances. Now they have admitted that it was happening wholesale and indeed it was policy. One French general, General Massu, appeared to have got qualms about it and to want repentance at the edge of the grave. One of his colleagues came out and defended it. He said that yes, it was regrettable that there was this torture and murder as an instrument of policy but it was necessary and if it was necessary again he would do the same. Is this the kind of military alliance in which we want to be involved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Norris for sharing time with me. I want to speak about the proposed reprimand. At a time when euro-scepticism is growing throughout Europe and many different countries are having difficulty explaining the European model and ideals to their people, this is the very worst time for the European Commission to wag the finger at this country. I say as an independent parliamentarian that I consider it to be weak-kneed, bullyboy tactics. I did not hear much from the European Commission, who are described as the guardians of the euro when Wim and the boys were letting the euro go through the floor last year and making mistakes left, right and centre. There was no finger wagging at the European Central Bank. There was no finger wagging towards Berlin or Bonn. It is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to Senator Doyle, it is not a matter of any sharp diplomatic incursions at this point. There is a serious and fundamental issue here, which I want the Government to state firmly to Europe. It is only possible to have a single model of fiscal accountability and policy for all of Europe when all of Europe is the same. This country needs to converge in many ways with the <Col N="177" /> rest of Europe before it would be fair to apply a single policy without flexibility.</P>
    <P>When we agreed to the euro, we understood the issue of asymmetric shocks and how that would affect the economic community. This is a classic example of it in reverse where there is an asymmetric impact of the policies. It works like this. We need to spend a lot of money on services, for example in the areas of education and health. As stated in this House before, we should be spending as much per student on educational services as the rest of Europe. We should have the same quality of and investment in health services <i>per capita</i> as the rest of Europe. When we have economic inclusion brought to the level of the rest of Europe, then it will be fair to say to our Government that it should spend no more than any other European country. Until that is done, the European single policy of inflexible application to all of the economic systems in European countries will reinforce disadvantage and underprivilege. That is a reality that is understood by the Irish social partnership and it should be stated very firmly to the European governments. There is an issue of trust and confidence in the community and they need to be aware of it.</P>
    <P>The social partnership model operated in this country goes from top to bottom. It begins by creating a competitive economy and that has required workers at all levels to tighten their belts for the last ten or 15 years. Arising from that competitiveness we have created wealth. That wealth goes to a number of areas. Of course it goes to profits. Of course it goes to research and development. It also goes into our taxation revenue. This taxation revenue is then redistributed in several ways. One is to improve social inclusion; another is to improve the pay of public servants and another is to improve social services. That is where the money is being spent. There is no question of our cutting back on investment in health, education, pay, improved services or improved social inclusion. It took us a long time to get to this point. Having done so we now wish to redistribute the wealth.</P>
    <P>I absolutely reject their model of fiscal policy that seems to indicate that what they are proposing in Europe would control inflation. It does not necessarily do so. Inflation is a natural part of the economic cycle. It is something we have put up with and control and direct. It is not something that can be excluded or eliminated. We need to put the proper policies in place.</P>
    <P>It will be helpful if the Irish Government ask the European Commission what they will do to ensure the euro remains competitive with currencies globally. Why can the Commission not make progress on pricing oil in euros? There has been some move towards that goal, but little progress has been made despite the matter being on the agenda for several years.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable for the Commission to ask Ireland to accept the policies that got us into trouble in the 1980s, given that we spent the 1990s <Col N="178" /> getting out of that trouble. There is some wealth here. When we reach a level of redistribution that provides acceptable levels of social inclusion and State services, then like the rest of modern, wealthy Europe we can allow our spending to be governed by such policies.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Doyle on the voting issue. I am attracted to the idea of the double majority, requiring a majority of both countries and population. The Taoiseach is trying to achieve this, and it was the objective of the previous Government also. The Taoiseach seems happy with a compromise and I will not pass judgment on that. As in all confederations, we have to move from a veto position to a qualified majority position, then to a less qualified majority position and then to a normal majority voting procedure. That will happen when there is trust and confidence among all the Community members.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has made it clear we must be careful how policy is formulated. From their eyrie in Brussels the Commission are not the font of all the wisdom in Europe. They have shown themselves to be quite inept in recent years, yet now they pick the smallest but most successful economy in Europe for their complaints. The Commission should apply to the rest of Europe the model of economic development that has evolved in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no successful economic model in a situation where unemployment is less than 4 per cent. We are in new territory. We have the lowest level of unemployment in Europe and the highest level of productivity growth among workers. We have the fastest growing economy and the second lowest debt to gross national product ratio in Europe. What else do the Commission want? If they apply similar figures to the rest of Europe they might have reason for complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nice summit has important aspects. The Swedish EU Presidency has taken the &ldquo;Three E's&rdquo; of enlargement, employment and environment as the main topics for its six-month tenure.</P>
      <P>Enlargement has had most emphasis during recent presidencies. I was in Stockholm last week at a meeting of chairmen of European affairs committees which included those from applicant countries as well as the current members of the EU. The problems of enlargement are different for each country. Enlargement will create problems within the current EU membership and it will impact on the newer applicants. Malta applied for membership in 1990 and meets the criteria required. It is a small country that will make little impact on the EU, but it is very close to North Africa. The Baltic countries were not considered to be of great importance to Europe before 1990 because they lay in the Soviet sphere of influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a different emphasis among the various applicant countries and there are fears, some <Col N="179" /> due to Germany's position. Freedom of labour and capital movement is one of the bases of the EU, yet it is suggested that after joining the EU, applicant countries would suffer a seven-year delay before they were entitled to freedom of labour movement. That is wrong at a time when European economies have improved dramatically and there is a need for labour. Priority should be given to EU applicant countries in sourcing labour, providing them with visas and the means of joining our labour market.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that countries such as Romania, which comes into the news quite often, have many workers who would benefit the Irish economy. It is difficult, because there is an image of Romanians as gypsies and therefore unwelcome, as is the case in other countries. The gypsies of Romania and other east European countries are a small percentage of the population and will be a minority of those who come to Ireland to work.</P>
    <P>Western Europe needs qualified labour and we should look to applicant countries to provide it. It is not fair that a seven-year waiting time should apply before allowing free movement of labour. The EU should get rid of that idea, just as the church got rid of the idea of purgatory.</P>
    <P>We have never had a unified Europe and those who think otherwise are fools. Europe is a huge area where there has never been a union. We had empires such as the Austro-Hungarian empire which covered large parts of Europe. To speak of the re-unification of Europe is nonsense. We are trying to get a majority of European countries into an environment where matters of trade, defence, ethnicity and mutual interest can be discussed.</P>
    <P>In Sweden last week, we discussed the environment. Protection of the environment, however, does not mean that the growth of employment potential can be dismissed &ndash; it is as important as the creation of employment. The greener the environment the better for employees and employers. We will do well to marry the issues of environmental protection and employment potential.</P>
    <P>Many of the applicant eastern European countries have huge agricultural potential. Irish farmers may see this as a threat. I do not agree. Eradicating certain diseases from the herd will take money from the agricultural kitty. There may not be as much money left for the applicant countries as we received under the CAP on our accession into Europe.</P>
    <P>Mr. Persson, when speaking of the three Es, admitted that the Swedish Presidency might not fulfil its hopes regarding each of these. The Presidency will also address matters outside Europe, for example in Palestine. Israel does not accept Europe as a powerbroker because it thinks that Europe is too close to Palestine. Nevertheless, we must have a bigger input into Middle East affairs. We cannot allow the Americans to control negotiations on behalf of the rest of the world. More <Col N="180" /> money, after all, goes into that part of the world from Europe than from anywhere else.</P>
    <P>We should defend ourselves against recent complaints made by the Commission. Statistics are available which show that we have a small economy which has a small part to play in the economics of Europe. Our taxation policies will spread the impact of our excellent economic growth to everybody. They are not anti-European.</P>
    <P>Cyprus is among the countries applying for EU membership. I believe that it would be nonsense to admit Cyprus because it is divided between the Greek and Turkish sectors. Greece and Cyprus are seen as acceptable EU members, but Turkey is unlikely to be accepted until it has improved its human rights record. I believe that Turkey's human rights record is equal to that of the United States. The death penalty has not been used by the Turkish Government for 17 years. I wish the same could be said about the United States. Let us be quite plain: there are human rights violations all over the world.</P>
    <P>We joined the UN Security Council on 1 January last. I received a note from the UN yesterday stating our position on five issues that we have been involved with. It is the first time I have encountered such details of what Ireland has done at United Nations level.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the Nice treaty by referendum seems to be necessary. Public support tends to vary depending on the strength of the Government, but I am confident that we will ratify the treaty. The public will support us as they understand its practicality and importance. If there is a need for a referendum, let us have it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris claimed that Germany's population will help it to control decisions made by the EU. In an EU of 27 members, Ireland's percentage of the total EU population will fall from 3.45% to 2.2%. Our voting strength will be settled at 2.03%, which will be a relatively modest adjustment. It has been proven through the years that minor statistical variations are not as important as an ability to make deals with other countries. It has been suggested that decision-making will be more difficult because of new arrangements which mean that decisions must represent at least 62% of the Union's population. The practical effect of this will be to ensure that any decision can be blocked by three large member states. The Taoiseach would have preferred if this threshold had been slightly lower. The effective rate until 1995, however, had been 63%, and on occasions had been over 70%. I do not think Senator Norris's statistics were correct.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at the practical implications of EU enlargement, and especially on the limitations that will be placed on the enlarged EU. There is a need to include applicant members and the sooner the better. We should not wait for a group of countries to be eligible. As soon as a country is eligible for accession it should be allowed in. It is envisaged that a group <Col N="181" /> of countries will be allowed in after 2003 and the second tranche will join in 2005.</P>
    <P>This has been an important debate on the Nice treaty. The more often we hold such debates the more often Senators and those outside the House will be able to see that the evolution of Europe is ongoing, important and necessary for our future economic and social development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Taoiseach did not see fit to remain in the House for the debate. That is no reflection on the Minister of State deputising for him. However, this debate was presented to us in glowing terms as statements on the Nice Summit with the Taoiseach in attendance. The Taoiseach spoke for 15 minutes, listened to one contribution and was out the door. That does not exactly constitute the Taoiseach listening to a wide range of views from all parties and spokespersons in the House.</P>
      <P>That is a shame as the Taoiseach was engaged in the negotiations. This issue will probably go before the country in a referendum and it would be important to hear the views of Senators. The Taoiseach is present in the Dáil for about two hours every day, yet we could not get him for two hours in this session. We will probably not see him in the House this side of summer.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I share a constituency and he attends several launches and openings every day. It could be said that he would attend the opening of an envelope in his constituency, but he cannot remain in this House for two hours in one session. That is very disappointing.</P>

      <P>It certainly was and that is what is on the Senator's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened attentively to the Taoiseach's comments. When one reads what he said it is clear that the decision-making process as regards the treaty leaves a lot to be desired. The Taoiseach <Col N="182" /> spoke about his four long days and nights of negotiations and haggling. It is like &ldquo;Seven Drunken Nights&rdquo; by the Dubliners or an ICTU conference in Tralee.</P>
    <P>The public is at a loss as to what is happening and no one seems to know how decisions are made. In the aftermath of the Nice Summit it is clear that there must be an end to this type of process for negotiating treaties whereby there is endless haggling behind closed doors, Prime Ministers claiming great things, headlines such as &ldquo;The Taoiseach Goes Ballistic&rdquo; or whatever. This kind of process will have to stop as there must be a better way of dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>Despite the sense of frustration at the manner in which business is done, we must not lose sight of what the EU has achieved. That is the key to what the Nice treaty is about. Much more important than the economic benefits it has brought citizens is the EU's crowning achievement regarding peace and political stability in western Europe.</P>
    <P>The 40 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome have brought a period of peace and an absence of war in western Europe not seen for generations and, possibly, never before in the history of this continent. However, citizens of other parts of Europe have not been so fortunate and many still live in severe poverty and in states emerging from the shadows of anti-democratic regimes. In the Balkans, which is as much a part of Europe as is Ireland, in the past decade we have seen the capacity of local conflicts and ethnic disputes to take a terrible toll in lives, with injuries and the destruction of property. In such circumstances it not surprising that so many countries outside the Union wish to join and share in its economic and political benefits. Nor is it surprising that all those who recognise the potential values of a zone of peace and stability stretching from the Aran Islands to the Ural Mountains wish to facilitate the orderly entry of applicant states at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>It was always recognised that the decision-making procedures which originated in a Community of six countries and which were adapted from time to time to facilitate the gradual expansion of the Union to its current 15 members would not be capable of dealing with a Union of 27 or 28 countries as is envisaged. Part of the challenge facing the intergovernmental conference which concluded in Nice was to revise and amend procedures to ensure that an expanded Union could function efficiently and effectively. However, the challenge went far beyond that to constructing a vision of a new Europe appropriate to such a potentially large and diverse community.</P>
    <P>There has to be considerable doubt as to whether the Intergovernmental Conference succeeded in fully meeting either challenge and there is much to suggest that the process reflected a lack of strategy and confidence in the enlargement process. There is also reason to believe that many states were so preoccupied with fighting <Col N="183" /> national corners that they lost sight of the bigger picture. It is not clear whether the Intergovernmental Conference has yet produced the improvements to the treaty necessary to strengthen the Union's capability for enlargement and its democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>Asked whether the Nice treaty was adequate to prepare for enlargement, the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, said that it might have done half the job. He also stated that he could not disguise a certain regret that we did not manage to go further. Eight weeks after the summit we face great difficulties in attempting to draw definite conclusions on the outcome of the Nice Summit because we do not have the text of the draft treaty, nor do we know when it will be available. This is just the draft text and we have no idea when we will have a final text.</P>
    <P>Final judgment on the Nice Summit will have to be withheld until the full text is available for examination and analysis. However, the outcome of EU summits are not always what they appear to be or what political spin doctors suggest. We all remember when, as Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds returned from Edinburgh with what we were told was a cheque for £8 billion in his back pocket. Members will remember that it was not quite that simple and that many more battles had to be fought before the level of funding was determined. We all remember the quaint word &ldquo;<i>fourchette</i>&rdquo;, whether it entailed an increase or a decrease.</P>
    <P>MEPs discussing the Nice Summit this week face the same difficulties in the absence of a draft treaty. However, there are strong suggestions in the European Parliament that despite reports of a successful outcome, many of the details of the draft treaty remain to be finalised. There are strong suggestions that the deal on the number of MEPs to which each state will be entitled has not been nailed down and that further discussions will have to take place before the implications for each member state are clear.</P>
    <P>I was not happy with the Taoiseach's comments on the number of Ireland's MEPs. He was quite vague as to whether we would have 12 or nine. If the number is reduced from the current 15 to nine, that would constitute a huge reduction in Irish representation. I would have expected him to be clearer in his assertion of the number of MEPs to which we will be entitled.</P>
    <P>I am also sceptical of efforts by the Taoiseach to claim a great victory in retaining our low level of corporation tax. Headlines, such as &ldquo;Bertie goes Ballistic&rdquo;, may sound great to the regulars in Fagans bar in Drumcondra, but I doubt if it reflects the reality of Nice. If this was a victory, it was in a phoney war. It was clear from the beginning that countries such as Britain, Sweden and Luxembourg would not contemplate majority voting on taxation issues. This battle would always be won because the other countries had already fought it. It suited the French to have it <Col N="184" /> included in the draft text so they could be seen to make a concession. It also suited the Taoiseach because he could claim a victory when it was taken out. Most of the running on the taxation issue was done by the Swedes and the British.</P>
    <P>The concessions on the composition of the Commission were of greater importance for Ireland and for the long-term development of the Union. The role of the Commission has been central to the Government of the European Union and a strong Commission is in the interests of smaller countries, such as Ireland. We saw a concerted effort at Nice to downgrade the role of the Commission to facilitate a move towards intergovernmentalism. The Taoiseach should not have conceded on Ireland's right to retain a full Commissioner at all times. These are the types of things to which the Taoiseach should be here listening. I fear that the proposals for rotating Commissioners will devalue the Commission and will tilt the balance of power in favour of the Council of Ministers. The political reality is that when the stage of rotation is reached and there is no French, German or British Commissioner, the Commission will lose considerable clout, impact and importance. It does not mind if Ireland does not have a Commissioner, but when the big three do not have one, it will be undervalued.</P>
    <P>When we consider this issue with the decision to raise the threshold for qualified majority voting from 71% to 73%, the position of the big three, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, will be strengthened at the expense of the Commission and of the smaller countries. The big three can now establish a voting block to stymie the smaller countries and their interests, as they always wanted to have control over the affairs of Europe within their largescale hands.</P>
    <P>Every major development in the European Union since we first entered in 1973 has been put before the people and approved by them in a referendum. Regardless of any legal requirements, the Nice treaty should also be subject to a referendum. I am surprised the Taoiseach was not able to give us a commitment today to hold a referendum. He said that legal advice is being sought and it is likely it may happen, but he was vague. If the expansion and development of the Union is to have democratic legitimacy, it must be put before the people for their approval and consent. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to get ratification through a referendum on any treaty with Europe. It will be even more difficult now given that the Minister for Finance and the Government have been reprimanded about inflation, pay and spending policy and their belligerent response that they will not take dictation from any European country, that our farmers are becoming more disillusioned because of the manner in which the European Union has banned our T-bone steaks and seems to be discriminating against them, that many sectors are concerned about our position on neutrality and what is seen as creeping interference from Europe. The <Col N="185" /> Government should consult the Opposition and try to get support for the treaty. Nothing has happened so far in that regard but it would need to get on its bike if we want this treaty to be accepted by the people.</P>
    <P>We should be aware of the disappointment with the treaty. There was the danger that it would not be ratified in the European Parliament. Much of the opposition and criticism is not coming from the Euro sceptics but from strong supporters of the European project. Euro sceptics were always there but Ireland is now becoming one whereas it used to be a Europhile. We are now beginning to be concerned about the European project. While the European Parliament cannot block ratification, a negative vote in the Parliament would rob the treaty of all its credibility. Some MEPs believe that if this happens, a number of national Parliaments, particularly the Italian and Belgian Parliaments, would refuse on principle to ratify it.</P>
    <P>There are many matters to be clarified and questions to be answered. This debate cannot be regarded as at a conclusion but the beginning of the involvement of the Oireachtas in the process. As soon as the full text of the treaty is available, there must be a full debate in this House to which all Members will have an opportunity to contribute. I hope the Taoiseach will give us some more of his time then.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the outset about the unsatisfactory nature of the Intergovernmental Conference process, particularly the final stage of the process in Nice. There is a strong view throughout Europe that this type of horse trading, brinkmanship, late night sittings and haggling must stop and that there must be a new way of concluding the business before the next Intergovernmental Conference is due in 2004. We must ensure this does not continue because of the importance of the treaties. The party of the European socialists, of which the Labour Party is a member, has suggested a new model based on the convention established to draft the charter of fundamental rights. This convention was made up of representatives of the member states, Parliaments and Governments, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency. The convention on the charter successfully concluded its work within nine months. I hope the Government acknowledges the inadequacy of the current system and joins with our colleagues in devising a way which is more democratic and efficient.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that there were two distinct elements to the Nice summit. It marked the end of the Intergovernmental Conference and it was also the conclusion of the French Presidency. While the French have been the subject of much criticism in this House today for their handling of the Intergovernmental Conference, they are entitled to considerable credit for the way they used their Presidency to advance the social policy agenda. That was reflected in the Presidency conclusions which dealt with such <Col N="186" /> important matters as food safety, public safety, sport, environmental issues and the statute for European companies. These areas require further debate because they are major issues relating to the Presidency and the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>I hope this is a preliminary discussion on this issue and that when the full text is made available, we will have a full scale debate where all Members will make their views known.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approve the draft Order entitled:</P>
      <P>Maternity Protection Act, 1994 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order, 2000,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid before Seanad Éireann on the 31st day of January, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>These orders provide for an extension to maternity and adoptive leave which attracts payment of four weeks and an extension of additional unpaid maternity and adoptive leave of four weeks. These orders will implement the budget announcement of 6 December 2000 to extend periods of maternity and adoptive leave. The effect of these orders is to increase maternity leave which attracts a payment to 18 weeks and additional unpaid leave to eight weeks. Adoptive leave attracting payment will increase to 14 weeks and additional unpaid leave to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>There have been major changes in Irish society and in the make up of the labour force due to Ireland's unprecedented rate of economic growth. The participation rate of women aged between 15 and 45, roughly corresponding to child bearing years, is 61.5%. We should provide workplace conditions which value the contribution of women.</P>
      <P>There is a growing demand for child care places. The difficulty for parents in accessing high quality affordable child care for babies under one year of age is particularly acute at present. The proposed increases in maternity and adoptive leave will contribute towards an alleviation of this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The orders before us are the result of recommendations of a working group which was set up by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review and improve maternity protection legislation. The working group was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments and agencies. The working group's recommendation to increase <Col N="187" /> maternity leave has been fast tracked ahead of the other recommendations to ensure women could benefit from the increase as quickly as possible. The report will be published later this month. Adoptive leave was not within the remit of the working group but the Government decided that, in the interest of equity, the increases in maternity leave recommended by the group would also be made applicable to adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations will involve primary legislation and I assure Senators that there will be ample opportunity to discuss issues surrounding maternity protection when legislation to implement the other recommendations is published.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is empowered under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, to increase by order maternity leave which attracts a payment and unpaid maternity leave. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a similar power under the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. The Acts also require a resolution to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the orders can be signed into law. Today we are here to discuss the orders and to pass the resolutions.</P>
    <P>On 6 December the Minister for Finance announced that the increased entitlements will apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided for by the annual social welfare Bill apply from April, or even somewhat later. After the budget announcement officials in my Department examined the possibility of applying the maternity and adoptive leave increases not only to women who commence maternity and adoptive leave on or after early April but also to women who go on leave prior to that date. This issue was examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. It is, of course, essential that the orders comply with the parent Acts. The Attorney General has advised that it would not be possible to have the orders to extend the period of maternity or adoptive leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements of the parent Acts. Any attempt to make the orders retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge.</P>
    <P>The notice requirements under the Acts are as follows. An employee must notify her employer of her intention to take maternity or adoptive leave at least four weeks before the commencement of leave. In the case of unpaid maternity or adoptive leave she must notify her employer of her intention to take leave at least four weeks before the commencement of the unpaid leave. There are different requirements in respect of notice where a father is applying for leave in the <Col N="188" /> event of the death of a mother. The Minister has been constrained by the notice requirements under the Acts in terms of how soon he could implement the budget announcement.</P>
    <P>The increases in maternity and adoptive leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity and adoptive benefit. They have a major impact on employers in many ways, for example, the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected and in some cases contractual obligations in respect of payment. A balance between the rights of employees and employers is contained in the parent Acts. We must respect this balance in making the orders under those Acts.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to implement the increases as far in advance of 2 April as possible while complying with the parent Acts. The passing of the resolution here today will mean that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in a position, together with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to sign the orders immediately into law. The extended periods of maternity and adoptive leave which attract payment will, therefore, apply to persons commencing maternity or adoptive leave in early March, instead of on 2 April. Similarly, the entitlement to the extra unpaid leave will apply to any person who has more than four weeks maternity or adoptive leave left on the date the order is signed into law. The revised entitlement to unpaid leave will, in effect, apply to persons who went on maternity leave from the end of November 2000.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ensure clarity for both employees and employers in relation to the increased entitlements to leave, officials in my Department, following consultation with representatives of employers and employees, decided that the commencement dates specified in the order should be those when the various types of employees eligible for maternity and adoptive leave would start maternity and adoptive leave. The date of starting leave is the date most clearly understood by both employees and employers, particularly as some employees give notice well in advance of the statutory minimum requirement.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of both orders relates to the commencement dates and takes account of the notice requirements in the parent Acts in respect of the various categories of persons eligible for maternity leave. Articles 1 and 3 of both orders are standard technical provisions.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the maternity leave order amends section 13(2) of the parent Act. Section 13(2) of the parent Act provides for an entitlement to maternity leave when a confinement occurs four weeks or more before the expected date and before the employee has gone on maternity leave. Article 5 extends this entitlement from 14 weeks to 18 weeks. This ties in this section with the overall increased entitlement under the order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Article 6 of the maternity leave order provides that the period of additional unpaid maternity leave under section 14(1) of the parent Act will be extended to eight weeks. Article 7 of the maternity leave order extends the period within which the father is entitled to leave in the event of the death of the mother, and the periods of leave to which the father is entitled, in line with the increases in maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of adoptive leave under section 6 of the parent Act from ten weeks to 14 weeks. This is the period of adoptive leave which attracts a payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Article 5 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of additional unpaid leave under section 8(1) of the parent Act from four weeks to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of leave to which a father would be entitled in the event of the death of the adopting mother to a maximum of 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the adoptive leave order extends the period of additional unpaid leave to which a father would be entitled in the event of the death of an adopting mother to a maximum of eight weeks.</P>
    <P>Article 8 of the adoptive leave order amends section 12(1) of the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, which sets out arrangements for the termination of adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave in the event of the termination of an adoption placement before the end of the period of leave to which the employee is entitled under the Act.</P>
    <P>Once this motion has been passed by the House, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will be in a position to sign the orders later today and an advertisement will be placed in tomorrow's papers setting out the details of the increased entitlements.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the orders provide that: any woman who commences maternity leave on or after 8 March will be entitled to 18 weeks paid leave and eight weeks unpaid leave; any woman who commences additional unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March following on her 14 weeks paid leave will be entitled to eight weeks unpaid leave; any adopting mother or sole male adopter who commences adoptive leave on or after 8 March will be entitled to 14 weeks paid leave and eight weeks unpaid leave; and any adopting mother or sole male adopter who commences additional unpaid adoptive leave on or after 8 March will be entitled to eight weeks unpaid leave. Entitlement of fathers to paternity and adoptive leave in the event of the death of the mother will also be increased in respect of fathers commencing leave on or after 8 February. In the case of a father who is already on paternity leave, the increased entitlement to additional unpaid paternity leave will apply with effect from 8 March. I recommend the orders to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="ÜfcMr. Connor ÜfcMr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this overdue extension of maternity and adoptive leave, with pay, from 14 to 18 weeks is very welcome. It comes against a background of the shameful fact that in terms of the length of maternity, adoptive and parental leave this country ranks second lowest in the European league of nations. For instance, in almost all the Scandinavian countries a mother is entitled to six months maternity leave with full pay. This is also true of France and Luxembourg. Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany have paid maternity leave for up to 20 weeks, which is at least two weeks longer than Ireland under the new orders.</P>
      <P>Our parental leave provisions are the second worst in the European Union, if not the worst when non-EU countries such as Norway and Switzerland are included in the equation. Nowadays, Norway, Austria, France and Sweden provide for 12 months parental leave. Ireland, on the other hand, as a result of fairly recent legislation, still has a miserly 14 week period, all of it unpaid.</P>
      <P>When the Parental Leave Bill, now the Parental Leave Act, was before the House it was well debated and subject to a number of amendments. One of the amendments provided that at least part of the 14 week period would include paid parental leave. The Minister resisted the amendment but, under pressure, he stated that the Government would actively examine the prospect of having at least some weeks of paid parental leave in the public service, and that in turn would give a lead to the private sector. Two and a half years later, there is still no sign that the Government is even thinking about making such a concession on paid parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the enactment of that legislation, gross domestic product has increased by 12%, which represents a huge amount of money. Given the economic growth in recent years, 1% of GDP is also a huge amount. The Government should be thinking of introducing paid parental leave. I am not a parent and so I do not come to the subject with a great deal of knowledge. People may be critical of me for taking up this stance, but I recognise that in the formation of society it is very important for parents to have time to spend with their young children. In the first year of a child's life it is most important for him or her to spend as much time as possible with his or her parents. In the world in which we live, with both parents working and everybody struggling to pay for mortgages and cars, there have to be two incomes in every household. To a large extent, child rearing is left to cre±ches or child-minding services. The Government should be doing everything possible to encourage leave for parents to spend with their young children. The influence of parents on their children in the formative months and years has an enormous amount to do with the adults those children will later become. While this matter may not be strictly relevant to these orders, it allows us to revisit the Parental Leave Act two years on. I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="191" /> introduce provision for paid parental leave, starting in the public service. We are not seeking 14 weeks paid leave, but it should be possible to start with a shorter period.</P>
    <P>While I welcome what is being done today, it is rather late. On budget day the Minister said this measure would come into effect on 2 April, but there was a hue and cry among pregnant mothers and families that this measure should have been introduced forthwith on budget day. That could have been done. If the Minister can introduce a measure that raises excise duty on petrol or tobacco at midnight on budget day, the same could have been done for this measure. It was not done, however, and there was no commitment to do so. The commitment was to introduce the measure on 2 April.</P>
    <P>While I am glad the entitlement will now come three or four weeks earlier, we have to bear in mind that in the two months since the budget, there have been between 9,000 and 10,000 births. If one extends it to 2 April, then one is talking about somewhere between 17,000 and 18,000 new borns, that is, between budget day and 2 April.</P>
    <P>Approximately 60% of mothers would qualify for maternity benefit so thousands of them will lose benefit because this was not with effect from budget night, which it should have been. I appeal to the Minister &ndash; this appeal was also made in the other House &ndash; to introduce a measure by which a lump sum is payable to parents, mothers in particular, for the loss of up to for weeks of this leave. That is only fair. At this stage, the Minister is bringing it forward by a number of weeks so it should now be applicable to everybody affected since the budget announcement on 6 December.</P>
    <P>This country does not score well in terms of maternity leave. The period of maternity leave in most Scandinavian and European countries is longer than ours. In fact, I think somebody mentioned that only the United Kingdom is worse than we are in terms of these benefits. It is very difficult to justify that given the growth and increasing wealth of this country in the last five to nine years. I do not know when the last extension to maternity and adoptive leave was made. I do not remember dealing with it in this House to which I came back over three years ago or when I was in the other House so it is probably a number of years ago. If I remember correctly, we dealt with a maternity leave Act in the other House in 1995. Six years on, it would appear it has taken us that length of time to give an extension. I hope that in next year's budget we would look again at extending maternity leave. If other European countries, which are not much wealthier than we are, can give 20 weeks and 26 weeks, we can do it. The Government should look at this positively to ensure that in the forthcoming budget, we are up with the best of them in terms of these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> In the context of next year's budget, which will be introduced around 1 October, I do not think the European Commission will rap us on the knuckles if we introduce a measure which would initiate some form of paid parental leave starting with the public service, because somebody has to start it. Obviously, we cannot expect the private sector, which did not like the introduction of parental leave in the first instance and did quite a lot of lobbying against it, to give the lead. There may be some employers in the private sector who allow some payment for parental leave, although that would be done on an individual basis. I make the plea that the Government should look at this in the context of the forthcoming budget to be introduced next October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend these orders to the House and welcome the Minister of State. I would like to place on record my tremendous admiration for the work she has done since her appointment in the area of disability and so on which is recognised throughout the country.</P>
      <P>These orders came about as a result of negotiation and the setting up of a working group as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Minister has acted in accordance with what was agreed and set down in these negotiations. These were protracted and serious negotiations involving representatives of the private and public sector. Arising out of that consultation and the work of the working group, this measure was put in place. Whatever the parallels elsewhere in Europe, these two orders are fully in line with the PPF and the thrust of the negotiations prior to that. It is important to recognise that this was not done willy-nilly by the Minister as a sop to a certain sector of society.</P>
      <P>It is tremendous to note that arising out of these orders, paid maternity leave will be increased to 18 weeks. On top of that, there is an entitlement to eight weeks unpaid leave which will bring the total amount of leave to 26 weeks. I am a small employer employing about nine or ten women. This year three of my staff will notify me of their intention to take maternity leave. It places me under certain constraints when three loyal staff take maternity leave in or around the same time because, in this day and age, it is difficult to replace them. A number of the girls working for me have taken leave on maybe two, three or four occasions but I have noticed that once the period of time with their new born child of 14 weeks or 26 weeks, if there are difficulties, is over, they are very anxious to get back into the workforce.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that 61% of women who are what we term broadly child bearing age &ndash; 15 to 45 years of age &ndash; are likely to participate in this scheme. Bearing in mind that the majority of girls between the ages of 15 and 22 years or thereabouts are in third level education, it gives great significance to the figures mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> Senator Connor asked why this measure was not introduced on budget night, 6 December, and I see his point. I do not think it would have been possible to do that because we must take into consideration the employers' constitutional rights and obligations. I can image the reaction of employers if this had been introduced on budget night or if it was made retrospective, particularly in the case of a big employer with many women working for him who would suddenly be faced with a huge demand for this leave.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, there is a statutory obligation, which is only right, to serve four weeks' notice on one's employer, whether in the private or public sector, of one's intention to take maternity leave. It is only fair that an employer knows that come 1 May or whatever, a person is taking maternity leave and that they will be off for 18 weeks. It is only fair in this day and age that is done. On the advice of the Attorney General, it was suggested that this part of the legislation should be complied with. The co-operation of three Departments &ndash; the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; is needed to effect this measure. This is not new legislation. These are orders which the Minister can make by virtue of the 1996 legislation. This is another of the many initiatives this Minister and Government have taken in the area of equality and women's rights. It is another giant step in that direction. I have no doubt that in time, we will have 22 weeks paid leave if that is what is demanded and required. It is significant to note that what has been done here by the Government and the Ministers concerned is fully in line with the positive thrust of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which is very significant.</P>
    <P>I read the speech the Minister made in the Dáil recently. In the negotiations prior to the PPF to negotiate this extra paid and unpaid leave, as set out in the orders, there was no mention of adoptive leave. The Government decided to extend maternity leave and graciously included adoptive leave. According to my records, this was not dealt with in the negotiations prior to the PPF. This is wonderful news and the Government should be commended on bringing it forward. I hope the orders can be signed immediately so that applicants can apply on or before 8 March. As I understand it, a person who is on maternity leave can serve notice on 8 March that she wishes to acquire the extended unpaid leave.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for coming before the House and outlining the significant progress that has been made by the Government in the whole area of equality and law reform. I recognise the wonderful work she is doing, sometimes without publicity, particularly for those who are disadvantaged due a physical or other disability. The Government and the Ministers concerned should be commended for moving this forward. It is a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The vibes I am getting from those with whom I work and associate in both the private and public sectors are positive. They recognise the significant leap forward that is being made. I expect it will bring much joy and financial reward to expectant mothers who on or after 8 March will serve four weeks' notice on their employers for the extended leave, which amounts to 26 weeks. The 18 weeks and the eight weeks unpaid leave combined is a reasonable time to allow a mother to be with her child. It is an important time and is a significant step forward compared to 25 years ago when maternity leave was very restricted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the orders. It is extraordinary that in a country which refers in its Constitution to women solely as mothers that we should be so far behind in doing something for mothers in this area. While this was a poor country in the past and there were not as many women in the workforce as in other countries, we have a long way to go, as Senator Connor pointed out. I am sure the Minister will continue to see what further money can be provided in this area, particularly in terms of providing a greater amount of paid leave. For economic reasons a large number of women have to go back to work. If the measure can be extended so that the paid leave continues for another four weeks over the next year it would be tremendous progress. As Senator Connor said, this is a measure for the improvement of society in general.</P>
      <P>I attended the launch of the family friendly workplace day at the Employment Equality Agency recently &ndash; 1 March 2001 will be family friendly workplace day. It is important that employers understand they have a responsibility to encourage the parents of young children to fulfil all their obligations to those children and should make it possible for them to do so. That is why it is important to have paternity leave as well as maternity leave and parental leave. It is sad that we have to state in Article 7 that fathers, on the deaths of mothers, will be entitled either to birth or adoptive leave. Nevertheless, it is important that that is stated.</P>
      <P>I recall the death of a friend of mine years ago, following the birth of her fourth child. If at that time the widower had been able to take some time off, the family situation might have been better. I had my children before there was maternity leave. Having gone back to work two days after the birth of my second child, in case I lost my job, I am extremely sympathetic to these proposals.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter about which, although it is not a matter for her Department, the Minister of State might do something. Over 18 months ago I brought a Private Members' Bill before the House regarding the regulation of invitro fertilisation. While a commission has been set up, nothing has been done. I am concerned because there may be more than one woman claiming to <Col N="195" /> be the mother of the child. An advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> looking for human eggs was sent to me, the text of which stated: &ldquo;Anonymous egg donor under 35 years needed for childless couple. Please contact.&rdquo;  That was not for someone within the State. We are in the forefront of the techniques of invitro fertilisation, yet there is no legislation in this area. Neither have we a register of those clinics which carry out invitro fertilisation. I ask the Minister, knowing her concerns in these areas, to encourage the Department of Health and Children to do something about this. There are surrogate mothers abroad. Their children come back here but they are not covered by maternity Acts or adoptive Acts because money has changed hands. At the centre of all this legislation it is the child we are thinking of all the time. I urge the Minister of State to see what progress can be made in that area.</P>
    <P>The adoptive leave is extraordinarily important. It is interesting that parents who want to get leave under these regulations have to produce a certificate to show they have adopted a child. They have to show to a third person an extract from the adoption register. There are still great difficulties regarding adoptive persons getting more than extracts from the adoption register. It is interesting that third parties can have more information on adoption than someone who was adopted in the past. That needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>The last time we spoke about adoption in this House was in 1977. I could almost have reproduced today the speech I made then. At that time I asked if the Government would set up a statutory adoption contact register. This has been promised since 1991 by various Governments but it still has not been set up. However, a register is being set up by the adoptive persons association which is a voluntary organisation. It is too much to expect them to do so, the Government should get active in this area.  The people who want to go on these registers do so voluntarily. They are the parents of children who were given up for adoption many years ago or adopted children who have reached the age of 18. This voluntary register is accessible on the web &ndash;  worldwide web.adoption.ireland.com &ndash; and 1,700 people registered in about six months. There have been three successful cases as a result of the register and it is reckoned that about ten other groups of people managed to make contact with each other. There is a need for it and it would be preferable for the Government to be in charge rather than its being run by a voluntary organisation.</P>
    <P>I warmly praise the Minister of State for introducing this motion and I encourage her to do more. When one thinks of the small amount of leave granted to women, especially post birth, is it any wonder we have the lowest breast feeding rates in Europe. Perhaps we could encourage this activity in those women who will take more prolonged leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this development. I have been involved in its gestation, if I may use the pun, in various different negotiating fora over the years. A prime objective of social partnership is the creation of family friendly policies. This is a step in that direction. I ask the Minister of State to look at ways to build on this. I agree with the points raised by Senator Henry about the family friendly day on 1 March. I had a meeting in my office this morning to see how we might mark it.</P>
      <P>In cold European bureaucratic terms this would be described as a pro-natal policy to encourage people or make it easier for them to have children. An examination of the fertility rate in different countries over the past ten to 15 years shows that in many countries the birth rate dropped dramatically, especially in the 1980s and up to the early 1990s when it then began to climb in countries such as France, the UK and in Scandinavia. In the meantime in the countries where the birth rate had not dropped &ndash; the Catholic countries of Italy, Spain and Ireland &ndash; the same pattern emerged when they became familiar with contraception. In 1989 the Department of Finance incorrectly forecast that the birth rate for the period 1996-2000 would be approximately 45,000 per year. It is now 55,000 per year and rising. The Masters of the maternity hospitals are crying out for more resources every day.</P>
      <P>We need to be careful about this because patterns of family living have changed to the extent that it is the exception rather than the rule not to have both parents working. Given this and the lack of child care facilities, many people are going out to work much earlier than they might like because they have to pay their mortgages. They seek a good portion of maternity leave, paid and unpaid, before returning to work.</P>
      <P>The regulations for child care facilities for very young children &ndash; infants under the age of 18 months &ndash; make it almost impossible to create a viable economic unit to provide that service. Many of the crèche facilities cannot afford to take in children under the age of 18 months. I am sure the Minister of State will be aware of that from her personal experience. It is something we need to look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed here is the outcome of negotiations by the social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In the course of the review of the PPF last year a further commitment was made by the Government to the social partners. The Minister announced in the budget that he would introduce this measure and it has now become a reality, which I welcome. I agree with Senator Connor when he said he could not understand why it was not introduced from the date of the Budget Statement in early December, although I recognise the initial proposal was to introduce it from 1 April. Over the last month we put pressure on the various Departments to bring it forward and I welcome <Col N="197" /> the fact that it becomes operable from 8 March. The ICTU and other trade unions will be very pleased with that.</P>
    <P>We need to focus to a greater extent on this area. We also need to ensure that there is a young population that continues to grow. To ensure population maintenance a fertility rate of approximately 2.1 is required. That is not a difficulty at present and between births and immigration the population is beginning to increase. However, we need further improvements in this area. In this regard if there is a change of Government I will be the first person to pursue Senator Connor on behalf of the trade union movement to ensure that his party delivers on the improved maternity regulations he advocates.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator's views, which does not happen too often. Last Sunday when I reviewed the Order of Business for the week I noted that this item was on the Order of Business for yesterday with a proposal that it be referred to a committee without discussion. Given the delays involved I appreciate that the Department and the House co-operated to have the matter dealt with here. It is as well this happened because the Dáil had to follow suit. It means the motion will be passed in an expeditious manner. I understand it will be signed this afternoon. I would like confirmation of that because there will be a queue of people telephoning my office later this evening to ascertain if they can submit their notice of maternity leave. The matter is that vital. It is also more evidence of the importance of social partnership. We might also explain to our European colleagues before they set out to reprimand us that these are the things that are important to us.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for introducing the motion and I look forward to further improvements of other aspects of maternity regulations over the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State will be aware, there were terrible problems in Ballina in the last few months as a result of a shortage of water. It is not acceptable in this day and age that a town like Ballina should run dry, particularly in the middle of winter. There was a lot of hardship for older people who had not sufficient water to make a cup of tea. I ask the Minister of State to approve the plans that are in the Department for the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The irony of the situation in Ballina is that there is not a shortage of water as such; in fact, the best supply in Ireland is piped from Lough Conn, which is a 12,000 acre fresh water lake adjacent to the town. That supply was put into Asahi in the 1970s when the joint manufacturing Japanese operation opened in the town. Unfortunately, Asahi closed two years ago and Ballina subsequently got another major industry, Coca Cola, which also needed vast quantities of water for its operation and which it is using very successfully.</P>
      <P>One of the great ironies of the water problem in Ballina is that while there is an abundance of water on the periphery of the town, sections of the town are running dry, not because of a lack of water but because of Victorian, clapped out metal piping. The local urban council recently put on display what it took up from a section of the town, that is, the old metal piping which was put in place at the turn of the century and needs to be replaced. There is only an eight hour reserve supply in the reservoir which caters for the town. An eight hour reserve supply is not sufficient or acceptable for a town such as Ballina which continues to develop. Ballina is not short of water but there is not a system to distribute it throughout the town. It is unfortunate that the system to replace the metal pipes which began in the 1970s was abandoned and has not been attended to since. That is a 20 year gap from beginning the replacement of the entire system within the town to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to expedite the approval of this scheme because the people living in the section of the town which is suffering badly do not want to face another winter, or indeed a summer, with this inadequate supply of water. It is not a question of non-availability of water; the water is there but we need a pipe to carry the water and a new reservoir which will have sufficient reserve capacity to carry us over periods <Col N="199" /> of major leakages or other accidental problems which occur in any water system. We do not have the reserve capacity in the present system, which is one of the major reasons for the serious shortfall in the water supply. There is a serious shortfall in the water supply to Ballina.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance and seriousness of this issue for sections of Ballina town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, cannot be in the House this evening to respond to this matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Total planned investment in water and sewerage schemes over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-06 is almost £3 billion, of which more than £2.4 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is focusing on providing water and waste water services needed to support economic and social development, employment generation, maintenance of high growth rates and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
      <P>Last July the Minister announced a new water services investment programme to cover the period from 2000-02. It includes 529 schemes with a total value of £2.1 billion. The schemes that went into the programme were drawn from local authority assessments of needs completed by them during 1999. The main purpose of the assessments was to develop an overall strategic investment plan for each county for the medium to long term and to set out a programme of works to meet the identified needs.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Senator's county is a significant beneficiary under the 2000-02 programme. It includes 23 schemes for Mayo worth almost £120 million. Among the bigger ones are Claremorris sewerage costing £7.3 million, Lough Mask regional water supply &ndash; Knock-Ballyhaunis &ndash; costing over £16 million, Westport sewerage scheme costing over £26 million and Castlebar environs sewerage scheme costing more than £15 million. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a variety of locations throughout the county. It is clear that Mayo is getting a fair share of available funding and that the schemes that have been approved will greatly contribute to removing development constraints and to creating the infrastructure needed to support and expand tourism, commercial, industrial and housing activity in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Ballina water supply scheme, stage 3, Ballina town, the position is that contract documents were submitted to the Department by Ballina UDC in the 1980s but were not approved. The scheme, estimated to <Col N="200" /> cost £3.5 million, was twelfth on the priority list of water schemes submitted by Mayo County Council as part of its recent assessment of needs. As I have already indicated, these priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02. Given the priority rating afforded to this scheme by the council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>
    <P>The three year programme for 2000 to 2002 is only the first phase of a rolling programme that will continue up to the end of the national development plan in 2006. Further schemes will be added to it on an annual basis during that period. The Ballina scheme will be considered when the next round of approvals is being finalised. I understand that these further approvals are likely to be announced in the next few weeks. In the meantime, I understand that Mayo County Council is formulating a proposal which it hopes will provide an interim solution to the water problems in Ballina. This proposal will be examined urgently in the Department when it is submitted for approval.</P>
    <P>The Senator can be assured that I have listened carefully and with interest to his comments and that the Minister will bear them in mind when the question of releasing further schemes is being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for coming before the House at such short notice to discuss the serious position in which the people of Moate, County Westmeath, and the surrounding districts find themselves.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday morning of last week the Kerry Group announced that it was closing down Dawn Dairies in Moate, County Westmeath. Despite its loyalty, the Kerry Group has not seen fit to provide adequate explanations to its employees for this devastating news. Local businesses and suppliers who have also been extremely loyal to Dawn Dairies deserve an explanation, as do its customers &ndash; my wife and I have given the dairy our custom for the past 32 years &ndash; and local people. The very least the Kerry Group should do is provide an adequate explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 62 loyal and hard-working people have had their means of earning a living wiped out at the stroke of a pen and without good reason. Many of these people have been employed by the company since its establishment in Moate and have given a lifetime of loyal and faithful service. To say that this news is devastating is an understatement. The loss of 62 jobs in a town without any other manufacturing industry is of horrendous proportions. It must be remembered that 62 jobs lost in Moate is the same as <Col N="201" /> 700 or 800 lost in Dublin. The effects will be the same.</P>
    <P>Dawn Dairies was the premier employer in Moate and made a huge contribution to the town since the mid-1950s. The company has served the town very well as an employer and a sponsor of many events held by organisations in County Westmeath. This makes its decision to pull out of Moate all the more difficult to comprehend. Having become such an important feature of both the social and economic life of the town, it beggars belief that the Kerry Group can now take the decision to withdraw from the town without considering the devastating consequences for it. As a businessman, I know only too well that decisions of this nature are made on financial grounds. However, I ask Kerry Group to take account of the social and business implications of its decision, to bear in mind the potential devastation the loss of these jobs will have for Moate and to reconsider its decision.</P>
    <P>I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to use her influence to seek a reversal of this decision and also to secure other industries which could offer employment to the inhabitants of this town. It is good that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who is possibly the most efficient, respected and talented Minister of State and who passes through Moate on three or four occasions each week on his way to Leinster House, is present because I know he will listen to our case.</P>
    <P>If Dawn Dairies will not reverse its decision, I call on the Tánaiste and the Minister of State to establish a task force to consider the problems faced by the town of Moate. I request that a captain of industry be appointed to chair that task force which should include among its members representatives from IDA Ireland, Westmeath county development, officials from the Department and other individuals the Tánaiste believes could either try to fill the vacuum or save existing jobs.</P>
    <P>I have served as a member of Westmeath County Council since 1985 and there have been only three occasions on which standing orders had to be suspended. Councillor Tom Allen, who is a dedicated and hard-working representative of the people of Moate, proposed that standing orders be suspended on Monday last in order for a debate to take place on this serious crisis. I seconded his proposal and gave my word that I would raise this matter in the Seanad this week to see if action can be taken. I thank the Cathaoirleach for acceding to my request in that regard.</P>
    <P>From experience of the dilemmas that have faced various other towns in the past, it appears that the establishment of a task force is the best route to take. That is our only hope. Dawn Dairies was the principal industry in a town that is increasing in size and has many new residents. The greatest problem thrown up by the advent of <Col N="202" /> the Celtic tiger is for areas which act as nothing more than residential centres and can offer no employment opportunities. Everyone who lives in such areas must travel by road or rail to reach their place of work. In the event of a downturn in the economy these areas will be devastated because people will be obliged to sell their houses due to the lack local employment opportunities. I hope such a downturn will not happen for a long period or that it will never happen again. However, history has shown that this is not the case because industries and the economy experience highs and lows.</P>
    <P>In this golden era in which we find ourselves and in which it is good to be in business, it should not be very difficult to find an industry to replace that which has served Moate for the past 40 years. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Cassidy's concern at the proposed loss of 62 jobs at Dawn Dairies in Moate, County Westmeath. The loss of these jobs will be a great disappointment to the people of Moate and the surrounding area. I sympathise with these people and their representatives, Senator Cassidy, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and Councillor Allen, who have been affected by this situation. I fully appreciate the difficulties being experienced by the redundant employees and their families.</P>
      <P>The liquid milk market in Ireland is becoming increasingly competitive due in part to imports of low priced milk from Northern Ireland and the increased market power of the multiples. Other major competitors in the market have moved to rationalise their liquid milk businesses to improve efficiency and to ensure competitive prices to consumers. The Kerry Group, for its part, has responded to these competitive pressures by reviewing its liquid milk business.</P>
      <P>Arising from this review, the group has decided to consolidate the liquid milk business. Part of the rationalisation involves the closure of the Dawn Dairy operation in Moate and concentration of processing operations in Galway, Limerick and Kilkenny. The operation in Moate will be transferred to Galway and Limerick where processing capacity exists. The company will continue to service the local market and normal collection of milk will be maintained.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Kerry Group is offering re-employment to the employees of Dawn Dairies who are losing their jobs in other Kerry Group plants and are assisting staff in evaluating various options. I am confident that the Kerry Group will meet its obligations as Avonmore did in similar circumstances. A total of 22 staff are being kept on to man a core operation in Moate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the job losses in Moate, FÁS has given a full briefing to the management regarding the supports available to the redundant workers. <Col N="203" /> These supports include briefing workers on the options they may pursue, one to one interviews with each worker to ascertain specific needs and making available a short training programme on job seeking skills and confidence building measures.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies are working closely with the Kerry Group and local and other interests to attract replacement projects and encourage the development of existing industry. The establishment of a task force would send out the wrong signals about Moate, which is an attractive location for industry. It is 60 miles from Dublin and 10 miles from Athlone and is well serviced. A number of new factory spaces are being provided by a private developer. There is already a high level of interest in these units suggesting a <Col N="204" /> strong outlook for employment. The focused agency approach combined with the locally based approach, both of which are addressing the jobs situation, make it unnecessary to establish a specific task force.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Cassidy's sentiments and reinforce his call to the Kerry Group to review its decision. I know Moate and I spent 15 years working in many sectors of the co-operative industry, such as milk, wool and livestock marketing. Moate has a large agricultural base and is known for the quality of its livestock and milk produced. It is an ideal centre for processing liquid milk. I hope the impact on the community of this down-sizing can be minimised.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 14 February 2001.</P>
