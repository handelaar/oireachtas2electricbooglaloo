      <P>I have received notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to include the N5 national primary route in the national development plan and to upgrade the N5 from Longford to Charlestown.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish a task force to immediately address the difficulties faced following the announcement by GMX of its decision to close its plant in Thurles, County Tipperary, with the loss of 230 jobs.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, motion re information to be issued to voters in connection with that referendum, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Referendum (Ballot Paper) (No. 3) Order, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 17, motion No. 24, not to be taken before 3 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 30 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 17, motion No. 25, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to. Will the Leader of the House indicate, either today or later, the legislation he intends to bring before the House between now and the end of <Col N="598" /> the session, which I understand he said will be in late July? I draw the House's attention to a report from a Government spokesperson in <i>The Irish Times</i> today to the effect that the referenda will go ahead on 7 June after the Oireachtas passes all four Bills tonight. The Government spokesperson should be reminded that there are two Houses of the Oireachtas and two of the Bills have not even reached Second Stage in the Seanad. It may be indicative of the approach the Government intends to take to the two Bills which will come before the House today and tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House aware that the Bill relating to the Judiciary will be heavily amended in the other House today and that it may even be guillotined? That is none of our business &ndash; it is not how things are done in the Seanad &ndash; but is the Leader of the House happy that there will be sufficient time for spokespersons to study the amendments and be fully up to speed when the Bills reach this House? Is he happy that there will be sufficient time for the two debates on Thursday and Friday?</P>

      <P>Much progress on many issues was made in our recent discussions under the chairmanship of Senator Manning about the Standing Orders of the House. A matter raised consistently was the more creative use of Government time. On behalf of the Independent group, I congratulate and thank the Leader of the House for taking a step forward in that direction by enabling a Private Members' motion to be taken today in Government time. This is how the House can make progress and allow debates on non-contentious issues to take place. These debates are not intended to cause problems for anybody, but they will allow consensus to be reached. I welcome this development for which I thank the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>It was said on a number of occasions that the House would return to the issue of industrial relations, how they are developing and the process of partnership in that regard. I draw the attention of the House to another unacceptable face of capitalism, the ongoing row in AIBP. I ask Members to recognise that such incidents cause workers to lose confidence in the development of the economy. I remind the Leader of the House that this area needs to be discussed in order that workers will be aware that there is a view among public representatives that the wealth of the economy should be shared by all the people of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the refreshing and more flexible approach of the Leader of the House to discussing items of concern to Members, will he arrange a debate on the Amnesty International report on human and civil rights in Ireland published recently? Worryingly, this report found huge abuses of human rights regarding the detention of persons in custody, the operation of the Offences Against the State Act, judicial and legal procedures in relation to asylum seekers and a <Col N="599" /> range of other issues on which it has reported over a number of years. The 1993 and 1998 reports of the European Council committee on the prevention of torture also found worrying aspects in relation to the detention of persons in Garda and prison custody. Ireland is in the process of abolishing the last vestige of capital punishment, but it does not have its house in order according to respectable organisations such as Amnesty International and a European body in relation to domestic civil and human rights.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning about the manner in which we are dealing with all these amendments to the Constitution in the one week. That is fine so long as the amendments are not contentious, but when they are &ndash; the amendment dealing with the Judiciary is proving hugely contentious in the other House &ndash; we should consider whether more time should be made available. We are not just dealing with legislation with which we need to take great care but with constitutional amendments, the inclusion of which in the Constitution we will ask the people to vote on. Nothing like that should be rushed and perhaps the Government should review the schedule for dealing with these amendments.</P>

      <P>Given the statement by the Minister for Health and Children yesterday on the report that one in three people in Ireland will develop cancer by 70, there is an urgent need for a debate in the House to see what preventative measures can be taken. When people are killed on the roads, there is a public outcry, yet 4,000 people die annually from cancer, which is caused by smoking and other factors. Will the Leader ask the Minister to ensure the cancer screening service available in the east is made available immediately to people in the west and south? All the people of the nation should be treated equally. The people in Lyracompane in County Kerry are just as good as the people in Dublin 4. It is important we have this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on the Government's spatial strategy, or what is nowadays called balanced regional development? I raise this in light of a national conference in Galway which was partly sponsored by the Department of the Environment and Local Government at which the head of the team examining the Government's spatial strategy told us that, by the year 2020, the population of Dublin will reach 2.4 million, which will be more than 50% of the total population of the Republic. More than one million people live within the greater Dublin area, which is more than 40% of the total population, and the infrastructure in the city and its environs is creaking because of this high level of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The Government parties' 1997 election manifesto was shot through with phrases about balanced regional development and later in the programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats, there were many references to balanced regional development. Current policies clearly do not lead to that end. The Cathaoirleach is remonstrating with me to sit down, but it must be said that this is an important issue which needs discussion in the House. The demographic pattern of the country and the economy are badly skewed in favour of a number of relatively small areas. We need&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years ago I asked the Leader if new legislation could be initiated dealing with the Gaming and Lotteries Act and I made the point that existing legislation was outdated and archaic. Is there any possibility that amending legislation could be introduced during the term of the Government?</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on the shameful position regarding orthodontic treatment, especially for less well off young people. It is frightening that there are four to six year delays in this area. It is an ongoing problem for which I do not blame the Minister. I raised a similar query ten years ago. It is shameful and disgraceful that young people, especially those who are less well off, must wait four to six years for orthodontic treatment, by which stage they have grown up and their teeth have developed to such an extent that the situation cannot be rectified. That is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Connor and support fully his sentiments regarding the conference in Galway and the issues discussed there. The decentralisation of Departments and of private sector firms is very important. There is a need to discuss that in the House and for a national policy on it to be formulated.</P>
      <P>I support the sentiments of Senator O'Toole regarding the AIBP workers. It is a disgrace that, despite the fact that these people have given a commitment to an industry which has undergone its fair share of turmoil&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader afford us the opportunity of a debate on the deregulation of the telecommunications industry? I ask this in light of a recent court decision which found that Eircom did not have a monopoly in Ireland. That is strange because 300 people are being made redundant because their company cannot obtain a licence from Eircom. If the legislation establishing the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is insufficient to allow the regulator to intervene and grant a licence to the mobile phone company in question, we should have a debate in the House to see if amending legislation is needed. It is strange that, at a time when we support deregulation, inadequate laws or a lack in the approach taken have caused the downfall of this company and have caused a major opportunity available in other European countries to be denied to entrepreneurs in this industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>While I am delighted more money is being spent on infrastructure in the Dublin region, the allocation for Cork Airport has not been forthcoming. I have continually requested for six months for the relevant Minister to explain to the House exactly what is happening. It is unfair that the number of passengers going through Cork Airport increases substantially every month without any improvements being made. It does not help the country as a whole. Dublin is doing very well, and more luck to it, but if traffic through it comes to a stop, we would like the rest of the country to be moving.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for a debate on the Amnesty International report and on human rights in general. While Ireland has a relatively good record in this regard, it is important we do not be complacent. It is often the case that human rights abuses are perpetrated in an atmosphere of complacency. If we are to continue to be seen internationally as a moral force where human rights are concerned, we must be above reproach. In this regard, we should be pre-emptive in ensuring there is no abuse in this regard in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In weather such as this, I am reminded of the story of the man whose roof always leaked. When asked why he did not repair it during the summer, he said it did not rain then. Every year we see and hear reports of the flooding which takes place in different parts of the country, especially in Carlow and Clonmel. I saw reports on the television this morning of serious floods in England. I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responding to the pleas from those parts of the country which have this experience and is doing <Col N="602" /> something about the matter in order that we will not be surprised when it happens next.</P>
      <P>I was not aware until I read in a Sunday newspaper of the plans for the removal of the plinth outside Leinster House. I am not sure what consultation takes place, but Members could be regarded as its residents, if there are residents. I read last Sunday that all the car parking spaces will be taken away and replaced with well clipped shrubbery and grass. That may be a worthy objective and everyone else may have been aware of the decision, but I was not. I hope consultation will take place with the residents of Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House request the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, to come to the House to debate the very worrying figures released yesterday regarding accidents due to assaults on staff in the health care sector? The figures have increased considerably since 1994 and are now very worrying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the health service, particularly the extension of the medical card system? I strongly support the view of the Government that the scheme should be extended to all citizens aged over 70 years who have paid their taxes and made sacrifices for the country. I welcome the call made by health boards today to extend the medical card system to all teenagers. The service should also be extended to those suffering from long-term illnesses, particularly those suffering from asthma who face medical expenses of more than £1,000 per year. This question should be at the heart of the proposed debate.</P>

      <P>Before Easter we reviewed the foot and mouth problem weekly. It would be useful to return to the matter. I hope the Leader of the House can find time to do so within the next week or so. I welcome the measures introduced yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development relaxing the restrictions on access to hill walking and allowing a resumption of angling on 11 May, although it is important that people behave responsibly. I also welcome the relaxation of restrictions on animal movements within farms, from silage pits to fields and so on. The restrictions on movement have imposed much hardship on the agricultural community. Everything that has been done so far, <Col N="603" /> however, has been sure-footed and it is prudent to continue the measures. We cannot assume that the disease has been eradicated, particularly given the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The farming organisations have been less than generous to other sectors of the community. People have made huge sacrifices, apart from the significant sacrifices made by the farming community. Some generosity regarding the contribution made by the wider community should be shown by the farming organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's query, can the Leader of the House confirm my understanding that there will be an underground car park in which there will be designated spaces for Members? This is an important advance, if true. If it is true, will the Leader of the House try to ensure the arithmetic is appropriately calculated? Someone appears to have made incorrect calculations when the office space was being built and large numbers of Members of this House were not included in the new office arrangements. One hopes car parking space will be designated and made available to all Members, particularly in view of the inconvenience caused sometimes by the parking of ministerial cars, which blocks access for Members of both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a call for a discussion of the findings in the recently published report on cancer. We should await further investigation of the causes of cancer. It has been stated that people living in Dublin have a 60% greater chance of contracting cancer than those living down the country. It is also claimed that radon gas will cause more cancer than living in &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; in Dublin. If poverty is a cause of cancer, why do people in poverty stricken parts of the world not die of it? There must be a full investigation of the causes of cancer before we debate the matter. When a member of a local authority I often claimed that if something was not done at a particular crossroads, within one week there would be a fatal accident. If, after raising the matter repeatedly, a fatal accident occurred at the crossroads, I had to ask myself if I had caused it. We should not rush to call for action to be taken on the link between poverty and cancer until the matter has been investigated fully.</P>
      <P>The report states that more than 75% of men over the age of 65 years have a cancer of some description. These cancers are not discovered until post mortem examinations take place. Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the recent report, but in the light of investigation? This matter must be dealt with properly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the relaxations announced yesterday, particularly the reopening of attractions on 11 May. I do not see the need for the closure of attractions such as Muckross House and Ross Castle, when all the neighbouring lands are open and, as a Member of the Dáil said, &ldquo;the deer have the roads haunted&rdquo;. Such closures do not make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by Senator Dardis. It appears that the nightmare of foot and mouth disease is coming to an end. Following on what Senator Quinn said about flooding, will the Leader of the House arrange for the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to come to the House to demonstrate what new action is being taken and additional resources provided to eradicate smuggling, which seems to be endemic in the country? We should not wait for the next outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning called for a list of legislation to come before the House. Yesterday, I informed the House of the 13 new Bills which the Government hopes to publish this term. I will give that list to Senator Manning after the Order of Business. Senator Manning also asked about the timeframe for the constitutional amendment Bills. I agree that one of them is being greatly amended in the Dáil. I have no hesitation in proposing that the House sit on Saturday, or very late on Friday evening, to ensure every Member has an opportunity to debate the proposed amendments. Every Senator will have an opportunity to make his or her contribution over the coming days. If necessary, we will sit on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Hayes called for a debate on industrial relations. I have no difficulty in allowing time for it. I am in favour of workers getting their fair share of the wealth of the Celtic tiger. Senators Costello and Ó Murchú called for a debate on the Amnesty International report. Time will be allowed for this.</P>
      <P>Senators Kiely and Lanigan called for a debate on cancer. It is a worthwhile suggestion and we will have time for it. Senators Connor and Hayes called for a debate on the Government's spatial strategy. They can have as much time as they want for this because it is Government policy to distribute the wealth of the Celtic tiger throughout the country. The IDA has received instructions on this and it is now its policy. As Senator Connor knows, it has moved part of its operations to Sligo and another close to his constituency in Athlone.</P>

      <P>The Government is taking the problem seriously, particularly in the BMW region. The issue could be debated in conjunction with the debate for which Senator Burke has called many times.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on gaming and lotteries and I have no difficulty in allowing time for it. He drew the Government's attention to the long delays people are experiencing in obtaining orthodontic treatment. The Government has a pilot scheme in the Eastern Health Board area relating to this. If this is successful, it will be put into operation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan, a long-standing and distinguished Member, has raised the issue of funding for Cork Airport. I will personally pass on his request to the Minister. A major investment is about to be put into Cork airport. I know he has been a great champion of the people of Cork.</P>
      <P>In relation to the statements of Senators Quinn and Norris, I understand a report on flooding has been published. If so, we will debate it in the House.</P>
      <P>Parking and other improvements are being proposed for our consideration at Committee on Procedure and Privileges level. I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss the proposed changes before we make a decision at Committee on Procedure and Privileges. As Senator Manning said, nothing will be agreed until we have a full debate because the facilities in question will be here for the next 100 years, assisting the Members and staff of the Houses, the number of whom is around 600. An enormous number of people come here on a daily basis, apart from the general public, to conduct business and run the affairs of the Houses. The proposals will be very helpful, but the Members should discuss them in consultation with the Committee on Procedure and Privilegess. I fully agree with what has been said here this morning.</P>
      <P>Senator Moylan called on the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to have a debate on health and safety and Senator O'Dowd called for a debate on the health services. We all welcome the announcement in the budget by the Minister for Finance that medical cards will be provided to those over 70 years of age and to other sections of the community, as has been pointed out recently. We all look forward to having a free medical service, but it is just not possible at present other than for those most in need of it. However, we certainly should discuss the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Coghlan and Quinn all made their views known on the position on foot and mouth disease. It has been the policy of the Government, through me in this House, to update the House on a weekly basis on the foot and mouth disease problem. Because of the Bills <Col N="606" /> concerning the referenda in the House this week, I hope we will renew the debate next week. A timeframe for doing this will be agreed between the leaders and the whips after this morning's Order of Business.</P>

      <P>As the substance of the debate on the Bill will relate to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment contained in the Schedule to the Bill, and since it would be appropriate to have that Schedule decided upon before deciding on Section 1 of the Bill, which actually provides for its insertion into the Constitution, I am suggesting that the House postpone consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill until after the Schedule has been agreed. This is a procedure that has been adopted on Committee Stage in the Seanad in the case of previous Bills to amend the Constitution. It would lend itself to a more logically ordered debate. It is therefore proposed that, in accordance with Standing Order 107, consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill be postponed until the Schedule is disposed of. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist amháin agam agus is ceist ghinearálta í. Tá tuarascáil mhór fhada curtha le chéile ag an bhfo-choiste ar an mBunreacht atá bunaithe ag an dTaoiseach ar na difríochtaí idir leagan Gaeilge agus leagan Béarla na Bunreachta. That report raises numerous questions of interpretation. Since we have both the Irish and the English versions before us, I ask the Minister if something can be done to make sure they correspond with each other. We are fortunate in that we have not had a succession of constitutional issues raised by the uncertainty of versions that do not mesh together. The report is full of them. I want to be sure that the two versions we have are tested by competent people to ensure that potential conflicts do not arise. I am not competent to say so, but this report would cause a constitutional lawyer many a nightmare because of the uncertainties that could arise.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her measures, taken in the interests of small shareholders, to bring <Col N="609" /> more transparency to company accounts; in particular the Seanad notes the Tánaiste's insistence that the directors of public companies should reveal their individual salaries; furthermore Seanad Éireann urges her to take further measures to ensure that investment and pension fund managers consult with their contributors and customers before supporting measures which enrich directors at the expense of small shareholders.</P>
    <P>I regret the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not present but I fully understand the reason for that as she is taking the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, in the other House. This subject is close to her heart and is one on which she would have made a considerable and weighty contribution. However, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I know he act as a very adequately substitute, as he always does.</P>
    <P>I particularly would have liked the Minister to be present because the motion specifically congratulates her on the role she has played in imposing transparency on public companies in Ireland. Members will be aware of the controversy that has raged for many years regarding both executive and non-executive directors of public companies declaring their salaries to their shareholders. For many years the Stock Exchange, the Institute of Directors in Ireland and other bodies and the directors of public companies have resisted almost unanimously the pressure that was put on them to inform the shareholders of public companies how much their directors were paid.</P>
    <P>This was the most simple request that one could put forward as a small or large shareholder of a public company but large shareholders did not seem to have a great interest in those who acted in their name declaring how much they were taking from them. It is similar to politicians who must declare their salaries to taxpayers because they pay them.</P>
    <P>The motion is not so much about how much people are paid or how grotesque the payments can be and have been in certain circumstances but about the right of those who have a stake in public companies to know how much is being paid. Those who have a stake include small shareholders, unit holders, pensioners, the staff of the companies and various others. The resistance to this among those who have benefited has been staggering in the past and I congratulate the Minister for taking the measures necessary to meet and overcome such resistance. That will be a permanent monument to her tenure in office.</P>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary aspects of the Minister's insistence on change and overcoming resistance to it was that we suddenly discovered the reasons for the resistance. We have come to know in the past few weeks why directors of public companies have not felt comfortable with being accountable for their salaries. Public companies are accountable to their shareholders, not the public. What we saw in the banks last year <Col N="610" /> demonstrated a lack of accountability by public companies to the public but we have also seen the revelation of bank salaries which, if not unacceptable, are much higher than people expected. Some would say that they are justified because bank profits are so high, bank shareholders have done so well and bank employees are benefiting. In such circumstances, shareholders perhaps do not mind so much when six figure sums are paid to their directors. They want to know, they have a right to know and they are beginning to find out.</P>
    <P>This is particularly topical as a debate will take place on Friday in the Burlington Hotel, because the revelations which the Tánaiste forced, have shown that the chief executive and chairman of the Jefferson Smurfit Group is receiving 6.5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary amount of money. This is a multiple of what the bankers are being paid. Maybe there is some justification for it, but we have not heard of one. Maybe he will come before his shareholders on Friday and tell them why he is paid so much money. I doubt it very much. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has forced these revelations. This is a particularly bad case, not necessarily because of the sum of money earned by the chairman and chief executive, but because of the way shareholders have been treated and have benefited from this company. The real problem here is the relationship between a bad performance by Smufit shares and a fantastic benefit to Smurfit executives.</P>
      <P>Let me look at the performance of Smurfit shares in the last five years. They have underperformed in the Irish market by 58.5% over the last five years, by 46.6% over four years, 35.7% over three years, 28% over two years and 22% over one year. At the same time the Smurfit family and directors are milking this company of millions.</P>
      <P>That is what we have found out and what the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney's, directive has revealed. Of course directors at the top of Irish public companies have resisted these revelations. They are very embarrassing for those who are overpaid while their shareholders are suffering at the bottom. I suppose a large number of people in this House know that shareholders own these companies. Why do they not do anything about it? Why have they not been able to stop these exorbitant payments? The reason is very simple, that this company, like most Irish public companies, is owned by a club of about 17 institutions who rarely if ever challenge the sort of commercial incest one sees in the Smurfit company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time something exceptional has occurred as a direct result of the Tánaiste's actions. Last week Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the 17 fund managers, declared that on Friday they would vote against such exorbitant payments. That was pretty startling news but people felt that <Col N="611" /> they were mavericks, as they are new to the club. A far more sensational development took place the day before yesterday when one of the great stalwarts of the investment management game in Ireland and an extraordinarily constant member of the club, Irish Life Investment Managers, declared that they would vote against the re-election of five directors of Smurfits this week. They have had enough. This particular payment was a breach too far. They are going to cast their vote, which I think is £46 million or thereabouts, I am open to correction on that, against such exorbitant pay. We are beginning to see a movement where shareholders are taking up the cudgels on their own behalf, whether they are shareholders by virtue of being part of a managed fund or shareholders in their own right. They do not intend to suffer any more if the directors of public companies are going to help themselves to great wads of their money. If we are not getting a return why should they get one? That is what I hope we are going to see as a direct result of the Tánaiste's measures.</P>
    <P>The problem lies I think in Irish public companies partly with fund managers, whom I will deal with in a few minutes, but partly as well with the directors of public companies. Directors of Irish public companies have on the whole been a disgrace in their behaviour as regards shareholders. The only purpose of independent directors is to look after the interests of shareholders. Nobody can stand up here today and say that the independent directors of Jefferson Smurfit look after their shareholders. They do not. They look after themselves and they look after the chairman. That is the pattern which has emerged in many other public companies as well. We did not know about it until the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, decided we should know about it and put pressure on public companies to reveal these exorbitant payments.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask if the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has any reply or suggestions to make to the question of whether there are any public companies in Ireland which are controlled by truly independent directors. I do not think so and I certainly cannot name them. A pattern emerges of people being in each others pockets with cross directorships, obligations to one another and certain perks which are indispensable and remain as long as people toe the company line.</P>
    <P>Let me take the example of the Irish Association of Investment Managers, which is the association of the fund managers who supposedly set the criteria for corporate governance for public companies. They say they are very keen on corporate governance and on independent directors. As far as I know, they set four criteria which an independent director should fulfil, some of which are negative. One states that no director can be considered independent if they have served on a public company for more than ten years. Another is that a director cannot be con<Col N="612" /> sidered independant if they receive consultancies from that company. It is perfectly obvious that if one serves for more than ten years in a company one becomes embroiled in the culture and is to a certain extent compromised. It is difficult to avoid this unless one is a very exceptional person and none of the people concerned shows any sign of this being the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that if one gets a consultancy from a company of which one is a director, then one is compromised because one is in effect being paid and is therefore more dependent on the company and the board. The next criterion is that one is not a former employee of the company because that implies having ties to the company and to people in it which one should not have if one is to be truly independent. The fourth is that one should not have given, or have been given, legal advice to, or by, the company or its directors.</P>
      <P>The Smurfit annual report confronts these issues and states that though the company may have offended, it does not consider that to be wrong. So many of the directors there receive consultancies and Dr. Smurfit himself received a bonus of over 3 million last year while the company's share price was falling. The Irish Association of Investment Managers, which sets down these criteria, is a paper tiger. We need urgent legislation, orders or pressure from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to enforce this on public companies. The IAIM has failed to make public companies conform to its guidelines with the result that our largest public company has said the IAIM is wrong and it will not take any notice of it. Fund managers have backed off and that company has continued to behave as it always has, which is unacceptable. Meanwhile, the directors continue to benefit, the guidelines have been breached and the shareholders are losing money. I suggest, though I cannot prove, that there is a direct relationship between shareholders losing money and directors doing well. They are doing far too well to care how the company does and where directors' pay is not related to shareholder performance this pattern continues.</P>
      <P>By nature of this being a small country with a small number of institutions, there is a system of cross shareholdings which is much tighter than elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Anyone who has studied in any depth, or even watched, the pattern at AGMs of proxy voting will be used to seeing them nearly always cast unanimously in favour of the board. What that has meant in the past, though I hope it is changing, is that the Bank of Ireland votes for AIB, the AIB votes for Bank of Ireland and Irish Life votes for Bank of Ireland. They all go to each other's AGMs and vote for each other to be re-elected. It is extraordinary. They never question each other's bona fides and they never ask questions about how the company is being run. In the manner of the old Soviet Union, they all put their hands up and when one hand goes up that is five million votes. The end of the story is that some guy is re-elected. Whose are the votes? They are the votes of the pensioners whose funds these people manage. It is amazing. Do you think that Bank of Ireland Asset Management, which holds 8% of Smurfits, though it used to be more, will vote against Dr. Smurfit's pay? The people it has on the board are Mr. Ray MacSharry, Mr. Howard Kilroy, an ex-governor of the Bank of Ireland and Mary Redmond. This is an example&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Such is the nature of the incestuous commerce of which I speak and that is why it is so important that these matters are exposed and revealed to the public. We have fund managers who vote willy-nilly for the board and we must ask why they do it. This is where the Minister should intervene as it is a fundamental problem. It is not simply commercial incest. Let me look at who they are voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fund managers here and overseas cast hundreds of millions of votes before or during every annual meeting and invariably cast them in favour of the establishment. Where do they get those votes? They are the votes of the pensioners whose funds they manage. Those pensioners, if asked, would come, inevitably in many cases, to totally different conclusions from the fund managers, and the fund mangers know it. Does anybody believe that a pensioner of BIAM consulted by their fund manager would say &ldquo;go and give Dr. Smurfit 6.5 million&rdquo;? Nobody wants to give him that but the fund managers vote for it against <Col N="614" /> the obvious wishes of the pensioners whose funds they manage.</P>
    <P>What does that tell you? It tells you that they are casting their votes for a different motive from the one with which they were entrusted. It tells you that they are casting their votes because there are other pressures on them, that they are casting their votes for what is not a normal, direct, commercial reason. It tells you they feel they have to for reasons which may be to do with their career, the interests of their own company or their parent bank, and it tells you they are not carrying out the wishes of their pensioners. Clear evidence is that, before this week, I know of no case where any fund manager ever broke ranks.</P>
    <P>As a solution to the problem I suggest that legislation or ministerial pressure be brought to bear to insist that on contentious issues to do with salaries, the direction of the company and payments, fund managers, pension fund managers at the very least, should be forced to consult with the trustees before they vote. I know of no record of fund managers consulting with trustees on controversial issues to do with corporate governance. There is no tradition of it because they might get a result they would not like. The trustees are honourable people whose role has been usurped to a large extent and in many cases they do not do the job with which they were entrusted as conscientiously as they might. They do not even know the roles they are playing and my guess is that they would give opposing instructions on these issues because they would consult their members and their members would say no. Fund managers must be reined in to consult them, pensioners and their unit holders.</P>
    <P>Not long ago I rang the two managers of my pension fund and I got an unsatisfactory reply from both of them. One was the AIB while the other was KBC. They informed me that it was not normal to talk to little minions like me about my money and that they would consult the trustees, but obviously had not done so and will not do so. Both institutions are members of the Irish Association of Investment Managers which, supposedly, sets down criteria for good corporate governance, which obviously does not include consulting the people whose interests they are supposed to be looking after.</P>
    <P>Let me make another suggestion. One of the key aspects to this problem is the remuneration committees of the boards of public companies which, almost inevitably, are full of stooges. There is no point in mincing one's words. That is the reason they are there. They are there to rubber-stamp. What the board thinks, the board and the chief executive ought to get. Remuneration committees sit in secret behind closed doors and never reveal what is discussed, the alternatives put forward or the submissions received. Occasionally, they commission the views of what they call independent consultants on the possible salaries or awards that should be paid to chief executives. In my experience, independent consultants inevitably consult widely and come to the <Col N="615" /> conclusions that those who pay their fees want them to come to. Unfortunately, that is the reality.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that remuneration committees, which decide on the level of pay, should not consist exclusively of members of the board. That is a simple request. Remuneration committees of four, five or six people should consist of shareholders in the company, including small shareholders. That would cause absolute panic in the boardrooms of Ireland and be totally unacceptable because the people concerned would not be part of the club. They would come in and make reasonable suggestions, but they might do something far worse. They might come out and tell the world what had happened behind those closed doors and how a matter was agreed. We could not have that situation unless they were hand-picked stooges. We could not have a situation whereby they, simply, rubber-stamped everything. They could be changed every year. Three or four could be members of the committee. It would be like a jury, and we could have reasonable pay for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>We witnessed an appalling situation with Eircom last year where bonuses were awarded at a time when shareholders were losing money hand over fist. We witness the same situation in Smurfit this year. The Tánaiste must give serious directions again whereby institutions which hold such shares will be forced to reveal what they are doing and consult primarily with their shareholders. I do not necessarily want to see pay levels lowered. I have no problem with people being paid huge sums of money, but I do have problems with secrecy and with people being paid enormous sums when boards are in their pockets deciding them, and with them being paid vulgar sums of money at a time when shareholders and pensioners are suffering.</P>

      <P>That may not be incorrect, but it need not necessarily be a criticism of it. I have admired and continue to admire the work done by the IAIM, by Ms Fitzgerald in particular in leading that organisation, for particular reasons. It does not have the authority that it should and could have if the Government was to take heed of this proposal. Perhaps, the way forward is to look at what can be done.</P>
      <P>I have a number of suggestions which I would like the Minister to take on board in his response in terms of how we can implement the wording of the proposal. First, the Irish Association of Investment Managers should be given statutory powers or else have its proposals implemented through statutory power. This can be done in a number of ways. It can be done through a ministerial order or regulation, as Senator Ross said, or by giving powers to the body. In that way the criteria it brings forward would have the power of statute and regulation. This would change completely the complexion and influence of the body and would be welcomed. It is something we should examine.</P>
      <P>Second, I would like to see regulation of the various relationships into which fund managers enter. I will come back to this point. Third, I would like to see an annual report from fund managers explaining their decisions in the course of a year being required by statute, and would require both the internal auditors and the audit committees of large public companies to explain to shareholders &ndash; their function is to explain decisions to shareholders &ndash; the logic behind and the supporting evidence for the decisions of the board on issues such as the remuneration of directors. That would have to be included as part of their report and endorsed and supported by the internal and external auditors in line with a series of regulations.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the audit committees of large public companies, such as Smurfit, the example given by Senator Ross, should recognise their responsibility as being to their shareholders, should be comprised only of independent directors, and give a separate report to shareholders at each AGM explaining these matters. That would move matters forward significantly.</P>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator Ross in congratulating the Tánaiste on taking these important steps. It has been a revelation and opened up a whole area which we never understood previously. We suspected, but did not know. I have no objection to the levels of salary, allowances or payments of whatever description being earned by directors. That is not the point of the proposal. It is about accountability, answerability and fairness, which we do not see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the next step? The Tánaiste has taken this fantastic step to ensure disclosure. The <Col N="617" /> requirement to disclose has now produced information. It cannot stop there. We know how to determine how we use that information, the ends to which it is applied and how it is brought forward. The information of itself does not make the shareholder any better off or protect him or her any more than before. It provides no additional support to the security of the workers, customers or creditors of a company. We need to know what to do next with that information. That is the reason for this motion today and it is why I propose those issues. It is a wake-up call to many people.</P>
    <P>Two significant groups of people are effectively in charge of funds. There are the pension fund managers and the unit trust fund managers and, as Senator Ross outlined, the pension fund managers are almost two steps removed from their customers. They make the contributions to the pension funds but only the trustees of the fund have contact with the pension fund managers. As public representatives, we should be asking the people who pay their shillings or pounds into their pension funds each week, month and year to ring up their fund managers this week and ask them how they intend to vote at the Smurfit AGM this week and why. This is part of what needs to be done. Only in the last month, we in the INTO took the decision to demand an annual response from the people who look after the pension fund of our employees. That is part of the process of making people accountable and answerable.</P>
    <P>The pension fund managers and unit trust fund managers have a very simple choice. They decide whether the money goes to the directors or the shareholders. It is a simple choice and there are no further options. That is the importance of the matter we are discussing here today. The issues we are exploring are crucially important following the whole debacle, as investors would see it, of the Eircom flotation, which hurt many people financially, some of whom were misled while others were foolish. Leaving those things aside, however, the fact is that interest in this area of work persists and we need to ensure that investors, whether they be in unit trusts or elsewhere, can have trust and confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>I ask people to do the following exercise on a weekly basis. Pick up the business section of any newspaper, including Senator Ross's newspaper, and look at the weekly report on the various funds. First have a look at the tracker funds and then at the funds run by the big boys, who promise they will use their great powers of intelligence and expertise as well as investment news to look after our money. A comparison of managed and tracker funds rarely shows any significant evidence that the humans of the managed funds bring greater benefits than the computers of the tracker funds. Why?</P>

      <P>That question needs to be asked and I ask it every year of fund managers. They are no better than the computers. I do not know what they are doing and we need to a response from them. They are the voice of the small shareholder.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the way fund managers do business in terms of the competition laws of the EU. They seem to flock and herd together and because they are only measured against each other, they protect each other, move together and take decisions together. In effect, therefore, they become market makers by another name. In many cases the fund managers are a cabal that effectively controls prices.</P>
      <P>There should be legislation to deal with all these areas and to look at the various sets of relationships that fund managers have. What is their specific relationship with the large companies in which they invest? We ask these questions of auditors of both external and internal companies so it is fair to ask the same question of the fund managers who have an equally controlling influence over the company. What is the relationship between the fund managers and the Stock Exchange? </P>
      <P>Let us hear about the flow of information from large companies to fund managers. It is utterly unacceptable that fund managers get access to information before small shareholders. This happens all the time. Waiting for the results from various companies is becoming a joke. Once they are released either they have no impact on the stock prices whatsoever, neither good nor bad, or the price moves in the opposite direction from what one might expect simply because the results have been either discounted from or added to the share price weeks earlier. That is wrong. I notice that the SEC in New York is taking a keen interest in the free flow and control of information and the practice of making information available to the large investors and large fund managers before it becomes available to the ordinary investor or shareholder. That cannot be allowed. I believe that there is a golden circle or club &ndash; Senator Ross talked about it &ndash; among the fund managers. Their job is an important one, but this House should still investigate it.</P>
      <P>As Members of the House will know, I do not hold fund managers in very high regard anyway. I was particularly annoyed and upset at the precipitate way in which they reduced their investment in the Irish market as soon as we went into euroland some years back. The swiftness with which they reduced the levels of their portfolio investment in Irish funds from some 30% to 40% down to 15% or lower created chaos in the Irish market. Admittedly, that might have been necessary but it showed very little commitment to the development of this country or to the needs of its shareholders. They were quick enough to turn their back on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will need to give teeth to the various bodies involved in this area. I recognise what the Irish Association of Investment Managers is trying to <Col N="619" /> do. I am in no way critical of them and I congratulate Ann Fitzgerald on being the first person, as far as I know, to come out with a clear view on the remuneration of the Smurfit Group directors. We should also recognise the move made by the Aberdeen Asset Managers and the Irish guide fund managers and ask other fund managers to take a similar line.</P>
    <P>We have here today a wake-up call. As elected public representatives, we recognise, welcome and support the moves made by the Tánaiste but ask that they be taken that bit further. We need to put in place regulations and controls like those we are introducing for accountants and auditors. It is equally, and in many cases more, important that we do so for this group of people because they will not do it on their own and will cock a snook at anyone. They already have in the case of the IAIM, where they refused to act honourably on the basis of voluntary movement. They will be required therefore to change their attitudes to statutory requirements and the Tánaiste should make this move in the knowledge that she has the full support of this House and of all small investors because it would return some element of trust and confidence to the marketplace, which is important for all of us.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to second the motion and thank Senator Ross for putting it on the agenda. I also thank the Government for taking a Private Members' motion in Government time for the first time in my experience. This is the way the House should work on issues where there is a general consensus and we are grateful for that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the issue of the remuneration of directors of public limited companies. The issues raised are topical, in that we are at present in the middle of the AGM season of many if not most of our publicly quoted public limited companies, popularly known as plcs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Tánaiste and myself, our Department and the Government, I wish to thank sincerely Senators Ross, O'Toole and their colleagues on the Independent benches for tabling this motion. The Tánaiste has played a key role in this area. I have certain legal, political, governmental and departmental responsibilities additional to those of the Tánaiste and I assure Members that the Tánaiste and I and the Depart<Col N="620" /> ment are at one in trying to ensure that absolute transparency will be available to everyone, irrespective of the size of their shareholding or the company in which investment is made. The Tánaiste in particular has played a strong and committed role in this area.</P>
    <P>The Irish stock market is relatively small &ndash; approximately 80 companies are quoted &ndash; with a market value of 85 billion. The companies listed have a market capitalisation varying from 14.5 billion to 300,000 million. In the year 2000, the ISE raised approximately 5.9 billion, as compared with £939 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>In recent years the most significant corporate activity on the exchange was the flotation of Eircom plc. The monitoring and supervising of takeovers is the statutory responsibility of the Irish Takeover Panel, the chairman and chief executive of which report directly to me and whom I met in recent weeks. The objective of the panel is to ensure fair and equal treatment of all shareholders in takeover situations and to provide support and credibility for our financial markets, a task they undertake most creditably. Some weeks ago I signed into law regulations which extend the remit of the panel to cover publicly quoted companies registered here, but not listed on the Irish Exchange, which will provide greater safeguards to investors in such companies in the event of significant corporate activity.</P>
    <P>Statute gives, in so far as our Department is concerned, two roles to the Stock Exchange &ndash; first, a role as listings authority and, second, a specific role in relation to the investigation of instances of alleged insider dealing. I am currently engaged in examining the year 2000 report. The preceding indicates some of the measures put in place to give greater transparency in the governance of corporate affairs in this State.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, impose considerable statutory obligations on directors in a variety of ways. They are required to disclose interests in other companies, must disclose substantial contracts and can only accept loans from their companies in restricted manners, etc. This is not an exhaustive list of requirements placed on directors, rather it is illustrative.</P>
    <P>In the area of the remuneration of directors, the 1963 Act provides that the emoluments of directors be disclosed in aggregate. As Members will be aware, provision for the payment of remuneration to directors is determined by the articles of the company. For example, Article 76 of Table A provides:</P>
    <P>The remuneration of the directors shall from time to time be determined by the company in general meeting . The directors may also be paid all travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by them in attending meetings . or in connection with the business of the company.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the Company Law Review Group dealt with the issue of disclosure. It recommended that <Col N="621" /> the following minimum information should be disclosed: all salaries, pension contributions and other benefits paid to directors in aggregate; aggregate figures for the performance element of the remuneration of executive directors should be stated separately; and detailed information on share option schemes available to individual directors.</P>
    <P>The issue of disclosure of directors' remuneration remained somnolent until March 1999 when the Tánaiste indicated that she was unhappy at the lack of transparency in this area, especially at a time of increasing globalisation of our capital markets, maximum accountability and transparency. She was of the view, one which I share, that full individual disclosure to shareholders would be in the in the best interest of all. In that connection she indicated her preference that the Stock Exchange rules on that issue should be revised voluntarily and that would be the best way to bring about change.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the OECD published its Principles of Corporate Governance, which, it suggested, should disclose sufficient information on the remuneration of board members and key executives for investors properly to assess the costs and benefits of remuneration plans and the contribution of incentive schemes. After intensive discussion, the exchange amended its rules to come into effect for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2000. Thus we have now reached the situation of disclosure of directors' remuneration on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>With the disclosure of individual directors' pay, a number of commentators have expressed concern, among other places in the media, on the correlation between the remuneration paid to directors and the performance of such companies. This issue was highlighted by Senators Ross and O'Toole. The consequence of the correlation is a structured mechanism to express dissatisfaction where in the view of the investor the remuneration package is not in keeping with the performance. Among the views expressed is that investment and fund managers should consult with their clients and policyholders on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of current interest in this debate that in the case of the proposed demerger and sale of Eircell to Vodaphone, a postal ballot of beneficiaries is in being to determine how the votes attaching to the ESOP 14.9% shareholding should be cast in relation to the resolution to demerge Eircell. Before remarking on that issue, I must state that it is striking to see the size of the market. Somewhere in the region of 200 billion is under management here, of which 75 billion is invested on behalf of Irish clients. A significant portion of the latter is invested in Irish equities to fund pension, life and other schemes.</P>
    <P>The goal of the investment manager is to obtain the best return for his client, which can number from single figures to hundreds of thousands. Irish institutions own something in the region of 20% of the Irish stock market, a proportion that has dropped by several percentage <Col N="622" /> points in recent years. This is related, to an extent at least, to eurozone investment possibilities, of which we hope there will be many more.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom has suggested a number of ideas in the area of directors' remuneration. These include special procedures to allow shareholders to table resolutions for the AGM on remuneration; a requirement for listed companies to have an annual vote by shareholders on the boards' remuneration report; a requirement for them to have a remuneration policy and to seek shareholders' agreement to it annually; annual elections for directors of listed companies; and a requirement for the chair of the remuneration committee to be elected every year.</P>
    <P>There are other legal issues in the matter of how to fix pay. One is conscious, as I have said already, that payment of remuneration for directors is normally provided in the articles of the company. There is the ability of shareholders, although in practice this would be institutional shareholders due to voting strength, to propose an amendment to a company's articles in such cases as meet their disapproval.</P>
    <P>The current Company Law Review Group, representatives of which I met in recent weeks, received no submissions on issues related to directors' remuneration in response to public advertisements placed as late as February 2001. Similar advertisements were placed in February 2000 and, again, no response was forthcoming. While the final report of the group at the end of 2001 will contain substantial recommendations to correct anomalies relating to directors and on directors' fiduciary responsibilities, it will not include any recommendations on directors' remuneration.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that, within the past fortnight, the Irish Association of Investment Managers has written to the chairman of each plc on a range of issues. In that letter the association is seeking, in connection with a review it is undertaking on its March 1999 paper on corporate governance, the views of each listed plc on peer group comparatives in relation to pay and remuneration. I gather the outcome of its review will be published and I look forward to reading it when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the directors disclosure regime, another significant element of primary data is now available for investors to assess. Where investors, either primary or by association, wish to invest in a company, they can use such information and criteria as they feel appropriate. The growth of pension fund activism raises the question of whose interests precisely are being pursued in the name of good governance. The increasing tendency of publicly quoted companies to return to closely held forms of ownership through buy-outs and similar forms of reorganisation suggests that dispersed shareholder ownership may not be as effective in ensuring good governance as many have thought. Meanwhile, <Col N="623" /> attention is being paid to alternative modes of governance, including co-operative and mutual forms of ownership, collective employee voice and creditor-based monitoring.</P>
    <P>Research in corporate governance needs to unravel the incentive effects of these different forms of ownership and control. Giving shareholders, whether they are institutional entities representing many thousands or hundreds of thousands of policyholders, the right in law to vote on remuneration is problematic. As a means of reining in excessive pay, they might be slow to work. I agree with Mr. John Lawrie's remarks made some years ago that &ldquo;initially only the most flagrant cases would result in a row at an AGM and a vote against the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, research in this area in the United States does not show clear trends. It is a fact that boards of directors pay their key staff for performance. While researchers feel that performance is being measured, typically total return to shareholders, the actual director pay plans are often built around other criteria. In a paper by the North Western University's Kellogg Business School the authors ascertained that performance measures often cited were net income, sales, return on assets, earnings per share and share price. Comparing the weighting of those criteria in the directors pay plan indicated that the board of directors got what it paid for. To the extent that there is a problem, it is that directors mostly are not paying for what shareholders want, which is higher total return.</P>
    <P>The issues in relation to directors remuneration packages, in so far as the Irish market is concerned, are now unfolding. Clear trends are not yet evident. It is a fact that we have considerable sums invested through investment and pension fund managers. A salient issue is whether such fund or pension managers have the ability to set down criteria for executive remuneration. Is it practical that institutions be mandatorily obliged to consult their clients, who will range in their thousands, on such an issue? Are those consulted competent to understand the issues they are being presented with as such packages are notoriously complex? There will be cost issues involved which I would be concerned would translate to cost to the individual pensioner or saver probably on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Eircom ESOP is currently balloting on the sale of Eircell to Vodafone. Such a ballot, which I presume involves thousands of people, is focused on a strategic issue, namely, a substantial asset disposal of the company. I would be concerned if corporate practices that routinely reward poor main board directors' performance with massive pay and perks jeopardise working families' savings, retirement savings, children's third level education funds and other family finances. Another concern would centre on excessive directors' pay and corporate practices which threaten jobs, as nobody in a company has more at stake than workers and <Col N="624" /> their communities. Perhaps their clients would expect the institutions to whom they have contributed their funds to invest to seek the highest returns and where they did not obtain the highest return to immediately disinvest. Such clients use the services of the institutional investors at no small cost to themselves, as such individuals perhaps have neither the capacity nor the opportunity to invest directly in the markets to ensure a satisfactory return to fund pensions, savings etc.</P>
    <P>Calls have not been made on me as Minister of State to change company law in respect of remuneration. I see no prospect of moving in that direction unless a compelling case is made. I would not accept as a starting thesis that something should be done by the State because of the remuneration package given in one plc. That would not be a basis to create new legislation. The current debate on the various issues centring on directors' remuneration has, in the words of the Carpenters refrain, only just begun. Let us see what companies, individual directors, institutional investors and others bring to the matter over the next 12 months or more and let us see what investors want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the motion and I thank Senators Ross and O'Toole for tabling it. I thank the Minister of State for his overview from the Department's perspective of this extremely important subject, namely, to ensure that investment pension fund managers consult their contributors and customers before supporting measures which, although beneficial to directors, may be detrimental to small shareholders. The motion urges the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to &ldquo;take further measures to ensure that investment and pension fund managers consult with their contributors and customers before supporting measures which enrich directors at the expense of small shareholders&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree with all what Senator Ross said except his reference to the Irish Association of Investment Managers as a paper tiger. Perhaps it is to some extent but it has also done valuable work. More legislation is necessary and I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce it. There should be consultation with the trustees before fund managers cast their vote. I agree that remuneration committees must be seen to be truly independent. I strongly support Senators O'Toole and Ross in urging the Minister for State and the Minister to give direction in this matter. The IAIM should be given statutory powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of vital national concern that we do everything in our power to ensure that small investors maintain confidence in the economy. They invest much of their savings in Irish equities both directly and through fund managers in various insurance companies with whom they have either pension or medium to longer-term investment products. Consequently, the institutional managers who manage such vast sums for their <Col N="625" /> investors must maintain constant vigilance and act sharply to rule out complacency and slackness in the performance of their investment policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, and the obligations they statutorily impose in different ways. I also welcome the good work done by the company law review group which published its report in 1994. It made recommendations which were a step in the right direction. The most important work done to date in this area, given the sluggishness or reluctance of the Irish Stock Exchange following the division with the London Stock Exchange, was done by the Minister. I was delighted that Senator Ross was lavish in his praise of her. She indicated she was unhappy at the lack of transparency in this area, particularly at a time of increasing globalisation of our capital markets, maximum accountability and transparency, as the Minister of State outlined in his speech.</P>
    <P>Another important step was the publication of the OECD principles of corporate governance in 1999. It was after extensive discussion that the exchange bowed to the view of the Tánaiste and the Department in amending its rules, which came into effect for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2000. That is how we arrived at full disclosure of directors' remuneration on an individual basis. All of this is vital given that there is approximately 200 billion under management here of which 75 billion is invested on behalf of Irish clients. A significant portion of the latter is invested in Irish equities to fund pension, life and other schemes. In common with one of the previous speakers, my only criticism of fund managers is in that they may have shifted too sharply out of Irish equities.</P>
    <P>The London Stock Exchange introduced the requirement for publicly quoted companies to disclose individual directors' salaries before us. Obviously this was a very necessary measure from a performance point of view,</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Ann Fitzgerald and the Irish Association of Investment Managers who campaigned successfully for full disclosure of directors' remuneration and to the Tánaiste for taking on board their views. This is a very important step to allow investors and small shareholders to make a judgment on the relationship between performance and reward. They rightly felt that full disclosure, which is the norm in the developed capital markets of the US and UK, was essential if companies were to be more accountable to their shareholders. I believe that disclosure to date has vindicated their stance.</P>
    <P>The combined code on corporate governance, which is embedded in the listing rules of the London and Irish Stock Exchanges states that remuneration levels should be reasonable but not excessive. It recommends that a proportion of remuneration should link pay awards to corporate and individual performance.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the code, companies have, over the last few years, established remuneration committees to decide on executive directors' <Col N="626" /> remuneration. This was necessary because they have been required to make a remuneration statement in their annual reports and many engaged independent consultancy advice to assist their decision-making. It would be regrettable if that advice were not fully independent as has been implied. From now on, we will be able to see how Irish companies rate on the quality and depth of that information. So far, based on what has been published, the quality of information the remuneration reports contain has varied widely, with some being very forthcoming while others are obscure to say the least.</P>
    <P>A vitally important question relates to responsibility in ensuring that performance and reward are linked and what shareholders should do if they are unhappy with the level of pay. I believe that corporate governance vests responsibility collectively in the board of directors even though, in practice, it seems they often hide behind the decisions of their remuneration committees.</P>
    <P>The combined code lays down that members of the remuneration committee should be independent non-executive directors and increasingly independence is being seen as not being a former executive of the company, not receiving consultancy fees from the company, not being retained as a legal adviser and not being a non-executive director for more than ten years. Senator Ross referred to that at some length and he may have had a further point that I overlooked. This leads to the need for a more precise understanding of potential conflicts of interest, which sadly are not often enough understood or appreciated in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Ann Fitzgerald of the IAIM has argued that the Smurfit Group has not complied with the minimum standard on disclosure whereas other leading companies such as AIB and Irish Life and Permanent have. She stated that both of the latter &ldquo;in their statements of remuneration policy gave details of the broad criteria and parameters relating to annual bonus awards to executive directors&rdquo; and went on to say that &ldquo;this has not happened in the Smurfit Annual Report. We have no information as to the parameters, percentage of base salary, which can be granted in bonuses to executive directors. Neither do we seem to have the same quality of information in relation to pension contributions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The IAIM is obviously very unhappy that nearly £8.5 million was paid out in 2000 to the five executive directors of the Smurfit Group which included a whopping £5.2 million to the chairman and chief executive, Michael Smurfit.</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28 March by Cyril Hardiman states:</P>
    <P>The executives' underlying remuneration was even higher when individual pension contributions, not disclosed by the company, are included.</P>
    <P>Moreover, adding in extra share options awarded last June under the group's special long-term incentive plans boosts the value of <Col N="627" /> the chairman's 2000 package to £13m (16.6m), way above the remuneration range to which other chief executives of Irish companies, most of them much more successful, can aspire.</P>
    <P>The options, exercisable in the future and conditional on earnings targets being achieved had a value of 10 million at that date.</P>
    <P>The Irish Association of Investment Managers (IAIM) said the Smurfit payments &ldquo;can be considered excessive&rdquo; by comparison with the standards and performance of AIB and CRH, two of the country's leading companies which, like Smurfit, have an international focus.</P>
    <P>IAIM secretary general Ann Fitzgerald, a staunch campaigner for full remuneration disclosure over the years, noted: &ldquo;On the basis of a total return to shareholders of approximately 2% per annum since 1990, there does not seem to be, in reality, any correlation between the remuneration paid to the chairman/chief executive and the performance of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In contrast, CRH and AIB have produced comparable returns to shareholders of 19% and 17% respectively.</P>
    <P>Despite easily outperforming the packaging group over the years, the executive directors of these two companies have been paid considerably less. AIB chief executive Tom Mulcahy earned 1.1m last year, excluding pension contributions &ndash; a mere one sixth of Michael Smurfit's remuneration.</P>
    <P>Ms Fitzgerald was scathing in her criticism of Smurfit for not disclosing more information in the annual report. It is normal for listed companies to include individual pension contributions when working out their executive directors' total remuneration.</P>
    <P>Smurfit chief operating officer Gary McGann, who himself picked up a pre-pension £827,000 (1.05m) package for the 11 months he was on the board, stressed yesterday: &ldquo;We followed the letter of the law&rdquo; in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, Ms Fitzgerald rejected this as &ldquo;a specious argument&rdquo;, saying: &ldquo;From shareholders' point of view, pension costs are an integral part of the cost of employment and should be disclosed&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is good to note that the IAIM is assessing remuneration committee members of Irish quoted companies in the context of a survey that they are carrying out in compliance with the criteria laid down in the combined code. It is necessary that directors be truly independent in practice in assessing remuneration. This is extremely important work as shareholders do not see what goes on in the boardroom and need to rely on objective criteria in making assessments. The IAIM has pointed out that, in evaluating this year's annual reports, they are focusing, in particular, on those companies where the composition of the board and remuneration committees do not meet with accepted standards, either because the position of chairman and chief execu<Col N="628" /> tive are combined or there is an insufficiency of independent non-executive directors. They have stated:</P>
    <P>We will measure them against the combined code and consider whether there is a need for more specific guidelines than the code provides. We will consider adopting recent UK Government proposals that quoted companies give information on the performance of comparator companies and disclose whether the board changed the remuneration committee's decisions with the reasons for the change.</P>
    <P>We will also have to consider the most effective ways for investors to exercise a negative vote at an AGM. At present shareholders who are unhappy with the level of directors' awards, for example, cannot vote against them directly. All they can do is vote against the adoption of the annual accounts or against the re-appointment of directors, none of whom may be on the remuneration committee.</P>
    <P>We may also publish guidelines, setting out our views and indicating the areas of non-compliance that may lead investors to exercise a negative vote at general meetings.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, institutional investors have to make the decisions that they consider to be in the best interest of their clients. That is what they are paid to do. Whether these decisions involve seeking change or disinvestment will vary depending on their views of individual companies. The one certainty is that companies who want a stable and committed shareholder base should aim to meet the highest possible standards and achieve the best possible returns over time.</P>
    <P>The work of the IAIM is vital as most small shareholders are not adept at monitoring company performances and learning to read the signals which affect them. I commend IAIM because accountability to shareholders is everything and there is clear evidence that some chairmen and chief executives are treating their shareholders with contempt by governing the companies with which they are entrusted as personal fiefdoms. They act as though they are feudal overlords.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the best corporate governance standards is vital and conflicts of interest must be avoided. In this age of openness, transparency and accountability there is no room for shoddy practices and all cards must be face up on the table. In line with Senators Ross and O'Toole, I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to take further measures. These may be taken as a result of further study or they may be taken as a result of consultation with IAIM, or both. The issue needs further time, as the Minister has agreed, and the House will allow that time. The House urges the Government to take the appropriate steps arising from the further study. I hope that will not take too long.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am delighted to speak on this debate. I echo <Col N="629" /> the Minister in agreeing that the current debate on directors' remuneration has only begun. We need to see what companies, individual directors, institutional investors and others want to bring to the debate over the next year. It is better to discover what investors want rather than legislating before we understand what is required. Small investors want to see their shares and investments protected while getting a return, as will be emphasised following the Eircom-Vodafone questionnaire. Much of this money is put away for pensions, third level fees and second homes, among other things. Investors may not want to participate in running a company, setting directors' fees, agreeing directors' remuneration etc. They may feel that this area is too complex and whether we agree with the amount of money directors get paid, the area is complex.</P>
      <P>It is important to take this matter slowly. This is the first year we are beginning to see the breakdown of individual director's remuneration and salaries at AGMs. As Senator Ross mentioned, there has been a change in the way major investment brokers and fund managers are dealing with this issue. Some are unhappy. We should see how this issue develops so that we can evaluate how best to continue. It is essential that while board and director performance are rewarded, this does not take away from the savings of working families and small investors who are saving for family reasons. The Government agrees with this position. While it is not up to us to decide what directors should be paid, excessive corporate practices which threaten jobs and savings should not be allowed. Small investors provide the funding for companies to move forward through pension funds and shares and their interests should be key in any discussion. The money they invest should be safe.</P>
      <P>There is no disagreement on this issue in the House. Senator Ross spoke about the need for greater transparency, and this is something which has become more apparent over the past two years. Initially, aggregate figures for salaries, pension contributions and benefits paid to directors were published. Separate aggregate figures for the performance element of the remuneration of the executive directors were published and we also saw detailed information on share option schemes available to individual directors.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Minister indicated that she was unhappy with the lack of transparency in this area, particularly as we have seen the globalisation of capital markets and a general increase in accountability and transparency. In the view of the Government, full disclosure to shareholders would be in the best interests of all. If one feels entitled to a particular wage or bonus, one should be able to stand up at an AGM, look shareholders in the face and explain why that wage or bonus is merited. Directors should be able to explain that payments to directors will be of benefit to all shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="630" /> ment, Deputy Treacy, have put a lot of work into this area and are to be commended for the progress made and for their courage in taking on the Establishment, as Senator Ross mentioned. Change is difficult, and Irish financial institutions have gone through a period of unprecedented change in the past five or six years, especially in the past two or three years. Openness, transparency and accountability have made a difference and this is to be welcomed. Public companies are now declaring directors' salaries to their shareholders and to other directors.</P>
    <P>I do not fully believe Senator Ross when he says that the issue is not about how much is being paid but about the right to know. However, I agree that the right to know is vitally important. Directors should not be unhappy for shareholders to know the amount a company pays to them. Openness may even make directors feel more worthwhile about their contribution to a company. Senators O'Toole and Ross asked why individual directors did not feel comfortable having their pay publicly quoted at AGMs and company accounts. Perhaps they felt their remuneration was too high, or did not know what others were receiving. However, once pay across similar businesses and sectors is known openly, directors will have a clearer picture of whether they have earned their rewards. If directors are happy that their contribution to growth and profits is deserving of the remuneration they receive, they will be satisfied for shareholders to share that information.</P>
    <P>A sea-change is under way in Ireland currently. The Minister spoke about the size of the Irish stock market. Small investors only recently started to acquire shares in Irish companies and read the financial pages of the newspapers to monitor their shares' performance. Due to economic growth and the fact that people have increased disposable income, we are only now beginning to see increased investment in stocks and shares and are gradually becoming educated about it. It will take some time before shareholders begin to reclaim power to the stage at which they can make decisions at AGMs. One only needs a single share to be eligible to attend an AGM and make a statement. It may not be possible to effect change at that level, but one can, at least, start the ball rolling. Investors must undergo a learning curve which companies must facilitate. Any decent public company will ensure its shareholders understand what they can do, what their rights are and where they can effect change.</P>
    <P>The independence of directors was raised. It is vitally important that directors are independent and seen to be so. They must not appear to make decisions solely on the basis of what is good for them as opposed to what is good for the company and its shareholders. I have a high opinion of the directors I know in many publicly quoted Irish companies. While most are very well paid, they have shareholders' welfare as their primary objective. They work for the good of the com<Col N="631" /> pany and its employees, the community in which it operates and the shareholders.</P>
    <P>Directors' pay should be related to share performance. If that does not happen, the correlation between the company's performance and directors' pay will not be obvious. If a company undergoes a bad performance period, a director's remuneration package should reflect that slump. Equally, good performances should also be reflected in directors' pay. This should be borne in mind by the various remuneration committees being established by publicly quoted companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the incestuous nature of directorships in public companies. There are benefits to sharing views on the different ways of conducting business at the boardroom table. Knowledge is very beneficial; if one knows exactly what is happening in the market and the direction in which it is headed, a certain synergy can be achieved through sharing knowledge. It is not desirable that the nature of directorships would work against the companies, shareholders or employees, but there are occasions when the close-knit nature of communications in this area can benefit companies and shareholders.</P>
    <P>There is total agreement in the House on the disclosure of directors' salaries &ndash; performance related bonuses, pension provisions etc. We should aim for greater accountability and transparency in this area. If directors accept money, they must be able to justify it and outline what they did to earn it. Situations must not arise in which individuals act over and above the good of entire organisations. The common good must always be borne in mind. Small investors, employees and the communities in which companies operate must be catered for. The rights of small investors must be protected and I am confident the Government will continue to take the necessary action to ensure this. I thank the Minister and the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Although a signatory to the motion, I did not anticipate speaking on it as this is not the type of subject which normally excites me. Listening to the debate in my office, however, I found it extraordinarily stimulating. We are indebted to Senator Ross for his initiative in tabling this important motion which follows a tradition he has upheld in the House for some time. As a former stockbroker, Senator Ross displayed great courage in a previous session when he opened up the issue of insider trading. He took a significant risk in doing so given his background. As someone who is often perceived as coming from an Establishment background, Senator Ross has shone a light into some very murky corners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small investors receive glossy reports containing photographs of very important looking people. Traditionally, such investors assumed that all was well and did not really question a company's underlying ethos. The Minister used the <Col N="632" /> term &ldquo;insider trading&rdquo; in the first page of his speech. He did not state that the subject of this debate constitutes insider trading, but is leaving it to me to suggest that there is a clear parallel between the two. The people about whom we are speaking are, undoubtedly, insiders who deal themselves an extraordinarily benevolent hand. I would be suspicious if I was involved in that card game, although I suppose one could justify the rather dangerous ethos at play on biblical grounds: &ldquo;To him that hath shall be given, from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This attitude seems to be creeping in everywhere. One can see it in the attitude of the Arts Council to the Gate Theatre; the theatre has been chastised because it has not lost sufficient money. Grant allocations have been questioned because the theatre is not in a loss situation. It appears failure is to be rewarded and success penalised. The companies cited here may not have penalised success, but they, certainly, appear to have rewarded failure. It is astonishing to even the meanest intelligence that people in a responsible position in a company should reward themselves with such huge bonuses at a time when the company's dividends and profits are decreasing. That is an absurd <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> type scenario.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the penny has not dropped with some of those involved that these are public companies, not personal fiefdoms which can be ruled in a feudal manner, although many seem to be getting away with this. Towards the end of his speech, the Minister pulled back somewhat in stating that he had not received sufficient representations or submissions on particular issues. The Government's action today in happily accepting a Private Members' motion during Government time and the Minister's use of the words &ldquo;delighted to be here to take part in the debate&rdquo; signal to me that the Government is sending a message to those involved in this area. For the record, the Minister is nodding. This debate is sending out a clear and important message that the Government is watching and that if matters do not change voluntarily, some type of statutory move will be made. I believe we are correct to be concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to look at one or two aspects of the Minister of State's speech. He states that he would be concerned if corporate practices that routinely reward poor main board directors' performance with massive pay and perks jeopardise working families' savings etc., investments which are intended to produce yield to pay for children's education and so on. I am concerned about the grammatical construction of that sentence. He states he would be concerned if certain things can be shown to jeopardise these pensions and so on. Built into that is an extraordinarily calm acceptance that there is a situation which routinely rewards poor main board directors' performance. This is something that ought to be looked at because we cannot just accept it. Frequently poor performance is given a paradoxical enormous reward. That is something which concerns me and <Col N="633" /> should concern everyone. The Minister of State goes on to say that clients might expect the institutions to which they have contributed their funds to invest to take action in this regard. However, Senator Ross has exposed why they will not do so, that is, they are all so incestuously inter-related. Many of the main investment funds have people who are on the board of these companies. There is a total spider's web of inter-relationship and the fact that there is a golden circle has been clearly demonstrated here today. How can one possibly expect these people to vote against themselves, because that would not be human nature? </P>
    <P>What makes me laugh is the revelation that the principles of capitalism and the free market do not seem to operate once one rises above a certain level inside a company structure. What happens to the free market philosophy when remuneration is being decided and where are the severe capitalist criteria in terms of profit and reward being applied in this situation? The private investor is just whistling in the wind because the Minister of State states that such individuals have neither the capacity nor the opportunity to invest directly in the markets to ensure a satisfactory return to fund pensions, savings etc. Obviously these institutions will not operate in the interests of their investors. That raises the question whose money is it in terms of the trust funds. The directors of these trust funds appear on many occasions to have acted as if the money was theirs, rather than that they were charged with the responsibility for the small shareholders and the investors, which seems to be a very bad practice.</P>
    <P>On the payment of these enormous sums, if a board decides more or less in secret to pay itself and its members these enormous sums in circumstances where market share is declining, where yield on the shares is also declining and where profits are declining, it raises questions about the obligations of those directors who have a legal obligation to behave responsibly in the interests of the shareholders. It suggests at the very least that people who grant themselves enormous sums in remuneration are guilty of, if nothing else, poor business judgment. If their vision of the future of the company is so obscured by their personal greed and the fact that they want to get a good position for their snout in the trough, that suggests that they have bad judgment and are incapable of operating in the best interests of the company. The fairly run-of-the-mill provisions for the remuneration of directors rehearsed in the articles of companies are in very vague form. They state that the remuneration of directors shall from time to time be determined by the company in general meeting. Senator Ross demonstrated the weakness of this. I hope the Minister of State will look at this aspect and consider some statutory regulation.</P>
    <P>He refers to the fact that in 1999 the OECD published its Principles of Corporate Governance, which it suggested should disclose sufficient <Col N="634" /> information on the remuneration of board members and so on, and that the IAIM has an initiative in this area. Senator Ross demonstrated that the board of Smurfit's was aware of these ideas from both the OECD and the IAIM, yet it cavalierly simply referred to them and then dismissed them as if they were of no consequence. In such an instance the Government would be correct to use the opportunity of this debate to fire a warning shot and signal its intent that, if something is not done by the companies themselves, it may take specific action.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on bringing this matter to the attention of the House. It was a courageous thing for him to do given his background in commercial journalism. He has exposed something which needs to be looked at and about which the public should be aware. I note he has had some success with his colleague, Mr. Dunphy, in acquiring proxy votes and turning up at meetings. However, I do not believe this is sufficient because they will always be defeated by the bloc vote which is wielded by institutions, not apparently in the interests of their investors, but in the interests of an &ldquo;old boy&rdquo; network. I regard this with a certain irony when I recall the squawks out of the capitalist lobby against the Labour Party in Britain on the parallel issue of bloc votes for trade unions. Precisely the same is happening inside the structure of our own corporate world.</P>
    <P>This is a very important debate which I hope will be widely reported. It certainly deserves to be widely reported because the Government, above all others, has encouraged the small investor to make an investment in the various businesses and publicly quoted companies. It is very disillusioning for ordinary small investors to realise the operations of these companies frequently are in the interests of the directors of the companies to the detriment of the ultimate financial interests of the small shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, as is customary on these occasions, I declare an interest in that I am a shareholder in some publicly quoted companies on the Irish Stock Exchange. By the time I am finished, I am not sure if they will thank me for having said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and commend Senator Ross and the other Senators on tabling the motion. Perhaps it is not surprising that as a member of the Progressive Democrats I am enthusiastically in favour of the motion which commends the Tánaiste in her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is important to look at the context of the debate. I suspect there would not have been as much demand for such a debate even as recently as five years ago. Perhaps it is a measure of our increased prosperity that there is now a greater degree of personal investment in publicly quoted companies, pension funds and equity based savings. That underlines the need to ensure those investors have a greater degree of control or influence on the investment managers and, <Col N="635" /> through them, on the companies in which the funds are eventually invested if they are in the equity based end of the market.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue is whether the interests and wishes of those individual shareholders are being fully met. If one examines, historically, the behaviour of companies in this jurisdiction and elsewhere, it is the case that some directors and managements played fast and loose in the way in which they conducted their affairs because there was no accountability. They dealt with few institutional investors and the broader market did not enter into it. As has been stated on several occasions, it was a cosy little club and, to a degree, that is still the case.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is dealing with Committee Stage of the Company Law Enforcement Bill in the other House, but there are certain things that she would have liked to have said about the motion, although the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has dealt adequately and ably with it. The explanatory memorandum of that Bill contains a startling point regarding the report of the working group on company law, compliance and enforcement, which was chaired by Mr. Michael McDowell before he became Attorney General. It is an unusual statement in an explanatory memorandum, but it states that the working group found that Irish company law had been characterised by a culture of non-compliance and a failure by companies and their officers to meet their obligations under the Companies Acts. The result is the establishment of a director of corporate enforcement who will take over the functions of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the investigation of potential company law offences. The Bill will come before the House at a later date and while I do not wish to anticipate the debate, it indicates the background to and context of the motion.</P>
    <P>Shareholder democracy is well established in a legal sense, but is less established in relation to the ability of the beneficiaries of pension funds and other managed investments to influence the companies in which the money is invested. This contrasts with the position in other jurisdictions, particularly the United States, where shareholder democracy is much more developed and pension fund members have the ability in many cases to influence how their trustees and investment managers manage their money in areas other than those related solely to financial reward. The MacBride principles governing investment in Northern Ireland and the Sullivan principles for South Africa were made real only because pension fund members could mandate their trustees to act in particular ways. Pension funds are to the fore in raising corporate governance standards in the United States and are leading the way on this front on a worldwide basis. There is no reason that Ireland should be excluded from that development or that it should not follow the model of the latent power of pension funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Traditionally, the mandate of pension fund trustees and investment managers was to secure the best possible financial return for the pension fund members consistent with reasonable levels of risk. This remains the best way to manage pension funds. Nevertheless, there is a strong argument that pension fund members should be able, in a democratic way, to mandate their trustees to act or vote in particular ways on matters which are non-financial and do not undermine or compromise the fiduciary duty of trustees. I do not suggest that all matters on which trustees or investment managers make decisions should be put to a vote of pension fund members, but it would be useful if a mechanism was available to pension fund members to make their views known and, ultimately, mandate the agents to act in a particular way.</P>
    <P>This is related to the point that there is now much more individual investment in such products. It is reasonable to assume that those investing their money should have some degree of control or influence on the outcome of some of the decisions made by the managers and trustees of the funds. As the Minister said, the mechanisms and rules should be carefully designed to ensure the fundamental purpose of pension funds is not undermined or that particular pension plan members are not disadvantaged. I am sure that can be done given the level of expertise in the public service and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The wider context is that people are, increasingly, providing for their future retirement. This is related to my point about individuals investing in equity products. Contribution pension plans, which are more commonly established than defined benefit plans, reflect the change in the world of work. This change is all about and the Government will soon introduce personal retirement saving accounts which should increase the number with pension savings. If all this is added to the increase in equity savings, it is clear that the financial power of ordinary savers must receive increased recognition. This reflects the change in the level of personal investment by individuals compared to five years ago and the situation is markedly different from the position ten years ago.</P>
    <P>There is a greater need for proactive financial education of the public, given the trend for greater investment in personal savings accounts, retirement accounts and equity funds. I am pleased that, as part of the new regime of financial regulation in Ireland, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Minister for Finance have brought forward the establishment of the new statutory post of director of customer protection. This person will have a mandate to promote the financial education of the public. This is a positive and forward looking move and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been to the forefront in terms of putting the consumer and the customer at the heart of financial regulation and other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> I referred to the Company Law Enforcement Bill and the Office of Corporate Enforcement. That is a step in the right direction and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong that there is a commitment to a bi-annual review or amendment of company law. This is important because it is obvious that companies have a great degree of expertise available to them and can be ahead of the posse in devising weird and wonderful ways of legally circumventing the intention of the Oireachtas. In that context, it is important to ensure regular updating of company law. I recall the large composite Bill introduced when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce. It was a voluminous and complex Bill and it is appropriate that such matters are reviewed and updated regularly.</P>
    <P>Regarding pension fund management, the central issue is in whose interests the pension fund manager is acting or whose interests he or she has at heart. Obviously, it must be the beneficiaries of the fund, the shareholders, but, as Senator Ross and others highlighted, that was not always the case. It came back to the question of an old pals act or a golden circle and, perhaps, the management was not as vigorous or forceful as it should have been in defence of those who had invested their money. This is related to the issue of empowering the investor. This power has been latent because if one is an individual shareholder in a company, one has no influence whatsoever. If one receives one's proxies in the letterbox before the AGM, there is no point in filling them in and returning them because one knows they will have no influence whatsoever on the outcome of the meeting. However, if individuals form a corporate entity through a fund manager, their influence will become much more powerful. It will have the capacity to effect change as happened in the United States, given that the core mandate is the power of the shareholders.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the professional managers of the funds they do not always feel that they have been given a professional mandate to act in a certain way. Some of them, as has been pointed out, have done extremely well and have stood up to powerful influences. They are to be applauded for that. There needs to be more coherence in that area. I do not know if that should be done by regulations or voluntarily but it should certainly be looked at. The question of the powerlessness of the individual shareholder is certainly an issue. Circumstances have changed and the whole context needs to change.</P>
    <P>The interweaving of directors, which has been referred to by Senator Ross, is of course true. If one considers a cross-section of publicly quoted companies in this country or elsewhere, one finds names recurring across the spectrum. That is not very healthy. It is obviously difficult in a small society to have a large representative group with the necessary experience and qualifications to go on to every board. That is not to say it cannot be done. It can be done and there is a case to be <Col N="638" /> made for the directorships of these companies to be more diverse. The matter of the Irish Association of Investment Managers has been referred to. I believe in general managers take their duties seriously and try to ensure those who invest are protected.</P>
    <P>The other question, which has become central to this debate but is not central in my view, is the remuneration of directors. It is an important issue and I would not understate it, nevertheless I do not think it is the key issue. I agree with Senator Ross that the pay of directors should be related to the performance of the company. It is ludicrous if company profits fall that the remuneration of the directors should rise. Anyone in business on their own, whether they be a farmer, a shopkeeper or something else, knows very well that if their business decreases their income decreases. The same rules should apply to the directors of public companies. There must be some connection between pay awarded to directors and the performance of the company. That is not just the capital performance on the stock market but the actual profits generated by the company, although the two things are related.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if anyone could point out to me a director in a public company who was defeated by a vote at a company's annual general meeting.</P>

      <P>I am talking about a plc where the proxies had the effect of removing the director rather than a palace revolution or coup or where the institutional investors decided someone was not to their taste. The goal of this must be to obtain the best return for the client and the company.</P>
      <P>I have spoken frequently in this House about a certain culture which survives in this country. It is, in my view, the last vestige of colonialism. It is evident at some times in the public sector. It is certainly evident in companies. It is that the peasants cannot be entrusted to manage things properly. They do not know how things should be done and an elite group should decide on their behalf, in their best possible interests of course. The natives are not to be trusted. That is evident in the higher levels of company law.</P>
      <P>I hope that when those on the boards of various companies sit down to their Chateau Petrus or Chateau Latour this evening they will reflect on these matters, although I doubt very much that they will. I suspect that while what we have said today will have an influence on the Minister and the Department, I doubt it will have much effect on the consumers of the Chateau Petrus and Chateau Latour at board level.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste is to be commended for her willingness to face down the bluff of people in the Stock Exchange and other areas about their determination to retain a level of secrecy about their individual incomes. It was entirely wrong. I was entertained by the reasons they gave in the mid-1990s for retaining that secrecy. One of them was fear that they would be kidnapped. This was taken seriously. The total remuneration of directors was available but the remuneration of individuals was not. If potential kidnappers knew that the average payment was £300,000 they would not kidnap a director, but if they knew that one director was getting £1 million and another was getting £250,000 then they might kidnap one of them. It was the height of nonsense and part of a certain arrogance that seems to infect people in those places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons for wanting a higher level of disclosure and accountability and influence over the decisions of investment and pension fund managers. The first of those is equity, the second is efficiency. Both are affected by the degree to which individuals feel accountable. If individuals are not accountable to their customers they will do what is necessary to satisfy the terms of their contract with the customer and then do what suits themselves. That is neither equitable nor good for economic efficiency. The contrast between the aggrandisement of executives in certain cultures and the realisation that such aggrandisement is not good for business or society which can be found in other cultures, often correlates well with concepts of equality in society. And, incidentally, the acceptance that <Col N="640" /> wealth brings with it not just privileges but enormous responsibilities. That is what this debate is about.</P>
    <P>We should start by reflecting on the scale of some of the rewards. A member of the Committee of Public Accounts which investigated the DIRT scandal said to me that across from him at the hearings were arrayed the well clothed bodies of eminent bankers. Any one of whom was paid more than the seven members of the investigating committee combined. It dawned on him that there is a different world, unknown to most of us other than to look in from the outside, in which the definition of adequate reward begins at about £100,000 and moves upwards, whereas for most people the definition of adequate reward begins at about £20,000 with the upper limit being £50-£60,000. There is an element in Irish society which sees itself in a quite different framework. The range of rewards is different. The question which society must ask is whether these people are doing something that is both so important and so valuable that in terms of income and pensions they are entitled effectively to live on a different planet. There is not much evidence that they are so wonderfully talented, skilled or innovative.</P>
    <P>I remember 15 years ago, when the Irish Permanent was demutualised, information was disclosed that non-executive directors were paid £20,000 for attending four meetings a year. That was regarded as the minimum a non-executive director could be paid at a time when the average male industrial wage was about £10,000 a year. What criteria justify that level of payment to persons who are part-time members of boards, who take minimal risks, whose attendance at meetings is not enormous and whose duties are not onerous? There is a presumption that £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 a year is the least a person can be expected to paid for being a non-executive director. It suggests an entirely different world.</P>
    <P>I wish to cite some facts from an American website entitled inequality.org. In 1960 the average ratio of the salary of a chief executive to that of the average employee in a corporation in the United States was 41. In other words, the average chief executive was paid roughly 40 times as much as the average employee. The figure increased to 79 in 1970 and decreased to 42 in 1980, presumably because of the recession in the 1970s. In 1999 it was 475. What criterion was used to justify that explosion in inequality in the United States? I am not aware of anything in terms of economic performance which would justify it. The United States has enjoyed a period of sustained growth of 3% to 4%, but that hardly justifies a tenfold increase in the gap between the salary of the average chief executive and the average worker. It is, however, related to certain other factors to which I will return. It is related to the increasing generosity of the share options offered. It may be related to the increasing generosity of the capital gains tax exemptions or the pension funds made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> The truth in Ireland is that we do not know very much about these matters. There is the scandal of a family fix-it in what is supposed to be a plc, where members of the family report to a person who is paid less than them, even though the person concerned is further up the company hierarchy. Very little can be done about this. It is difficult to argue the case for it in terms of any reward, performance or incentive basis or other logical arrangement other than the fact that the company is owned by the family who believe they are entitled to be paid more than those with more onerous jobs than them. It is a wonderful concept which has very little to do with the function of a plc. Perhaps the Minister of State should take a slightly less benign view. It is not just one company, it has crystallised reservations people have had for 20 years about the closed shop method of fixing or settling corporate rewards.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problem with rewarding people who take genuine risks, something of which we on the left are always accused. However, I do not know anyone in the banking sector deserving of reward because none of them ever took a risk in their lives. They have all managed to move from one safe job to another. Neither do I have a problem with rewarding people who are genuinely innovative. One does not see much of this in the corporate sector, although there are exceptions which I will mention. Nor do I have a problem with rewarding people who are genuinely successful in a competitive market, because that usually means a person is doing something better than others in a way which is good for consumers. Success in a non-competitive market means a person has succeeded in manipulating customers and consumers. I can think of examples of success, such as Iona Technologies where Chris Horn has been enormously successful. Another is Elan, a company which has spent considerable sums on research and development. Other examples are the dotcom companies, however dodgy their future may now seem. They were established by people with imagination and I would not begrudge them rewards.</P>
    <P>They are not, however, the people whom we are discussing. We are talking about safe, stolid companies in comfortable, non-competitive sectors of the economy, which is what the banking sector is. It is, effectively, a cartel cared for by the Central Bank which is so obsessed with the stability of the sector that it has allowed layer upon layer of fat to grow on it to secure the basic idea of its stability. This has been done at the expense of the customers of the banks. There is a similar regime to a considerable degree in the insurance market. Due to concerns about proper funding, comfortable cosy arrangements have been formed, crystallised in the appalling overcharging of young people, something we know to be a fact. As young people pose a slightly higher risk, most companies opted out and those who stayed in discovered that they could make more money out of young people than out of anyone <Col N="642" /> else. Companies are allowed to be in a position to do this because of the fear of a threat to them if they are not allowed to be like that.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I do not have and never have had any problem with substantial rewards for genuine risk and achievement. My problem is with those who receive rewards. I do not regard someone who is fortunate to receive on the cheap a licence to run a second mobile phone service with a low level of capital investment, makes £250 million from the sale of his company, leaves the country for 18 months to avoid paying capital gains tax on the money and then comes home brandishing his Irish credentials to claim the right to take over Eircom as a model of either corporate, personal or social responsibility, nor as an example of the type of risk taking which deserves such rewards. People should be rewarded with incentive schemes when they perform properly, but we do not know how these are done, the reason they are done and, until recently, to what extent they were done. We were, simply, given global figures. This used to happen in so-called mutual societies, such as building societies owned by their members. They would say nothing about how much was being paid when dubious arrangements involving family members and relations of the directors were entered into. It was and still is a wonderful arrangement for those on the inside.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the scale of rewards for those involved in pension and investment funds, my colleague and friend, Senator Ross, has consistently indicated that most of our pension funds underperform by comparison with the market and that anyone who decides to invest money in half a dozen major plcs would do better than the reward he or she would receive from any pension fund, especially in the medium to long term. This is supposed to be a thrusting and competitive area and those involved are thrusting and competitive, but only in how they make money for their funds. They do not perform well for those who provide the money, namely, those who contribute to pension funds. Fund managers are not models of enterprise and effort. They are cosy, safe and well able to safeguard their interests without deferring to the interests of those who pay for their capacity to play the market.</P>
    <P>When these institutional shareholders attend the annual general meeting of plcs, the remuneration of directors may be questioned and an attempt made to vote against it, but the institutions vote to retain the directors' exorbitant level of remuneration. This happens because all the people who attend AGMs are in similar positions in other plcs and will not allow awkward and unhelpful lay people to enter into the cartel which guarantees that no one in the cosy circle of directorships is paid anything like the rest of society. There is hardly a chief executive of a single plc who is not being paid at least twice and probably three or four times the salary of the Taoiseach. This is not an argument for inflating the Taoiseach's salary. There is still some sense of decency among politicians. However, a funda<Col N="643" /> mental question must be asked when plcs whose performances are mediocre reward many of their middle ranking and senior executives with salaries which are vastly greater than that of the Taoiseach, who has a responsible and extremely demanding job &ndash; whatever one thinks of how he does it &ndash; which consumes enormous amounts of time, involves huge sacrifice and produces limited financial reward. It is a cheap shot for newspapers, particularly those in the group owned by the person whom I understand I am supposed to describe respectfully as Sir Anthony O'Reilly, to criticise Ministers' and politicians' salaries while their executives are rewarded with vast sums out of proportion to their performance.</P>
    <P>Ireland is faced with a peculiar dilemma. This is not Boston, where capital is held accountable with vigorous regulation, or Berlin, where capital has a tradition of social responsibility. We have become a seedy offshore island in which grubby people can make money and be accountable to nobody. Like our neighbouring island we have, I presume, rolling contracts whereby executives always have two or three years left in their contracts and even if they underperform and are dismissed they are compensated for the remaining years of their contracts. The trick of the rolling contract was invented in Britain in the 1980s. We also have the mutual support society in which no one questions anyone else.</P>
    <P>I believe in rewarding effort and particularly in rewarding risk taking, achievement and innovation. People deserve incentives to encourage innovation. There is a clear and inexorable logic which dictates that companies must make money if they are to reinvest and attract further investment. No one disputes that. Let us not confuse this with the naked greed which characterises corporate Ireland. This greed defines a minimum income on a level which most of society could never imagine. It is in this context that the Minister of State's speech was so disappointing. It was limited, conservative and protective of vested interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said, &ldquo;No calls have been made to me as Minister to change company law in respect of remuneration.&rdquo;  Senator Ross has written on this topic, perhaps once a month, in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>and it has been raised frequently by various Members of the House. The Minister of State is actually saying that none of the people he thinks are important has asked him to do anything about company law in respect of remuneration. The people the Minister of State thinks are important are those who are doing well out of the existing situation. They will not ask him to do anything about it. Virtually everybody else, including lobby groups such as the Conference of Religious of Ireland, the trade unions and large numbers of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who talk about inequality and have suggested that corporate greed is one of the things which may undermine social stability and solidarity, have called for something to be done <Col N="644" /> about company law in respect of remuneration. Obviously, these people do not have the ear of the Minister of State. Those who have are doing well out of the existing situation. As long as the Minister of State listens only to them there will be no calls for change.</P>

We know that Ministers must have scripts because they enunciate Government policy. His script states that no calls have been made on him as Minister to change company law. The Minister of State can never say that again. I am calling for a change and Senator Ross and others have also called for it. That piece of the script will have to be left out in future because the Minister of State is now being called to do something about corporate remuneration.</P>
      <P>Inequality is socially destructive. It makes societies worse. There is evidence that inequality affects people's health and it limits society's willingness to deal with real problems such as housing and public transport. Societies which have a commitment to reducing inequality are also the societies which deal with those issues. As long as people like the Minister of State are in power, who believe that inequality is a good thing and that allowing corporate greed is good for society, we will not deal with the other symptoms of inequality. Although I congratulate the Minister on what she has done, I doubt if she will move very far in the direction in which we should be going.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Ross, for his initiative in presenting this motion before the House.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago at the time of the impending IPO of Telecom Éireann, like many of my colleagues I enthused at the prospect of the concept of shareholding dawning on a new Ireland in a period of economic prosperity. Today's debate affords me the opportunity to apologise for the enthusiasm with which I embraced this concept. In theory it seemed to be working wonderfully well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a minor shareholder &ndash; anyone who cares to look at the register of Members' interests will see the extent of my shareholding &ndash; I have been following the stock market and financial instru<Col N="645" /> ments as a hobby for a number of years. I had watched the highly successful IPOs launched in Britain since the sale of British Telecom shares and all of them had done very well. There seemed to be no reason the Telecom Éireann IPO would not do equally well, especially at a time of phenomenal economic growth. Two years later, with hundreds of thousands of people, I am nursing a heavy financial loss. It is a tribute to the courage and bravery of those shareholders that they have not sold out, as one would expect nervous shareholders to do. If it was happening in an American environment, they would long since have distanced themselves from what has been seen as a failing share. That is the reason I am in apologetic mode.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority in this country, shareholding was a new concept. Others and I, both in this House and outside, encouraged people to put their money into Eircom because it seemed to be a safe bet, but we added the rider &ndash; very much tongue-in-cheek &ndash; that what goes up can come down. None of us anticipated, however, that having gone up ever so slightly it would come down with such a crash and hit the floor with such resounding force that it has been damaged, although I hope not beyond repair.</P>
    <P>In that context, I welcome Senator Ross's initiative. Purely from a shareholder's point of view, I also share serious concerns about the way in which Eircom has gone about its business. The suggestion that its directors should somehow be rewarded for the pathetic share performance in the last couple of years has caused me and others a great deal of anger which was expressed eloquently by Senator Ross, representing many of the smaller shareholders at the last AGM. I have no doubt that he will be loading his barrels to have another go when next we meet.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I compliment the board of Eircom on having the vision to initiate discussions with Vodafone, notwithstanding the fact that the telecoms sector has been going through an extraordinarily difficult period since the flotation two years ago. I acknowledge that the board of Eircom could not possibly have anticipated that there would be such a run on its stocks that has brought us to today's sorry state.</P>
    <P>We, in Ireland, have suffered from what I can only describe as the poor management practices of many of the major companies, Vodafone included, which seem to have completely lost the run of themselves in the auction process in the United Kingdom. They were buying up licences for third generation mobile phones at such inflated prices that even those who had absolutely no knowledge of economics, or of how the market works, were beginning to question how, in the name of all that is holy, they would be able to recoup the amount spent purely on the acquisition of the licence, not taking into account the amount it was going to cost to invest in third generation phones.</P>
    <P>What is the current situation in relation to the 3G networks? Worldwide evidence now indicates <Col N="646" /> that most of us are quite happy with the generation of phones we have. It is not rocket science. What do most people want a mobile phone for? They want to switch it on, make a call, receive a call and switch it off, but we have been bombarded in the last couple of years with all sorts of hype surrounding the 3G mobile phone. We are told that it will be able to do everything, including making a cup of tea, but most could not care less about it, as recent surveys have suggested. This begs the question as to where Eircom is going in its merger with Vodafone. As I said, I welcome the initiative. It is the best possible deal for Eircom and I will be strongly advising shareholders to support it. I have sent back my particular tuppence ha'penny worth and hope everybody else will do the same because it really is the best future we have got. Eircom is unique among European telecom companies in that it has no debt overhanging it. It is, literally, going in as a clean operator to join a company which is acknowledged as the world's largest in its field. That has got to be good for shareholders in the medium to long term. I advise them to stay in and hold onto their shares.</P>
    <P>In the context of the remuneration involved, it is not at all surprising that shareholders have become angry and agitated about what they see as inflated sums being given for poor performance. In a way, however, I feel sorry for Alfie Kane and his people having to face that barrage of criticism. While it may seem that I am looking after one of my own, I wish to compliment the chairman of Eircom, Mr. Ray MacSharry. Whatever the criticisms for failings that may be levelled at Eircom for the way in which it has managed matters since the flotation, I have always had the height of respect and admiration for Ray MacSharry who has a proven track record in business. The fact that he has given his services to that particular business at the invitation of the Government is a tribute to his own civic mindedness. I have every confidence in him. If he was not there, I, probably, would not feel as confident about the future well-being of my shares in Eircom.</P>
    <P>There is a need to create some type of vehicle whereby shareholders can have a say in what is going on, but there is another element to it. Institutional investors who make up the bulk of shareholdings and represent the vast majority of those who have pension plans, and others, rattle the cages whenever it is necessary to do so. It has not happened here to any great extent and, although there was an expectation that it would at the Eircom AGM, it did not. It has happened recently in the United Kingdom, however, in the case of the managing director of Marks and Spencers.</P>
    <P>That company has been going through an extremely difficult patch, so much so that it has circled the wagons. It is closing down its European operations and will concentrate exclusively on the UK market. Its share price has halved in the last two years. The reaction from the board of Marks and Spencers to its relatively new man<Col N="647" /> aging director, Mr. Luc Vandevelde, was not only to increase his salary, but also to propose that he should receive a performance-related bonus of £800,000, this at a time when the share price had fallen from over £6 to £2.20 and when the company was closing its stores left, right and centre. It happened at a time when the managing director's refocusing of the Marks and Spencers in-store brand was failing at such a disastrous rate that it was not even meeting its own low quarterly projections. Yet, the board decided to give Mr. Vandevelde a performance-related bonus on top of the £2 million salary he had already received. What happened? Mr. Vandevelde had to withdraw and voluntarily give up his performance-related bonus within the last two weeks. This was because the City of London decided that enough was enough. The institutional investors rattled the cages, wielded their fists and said that performance-related bonuses should only be given for legitimate reasons.</P>
    <P>In the case of Marks and Spencers, the bonus was totally unjustified and caused a great deal of anger among small shareholders. It was the institutional shareholders, however, who took the initiative. I hope it will be a lesson for institutional shareholders in this country in order that they will wield the stick when they see corporations which are not performing. There are a number of examples that have been outlined during the debate which I will not repeat.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the United States and I take the point he made which was a specific reference to the Kellogg business school and how the criteria for performance-related pay bonuses were arrived at. Interestingly, however, the United States may not be the best example of how to pay corporate bosses because the corporate culture in the United States, and the wider environment in which shareholders operate, is not one of begrudgery or envy of material success. It is the complete opposite. To illustrate the point, an apocryphal story is told of the American who sees one of his fellow citizens driving a Rolls Royce down the street and says: &ldquo;How can I make enough money to buy one of those cars?&rdquo;  An Irishman watching one of his fellow citizens driving a Rolls Royce down O'Connell Street asks: &ldquo;How the hell did he get the money to buy that?&rdquo;  Success is encouraged in the United States, but there is a different culture here.</P>
    <P>Only recently I heard a quote to the effect that in order to be successful in the United States corporate jungle one has to be a failure first. To be a failure in this society is to be branded for life as if one was a common criminal. I sometimes wish that we did have a culture of encouraging and acknowledging success, instead of the old, mean-spirited begrudgery that sometimes raises it head. What immediately springs to mind is the hypocritical reaction from some political quarters to the Taoiseach's proposal for a national sports stadium.</P>
    <P>This is a typical example of mean spirited, <Col N="648" /> nasty begrudgery of the traditional Irish kind where there is a lack of vision on the part of people who do not know how to create a legacy. It is probably part of the corporate culture in which we have grown up. I wish the day would come when the shackles of begrudgery would be removed from our shoulders, success would be acknowledged and encouraged and, if somebody stumbles and fails, he or she would not be branded forever but encouraged to get up again and work in the best interests of society generally.</P>
    <P>Such people will make money in the process. Denis O'Brien is not my favourite person, not because I know the man well but because of his style. However, I admire him for what he has done. He failed several times but now he is a rich man and he is spending some of his money on good causes. Last week I attended a presentation by Mary Lawlor, the former head of the Amnesty International Irish Section, who is now heading up an organisation called Frontline, which aims to protect human rights defenders across the world. Denis O'Brien is the main financier of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many other instances of individuals in corporate Ireland, particularly those among the <i>nouveau riche</i>, who have made money as a result of the economic policies pursued by the Government. However, they are investing some of their wealth for the betterment of the less well off. I would like to see the development of such a society and it is the type of corporate culture that I would encourage. The Minister of State will have no difficulty agreeing with the philosophy. We will always criticise such individuals and have difficulties with the way they operate at corporate level but in general it is good for the country.</P>
    <P>US President Harding in the 1920s was asked what was America about. He replied, &ldquo;The business of America is business.&rdquo;  I would not mind if somebody said the business of Ireland was business because at the end of the day the creation of wealth can only raise the standard of living for everyone. That is similar to many of the issues addressed by Senator Ryan and all of us subscribe to that philosophy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State whose contribution was impressive and I thank Senator Ross for tabling the motion. I am very much an innocent abroad in this area. Senator Dardis was wise enough to declare his interest in the stock market and, while I have no stocks or shares, I subscribe to a pension fund. However, I was horrified to discover that my best interests were not at heart. I was particularly annoyed to find this was the case because while 39% of the workforce comprises women, they are in an invidious position regarding pensions compared to men. Women have an 11% lower pension rating in comparison to men because they rely on spouses and partners frequently to provide pensions in their old age and they have the problem of breaks in service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> How am I supposed to encourage women to become more involved in pension funds when such a carry on, which is outrageous, can take place where the best interests of those who subscribe to pension funds are not put forward by those who are responsible for the money? It is a depressing scenario and I hope the Minister of State will do everything he can to rectify that. However, those who run pension funds can do a great deal more. The trustees of the funds have an onerous task and must carry out an important duty. They must ensure they obtain the best return on the funds they invest, but at the same time they must not take unreasonable risks with the money.</P>
    <P>Many pension fund trustees transfer the money to banks to invest but, as Senator Ross pointed out, frequently the same people are directors of the banks and public companies in which the funds are invested. This is an extraordinary scenario in that the right hand knows only too well what the left hand is doing and perhaps it would be better if there was at least a Chinese wall between them. That does not seem to be happening. The directors of each group are easily supporting the activities of the other group. We must first query the overlap that occurs when pension funds are managed by a bank whose directors are also directors of the companies in which their funds are placed. This is a difficult problem because Ireland is a small country and such overlaps can easily occur.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the almost consanguinity between investment/pension fund managers and those in the companies in which they are investing and the lack of investigation into the high remuneration of some directors and the exorbitant expenses which are claimed in many cases. This is particularly difficult to understand when companies are not doing well.</P>
    <P>I do not have any involvement in such companies financially but at their AGMs the small investors who attend are in a weak position regarding the questions they can ask because the directors hold the proxy votes from the investment fund managers and can say there is no need to answer certain questions or that the remuneration is correct and so on. It is profoundly depressing that many company directors who do not give the answers that are required consider themselves pillars of society. That is laughable as they should set an example to the rest of society regarding how best to deal with the funds for which they have responsibility on behalf of people who are often not very well off.</P>
    <P>As a doctor I have had the unfortunate experience of meeting patients who had invested with brokers and in pension funds which went to the wall and into liquidation. The distress caused to such people through the loss of their life savings was quite incredible. Their concerns must be taken into consideration more often. We forget there are human faces behind money and frequently these people only have a few thousand pounds that is extraordinarily important to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> We have begun to think in terms of hundreds of thousands and millions of pounds and we forget those who may have saved £10,000, £12,000 or £25,000 over their lifetimes. I recall one company which went into liquidation. Most the people who had invested in it were bus company employees who were terribly distressed when their few thousand pounds was lost. This area needs to be examined carefully.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for investment fund managers or bank directors investing in companies in which they do not think the directors are behaving properly commensurate to their remuneration. Until recently approximately 60% of investment funds were invested in Irish equities and gilts. However, domestic investment is now considered to be within the euro zone, in which we all travel nowadays, because if we travel anywhere else we will not be able to afford our tickets home. If it is felt that the directors of Irish companies are paying themselves too much, the old fashioned phrase, &ldquo;Up with this I will not put&rdquo;, should be adopted and the funds should be moved elsewhere because there is no constraint on such movement. The salaries of companies should be carefully inspected and monitored by fund managers and it should be stated clearly why they are moving money.</P>
    <P>The problem, as Senator Ross stated, is not the remuneration of directors but obtaining good value for money. For example, when a company is not doing well, it is ridiculous to pay directors well. What Senator Ryan noted about rolling contracts was important. Even if a person was fired, huge sums of money in severance pay seem to have been given to him. I am jealous that I did not manage to get into one of these situations myself because some people seem to have done extraordinarily well.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris pointed out that there was an old boys network in operation. At the risk of sounding sexist, I wonder if it would be better if the small number of women involved in investment fund management and as directors of major companies increased. I would hope so, but I am not sure it would happen. I note that the Bank of Ireland has on its court of governors a 100% increase in the number of women on the board &ndash; there are now two. It would be good to have an increase in the number of people whose social consciences are focused on the small shareholders about whom I am talking. These are the people who should be influencing the investment funds managers' thoughts when they are deciding where they have to put their investments. Of course they want to get a good return. Of course they cannot take on unsustainable risks, nor should they. However, they must remember that there are people behind the money who give them the power to invest. I congratulate Senator Ross on his having put this motion before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her kind words. I hope that the near unanimity on this evening's issue is the beginning of something big and representative. At the top of public companies, people are doing things that none of us likes very much. If we can do nothing about it, nobody can, because it is the Government that decides whether abuses of this kind should take place and whether they are right or wrong. They are certainly legal, but do we disapprove of them enough to take measures to expose them and remedy the problem? I suggest that we take such measures. The Minister's reply was very welcome. I detected a hint that there is more to come in the future, but that he is not yet sure of what approach to take. In recognising what the Tánaiste has done, we are going down a path that is primarily one of transparency. As Senator O'Toole rightly said, when one has the facts and figures, one decides what to do with them. We now have the facts and figures, thanks to the measures of the Tánaiste, and they make pretty grim reading.</P>
      <P>It was no coincidence that there was an uproar when the Smurfit salaries were revealed. It was no coincidence, simply because they were not revealed before and because the top layer of Irish public companies fought tooth and nail to see that the details were not revealed. Now we know why. It is because they were not performing up to scratch and the shareholders who were paying them felt they were being cheated. As Senator Norris said, it is either their money or the shareholders money. Every penny that goes into the pocket of Michael Smurfit comes from the pockets of the shareholders. I may have a small shareholding in Smurfit's. I do not know if it is declarable as I am not certain if I have it yet. Let us pay the directors only if they deserve it. It is very simple.</P>
      <P>This evening, we heard an interesting view of the role of fund managers, who are in this loop of which I have been speaking. They are part of a loop that pays too much. The Minister was careful to say that he was not going to tackle the problem too radically. I do not blame him for that because the measures I am proposing are very radical and very democratising. The Minister might say they are very impractical. What we are seeing, as stated by Senator O'Toole, is fund managers coming under focus. Who the hell are these people who are looking after billions of pounds of our money? I was upbraided today by the Cathaoirleach for naming people who could not defend themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not by the Acting Chairman but by the Cathaoirleach. I do not know the names of the culprits, the magnificent 17 who <Col N="652" /> manage our money, because they hide. They vote with proxies but never appear in person. They send in forms with 100 million votes on them, but we never know who they are. These are the very same people &ndash; one knows who they represent &ndash; whom one cannot get at to ask them to be accountable for their actions because they move like shadows in the night. As Senator O'Toole said, they underperform the market at every turn. They are unbelievable. They vote against the wishes of those they represent, and when they are representing them in other areas, which is meant to be their professional job, they perform appallingly. They cannot beat the ISEQ index, the Financial Times 100, the Dow Jones or any index known to man, but they are paid vast sums for this. Senator O'Toole asked what their benchmark was, a word very familiar to the Senator. Their benchmark is themselves. It is most extraordinary that they do not measure themselves against markets or indices. They publish tables every quarter, which state who is on top and who is on the bottom. It is like being at school, but there is no pass mark. If there was one, they would fail, these people who are so well paid. They appear in little groups, very close together in terms of coming first to seventeenth. Why is that? It is because they follow one another like sheep. They all invest in the same shares and stocks because they are frightened of being out of line or taking risks. If they did, they might be on top or on the bottom, so they all conspire together silently to invest in the same stocks to come out close together. One year, one is on top, and another year, another. The top becomes the bottom and the bottom becomes the top. It is a joke and they get paid millions of pounds for doing this. At the same time, these clowns vote to keep the directors' salaries high with shareholders' money.</P>
      <P>Pensioners are the most abused group in terms of fund management because they are losing out due to exorbitant fund-management fees. They would do better if they went into tracker funds, as Senator O'Toole said, or if they invested the money themselves. They are also losing because vast amounts of their money are going towards the payment of directors who do not deserve it, and they do not know it. The only real gain that pensioners get, and the only real reason for being in a pension fund, is the tax relief. The fact that pensioners benefit greatly from tax relief means that they do not realise how much they are being ripped off elsewhere. By giving tax relief, the State is camouflaging the fact that pensioners are losing on fund management and costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although today's debate was progressive and useful, I am disappointed that the Minister did not reply to some of the very specific questions I asked. I know he was acting to a brief. He came up with hints of things to come, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the suggestions put forward in the United Kingdom. The Minister and I agreed on the fact that the <Col N="653" /> remuneration committees are fundamental to the problem. The committees, comprising people who pay and agree upon the pay of directors, are filled by stooges and directors who feign to be independent, but are not. They must be filled by ordinary small shareholders whose interests should be looked after. When they come out and say what was discussed we will see pay levels coming down to realistic levels or only being high in cases where shareholders and pensioners are also benefiting.</P>
    <P>I thank the House and all who spoke in what has been a very constructive discussion.</P>

    <Title>Arms Trial Evidence: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to set up a small independent expert group to collect all available evidence relating to the Arms Trial and the events surrounding it, to examine and evaluate such evidence, to put all such evidence into the public domain and to publish its own conclusions on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. The motion I propose is important, balanced and fair, and seeks only to make available in an ordered, structured and unimpeachable way all evidence on the arms crisis of 1969. It seeks to place in the public domain all the factors which led to the crisis as well as its issues, conflicts, contradictions and outcomes. It is not judgmental and its purpose is no more or less than, as far as is possible, to have all the facts placed before us. People could make up their own minds and if it was felt that important questions remained to be answered, a further, more formal inquiry could be established. I am astonished that the Government has tabled an amendment and even more astonished at its nature which is not only narrow and defensive, but also flawed and perverse. I will deal with it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a House of Parliament in the year 2001 we might well be asked the reason we should bother with the arms crisis of 30 years ago. Is it not history and should not sleeping dogs be left to lie? The answer is that the arms crisis is one of the most important events in the life of modern Ireland and raises huge issues, but more than that, we now know what happens when we brush past difficulties under the carpet and fail to face the truth about ourselves. The arms crisis presents such a difficulty and shaped politics for years afterwards. Some of the questions raised by the crisis can be left to historians, but others have come back to haunt the present. Today, we live in a more open, transparent and accountable age and there is an obligation to present the past in as fair, a honest and full a manner as we can. In some ways, the <Col N="654" /> reason we bother with the motion is as simple as that. Many questions arising from the arms crisis need to be answered. The key ones are fairly straightforward.</P>
    <P>Was the arms affair, as the official view has long had it, an attempt to subvert the Government from within, an attempt by a cabal in the Government to defy the authority of the Taoiseach and, in effect, stage a <i>coup d'état</i>? Was it the beginning of a move to stir up sectarian division, destabilise the institutions of State and arm the enemies of the State? Was it such a threat that it took extreme measures to save our public institutions, <i>salus populi suprema lex esto</i>? Was the arms affair about a Government which had temporarily lost control, floundered about caught up in a crisis it was ill-equipped to handle, and which sought to save itself by engaging in damage limitation, including cover-up, suppression and tampering with vital evidence? Was it about a power struggle within Fianna Fáil as many suspected at the time, a struggle to gain control of the biggest party in the State&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which looked as if it was set to remain in government for a very long time? Possibly, it was the Irish version of the Dreyfuss affair where the power of the State was used to target and destroy powerless individuals who were then forced to live out their lives as broken disgraced men. There is no Devil's Island here, but a situation where an all-powerful State covered up and tampered with evidence and engaged in the subversion of justice. Perhaps the arms crisis was a mixture of all of the foregoing.</P>
      <P>These are serious questions which partly shaped the history of the 30 years which followed. They are questions we have a duty to address and answers will be provided. Fine Gael proposes a framework within which we can ask all these questions and perhaps receive some of the answers. Some have called for a judicial tribunal of inquiry, but I do not have to argue the case that it would be too soon, too expensive and too cumbersome and not the appropriate method to investigate these issues. There have also been calls for an Oireachtas committee of inquiry, but my view and that of my party is that such a committee would not be appropriate at this stage as the emotions are still too raw for many and some issues still have a tinge of vindictiveness or vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes the establishment of an expert group as set out in the terms of reference of the motion. Such a group would comprise &ndash; this is a question of detail, not principle &ndash; of a judge or retired judge as chairperson. Judges are used to examining detailed evidence, have a knowledge of the law and are expected to be, as their title implies, judicious in the way they handle matters. An experienced historian should be a member of the group because it is the job <Col N="655" /> of the historian to go through archives, evaluate evidence and come to conclusions based on the evidence alone. The historian is dispassionate, cold and utterly respectful of the evidence. The group should include also a former civil servant, perhaps a former officer of these Houses, who would be aware of the detail of parliamentary procedure and the way in which Government and Parliament work. The group would not have to be limited to three such people and could include other appropriate experts and would obviously need a small number of assistants to help with its work.</P>
    <P>What would the expert group do? The answer is simple and laid out in the terms of the motion. It would collect all the evidence. It would have access to the archive of the Committee of Public Accounts and trawl through all the archives deposited in the National Archives. That in itself is a job for an expert and would require more than hit and miss forays into the archive by individuals. It would trace papers not yet in the National Archives, but which are, almost certainly, in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, Defence and Foreign Affairs and, possibly, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It would ensure, where necessary, the security of those still alive would be protected, invite those with private papers which might be of help to make them available and take statements from those who believe they can add to the information, including members of the then Committee of Public Accounts, former members of the Garda and the Army and those who may have something useful and helpful to say. It would then be its job to put the evidence in order and, if possible, evaluate it. All the evidence would then be placed in the public domain.</P>
    <P>It may well be the case that when that was done we would still have widely differing interpretations of what actually happened. Those with strong and certain views are not always easily moved by evidence, sometimes never. That is life. That is normal, but, at least, there would be a body of evidence upon which conclusions could be drawn. The best definition of history is that it is what the evidence forces us to believe. The process, as I outline it, would, at least, produce as much of the sum total of available evidence as is humanly possible. We can ask for no more.</P>
    <P>That is our proposal. When I made it originally in the House many in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats saw it as an opportunity to view the whole picture in context and in totality, but what we are currently experiencing is a drip by drip treatment of the arms crisis. Each new document becomes a sensation and there is a daily rush to judgment. Old scores are being settled, old sores reopened and hidden agendas played out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> As for the Government amendment, I can only see it as cynical and, in some ways, perverse. It will confine the inquiry to recent documents, but more than that, the examination will be carried out by the Minister's Department and the Attorney General's office, both of which were up to their necks in the events of 1969-70. It will be difficult for such inquiries, however well made, to carry real credibility. They should and must be handled by an outside source. There is no question of impugning the integrity of officials in either office, but in a sceptical world, Departments do not examine themselves. That is a job for an independent outsider. We, simply, have no way of knowing if the inquiries to be carried out will be as full as possible or whether reasons of security or departmental interest will come first. We do not know what files will be excluded or the competence of those who will carry out the inquiries. I am sure the Minister will assure us that the people concerned are of the highest competence, but we will have to take him on his word. In this day and age, that is not good enough. Everything is being done behind closed doors which, again, is not good enough. The exercise lacks all credibility.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister trying to limit matters? Why does he not accede to the request for a full inquiry as most of those involved on all sides of the controversy now say they want? Let his own inquiries go ahead, but enough has emerged to warrant a fuller, more open inquiry. That is all we are asking for.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister and the Government have not responded to the motion in the way in which it is put forward. It is not put forward to score political points. From the very beginning &ndash; I know my colleagues on the far side of the House will agree &ndash; I have approached the matter as dispassionately as possible. My only concern has been to try to be fair to all sides and establish the truth of what happened.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, are approaching this matter in the most helpful and constructive way possible and will press our proposal to a vote tonight. We will oppose the Minister's amendment. I appeal to those on the other side of the House who expressed support for what I proposed at the earlier stages to support us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator Manning's proposal. The motion tabled by Fine Gael is clear, fair and strives definitively to establish the facts without convolution. The scenario that has emerged in recent weeks is not welcome. In 1970 the State was convulsed when the then Leader of Fine Gael, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, went to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, with specific information given to him. He did so because of a fear for the security of the State at the time. Subsequently, a serious debate took place in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Dáil sat through the night, the end result of which was that a num<Col N="657" /> ber of Fianna Fáil Ministers were sacked from office.</P>
      <P>A number of years later a trial took place, known in recent history as the Arms Trial, from which certain conclusions emerged. Matters were laid to rest, although there have been tensions within sections of a particular party, until the documents in question were released under the 30 year rule as a result of which certain individuals have made various allegations. Senator Manning is prudent, right and fair-minded in placing this proposal before the House requesting a full inquiry and a full independent examination of the documentation available by persons with no vested interest and without any direct implication in what happened at the time. He has suggested that a judge, a senior Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a historian and a civil servant be involved in the process. There is no urgency in relation to the way in which it should be done. There is extensive documentation available in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General's office and various archives. It would be a very time consuming job, but in the interest of fair play and keeping the public fully informed, it is important that the exercise proceed.</P>
      <P>At the time of the crisis, various individuals and politicians at the most senior level were involved as well as members of the Garda and the Army. It was a very serious matter and the House was under very tight security. It was not unusual for major marches to arrive outside the gates of Leinster House. Thousands of Provisional IRA supporters were, repeatedly, at the gates. It was a real crisis.</P>
      <P>There must be a full inquiry. It is not adequate for the Minister to undertake an investigation in his Department. If he would listen, it would be appreciated because he is only one cog in the wheel in relation to the entire investigation which should not just be about his Department. It should also be about the Attorney General's office. Sections of the Army and the Garda Síochána would also have to be investigated. That is the reality. All the research would have to be collated in a dispassionate and fair-minded fashion.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that allegations have been made by those involved on either side at the time. It is important to ensure a wrong was not done to persons at the time, that their careers were not damaged irreparably and that they did not become broken people. If a wrong was done, we and the public should know about it. It is, equally, important that those against whom allegations are being made have those matters cleared up and the record put straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the weekend we saw an interview with Captain Kelly. We also saw Deputy Desmond O'Malley being interviewed and counter-claims were made on both sides. Deputy O'Malley, as a member of the Government side, has publicly stated that he would support a full inquiry, not <Col N="658" /> just an inquiry into a particular aspect. For the inquiry to be effective, it will have to be full and range across every aspect, not just one.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Government is extraordinary. Why has it decided to present such a narrow, restrictive amendment to the motion? It is so narrow, it is appalling. It notes the allegations made concerning the preparation of the book of evidence in the Arms Trial, welcomes the inquiry which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is undertaking into the matter and calls on him to make the results public.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform making inquiries into specific elements related to the book of evidence in the Arms Trial? That would not be acceptable. How can the Minister believe that in a democratic State natural justice can be done or seen to be done or have any credibility if the Department of Justice is seen to be investigating itself? Let us be honest. The Minister and I both know, as do the rest of the Members of this House and the general public, that one cannot have a credible investigation when the outfit under investigation is investigating itself.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to arrange with his party to withdraw this amendment and accept the motion as tabled because going down this route will lead to other questions and further inquiries. Ultimately, the Minister will find himself dragged into holding a very detailed inquiry. He would be better off running with it now and getting the full facts and conclusions, rather than proceeding selectively to investigating only part of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to proceed down this route raises many questions. Is it because Fianna Fáil does not want the full facts to be known? Does that party want to point the finger selectively and in certain directions only? Does it want to protect certain people by undertaking such a narrow investigation? What is Fianna Fáil trying to hide? </P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond O'Malley of the Progressive Democrat Party has stated he wants a full inquiry. Has the Minister consulted with the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats on the motion? Has he discussed the details of his proposals within his Department? This is a fundamental matter of democracy relating to the highest levels of the State and how the Taoiseach's office and a number of other Government Departments operated back in 1970. I urge the Government side to take the Fine Gael motion as it stands, accept it in good faith in the interests of natural justice and fair play to all concerned and withdraw its amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the allegations which have been made <Col N="659" /> concerning the preparation of the Book of Evidence in the Arms Trial, welcomes the inquiries which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently undertaking into the matter; and calls on the Minister to make public the results of these inquiries as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take issue with the view expressed by the speakers opposite that our amendment is perverse or cynical. That suggestion is totally over the top.</P>
    <P>I am sure the words used in the motion by my eloquent colleague, Senator Manning, were well intended but let us take the phrase &ldquo;small group&rdquo;. What is meant by that, two, three, four, five, six or more members?</P>
    <P>I also query the notion of an &ldquo;independent group&rdquo;. Who will define independent and who will be included in the group? Will it be politicians, historians, members of the Judiciary? I query the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;expert group&rdquo;. Might I be so bold as to challenge the Fine Gael speakers to define who constitutes an expert?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contempt would have been much mellower if our amendment had not been described as both perverse and cynical, which is very strong language.</P>
      <P>The difficulty here is that if we choose historians or journalists, different members of the group might reach totally different conclusions. If we set up such a group, it is possible to envisage the findings presented to us being supported by a majority of members, for example, three to two in a group of five or four to three in a group of seven. How does one decide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion goes on to call for the expert group &ldquo;to collect all available evidence relating to the Arms Trial&rdquo;. The use of the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; might lead to a retrial of sorts and I ask the <Col N="660" /> Opposition if a retrial by this expert group is envisaged.</P>
    <P>To return to the notion of an independent group, the Judiciary in my view is tasked by the Constitution and its independence from the other arms of the State on matters of law is protected by the Constitution. The facts are that the defendants in the Arms Trial, including the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Luykx, faced trial by judge and jury and all were acquitted by the court of trying to import arms. We must be extremely careful with this issue. To my knowledge, there was no appeal and no judicial inquiry. Consequently, the Arms Trial, as a trial by law under our judicial system, is complete and consigned to history.</P>
    <P>I assume, subject to correction, that all available evidence relating to the Arms Trial was dealt with appropriately by the court at that time. There is a clear duty on all practising lawyers to put all the facts before the court and the jury. The code of ethics of the Bar Council clearly states that this is required practice for all criminal trials.</P>
    <P>Archive evidence now available would appear to indicate that crucial statements were either altered or possibly edited. That would be very worrying were it to transpire as fact. Any editing of any witness statement pertaining to any court, whether it be a District or Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court, would be a grave matter.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Arms Trial severely damaged the reputations of a number of eminent people, including Captain Kelly, Charles J. Haughey and Neil Blaney. The late Neil Blaney went before a district judge to be assessed in a summary fashion. What unfolded was that the judge found insufficient evidence to bring Mr. Blaney to trial and, to use a technical legal term, information was refused. This was the end of the trial as far as Mr. Blaney was concerned. There is a view abroad that Mr. Blaney, Mr. Haughey and others were merely scapegoats in a political event of the time.</P>
    <P>After the words &ldquo;Arms Trial&rdquo;, the motion continues, &ldquo;and the events surrounding it&rdquo;. This again is interesting because the Senators condemn us for moving a very narrow amendment. Looking at the wording of the motion, I conclude that the task of looking at all the events surrounding the Arms Trial would take a huge amount of time. One would necessarily have to look at the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the mid to late 1960s. One would then have to look at the situation the Nationalist community faced prior to the Arms Trial when its members had to take to the streets and fight for their civil rights and against the discrimination imposed on them. One would then inevitably have to look at the rebirth or, more appropriately, the reformation or resurrection of the IRA. I have no doubt that the oppression of the Nationalists in the North in <Col N="661" /> the mid 1960s caused many young men and women to look towards the IRA for protection.</P>
    <P>One would also have to examine the views and stance taken by members of the Social Democratic and Labour Party at that time. People such as Gerry Fitt and Paddy Devlin as well as many other Nationalist figures came to Dublin and sought protection for the Nationalist community in the North. These are all &ldquo;events surrounding&rdquo; the Arms Trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great fear at the time in Northern Ireland that there would be a sort of ethnic cleansing against the Nationalist community. The fear was such that hundreds, indeed thousands, of nationalists were prepared to flee and seek refuge in the Republic.</P>
      <P>One might also examine the use of the phrase by Jack Lynch during the period in question that &ldquo;We will not stand idly by.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to place on record that many people's reputations were severely damaged as a result of the Arms Trial. Captain James Kelly lost his position in the Army, suffered financially and was seen as a social outcast. I have sympathy with the view&mdash;</P>

Senator Gibbons will contribute later and I am sure he will elaborate his views on this matter. I have great sympathy with him and his family in regard to the innuendo and allegations which have arisen in respect of his late father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for me to write anyone's political epitaph this evening and I have no intention of doing so. However, I oppose the motion and support what the Minister is proposing to do. Inquiries are currently being carried out which the Minister instigated immediately after this issue became public. When those inquiries are complete and when the Minister has reported to the Oireachtas and made the findings of those inquiries public, we can then, perhaps, engage in a further consideration of this matter. I do not believe we <Col N="662" /> should establish a small independent group to consider this complex matter. Engaging in consideration of all the events which took place during the period in question would be a task of astronomical proportions. I request that the amendment be seen for what it is and that the Minister be allowed to do his job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to this motion and to share with the House some preliminary thoughts on the issues raised by the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcasts on RTÉ relating to the Arms Trial. At the outset I might note that these issues arise from an analysis of documents released by my Department, with others, at the end of last year under the Archives Act.</P>
      <P>No matter what the outcome of the current controversy, I believe the decision to release the documents was correct. The Archives Act effectively allows for a certain degree of subjective discretion in decisions on the release of documents, but it is right, and in the spirit of the Act, for such decisions to be informed by a commitment to openness and transparency to the greatest possible extent. Whatever the short-term difficulties that might be caused by the release of documents in cases of this nature, they are far outweighed by the insight which such records give us into our past.</P>
      <P>The Arms Trial and the controversies surrounding it are an important part of that past, occurring as they did against a backdrop of civil disturbance in the North on an unparalleled scale. While we are now, thankfully, in a period of genuine hope where, more and more, peace is being embraced and violence rejected, it is nevertheless the case that the events of 30 years ago still reverberate today. Any fresh insights into the Arms Trial, therefore, are bound to be not just of historical significance, but of contemporary interest. It is not surprising that the rolling programme of release of Government papers under the 30 year rule, having reached an era of such particular significance, should have attracted considerable interest and, no doubt, will continue to do so in the coming years. This is all the more so when it is inevitable, in some cases, that the release of papers, instead of explaining events, raises new questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such is the case with the analysis by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; of papers relating to the Arms Trial. The issues raised by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, as I understand them, derive from a particular interpretation of the released documentation and focus on differences between an original statement by Colonel Hefferon, the former director of military intelli<Col N="663" /> gence, and the version of his statement which was included in the book of evidence. The allegation, as I understand it, is that Colonel Hefferon's original statement was altered prior to inclusion in the book of evidence so as to remove from it references to the alleged knowledge of the then Minister for Defence &ndash; which he always denied &ndash; of the proposed importation of arms because, it is argued, such references were seen as potentially damaging to the prosecution and helpful to the defence, at least in respect of some of the defendants.</P>
    <P>This allegation was again discussed on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night and has more generally been the subject of much comment in the media, with suggestions that the book of evidence was compiled in an unusual way and even some claims made that the statement in question must have been altered in the Department of Justice. Of course, Colonel Hefferon proceeded to give direct evidence in the Arms Trial on the subject matter removed from his statement, but it is argued that this makes no real difference and that it is no answer to an allegation of an attempt to suppress evidence that in the end it was unsuccessful. Having said that, it seems a matter of common sense that as the book of evidence was going to be available to the defence, and Colonel Hefferon could have been made aware of its contents, the fact that his original statement differed from that in the book of evidence was liable at any time to come into the public domain, and presumably those preparing the book of evidence would have been conscious of this.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that the allegations which have been made &ndash; I stress that we are talking about allegations which arise from a particular interpretation of certain documentation &ndash; are serious and cannot be ignored. As the House may be aware, I undertook, when this matter was raised in Dáil Éireann shortly after the first &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, to make inquiries into the matter and report back to the Dáil as soon as possible. I am currently in the course of making those inquiries. I am having the papers in my Department double-checked, and I have been in contact with the Garda Síochána and the Attorney General to see whether they may have information on what happened. I hope to be in a position to report within the next two to three weeks or so.</P>
    <P>The House will, I am sure, appreciate that there are particular difficulties in inquiring into a matter of this kind. The issues surrounding the Arms Trial were and remain fiercely contested by those involved. We are talking of events of 30 years ago and in circumstances where some of the main participants are no longer with us, where documentation may be incomplete and where issues of legal privilege and client confidentiality may arise. I say this not as an excuse not to inquire into the matter or as an alibi for any fail<Col N="664" /> ure to find answers, but simply to be realistic with the House on the prospect of conclusively determining to the satisfaction of all concerned what happened and why it happened.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will do whatever I can to find answers to the questions which were raised in the original &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and that I have an open mind on whether any further inquiries might be needed. It would be wise, however, for judgment to be reserved until we obtain a clearer understanding of what happened. I appreciate it is thought by some that the documentation which has been released reveals an occurrence which is inherently incapable of innocent explanation and that the only questions needing answers relate to the identity and motivation of those who, on this understanding, sought to perpetrate a miscarriage of justice. However, I would counsel extreme caution. I do not believe that our proper understanding of what happened 30 years ago will be helped by a rush to premature conclusions. What is needed is calm analysis and cool judgment. We should remember, in particular, that the good name and reputation of individuals is at stake and that some of these individuals are no longer here to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls for the setting up of a small independent expert group to collect all available evidence relating to the Arms Trial and the events surrounding it, to examine and evaluate such evidence, to put all such evidence into the public domain and to publish its conclusions on the issues involved. I understand the desire on the part of Senators to inquire into the allegations which have been made, but I believe that the motion is, at this stage, premature. In saying that, I am not seeking to avoid the making of inquiries which may need to be made. Indeed, I have accepted that the allegations need to be examined and I have undertaken to make what inquiries I can and to report on the results of those inquiries. I suggest to the House, therefore, that it would be reasonable to await the results of my inquiries before coming to any definitive conclusion as to the need for a more formal investigation.</P>
    <P>I cannot guarantee that my inquiries will find answers to all the questions raised and it may be that the Senators proposing this motion will remain minded to call for the establishment of an expert group to examine the matter. I do not ask Senators, therefore, to accept in advance that my inquiries will result in a complete answer to their questions. As I am already undertaking inquiries into the matter, it would make sense to await my report which I expect to complete within the next two to three weeks. The more information we have available to us, the better placed we will be to come to a determination as to whether further action may be necessary and what form it might take. It is best for me to complete this initial inquiry to see whether any clarifying or explanatory information may be available and to enable <Col N="665" /> all of us to come as far as possible to an informed conclusion on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that even if it there were to be a consensus on the need for a further inquiry into the matter, there would remain the question of the nature and scope of that inquiry. The motion calls for such an inquiry to be carried out by a small independent expert group. I express no opinion on that at this stage, but there may be those who, if there were to be an inquiry, would question the subjectivity of such concepts as independent and expert and there may be those who would, particularly if their good name and reputation were at stake, argue that any inquiry should provide them with an opportunity to be represented and to test any evidence obtained. The protection of the reputation of people who have, sadly, died and are therefore unable to defend themselves could also be an issue.</P>
    <P>There might also be differences of opinion on the scope of any such inquiry. The House will be aware that already there are conflicting views on this even among those affected who agree on the principle of an inquiry, with one argument being made that any inquiry should be limited to the narrow although extremely important point of the apparent alteration of a witness statement, and another argument being made that individual aspects of the Arms Trial can only be understood in context and that therefore any inquiry should be comprehensive. I make no comment at this stage on the merits of these different positions or on the interests underlying them, but it is necessary to recognise that this would be an issue to be addressed in the event of an inquiry being held.</P>
    <P>It would be misleading, however, if I did not say that the questions of whether there should be a further inquiry and what form it should take are not straightforward. One issue is the extent to which an expert group or some other form of inquiry would have access to records which were deemed not to be releasable in accordance with the criteria set out in the Archives Act. Is it the case that different public policy considerations should apply to matters such as the Arms Trial? There is also the related point that if papers contain defamatory references to people, making them available to a group of experts does not mean that a possible action for defamation does not arise. I understand from reports in the media that one of the defendants in the Arms Trial has indicated that he is considering suing the State in relation to some documents already released to the National Archives and we must be mindful of this issue in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>We must also be conscious of the danger that the Oireachtas or the Government might be seen as in some way trying to sponsor some agreed version of the State's history. It can be argued that the papers which are releasable under the National Archives policy set out by the Oireachtas in legislation are freely available in <Col N="666" /> the National Archives and it is a matter for historians, journalists and everyone else who has an interest in the matter to form their own judgment. I make these points not to obstruct in any way the taking forward of this matter &ndash; I have an open mind about that &ndash; but to point out to the House that the matter is not without some difficulty. Given the length of time which has elapsed and the fact that a number of people involved can no longer present their version of events, it may prove ultimately to be the case that history alone will be in a position to judge these matters.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House would not only seek to decide now the question of holding an inquiry in advance of hearing the results of the inquiries which I have under way, but would seek to decide the form of that inquiry and its scope. I urge Senators to accept that it would be premature to decide all these issues today. Staying their hand would not in any way prejudice their view if it remains their view upon considering my report that some form of expert group should be set up to inquire into this matter. I have an open mind on the matter, but today is not the day to determine these issues. I ask Senators to join me in recognising this and to accept the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have ever been as confused in this House. I do not know what is going on. When Senator Manning first proposed this motion a week or two ago, I thought there was all-party agreement that it was a good idea and this was how we would proceed. I thought the Progressive Democrats were keen about it and that Deputy O'Malley had said this was the road he would favour. I respect the Minister for his speech and he has tried to put sense on it. I could not understand the logic of Senator O'Donovan's argument and I usually find him a model of clarity. What was small and independent? He dragged Brendan Behan in as an expert witness. It was extraordinary. I do not know what is going on.</P>
      <P>As politicians, we constantly blame the media for our woes, yet we are about to jump up and down to the questions raised by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; will ask one question and we must respond with the answer. Then it will ask another question and the following week the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to provide another answer. I cannot understand what is going on. Other members of the media will do the same. I was astonished and sympathetic the other night when a jury person gave his views on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; about what happened 30 years ago. He was annoyed at the suggestion by Garret FitzGerald that the jury had been intimidated. This is becoming like the O. J. Simpson trial. Surely we need to get more sense? We have no one but ourselves to blame when we say the media control events if we continue in this way. I am astonished at what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> It would be better if we tried to keep this at one remove from politicians. With respect to the Minister, who is an honourable man, this will be described as a political investigation of events within his Department. Serious questions are being asked and they impinge on the reputations of many people, some of whom are still alive, such as gardaí, Army officers, politicians and businessmen. If they are not alive, their children, spouses or others connected with them are still alive. I must declare an interest in that one of my uncles was the bank manager in Baggot Street where the money was deposited and from where it was withdrawn and sent to goodness knows where. He did not speak about it and he was not brought before the Arms Trial, but I look with some concern at the Dáil committee papers which must come out.</P>
    <P>We are setting ourselves a trap by going down this road tonight. I am astonished the Progressive Democrats are agreeing to it. I urge it to exercise caution in this area because one small bit will be investigated and then there will be another question and we must jump again. That is what we are doing. This is an extraordinary state of affairs. This motion was tabled in good faith. I cannot see any political advantage for Fine Gael. It seems the usual type of academic question which Senator Manning, as an academic, is inclined to frame. If he was told the committee could not sit for six weeks or two months, that would be all right. However, let us not jump over hoops at the beck and call of the media because that is the way we are going now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate provides to address some of the points raised over the past three weeks following the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme screened on 10 April. I speak tonight in defence of my late father, Jim Gibbons, whose name and reputation have been severely maligned in recent television programmes concerning his role in the arms crisis and the Arms Trial of the early 1970s and who is now dead and is not in a position to defend himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim Gibbons was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1957 and he represented the people of Carlow-Kilkenny for 28 years. He served as Parliamentary Secretary from 1965 to 1969 before being appointed Minister for Defence. He also served as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries from 1970 to 1973 and again from 1977 to 1979. During the period 1973 to 1976 he served as a member of the European Parliament. He was a member of Kilkenny County Council from 1954 to 1965. Throughout his career in public life my father served the people of Carlow-Kilkenny and the people of this country to the best of his ability and with the highest standards of honesty and integrity. He applied his strict personal morality <Col N="668" /> to all facets of his public life. I am happy and proud to stand over his record of public service.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to get into the detail of that fraught period in our recent history, I would like to highlight the impact the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and the subsequent media coverage had on my mother and the other members of my family over recent weeks. By highlighting and devoting itself entirely to one side of a very complex and critical period in Irish history, the result was effectively the character assassination of Jim Gibbons.</P>
    <P>I take particular issue with one element of last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and that is the response of an alleged former juror at the Arms Trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the highly inappropriate practice of interviewing a juror, my family and I were utterly appalled that RTÉ television would use written quotations from an anonymous person to level a scurrilous charge of perjury against my father. One would expect a certain standard of programming from the national broadcaster. What was delivered on last night's programme goes beyond every standard we might have anticipated. The fact that this anonymous person was given virtually <i>carte blanche</i> to blacken my father's name, without any contact or right of reply, merely reinforces my belief that the programme is portraying a one-sided perspective on this very serious issue.</P>
      <P>The focus of this sometimes frenzied debate to date has centred on the statement of one witness and the alteration to this statement. I can only assume that there was more than one statement in the book of evidence and that the contents of all other statements may present a different view from those expressed by Colonel Hefferon. They should be afforded the same attention. It is worthy of mention that archival material from military intelligence files, released under the 30-year rule, demonstrates a very different view of the events surrounding the period 1969-70. These were reported in both <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> in early January this year. I suggest to anybody who is genuinely interested in the truth that these files warrant further attention. Anybody wishing to get to the truth about the events surrounding the arms crisis in 1970 should be open-minded enough to examine all the facts relating to this period. This would represent a balanced approach in contrast to focusing on just one witness statement and the view of an anonymous juror. Consequently, I would wholeheartedly welcome a full investigation into all relevant documents relating to this period of our history. I have no doubt that any such inquiry would vindicate my total belief that Jim Gibbons did not perjure himself in 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> In the interests of natural justice and out of respect for those people who can no longer defend their reputations, the serious issues relating to those turbulent times should be lifted out of the political arena and indeed outside the remit of television trial and speculation. Instead, the matters should be put into the hands of an independent panel of experts who can assess all documentation and objectively adjudicate and report on their findings. We owe it both to the living and the dead to establish the full truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and support the motion in the name of my colleague, Senator Manning, who as a historian is a calm and dispassionate observer. I do not understand why we are dividing over this. I welcome the contribution of Senator Gibbons, a man for whom I have great time, and I heartily concur with what he said.</P>
      <P>We can marry these two matters. As Senator Gibbons said, all the facts need to be examined and we owe that to the living and the dead. Of course natural justice requirements must prevail. They are serious issues. Senator Gibbons said that we need to take these matters outside the political arena entirely and this is in line with Senator Manning's motion. They must be objectively adjudicated on.</P>
      <P>I also welcome much of what the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said. I take him at his word in his commitment to openness and transparency; perhaps I did not like his addition of &ldquo;to the greatest possible extent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In his speech he said: &ldquo;Whatever the short-term difficulties that might be caused by the release of documents in cases of this nature, they are far outweighed by the insight which such records give us into our past.&rdquo;  However, as Senator Gibbons said, we must tread carefully and we must be respectful. That is our intention &ndash; I do not believe Senator Manning has anything else on his mind; I certainly have not. I am not here to quibble or fight with anyone on either side of the House. I agree totally with what Senator Gibbons said about getting this out of the political arena and that is what this motion calls for. I look forward to hearing Senator Manning further when he responds.</P>
      <P>In accepting this motion, the Government would decide whom to appoint to the expert group. Senator Manning has in mind an eminent High Court judge or a former judge, a historian and a former officer of these Houses. All sides could readily agree to the composition of such a group. All we want is to get at the truth in a balanced and fair way. There is a report from the Committee of Public Accounts from the period between 1971 and 1973 that remains under wraps and despite the 30-year rule, there are other papers which would be available to an independent group if it were set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, many new questions have <Col N="670" /> been raised. I agree with him that we must not rush to premature judgment, and that is consistent with this motion. I welcome the Minister's own inquiries within his Department and the release of such information which may come from that. As Senator Gibbons said, the proper thing to do with that information would be to keep it outside the political arena and place it in the hands of an independent-minded group that would give its objective adjudication.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that his inquiries would be completed within a very short period. If the House were to pass this motion, we would be respecting the dead, we would be very much complying with Senator Gibbons's intentions as I understood them and we could all be happy. It need not become operational until after the Minister's extra information is available because it will take some time to assemble a group and a back-up group. We can have a meeting of minds on this issue. We do not have to press an amendment.</P>
    <P>We should respect what Senator Gibbons said. Opinion columns and editorials have put forward many differing views since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. Readers may believe Mr. Vincent Browne, Mr. Ryle Dwyer or Mr. Frank McNally, depending on which newspaper they read. These commentators have their biases. Without showing disrespect to those writers, we do not necessarily want to believe any of them. We just want to get at the facts and the truth, and that can only be had by making all relevant information available to a group which can undertake a proper, objective analysis of the matter.</P>
    <P>We should be big enough to accept the truth but it is important to set about finding that truth, whatever it may be. If we are to give this matter credibility we must accept this motion, although I accept that the Government will have a big hand in setting up an inquiry. The Minister mentioned transparency, openness and the desire to find the truth. I take him at his word. Nobody wants to play games with this matter, it is far too important. I was struck by the contribution of Senator Gibbons, and taking that contribution with those of Senator Manning and the Minister, I believe it is possible to find a formula incorporating the motion. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment as outlined by Senator O'Donovan. Shortly before the Easter recess the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated to the House that he would be making inquiries into the claims raised on the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast relating to the Arms Trial and that he would report back to the House as soon as possible &ndash; I understand the Minister hopes to be in a position to report back in two to three weeks. Regarding the establishment of a more formal inquiry, I know that various suggestions have been made but we should keep an open mind and reserve judgment until <Col N="671" /> we hear back from the Minister. As Senator Coghlan said, there should be a meeting of minds. The Minister has put an inquiry in place and wishes people to reserve judgment until the results of this are made available to the House. If necessary, a further investigation by an expert group or a judicial inquiry could take place following the report. There is little sense in having another inquiry running parallel while the Minister has not finished his investigation.</P>
      <P>Many names have been mentioned in relation to the Arms Trial, both in the House today and in the course of the trial. Each of these people served the country well in their various ways, and served with dignity. We should accept the unique events of the time and the unique situation that different people found themselves in and had to react to. Many against whom allegations have been made are no longer alive. The period of the trial was a difficult time for the members involved and their families, and we should be sensitive to that. It is in everybody's interest that we establish the truth. When the Minister brings the results of his current inquiry to the House he will then consider what action is necessary. It is sensible to abide by his wishes.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to one document and one piece of evidence, but it is wrong to draw assumptions from that without having access to all evidence and all documents. Many members are in agreement on this. Descriptions such as &ldquo;cynical&rdquo; and &ldquo;perverse&rdquo; have been used to describe the amendment before the House. I do not agree with that. Such an interpretation was never our intention. We could take issue with the wording from the other side of the House. When Senator O'Donovan mentioned an expert group, Senator Coghlan said that different historians may hold different views. A huge range of opinions is not what we want. We want to get to the truth.</P>
      <P>Reference has also been made to the independence, the competence, the honesty and the integrity of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials.</P>

      <P>I draw the inference that if we have such an opinion of the Department being involved in that fashion at that time, it will be difficult to agree now as to its independence in this matter, and that is regrettable. Not alone are we casting aspersions on the Minister who sits in that important office today and his officials, but also on many who have served in that Depart<Col N="672" /> ment in the past. There have been Ministers from all sides of the House who have served in the Department of Justice with their officials. I have the fullest confidence in the Department and in the current Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. He will go down in history for the amount of legislation he has introduced over the past four years for the betterment of every citizen. We must weigh up whether we should wait for the Minister and his officials to report or take another course. I believe the Minister will act honestly to bring us the results we require. I do not believe we will be finished with this matter when the Minster brings in the results. We may have to go much further. The dispute here is about what way we go about this and I believe the amendment is the correct way.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Noonan, suggested on RTÉ's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning that, &ldquo;following the receipt of a report on the release of these papers from the Clerk of the Dáil, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could inquire into the broader issue of the arms crisis.&rdquo;  As far as I am aware, the only issue the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will decide or inquire into, on receipt of the Clerk's report, will be whether the papers are to be made public. I expect this to be ready in two to three weeks' time.</P>
      <P>Matters of evidence, law and justice must be examined by the Judiciary. When we speak of the independence of an inquiry, the Judiciary is the only group which can claim to have this quality of independence, as recognised in the Constitution. I consider the amendment put down by Senator Cassidy as a reasonable response. Serious allegations have been made concerning the preparation of the book of evidence in the Arms Trial and I welcome the inquiry which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is currently undertaking. I urge the Minister to consider carefully all aspects of such allegations and, when ready, to publish the results of such inquiries immediately. I have confidence in the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not see how the Government can set up an expert group as outlined in the Fine Gael motion and I have outlined my difficulties with the phrasing of that motion. I respectfully suggest that my colleagues revisit this entire saga once the Minister has concluded his inquiry and it is made public. A full judicial inquiry may be warranted and I have no difficulty with that. I would welcome it, as would Members from all sides of the House. I commend the amendment and ask Members to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator John Cregan's contribution suggested some movement towards a common position. I hope this may be the case. He seemed to indicate that once the Minister receives the information being sought, it may well be proper to appoint the type of committee of inquiry sug<Col N="673" /> gested by Senator Manning. I do not see any conflict between these two positions. Senator Manning has made a very convincing case for an inquiry which would include professional historians.</P>
      <P>This was a very turbulent period in Irish politics. I am not surprised that people are confused about it now because it was extremely confusing at the time. The State was very parlous and emotions ran high. People came down from Northern Ireland claiming they were under great threat and it appeared from newsreels that this was the case. People were being attacked and appeals were made for support. Some sections of the Government of the day did not seem to respond in a very responsible fashion to such requests and certain questions must be answered.</P>
      <P>It is important to ascertain whether the statement was changed. It seems clear that it was. We must elicit on whose authority it was changed and whether the change affected the outcome of the case. Mr. Patrick McEntee, senior counsel, a distinguished legal authority, seems to feel it did. Was the evidence admissible in any case? Deputy O'Malley dismissed it as hearsay and was not concerned about it because it would not have been admissible. I am not a legal authority and do not know the answers to these questions. Historians and legal experts could make a determination on the facts on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Vincent Browne posed a further series of questions in this morning's newspaper which also require answers, particularly in light of the fact that Deputy O'Malley has a very strong reputation as an honourable, decent and conscientious man. It appears that he did attend a secret meeting with Mr. Haughey and approached the then Secretary of the Department, Mr. Peter Berry. We must seek an explanation. In some way, I understand how the confusion could have arisen. The letter reproduced photographically in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicates that it was a formulaic response produced <i>en masse</i>. The then Minister may well have signed a sheaf of these formulaic letters stating that a particular course of action was necessary and that may account for his lack of memory in the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan received something of a handbagging from my colleague and while I sympathise with him to some extent, he deserved it. The quotation he desperately attempted to recall was not from Brendan Behan, but from Seán O'Casey. His mistake illustrates the deficiencies of memory over a very short period. We are talking here about something that happened 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very moved by the manner in which Senator Gibbons manfully defended his father. In 1970, I, among others, was under the impression that Mr. Gibbons, like Deputy O'Malley, was a man of very high personal standards of morality and public behaviour. This view has been challenged and it must be very difficult for the Gib<Col N="674" /> bons family to hear the allegations that had Colonel Hefferon's evidence been available, Mr. Gibbons would have been in the dock.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the proposed establishment of a panel which would include historians to make determinations on this matter and want to place on record my reasons for doing so as they are relevant to this case. I was approached by a constituent of mine who, as a historian, has concerns about the non-application by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the standards of practice required of it under the National Archives Act in circumstances which bear some relation to this matter, although they relate to the period 1923 to 1962. I have been advised that there is a huge lacuna in the Department which also relates to a period in which Mr. Berry was Department Secretary:</P>
    <P>Quantification based on evidence of lacunae within sequence has revealed that in the largest of the Justice 8 sub-classes &ndash; S, for every file deposited with the National Archives from the period 1923 to 1962, a further 8.62 files are unaccounted for.</P>
    <P>This is a worrying statistic and we need to know the reason these files are not available. Does it arise from a lack of expertise or manpower?</P>
    <P>My correspondent obtained some information from the Department confirming that it has a large accumulation of unsorted material in its cellar in St. Stephen's Green. She states:</P>
    <P>It would appear that no systematic attempt has been made to set this material in order since the enactment of the National Archives Act in 1986. Under the terms of the Act, deposits must be accompanied by a schedule of contents from the depositee. One might conclude, therefore, that for whatever reason, a start has yet to be made on sorting and preparing schedules relating to the contents of this cellar.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that the Department is unaware of its obligations under the National Archives Act, the very Act which has led to the current debate? If so, my correspondent feels that it would be timely and entirely appropriate to make it aware of its obligations and ensure they are carried out without further delay. She further states that the work undertaken by the Department's six certification officers clearly needs to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>From 1932 to 1948, my correspondent was researching a book on the history of the Communist Party of Ireland, hence her interest in the material. She states:</P>
    <P>There was systematic leakage of either S file material dealing with Communists and other left-wing activists to the Catholic gutter press or leakage of duplicate reports to those in the Department's S sequence held in files designated as CS files from 1923 to 1939 and, thereafter, as 3C files held in Garda headquarters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> A further matter of extreme concern is the use to which these files may have been put by the Department Secretary. Few of those deposited have been deposited in their original covers and in no case where a file was inserted into a new cover prior to deposit has the original cover been deposited with the National Archives. The significance of this failure to deposit the original covers is two-fold. First, the Department disregarded the instructions of the National Archives in the matter and, second, the recto of each front cover contained a record of Registry transactions relating to the file in question. In other words, the record of usage has either been inadvertently or deliberately suppressed.</P>
    <P>A single instance will serve to illustrate the possible implications of deliberate suppression. James Larkin Jnr was Chairman of the Communist Party of Ireland from 1933 to 1938. He was elected to the Dáil in 1943 and for many years was involved in the running of the Workers Union of Ireland, subsequently FWUI and now subsumed, together with the ITGWU, into SIPTU. It is alleged that the Department Secretary may have used material within the keeping of his Department to exert improper leverage on the WUI. Could this be proven, it would be either an authorised or unauthorised action or sequence of actions on the part of a senior civil servant, the consequences of which were, at the very least, an attempt to hamper and impede the work of the WUI in defending its members' rights and interests. If there was no such wrongdoing on the Department's part, it is in its interest to comply fully with its obligations under the National Archives Act. If such wrongdoing occurred, a full acknowledgement and apology are in order at the very least. It seems there is little in the form of legal redress open to the heirs and assignees of James Larkin Snr and Jnr but, in default of such, an acknowledgement and apology would constitute semi-formal redress and closure.</P>
    <P>This case is directly analogous to the current one in regard to the suppression of historical files and involves a person at the centre of the controversy. This distinguished historian's analysis of missing files in the Department at a time when a key figure involved in the arms case also worked in the Department could move the focus of the question from accusations against the late Mr. Gibbons to accusations in another quarter. In any case, it is absolutely imperative that the Department is required to honour its obligations under the National Archives Act.</P>

      <P>What we saw last night on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTÉ and what we saw previously on 10 April was neither balanced nor fair, it was sensationalist and not good journalism. I believe the whole truth is some way <Col N="676" /> away from what was portrayed on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and that the issue of the particular interpretation of released documents must be seen in a much wider context, that is, the momentous events taking place in the Republic and Northern Ireland at that time.</P>
      <P>Concentration on one document gives a very distorted view. I am of the view &ndash; like Senator Norris, I am not a lawyer &ndash; that the exclusion of hearsay and personal opinions would have been normal in the preparation of the book of evidence. However much I might wish to do so, I do not want to get into the details of these events and Senator Manning has also resisted that temptation. I wish to quote an article by way of illustration that, if one takes particular aspects, it is possible to put any interpretation on them. The article by Brendan Ó Cathaoir in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 and 2 January 2001 states that when Colonel Delaney took over as Director of Military Intelligence on 10 April 1970 he commented as follows:</P>
      <P>I inquired from Col Hefferon on numerous occasions as to what Capt Kelly was doing. I got the reply that Capt Kelly was a valuable staff officer, and because of his connections in Northern Ireland he would be quite valuable in an emergency. He never informed me as to Capt Kelly's particular activities.</P>
      <P>The article goes on to read:</P>
      <P>Colonel Delaney decided &ldquo;that I could not have as a personal staff officer, nor could I tolerate in the Intelligence Section, the presence of an officer whom I had never met, who did not report to me, or about whose activities I knew nothing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into detail other than to use this article as an illustration of what it is possible to take from selective quotations, which would rebut some of the material seen on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. While not going into the details, I believe it is obvious to everyone that the Arms Trial case was simply the epilogue of the whole arms crisis and that two Ministers were fired in advance of that trial and another resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Manning, at the time I was not very long out of University College Dublin or very long actively involved in politics. However, I vividly recall the turmoil, anxiety and virtual hysteria of the time. The Minister referred in his speech to the context of the civil disturbance in the North, which was on an unparalleled scale. It is fair to say that was the most serious shock to the constitutional and political life of the Irish State since its foundation, notwithstanding the Emergency when there was at least a national approach. Furthermore, it was not a case of subversives trying to topple the lawfully elected Government of the State, this was being done from within the Government. I am confident there was no Cabinet decision or conspiracy to import arms, a view which I am sure will be vindi<Col N="677" /> cated following the Minister's inquiries or any subsequent inquiries that might take place.</P>
    <P>The day Senator Manning proposed on the Order of Business the establishment of an expert group of historians, I accepted that the idea had some merit. I accept also that he has been dispassionate in what he subsequently said. However, it is reasonable to avail of the outcome of the Minister's inquiries, even though I have some reservations about the limited focus of the Government amendment on the single issue of the preparation of the book of evidence. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is a truthful and fair minded-man and I am prepared to accept the assurances he gave to this House. I note he said he has an open mind of what subsequent action should be taken. Equally, Senator Manning's motion is very widely drawn. I wonder about the degree to which it is extended because it talks about events surrounding the Arms Trial. I hope when the Minister's report goes to the Government and the Dáil whatever information he and any other agency involved in the inquiry brings forward will be put in the public domain.</P>
    <P>There has been sufficient rushing to judgment on the role of those involved in the Arms Trial. I believe these people acted honourably and patriotically and I am prepared to await the outcome of the Minister's investigations before deciding whether we go on from there. A period of calm, so markedly absent from some contributions outside this House, would be of enormous benefit and is what is needed. The matter of independent people adjudicating on these issues is problematic. I wonder how in these circumstances anyone can have an independent view because everyone's view, no matter how impartial, is coloured.</P>
    <P>I strongly support what Senator Gibbons said in relation to the use of anonymous quotations from a juror on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night. He adequately covered the issue and I do not wish to say any more on the matter other than to endorse what he said. I wish to refer to libelling of the dead, which, under our law, seems to take place with impunity. This is becoming an increasing feature which I would describe as &ldquo;tabloidism&rdquo;, where the dead's reputation is up for grabs and there is no one to speak on their behalf. Fortunately, in the case of Jim Gibbons, his son is here to speak on his behalf, which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be no effort to further politicise this issue &ndash; incidentally, I am not accusing Senator Manning of doing so. I believe the central figures of that time, whether the Taoiseach of the day, Jack Lynch, or all the others, will be vindicated with time, as they have been in the past. I wonder what the former Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, Liam Cosgrave, would think about some of these events. As I said, it is not my wish to politicise the issue. The facts speak for themselves and the interpretation of those facts will be very difficult irrespective of how independent or open-minded people are in considering <Col N="678" /> the facts. I am unshakeable in my view that Deputy O'Malley, Jim Gibbons and Jack Lynch were correct in everything they did and that they behaved properly, patriotically and honourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the unusual position of regarding a member of both the protagonists' families, Captain Kelly and the late Jim Gibbons, as friends of mine. In different circumstances I have heard both of them say exactly what was put on the record here by Senator Gibbons and what was said about Captain Kelly, and one absolutely contradicts the other. I have no reason to doubt the veracity or sincerity of the two people, but it is strange that two people should defend their parents with such vigour, as one would expect, and end up saying that two entirely conflicting stories are true. That is the basic argument. I have no desire or wish for nor will I pursue in any way a political agenda.</P>
      <P>I have rarely agreed with Deputy O'Malley about anything, but I have never had any doubt about his integrity or courage. I often thought that he was unnecessarily courageous and stubborn, but they are legitimate actions. I do not believe and would not suggest that he would deliberately and knowingly mislead anybody.</P>
      <P>It is terrifying that 30 years is so short. It is important, therefore, that matters released to the archives are handled with a degree of professional responsibility. I am beginning to reach the conclusion that no professional would take a single document from the archives and construct a case on it alone. I remember the debate on the legislation relating to the National Archives when many others and I argued with the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, that 30 years was too long. In the context of this matter, however, it does not appear particularly long. In common with other Members, I remember precisely where I was &ndash; in a flat on Lower Rathmines Road &ndash; when the newspapers were delayed because they were announcing the sacking of two members of the Government and the resignation of a third.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this matter came into the public domain as it did. Quoting an anonymous juror is not upholding the best standards of investigative journalism. I also agree with Senator Dardis that it is less than courageous investigative journalism to turn on the dead. It is not the stuff of serious journalism. A person who was an occasional acquaintance and became a good friend of mine was the late Stephen Hilliard. He was libelled after he died by <i>Phoenix </i>magazine. He was a fine and courageous Church of Ireland priest with a wonderful record. The magazine managed to put together a concoction of stories about him and his widow attempted to sue. The judge said that it was a disgusting story, but, unfortunately, nothing could be done because he was dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We end up depending on the sense of responsibility of journalism in such cases. I do not suggest <Col N="679" /> that the matters in the archives should have been left there and not discussed. There is a case, however, for somebody who does such work to think it through and consider whether the fact that a person is dead means the standards that normally would be applied can be set aside because one knows that one cannot be sued. Does it mean that one does not need to have the same sense of balance and responsibility that one would have normally? This is a question about journalism and the media. I am certain that if some of the people involved in this matter were alive, there would have been a huge second thought about doing some of the story because of the possibility of legal action.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have my doubts about the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a detached body conducting even a preliminary investigation. It is a protagonist and does not have a wonderful record of accountability, openness and transparency. As I said on many occasions in the past, it is not that long ago that one opened the IPA yearbook to look at the accounts of each Government Department, but when one came to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the photograph of the Secretary General was missing because it had been decided that he was much more vulnerable than the Chief of Staff, the head of the Garda Síochána or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is not the atmosphere in which to conduct a dispassionate study of an issue such as this or in which one can be certain that judgments will not be made about issues that are peripheral to this matter, but fundamental.</P>
    <P>Is there a national security defence which could be used to justify the withholding of evidence of a trial similar to the defence that exists in the United Kingdom? That defence was used in the arms to Iraq scandal where attempts were made to withhold information in a way that would have resulted in innocent people, who believed they had authorisation to do certain things, being punished. Is there such a practice in Ireland? If so, would one be able to believe a Department, which engaged in that practice, would now reveal that such a practice was used? I do not suggest there is such a practice, but there are overtones.</P>
    <P>Thirty years is a short time and there must be people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now who were significant players in this matter. If they are coming into their middle 60s now, they would have been in their middle 30s then. They would not have been junior clerks in the Department; they may have been there for 20 years at that stage. I am not imputing anything, but it is not a detached body, independent of these matters. It has an interest to defend. None of us can claim objectivity, detachment or impartiality when we have an interest to defend. This is the reason the House has learned the hard way that Members must have some type of record of <Col N="680" /> their own interests to protect them from that imputation.</P>
    <P>This is the reason I am disappointed with the Government amendment. We could have discussed the precise terms of reference of the expert group or the qualifications people should have. We could have discussed in more detail issues such as the events surrounding the Arms Trial and placed a reasonable time limit on the matter. It is not acceptable, however, to postpone an investigation without a commitment from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that something will be done afterwards. This issue will not go away; that is the inevitable consequence of documentation, whether partial or complete, coming into the public domain. Another issue that arises is the need for the Houses to get their act together. It is ridiculous that the National Archives Act applies to everybody, but Members of the Houses. It is time we became part of the same regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the Senators who tabled the motion in an effort to get to the truth. The Minister also empathises with them, but I intend to support the amendment because he said that it would be reasonable to wait for the results of his inquiries. He also said that the Senators who tabled the motion may remain minded to call for the establishment of an expert group later and that may be the best way to proceed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry about how the House has responded to the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. We should not do it because we tend to hop too readily. The debate, however, is not only a response to a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, but the fact that a document, evidence that should have been available, was obviously interfered with or changed. I do not believe that was done by Deputy O'Malley. There is no need on this occasion to rake over all the points that could be made about the Arms Trial and that period. It was a traumatic time for the party of which I am a member &ndash; only those who were there could begin to understand just how traumatic it was for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the role of the media, which is most important in this case. The way the late Jim Gibbons has been pilloried is appalling. I do not know whether Mr. Gibbons told the truth, but that is not the point. The man is dead, yet the media have libelled him. They have done it to many others of whom I can think, such as the late Seán Walsh of Dublin County Council and others who were mentioned. It is an appalling thing to do to a person. I respect Senator Gibbons for defending his father and that is what I would expect of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am also aware of the hurt other families whom I have known over the years have suffered, such as the Blaney family, the Haughey family and the family of Captain James Kelly, a man I believe was wronged. If this inquiry proves <Col N="681" /> anything, it will prove he was wronged. If it is so shown, he should be reinstated at the rank he would have reached by this stage, namely, that of a full colonel, and given a pension at that rank.</P>
    <P>I knew intimately many of the people involved in that period. I also knew of the terrible trauma, hurt, pain and passion which were part of those times. I would hate to see it all resurrected again. I hope it is not just age but also the passing of time which has mellowed us and allowed us discuss this in a rational manner. It would not have happened 30 years ago. Perhaps we have matured a little. I hope the truth emerges.</P>
    <P>I have only one concern which was alluded to by Senator Ryan, namely, that there may eventually be an excuse to the effect that the suppression of evidence was done in the public interest to avoid some conflagration. That is akin to what Lord Denning said about the Birmingham Six, that it was better they remain in prison than the British judicial system be questioned. I would hate for my concerns to become reality. No one is a saint in this matter.</P>
    <P>I know a great deal about the Arms Trial period. I am in possession of information about it which I understand has never come into the public domain. It is not concerned specifically with this issue but with the matter generally. Often the truth in these matters is one of perspective. When one is on the opposite side to someone else, it is difficult to see that they did what they thought was right at the time. There were different sides in this argument and I am sure both thought they did what they thought was correct at the time. It is not always easy to judge in hindsight the motivations of the men involved, especially those who have gone to their eternal reward.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition to accept the amendment, although I am not sure it will. I appeal to all who debate this issue, especially those in the media, to do so in a calm and reasoned fashion to try to see if we can get to the truth of what happened at the time. If the group the Minister suggested does not work, we should proceed to a more intensive inquiry of experts or a tribunal or whatever is necessary. If another tribunal is established, perhaps we should set strict terms of reference for it to ensure it does not continue <i>ad infinitum</i>. However, that is another matter.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on the matter. I do not want to open up a discussion on the facts. I am concerned we may be given a reason for the doctoring of these documents to the effect that it was in the interests of the State. Perhaps that is necessary sometimes. I do not doubt Senator Ryan when he said that it happens sometimes.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few brief comments. I support the motion. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I was involved in the investigation into the Sheedy affair. I buttress the argument that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not very good at investigating itself. Three inquiries were conducted into the Sheedy affair, one by the Department, one by a senior member of the Judiciary and one by the committee. It was generally agreed that the report produced by the Department was the least good. I do not wish to impugn officials of the Department and allegations to that effect are quickly made when one says what I have said. However, the Department is not the best Department and Departments are never good at being judges of themselves in any event. It is against the principle of both natural justice and finding the truth that they should be such.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning's motion suggests that an expert group of historians, legal people and, perhaps, an officer of the Houses be established to go through these archives, arrive at the truth and make a report. There is confusion as to whether all the relevant papers appear on the file being discussed and in which this famous and important letter for which privilege was claimed was discovered. It appears that there may be other archival material and documents relevant to the period which are not in the file. I do not know about this for certain but the inference can be drawn from remarks which have been made. The Public Records Office in London has recently released papers from this period which detail the comments of the then British Ambassador to Ireland, Mr. John Peck. They are interesting and should be examined in the context of this investigation. It is interesting to see what Mr. Peck wrote to the then British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Hume, about what the then Tánaiste, Mr. Childers, had to say about jurors being &ldquo;got at&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I admire the courage of Senator Gibbons in defending his father. As someone who lives in the farming community, I was always an admirer of his father and thought he was an excellent Minister for Agriculture. He always behaved honestly, honourably and with the utmost probity. I also believe that applied to Deputy O'Malley in this case.</P>
      <P>We need to have all this examined and the appropriate people to examine it and the appropriate approach to it is set down in the wording of the motion and ought not to be amended. Senator Coghlan made the reasonable point that the motion could be agreed tonight and we could examine the Department's report in three weeks' time. Going on past experience, I do not believe anyone will find it to be adequate, but I do not want to prejudge it. If the motion were agreed tonight, what it has set out to do could be put into effect.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Connor for sharing his time. I do not come to this issue with any baggage as Members will be well aware. However, it is one of those occasions when the importance of trust and confidence in the political system is brought into focus. Pursuit of the truth is important to politicians of all sides. I rarely agree with Senator Lydon on issues discussed in the House, but I agree with him when he speaks of perspective. As part of my job I meet people who have witnessed the same incident, who take completely different views and describe it completely differently. I was raised in a house where my father said and continues to say that one should never depend on direct evidence if there is not also accompanying circumstantial evidence. Therefore, apparently simple and straightforward matters do not lead to straight conclusions.</P>
      <P>I met Captain James Kelly on one occasion. While he does not do himself any favours in the media and should avoid them, he is a victim in this and I have a sense that something needs to be corrected in that regard. However, that is only related to the business in this motion.</P>
      <P>We need to examine this issue independently and impartially. I do not accept that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be independent and impartial, nor can any Member. It is one of the players in this episode and is completely involved. No one can walk away from the fact that a small, independent expert group reaching some conclusions on this would be of help to everyone. It would be in the interests of all Members who have spoken, especially Senator Gibbons. It would take the issue out of the political milieu, away from the commentators and the media judgments, and deal with it in an appropriate way. I strongly support the motion.</P>

      <P>I was in Northern Ireland today attending a cross-Border meeting in Armagh. Unfortunately, the signs of British imperialism are still to be seen there. I was a young man at the time of the arms crisis and not very actively involved in politics. I was in Derry on the day of the civil rights march. Senators may rest assured that I ran as far as I could from the trouble. As a student, I was outside the British Embassy on the night of the fire. I can understand the emotion of the time. Living in a Border constituency I was aware of how Catholic people in Northern Ireland were being treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis said that he would like to support the Opposition motion because the question is broader than merely the book of evidence. I <Col N="684" /> am convinced, however, that the investigation of the omission of certain information from the book of evidence may lead to other information and extend beyond the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I have my own opinion of what happened at the time. Deputy Neil Blaney was a respected member of the Fianna Fáil organisation in County Donegal. Despite the split in our organisation, for many years after the Arms Trial most of us continued to have great respect for Deputy Neil Blaney and were, possibly, supportive of him until the period of the hunger strikes in 1981. It was then that he moved totally away from the Fianna Fáil organisation. Deputy Neil Blaney often said that he did not leave Fianna Fáil, but that Fianna Fáil left him. The arms crisis split our organisation in County Donegal. We have had many battles with the Blaney organisation. Many on the Blaney side of the split suffered greatly in the intervening period. I could not disagree with what Deputy Neil Blaney's brother said recently on the radio.</P>
    <P>I would like to get to the bottom of this matter, not alone to see what happened to the book of evidence, but to discover what really happened. I find it hard to believe that members of the Army, particularly Captain Kelly, acted independently, despite the fact that Captain Kelly came from a Border county and may have had republican sympathies. He was not treated fairly. If it is proved that he was a mere cog in the wheel, I hope he receives proper justice.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the whole matter investigated. I did not see last night's television programme or the programme which dealt with Deputy O'Malley. However, I can give an example of how things can be misconstrued in the media. I was in Celtic Park last Sunday and Roy Keane was sitting about eight seats from me. When I came home I read that he was being courted by Glasgow Celtic and had been seen sitting among leading Celtic players at the match. They may have been in the same stand, but they were not sitting near to Roy Keane.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the motion, but some day we may have to travel the route proposed by Senator Manning in order to get the full information.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Bonner for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>The debate has been extremely balanced. More than 30 years after the events we can speak more circumspectly about them, but they generated much emotion at the time. It is appropriate that we now have a sense of proportion and balance in relation to them. It is equally important that we do not judge the events of 30 years ago from the perspective of today. Hindsight is useful, but it is not available to us when we are obliged to make decisions. The crisis was, probably, one of the greatest challenges to face any Government in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> While I came from a deep republican conviction, I regard all those involved in the events of the time, some of whom I knew better than others, as people of stature who made an indelible mark on governance for a long period of time. They made selfless contributions to the development of the country. Some of them may not like to be grouped together, but history has ordained that they will. The nicest tribute to the late Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, was paid by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, when he referred to him as, probably, the most popular leader in the country since Daniel O'Connell. I knew the late Deputy Jim Gibbons in a neighbouring constituency. As a young person becoming involved in urban council activities, I found him to be accessible and extremely helpful. His son, Senator Jim Gibbons, paid him a well deserved tribute. Anyone who knew Deputy Gibbons knows that he did splendid work for agriculture and his constituency. Deputy O'Malley distinguished himself in many ministries and is accepted as having made a tremendous contribution to political life. Despite what has arisen at some of the tribunals, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, made a very beneficial contribution in many ministries and as Head of Government and history will judge him more fairly than he is being judged. Senator Bonner referred to Deputy Neil Blaney. He was a man who suffered as a consequence of the events of the time, but all who were involved were scarred to some extent. We are wrong to deify or demonise any of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning may find that we can agree a compromise on the issue. It is not one on which we should divide. It is important that all the documents be examined and it is for historians rather than the Oireachtas or a public inquiry to investigate these matters. History will provide a balance in relation to these events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a useful and balanced debate. It has also been an emotional one and I thank colleagues who have contributed from all sides.</P>
      <P>I knew Senator Gibbons's father. I enjoyed the hospitality of his house and had enormous respect and affection for him. During most of his 28 years in politics my father always gave him a first preference vote, except on the occasion when my brother ran for the Dáil and he was obliged to vote within the family. The senior members of my party have always had a great respect for the integrity and patriotism of Jim Gibbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In submitting the motion I remembered the late Deputy John Kelly saying that had he been in government in 1969 and 1970 he did not know what he would have done. I remember the sense of confusion and helplessness we felt at the time. I will not accept lectures from Unionists whose own corrupt and rotten system was the cause of much of what happened down here in those days. <Col N="686" /> That is something I will not take and which none of us should have to take from them.</P>
    <P>As a historian and someone who tries to be fair, I am appalled by the drip, drip, drip of people rushing to judgment on the basis of new documents without placing everything into context. We must see matters in totality. We are dealing largely with documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>While I am not being dogmatic about the composition of such a group, the reason I proposed the establishment of this small committee &ndash; I will talk to Senator O'Donovan afterwards about the words &ldquo;small&rdquo; and &ldquo;expert&rdquo;&ndash; is that it would be eminently suited to gather all the available evidence, although it might not necessarily come to a conclusion. We all have different views on the Civil War and the 1930s and 1940s because we all bring our own baggage to bear on such matters. Now, however, we can at least agree on the bulk of the actual facts upon which we will base our judgment. As a preliminary exercise this group, which would be accepted and respected by all sides of the House, could bring all the facts together. That is what my motion is about.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan said that I had perhaps impugned the integrity of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I did not and my script made that very clear. I certainly would not do so. I am saying, however, what many other Senators have said, which is that the Department of Justice was a player in the events of 30 years ago and so was the Office of the Attorney General. There is a departmental loyalty and while I am not impugning anybody, there may well be, to the outside eye, a question mark over whether a Department is best suited to be the judge in its own case. In the sceptical age in which we live, the current papers should be investigated and verified by somebody outside, as much as anything else to protect the people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General from any doubts that may hang over them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the motion is not being accepted. A number of people on the Government side said, in effect, that the motion was one with which they could agree. The wording of the Minister's amendment makes it impossible for me to support it. I cannot support an amendment which simply says: &ldquo;Leave it to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's Office, and if they come up with something new, you can put your motion down again and we might talk about it.&rdquo;  I am moving this motion because I believe it is the right thing to do and it represents the best way forward. We can argue over the details of it later. I am also moving it as a marker that this is an issue to which we will return. I cannot accept the Government's amendment. Most people, even on the Government side of the House, would find it difficult to accept an amendment where Departments are judges in their own cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> I thank people on all sides of the House for their contributions. It has been a good and healthy debate, carried out in a calm and civilised way without rancour or party point scoring. We <Col N="688" /> have advanced the wider debate a bit further. We will press our motion and cannot support the Government amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter. I tabled this motion to have the N5 national primary route included in the national development plan, the section of the N5 from Longford to Charlestown through County Roscommon upgraded during the lifetime of the national development plan and the necessary funds provided in the plan. I do not expect to get a conclusive response from the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, tonight.</P>
      <P>The purpose of putting this motion before the House is to advance the case that is being put forward in counties Longford, Roscommon and Mayo to have the N5 national primary route brought up to a standard that will accommodate traffic through that section of the northwest over the next 20 to 30 years. The present national primary route, the N5, which travels from Longford into Termonbarry, on to Strokestown, Tulsk, Ballinagar, Frenchpark, Ballaghaderreen and Charlestown is the most inadequate and poorest national primary route. It is expected to carry six million tonnes of goods annually, much of which arrives at its destination in the east coast in a damaged state.</P>
      <P>The councils of Roscommon, Longford and Mayo have put this case forward, as have many others including the hauliers' association and all of the interest groups such as development groups and chambers of commerce that have been involved. This road artery into the northwest is hampering the opportunity for people to bring forward commercially viable projects. As long as this road remains in its current state then this part of Ireland will not develop. Neither will it be in a position to avail of the opportunities that are presented to it under the auspices of Objective One status or the Shannon rural renewal scheme that covers 45 miles of this road. In fact 45 miles of this road runs through the constituency which I represent and the other 15 miles run through County Mayo. It is a 60 mile stretch of road that is in question and it is a vital artery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Discussions are taking place on this matter at a very high level, including the involvement of the Taoiseach. I am responding to representations made to me and my colleagues at many public meetings. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to report back from this debate in Seanad Éireann that there is a concentrated and determined attempt to have this road upgraded. It is our intention that the decision taken in this House will support the local request that this road be brought to a standard that is appropriate to the opportunities that are presented.</P>
    <P>Counties Longford, Mayo and Roscommon will be unable to develop otherwise. No industrialist will pass the Shannon at that point if they have to travel on the N5 as it is today. It is a danger to the public, particularly in connection with the transportation of goods, which has resulted in countless accidents, some of them fatal. This is the start of a campaign to seek that this road becomes part of the national development plan, with funding to ensure it is brought to an appropriate standard between now and 2006-2007.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Senator Finneran for giving me a portion of his time to contribute to this debate. I live beside a village which the N5 passes through, by consent and the admission of the National Roads Authority the most deficient section of national primary road in the country. I refer to the 56 km section in Roscommon from Termonbarry to Carracastle on the Mayo border. I have made the point previously, in Roscommon County Council and elsewhere, that the road has not changed since 1901 apart from currently having a bitumen or tarred surface. The alignment and sight distance is the same along the 56 km stretch, apart from minor deviations, as when it was constructed for horse-drawn vehicles in the mid-19th century. The case for upgrading it is indisputable.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to explain why the National Roads Authority in its 1998 needs study categorised this road in phases three and four, while every other national primary road and almost every national secondary road is put in phases one and two. A phase one or two designation implies that the road should be finished before 2006, with up to phase three being completed by 2010. Phase four needs are projected as far as 2019. This road cannot wait. The National Roads Authority informed me that the average daily traffic flow through County Roscommon is some 2,700 vehicles. That includes 24% of heavy goods vehicles indicating that it is a main economic artery. Heavy goods traffic causes the greatest problems. Overtaking is impossible due to sight distance and the inadequacy of the lane width. The designation of this road in the needs study, especially in County Roscommon, has to be changed from phase three and four needs. It is not acceptable to suggest it would not be addressed until between 2010 and 2019.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> The Government proposed, in perhaps its second national development plan, the building of strategic transport corridors to all major ports and airports. Many people have made fun of Knock Airport, and Senator Chambers may be the best man to make a case for it, but it is a major airport and it neither has, nor is it promised for many years, a strategic corridor if this needs study report is not changed. We appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to go back to the Government and bring the influence of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to bear on the National Roads Authority to change the timetable for the N5 upgrading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for sharing his time. I support the motion on the national primary route. If the £6 million national roads investment fund for this year does not make provision for addressing the N5, under the national development plan or BMW funding, it will undo much of the industrial gain and job creation in the area. The large companies who export all their produce on that circuit in County Mayo and a substantial part of County Roscommon will be left without a major primary route. I believe a strong case has been made by the people of counties Mayo and Roscommon. The county councils are at one in this case. I understand that the Government and the Taoiseach are taking a particular interest in it.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a need to ring-fence some of the national roads money for this project. That can be done and must be done. This year when there is planning for work to take place in Roscommon and the National Roads Authority has been in discussions with Senator Finneran, the county council, other Senators and elected representatives, there is a need to continue the investment on an annual basis so that progress can be made on a road that has been left behind relative to any other national arteries. We must have balance in dealing with peripheral areas in terms of the Government's concern and investment. It is fundamentally important that we provide funding within the National Roads Authority in a proper ring-fenced way to deal with this and forget about the better local government needs programme that was drawn up in 1987 which does not give due regard to that need.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter in the House and for giving me the opportunity to respond. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment in the national road network of £4.7 billion over the period 2000-06 and sets out a strategic framework for the improvement and maintenance of the network over that period. To <Col N="691" /> put this in context, we will spend about £2 million a day on national roads over the plan period. The NDP provides for significant improvements to be carried out on major national primary routes, including the N4 and the N5, some of which are already under way. In 2001, the National Roads Authority has allocated a total of 8.3 million to local authorities in respect of projects on the N5 in Counties Longford, Mayo and Roscommon, and in recent years the N4 has been significantly upgraded, to the benefit of the persons travelling the route to Castlebar, through projects such as the Mullingar bypass, the Longford bypass and the Lucan-Kilcock motorway. Most of the planned improvements on the N4 will be completed or well advanced in planning by the end of the current national development plan</P>
    <P>The NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, is pursuing the detailed programming of the work involved and will determine appropriate road types in that context based on the roads needs study, current and projected traffic growth and the national spatial strategy. The objective will be to ensure the N5 is developed to a standard which will accommodate projected traffic growth over the next 20 years. Most of the planned improvements will be completed or well advanced in planning by the end of the NDP period. While there is no proposal at this stage to amend the provisions of the NDP, the need for the development of the new routes to augment those mentioned in the plan, including the N5, are being kept under constant review and the views expressed in the course of this debate will be brought to the attention of the NRA. Where the need for a new route is established, funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period with a view to bringing the project to fruition within an appropriate timeframe.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, to the House to listen to the raising of a very important matter in my constituency, that is, the announcement by GMX last week of the decision to close its Thurles plant with the loss of over 200 jobs after a period of ten years in the town. The Minister of State is possibly aware from media reports that the location of GMX in Thurles followed the devastating closure of the sugar factory and the need to generate employment in the area. Indeed, the coming to Thurles of that factory was very much welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been rumours and indications in recent weeks that all was not well at the GMX plant, the announcement came like the announce<Col N="692" /> ment of a death in the family. There is shock and trauma in Thurles not only because of the loss of jobs and the immediate difficulties faced by so many who worked there but also because there is a realisation in the towns of the midlands, including north Tipperary, of the immense difficulty of finding replacement industry when a factory such as GMX closes.</P>
    <P>The people of Thurles will be well aware of the trauma faced by former workers in the Offray plant in Roscrea which closed around this time two years ago. Despite all the efforts of the IDA and Shannon Development there has been no success in finding a replacement for that plant and there is not great optimism in Thurles that there will be positive news in relation to GMX either. What has happened in Roscrea, and is expected to happen in Thurles, is a dispersal of the workforce and I do not have to spell out the implications for the local economy of a town of this size, both socially and financially, when a major employer closes down.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been made and we, the members of the local authority, discussed them on Monday of this week. There is a need to establish a task force with teeth, with a clear focus of intent and the clear objective to go where necessary to find and attract a replacement industry. There is also need for recognition that Thurles, Roscrea and all the towns of north Tipperary, which are currently included in the southern and eastern region for the purposes of regional status, correctly belong in the BMW region. It is that region which will receive tax incentives or supports necessary to maintain employment and meet disadvantage. In relation to our economic status and <i>per capita</i> wealth, it would be more correct to place north Tipperary with the Counties of Offaly and Laois. We are very concerned that the inclusion of north Tipperary in the southern and eastern region will work to our disadvantage in attracting new investment.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that despite the unprecedented level of inward investment and employment growth, we are not seeing the benefits in our county. Expansion and inward investment are not taking place and we are left vulnerable when the winds of globalisation blow and factories like GMX and Offray suffer.</P>
    <P>We hope that this is not a disease which will spread further. We want to see the establishment of the task force outlined and recognition that Thurles is a hub, considering the location of a third level college there, the Tipperary Institute, the availability of state-of-the-art broadband technology, its situation on the country's main railway line and the availability of a workforce. We want to know that the Government is taking seriously the difficulties faced by the towns of north Tipperary, particularly Roscrea and Thurles. We want to know that there is a definitive timescale in place. We also want to know if it is the Minister's intention to visit the town to hear from the people and to roll out an objective <Col N="693" /> set of tasks and a legitimate plan to restore Thurles to economic health and optimism to the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. My Government colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, and I fully share her concern and disappointment over the decision last week by GMX to close its Thurles plant. We are very conscious of the effect its closure will have on employment in the Thurles area and, most immediately, the employees concerned.</P>
      <P>GMX Limited employs approximately 230 people in the manufacture of a range of domestic appliances, motors and electromechanical components at its Thurles facility. The company established operations in 1989 following the demise of the Irish Sugar Company's processing facility in the town. At the time it was owned by Moulinex SA of France, Glen Dimplex Limited and Greencore plc. The other shareholdings have since been acquired by the French company, which is now the sole owner. In 1991, the company took over the Krups factory in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>On several occasions since the company was established various initiatives were undertaken to broaden the range of products and invest in new technology in order to underpin and consolidate the operation in Thurles. These changes were supported by Shannon Development and resulted in a reorientation of the company's output away from component production to a focus on domestic appliances. Employment grew to a total of 350 staff at its peak.</P>
      <P>Despite these successes, however, in 1998, Moulinex decided to rationalise its production facilities and relocate some production lines to France. Later that year, as a result of the collapse of the group's Russian market and stagnation in the United States and South American markets, significant overcapacity arose. Moulinex then decided that it was no longer viable to maintain both the Limerick and Thurles facilities. The Thurles plant was chosen as the site for centralised production in Ireland and this safeguarded, for the time being, the jobs at the GMX plant.</P>
      <P>The parent company has, unfortunately, been forced to undertake another rationalisation programme. It is incurring continuing losses and now has extensive overcapacity worldwide. Moulinex merged with another company, Brandt, last year and that company also had a large number of plants. The group employs 21,000 people worldwide and its current rationalisation plan proposes to make 4,000 persons redundant and close four plants, including, sadly, the one in Thurles. The production in Thurles will be transferred to other centres within the group in both France and Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, following the closure announcement, my Government colleague, the Minister for <Col N="694" /> Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, flew to Paris to meet the French parent company to discuss the closure. He secured commitments from Moulinex Brandt that the total closure of the Thurles plant will not happen before 31 December next. It was also agreed that there would be full co-operation on a skills audit of the workforce, a technical audit of the premises and equipment and, most importantly, helping the workforce to secure alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Despite this blow to the area, we are heartened that the employment position in north Tipperary is positive. Employment in IDA companies has risen from 740 to 1,106 in the last decade. The most significant project was in respect of Procter and Gamble in Nenagh in 1999 where an additional 250 jobs were created, bringing its employment total to approximately 580 people. The numbers registered as unemployed in north Tipperary as a whole declined from 2,419 in 1999 to 2,103 last year. The unemployment figures for Thurles showed a decline from 1,105 to 937.</P>
    <P>In addition, a welcome infrastructural initiative is the new £2.2 million Tipperary Technology Park project being developed by Shannon Development, which was launched last year and is due for completion later this year. It is a state-of-the-art technology centre and will ensure north Tipperary, Thurles in particular, has the capacity to meet the needs of the developing knowledge economy. The new technology park will support the development of indigenous high technology enterprise in the region.</P>
    <P>When completed, the technology park will incorporate over 20,000 square feet of high quality office space, serviced with a state-of-the-art telecommunications network and other facilities geared specifically towards businesses in the high growth knowledge-based services sector. The type of business targeted will include software, multimedia and e-commerce related activities. As well as providing incubation space and support facilities for new and growing businesses, the new park will incorporate other serviced accommodation which will also meet the needs of international investment.</P>
    <P>Another welcome development in the town of Thurles was the establishment by the Government of the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute, which began offering courses in the academic year 1997-98. Enterprise Ireland is supporting the institute in the development of courses and programmes in sustainable rural development, SME development and information and communications technology. Recognising the potential of the new institute to contribute to economic and enterprise development in the Tipperary area, a joint working group of Shannon Development and institute personnel was established to work out strategies and action programmes.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the closure, my departmental colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, decided to establish a special inter-agency task force. This group will examine and <Col N="695" /> respond to the needs of the Thurles workers and examine ways for further action on job creation in the area. It will be chaired by Shannon Development and include representative of the IDA, FÁS and the county enterprise board. The terms of reference for the new task force will be to secure alternative job creating enterprise, both from overseas and indigenous investors, for Thurles; to provide an immediate skills assessment and suitable training opportunities for affected workers; and to provide the necessary information and assistance for any employees who may wish to establish their own enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith and the Government are totally committed to ensuring job creation in the Thurles area is a high priority. We are optimistic <Col N="696" /> that Thurles will recover from this setback in the immediate years ahead.</P>

      <P>While I will bring that matter to the attention of the Tánaiste and recommend that they be included, I cannot give a guarantee. The final decision will rest with the Tánaiste. I am sure that if the Senator had a word with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, it would also help. I will ascertain if they can be included.</P>
