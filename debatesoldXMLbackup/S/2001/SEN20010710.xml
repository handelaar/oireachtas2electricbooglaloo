      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken not earlier than 2 p.m.; and No. 2, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>Throughout this session it has come to everybody's notice that the way we are doing business in both Houses is questionable. Time allowed for debates has been shortened and Report Stages have been taken immediately after Committee Stages. Opportunities to examine and re-examine Bills have not been given to us, especially with regard to No. 3, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. This was guillotined in the Lower House and brought back here without affording us the opportunity to discuss it. In particular with regard to the Attorney General's advice regarding this issue, it should be re-examined. The Bill should not be rushed through in the way that it has been. We will have difficulty with the Order of Business today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A commitment was given to have a debate in the Dáil on the report on the sentences of Mr. Thomas Murray, found guilty of the brutal murder of a valued retired colleague of the Cathaoirleach and myself. The Dáil is now in recess. Can a debate be held on the matter in this House and will the Minister bring it to the Dáil in the new term? There are huge discrepancies in the report that are causing much anxiety to the <Col N="1230" /> families and friends involved, and also the people concerned about them.</P>
      <P>Different views are being put forward on whether Thomas Murray should have been granted day release, during which time he committed another murder. There is a gap in the report, which I want to discuss. I do not want to do so now, but to draw attention to the fact that this is the reason it must be raised. Both sides of the House are equally concerned about the matter. I will address it again in the new session if we do not do so in this one. It needs to be discussed calmly and in detail.</P>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill is on the Order of Business for today. Like any Seanad Bill, it is published on yellow paper. However, the Bill we are to discuss today, with the same title, is published in a different colour. The reason is very simple. It is because Article 22 of the Constitution states that a Bill initiated in Seanad Éireann, if amended in Dáil Éireann, shall be considered as a Bill initiated in Dáil Éireann. Any Bill that comes to us having been initiated in Dáil Éireann comes to us on Second Stage. Will the Leader recognise the constitutional imperative that we deal with this Bill today on Second Stage, like all other Bills initiated in the Dáil, which come to us on green paper?</P>
      <P>As an amendment to the Order of Business, we should consider discussing No. 4 which reads:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Order 103, and implementing the imperative of the Constitution, Article 22.2.2º, which declares &lsquo;A Bill initiated in Seanad Éireann, if amended in Dáil Éireann shall be considered as a Bill initiated in Dáil Éireann', the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 be considered at Second Stage.</P>
      <P>In older versions of the Constitution, Article 22.2.2º may be Article 20.2.2º. The motion is in the name of the Independent Senators. In deference to the Constitution&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is Senator O'Toole moving that as an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1, that No. 4 be taken before No. 1. It should be accepted without a division of the House and without argument or rancour. The Constitution must be recognised in spite of anything that might be in our Standing Orders. We have a responsibility to ensure the issue is addressed by the Supreme Court to see if we are out of kilter with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader either accept my amendment to the Order of Business or defer the Electoral (Amendment) Bill until we receive the view of the Attorney General on the matter? I am referring only to procedural matters, not the Bill <i>per se</i>. I am not discussing the Bill for the moment, merely the process and procedure. This is how we should conduct our business. I ask the Cathaoirleach to take an interest in the matter because it is fundamental to the way we do our business and on that basis it makes a great deal of sense. The <Col N="1231" /> matter is not urgent and I ask that we defer dealing with it until we get a complete ruling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Cabinet the recent United Nations human development report which, for the fourth year in succession, shows Ireland virtually at the bottom of the poverty league among the industrialised nations. We are ranked 16th of 17 countries in the poverty stakes. This country is booming and awash with money yet we are at the bottom of the league with over 16% of our people living in poverty. That is a disgrace and it is high time the Government addressed it in terms of health, housing and literacy, where nothing has changed&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the Order of Business. The Senator should find a more appropriate way of raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to our rates of literacy and numeracy. That is the issue we should be debating today rather than one of these other matters which can easily be left until the autumn.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 to the Order of Business, to delete No. 3 from the Order Paper. It is outrageous that we are expected to deal with Report Stage of a Bill which comes before this House after substantial changes were made to it in the other House. It has effectively become a Dáil Bill, yet we have to deal with it today in a very short time. That is not acceptable. There are serious constitutional and policy issues at stake. The issue has dominated the media since its introduction in the Dáil and appears to have arisen purely because the director of elections in Tipperary South wanted a scapegoat for Fianna Fáil's poor electoral performance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely explaining some of the reasons for deleting the matter from the Order of Business today, which is the only proper way of dealing with it. Even if we proceed to Second Stage, we will not have time to deal with it. The proper course of action is to take it off the Order Paper and present it in the autumn. I do not see the reason this Government is pressing ahead helter-skelter with a matter which was not an issue for the Government when the Bill was introduced. Now it must be pushed through the <Col N="1232" /> House in a single day. I propose its deletion from the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator O'Toole's motion covers what I wish to raise on No. 4. If not, I propose we suspend Standing Order 103 under Standing Order 143(2), which allows a matter of necessity to be introduced. Rather than accepting that all the other Stages have been dealt with, and that this is a Dáil Bill coming here on Report Stage, I want it to be treated as a new Bill through the suspension of Standing Order 143(2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 143(1) states:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Seanad may be suspended for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice.</P>
      <P>Standing Order 143(2) states:</P>
      <P>Provided that in cases of necessity, of which the Cathaoirleach shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders may be suspended upon motion made without notice. If such motion be opposed, the Cathaoirleach shall permit an explanatory statement from the member who moves it and a statement from a member who opposes it, before he puts the question thereon.</P>
      <P>I propose that, under that Standing Order, we suspend Standing Order 103, which states:</P>
      <P>A Bill which has been initiated in the Seanad and amended by the Dáil shall, after its receipt back from the Dáil be deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and shall be placed on the Order Paper for its Fourth Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be supporting that as a fall back position. The simplest way of dealing with this matter is to remove it from the Order Paper, avoid further controversy and let us deal with the matter in a proper parliamentary sense. Matters of this nature are best dealt with by consultation between the Government and Opposition parties coming to a reasonable understanding. That is not possible because there has been no consultation. The matter will be dealt with in a single sitting as the Leader has proposed. The Bill is substantially different from the Bill which entered this House.</P>

      <P>I support, but do not second, Senator O'Toole's motion. The motion will be seconded by Senator Quinn. I will propose a motion which might solve the problems which the Leader will encounter today. I move:</P>
      <P>That Standing Orders be suspended for today's sitting so that an invitation can be issued to the Attorney General to address the House on the issue of Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this will be a difficult and controversial day for the Seanad. I propose this motion because serious constitutional issues are involved in this Bill. Senator O'Toole has already raised one, to which there appears to be no obvious answer. There is also a serious constitutional issue which has, apparently, been addressed by the Attorney General himself and it appears that the Attorney General's advice has been ignored by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in Standing Orders for the Attorney General to address this House. It will be absurd if the Attorney General has found the Bill to be unconstitutional, the Government rams it through, it then goes to the Supreme Court and <Col N="1234" /> we do not have the benefit of the Attorney General's advice. We need to fulfil our obligations to hear the best possible legal advice on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not need to point out to the House that the Bill and this issue were not debated in their entirety in the Dáil. The issue was not debated at all in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a convention that we do not comment in this House on how the Dáil does its business. We do our business in this House in our own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree absolutely, a Chathaoirligh. That is particularly why we should show that this House takes the Attorney General's advice seriously and that we value that advice. There is no point in having an Attorney General if his advice is ignored. It appears that, even if we do not discuss the issue of how the Dáil conducts its business, how the Cabinet conducts its business is a matter for this House. The Cabinet's conduct of its business on this issue is questionable. It appears that all members of the Cabinet, including both parties in Government, have ignored the Attorney General's advice. If we go ahead with this Bill today and it is found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we will have neglected our duty by not listening to the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer, as I did last Friday, to the fact that we are rushing legislation through this House. I object to the principle of that as it makes for bad law, of which Senators on all sides of the House are aware. We need to discuss legislation properly and to allow due process for all legislation. I am not talking about only one Bill. I want to make a case on that principle.</P>
      <P>Time should be made available to discuss the United Nations human development report, particularly its indication of the high levels of functional illiteracy in Ireland. It is amazing that up to 23% of Irish people are not able to read a bus timetable properly. That is a terrible indictment of our society and particularly our education system. It is essential we debate issues such as this which are more to do with the quality of life of our people and are extremely important, particularly when one considers the relative wealth of many people in society. I ask that this be given priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator O'Toole's motion No. 4. A Member on the other side of the House talked about having a debate on politics because of the bad name politicians and politics are receiving. If politics has a bad name, it is because of the behaviour of politicians. I am not speaking of this House particularly, but new legislation has been allowed to go through without being debated. It is essential that we have a Second Stage debate on this Bill. If we do not, we will find that legislation will be passed without debate. We will have no one to blame but ourselves if we do not succeed in having a debate on this.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader allow a full debate on money lending, and particularly the way money lenders are abusing ordinary citizens, when we return after the recess? It would be a worthwhile debate and we should devote some time to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of Senators Coogan, O'Toole and Ross, and particularly the views of Senator O'Toole as enshrined in motion No. 4. If there is nothing else in the Constitution to overrule it, the motion presents a solid case to have the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, considered on Second Stage. I cannot think of anything to overrule it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that there has been a division and that matter has been ruled on, it would be very foolish of this House to proceed without the advice of the Attorney General. Will the Leader tell the House if the Attorney General's advice will be available to the House prior to proceeding to the debate? This matter was last raised in 1991. The then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Pádraig Flynn, has stated publicly that he did seek advice from the then Attorney General. He has said he was advised to <Col N="1235" /><Col N="1236" /> proceed with extreme caution and the matter was dropped.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a duty to ensure that we have the best advice available to us. I have no doubt that the best advice would come from the Attorney General. I have great faith and confidence in his judgment. I urge the Leader that we should not proceed unless we have that advice.</P>
    <P>I also want to raise the issue of post offices and sub-post offices, a matter I raised last week and many times previously and about which there is serious concern in rural areas. A debate was promised but it has not been delivered. I would like an update from the Leader on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has raised a very important constitutional point, and I support him. Has the Leader contacted the Attorney General's office to get a view on this?

      <P>It is very important that this House be given the advice of the Attorney General. It seems quite extraordinary that the Government should be given the advice of the Attorney General, turn its back on it and then deny this House that advice when we have a debate on the matter. I know we are not supposed to discuss the business of the Dáil, but the way in which business was conducted there materially affects the nature of the Bill which is now before this House.</P>

      <P>If this House does not have the fullest possible advice and discussion on this Bill then it will have been inadequately discussed. I was rather surprised to hear Fintan O'Toole, a distinguished and shrewd political analyst, say on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last night that the Bill had been passed by the Oireachtas and was now on its way to being law. It has not because it has not been discussed by the House, but it shows the effect this rubber stamping is having on political life when someone like that can assume the Bill has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears odd we will debate the Second Stage of the Local Government Bill as the third item of business. When is it proposed to take the remaining Stages of the Bill? Will it be left hanging fire over the summer vacation or will we take it <Col N="1237" /> tomorrow? It appears much more important that we spend the entire day, perhaps, discussing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill and its ramifications. I have every confidence we will be here until pretty late this evening.</P>
    <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business which I understand the acting leader of Fine Gael may be able to support, especially given that the matter with which the amendment is concerned has been drawn to the attention of the House by his distinguished colleague, Senator Keogh. We ought to show some conscience in the House. It is extremely disturbing to read in the papers this morning of the United Nations report which stated that income inequality is higher in Ireland than in any other western country, apart from the United States and the United Kingdom. Is that not something which should concern Members?</P>

      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business for reasons which are obvious to us all at this stage, and I support the cogent arguments made on this side of the House about the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. I remind the Leader, because he clearly needs it, that we are Members of an independent House and that we decide how we conduct our business. I also remind him of one of our fundamental functions, which is to conduct an increased and broader examination of legislation, especially that coming from the other House. It is clear the Electoral (Amendment) Bill is fundamentally different legislation to what we sent to the other House for consideration a number of weeks ago. The Leader must take that into account and exercise his function in that regard.</P>
      <P>If we accept the Order of Business as presented, we will undermine fundamentally our role as Senators and the role of Seanad Éireann, roles granted by the Constitution and which we are expected to fulfil by those who elected us to this House. The manner in which we conduct our business today will be viewed very seriously by all those who observe it. The amendment from the Dáil is also being viewed very seriously by the public, and that will continue to be the case. I urge the Leader of the House, therefore, to take on board those views and accept the amendment we are tabling in a positive and constructive fashion.</P>

      <P>I will be brief as today is being taken up with constitutional matters and amendments to various Bills. However, I must comment on the UNDP report published this morning. There should be a full day's debate on the issue as soon as possible but it should not happen as a result of a headline in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. We should look at the report which I have read and on which many people have commented. It is easy to take two items from the report and say Ireland is not doing well. It is the most positive statistical report on Ireland in a very long time. If anyone talks to members of the UNDP or the OECD they will discover that there are issues which need to be addressed. We need to address the education system if 15.3% of people are functionally illiterate.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment which raises an important constitutional issue, not just on this Bill but on many other Bills which have come back to this House from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I raised on a number of occasions the state of the tourism industry. It is disappointing we have missed an opportunity to debate the issue, therefore, I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for a full debate, perhaps a day long debate, on tourism early in the next session. Many regions throughout the country realise the tourism season has almost ended and we will only find out at the end of the year when the figures are calculated what we have missed in this regard, for which the Government must take the blame. I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the issue early in the next session.</P>

      <P>Senators Coogan, O'Toole, Costello, Quinn, Norris and Burke expressed concern about No. 3 and Senator O'Toole expressed concern about No. 4. Under Article 15 of the Constitution each House shall make its own rules. Standing Order 103 provides that a Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil shall be placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Keogh, Quinn and Lanigan called for a debate on the UN development report. I give a commitment to the House that a debate on this issue will take place very early in the next session. We cannot have a debate on the issue now given the amount of legislation to be debated. Legislation must be debated and passed and this has always been the case in the House.</P>
      <P>I will pass Senator O'Toole's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I fully agree with his sentiments regarding the very sad matter to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on money lenders. I will allow for a debate on the issue in the next session. Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the future of post offices. This is <Col N="1240" /> very timely and there can be a debate on the issue in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Thérèse Ridge has called for a debate on the subject of school attendance. This must be deferred until after the recess and I will allow time in the early weeks of the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke has asked for a debate on tourism. I think it is a little unfair to put responsibility for the problems in the tourism industry on the Government. The foot and mouth crisis was to blame because Americans were afraid to come and bookings were down last February and March. Perhaps his great friend and colleague, the former Minister and long-term aspirant, would be able to inform him that the Leader knows well what the situation is like on the ground. I will allow time for a discussion on this subject in the next session.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity this morning to ask Irish people to support their own tourism industry and stay at home this summer. The Americans are not coming in the same numbers because of the uncertainty last February and March caused by the foot and mouth epidemic in England. I ask the Irish people to rally to the cause one more time and help Irish tourism.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the Report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, was initiated in this House last April. The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative mechanism by which the current waste management planning process may be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion in accordance with our EU obligations. This planning process has now been under way for several years and, while the local authorities generally have sought to address their responsibilities in this area, three out of 13 local authorities in three <Col N="1245" /> regional groups currently refuse to adopt the proposed regional waste management plan.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House for the short delay. These authorities are obstructing any prospect of progress on the part of the majority and have delayed the overall planning process. As a result, we have not made the progress that we all accept is necessary and long overdue in the provision of effective and cost efficient services and infrastructure. All the time, the problems associated with proper waste management continue to grow. It is essential that all remaining waste plans are made as soon as possible so we can move forward to the implementation phase and put in train the necessary measures to meet our national and EU targets and obligations in this area.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government decided to propose an amendment to the Waste Management Act, 1996, so that the power to make a waste management plan would be transferred from the elected members of a local authority to the relevant manager, and to make other supporting legislative amendments. These are specified in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward this amending legislation, the opportunity was also taken of providing a statutory basis for a number of other important waste management and anti-litter measures, including a new environmental levy on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and potentially on other products which are problematic in waste management terms; a levy on the landfill of waste; the establishment of an environment fund, through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to finance beneficial environmental initiatives in a range of areas including waste management, environmental education and awareness; and an increase in the on-the-spot litter fine to £100 and provision for future changes in the level of the fine.</P>
      <P>In its passage through the other House, the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill was subject to a small number of essentially technical amendments not related to the key provisions in section 4 and I now advise Senators of the purpose and principal features of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 34 of the 1996 Act provides for a system of permitting, by local authorities, of com<Col N="1246" /> mercial waste collection activities and it is proposed shortly to make regulations under this section introducing a waste collection permitting regime. Section 34 provides that after such date as may be prescribed, a commercial waste collector would require a permit from each local authority in whose functional area waste is collected. Where large waste collection businesses are operating in multiple areas, such a permitting system could give rise to a considerable administrative and cost burden.</P>
    <P>In drafting the 1996 Act, consideration was given to a system whereby only one collection permit would be issued by the local authority in whose functional area a collector was based. At the time the view was taken that this could present implementation difficulties and would not easily meet the legitimate concerns that individual local authorities may have in relation to the conduct of operators within their functional areas.</P>
    <P>However, following consultations with local authorities and the Waste Management Association, representing commercial waste collectors, it is proposed to amend section 34 to provide for an alternative approach which compromises between the need for effective local authority oversight of waste collection activities and administrative simplicity.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendments are specified in section 6. They would allow local authorities to adopt a collegiate approach to waste collection permitting, particularly within the context of regional waste management plans. Where a group of local authorities have jointly made, or propose to make, a regional plan or are otherwise co-operating with one another in relation to waste management, it is proposed that they may nominate one authority to carry out waste permitting functions on behalf of the others.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken to provide powers whereby the Minister could, in the future, prescribe that waste collection permits would be granted by a specified body rather than by local authorities. However, this is purely an enabling provision. There are no proposals for such a measure at present.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, under section 34(1)<i>(a) </i>of the Act, as amended, a waste collection permit may be granted by the local authority in whose functional area waste is collected, another local authority nominated for the purpose in accordance with paragraph (<i>aa</i>), or such other body or bodies as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>aa</i>), which is new, provides that where two or more local authorities have jointly made, or propose jointly to make, a waste management plan or are otherwise co-operating with one another to achieve common waste management objectives, they may, or shall if so required by the Minister, nominate one of their number to perform the permitting functions with respect to each of their functional areas. The proposed subsection is a technical drafting amendment which follows from the amendment of subsection 34(1).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> A provision of the Bill that was widely welcomed is the proposed establishment of an environmental levy on plastic shopping bags and potentially other products and materials. To this end, section 9 inserts a new section 72 into the 1996 Act. In the first instance, the levy will apply to the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags to customers. Under proposed regulations, retailers will be required to pass on the amount of the levy to customers at the check-out or counter. It is intended that the Revenue Commissioners, acting on an agency basis for the Minister, will collect the levy.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps, 20,000 retail outlets that are potentially liable for this levy so the collection scheme will be administratively complex. Following consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, it is proposed to amend the proposed section 72 to provide, as an enabling measure, that in lieu of seeking to collect the levy directly from all individual retailers concerned, the Revenue Commissioners could, if it is deemed practical and effective for them to do so, enter into arrangements with manufacturers and distributors of plastic bags. Under such arrangements, these distributors, acting on behalf of the retailers to whom they supply plastic bags, would collect the relevant levy and remit it to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6)(<i>k</i>) of the proposed section 72 would enable a collection authority to enter into arrangements with specified persons whereby, under an agreed scheme, they would agree to discharge the liabilities of others participating in that scheme and remit the levy to the collection authority.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9)(<i>c</i>) of the proposed section 72 is a consequential amendment which provides that failure to comply with any terms and conditions of a collection scheme would be an offence.</P>
    <P>This amendment is simply an enabling provision. My Department is in ongoing consultation with the Revenue Commissioners regarding the modalities of the necessary levy collection system and it remains to be seen whether this kind of arrangement is practical or necessary. It would not impact in any way on the intended requirement that the levy be passed on visibly from retailers to their customers.</P>
    <P>The levy will apply to all retailers, large and small, who provide plastic shopping bags to consumers. The use of any arrangement or scheme under paragraph (7)(<i>k</i>) would not militate against the imposition of the levy on all relevant retailers. It would merely mean that the Revenue Commissioners could agree a scheme to collect the levy payable by a group of retailers through the relevant manufacturers and distributors which supply them with bags, while allowing the Revenue Commissioners to apply their enforcement effort directly on retailers not subject to any such scheme.</P>
    <P>There are two further technical amendments to the proposed section 72 to correct an error in sub<Col N="1248" /> section (2) where the words or otherwise are incorrectly inserted. The purpose of the words or otherwise is to provide that the proposed environmental levy can apply to the supply of plastic bags to a customer anywhere on retail premises.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the insertion of a new section 73 into the 1996 Act to allow for the imposition of a levy on the landfill of waste and associated regulatory powers to require that the proceeds of the levy be paid into the environment fund.</P>
    <P>The proposed section 73 has been amended in the other House by the insertion of a new subsection (7), with a view to ensuring that provision can be made in regulations under the section so that the liability for the levy is passed on to waste producers in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>The intention is that local authorities operating landfill sites would recoup their levy exposure by means of an additional charge on all their customers, for example, domestic or commercial producers to whom the local authorities directly provide a collection service. Private waste collectors will pay gate fees for access to landfill.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised by the commercial waste industry that local authorities could unfairly load the levy on private operators using their sites to mitigate the impact on waste collection charges payable to those authorities by domestic customers. Clearly, having regard to the polluter pays principle and the basic objective of the levy to provide an incentive for diversion of waste from landfill, this would be undesirable. It is considered necessary, therefore, to bring forward appropriate regulatory powers to direct or control local authorities as to the means by which they recoup or pass on their levy liability.</P>
    <P>The proposed subsection (7)(<i>a</i>) provides that the Minister may, by regulations under section 73(1), restrict the extent to which a local authority may pass on the landfill levy in particular circumstances by means of a charge for its landfill service.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7)(<i>b</i>) clarifies the purpose for such regulatory provision to ensure that one or more categories of person are not charged disproportionately for the purpose of the recoupment by a local authority of its exposure to the landfill levy. Subsection (7)(<i>c</i>) is a consequent technical provision.</P>
    <P>Overall, waste management has been the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; of environmental services. There is a wide acceptance in both Houses, supported by a broad public consensus, that this must change. We need to move rapidly from a position of excessive reliance on landfill to the establishment and operation of a modern integrated waste management system. We have reached the stage where we have a clear policy direction, underpinned by an effective legal framework. We are committing significant resources to achieve progress and we have clear objectives and targets. We now need action, implementation and deliv<Col N="1249" /> ery. The Bill will facilitate such progress and I commend it to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I appreciate the efforts he made to get us a copy of his speech. I pass on my good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for a speedy recovery. We wish him well.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arise from the Minister's speech. I take exception to the first statement, which is a reiteration of the old battle lines that the Minister knows best, and the democratic representatives of the people are being treated with disdain. The Minister states that three out of 15 authorities in three regional groups refuse to adopt the proposed regional waste management plan before them. The local authorities never met as a group. For example, in the region of Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, those county councils never met. They met as individual councils to discuss the plan, but it cannot be called a regional plan when there was no meeting as a region.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the first debate, in County Louth we rejected the waste management plan because an hour before our vote we were told that the incinerator that we saw in Germany had been closed down. The elected members were acting properly, coherently and with much common sense in saying that they did not want this industry foisted on them. In this Bill the Minister is taking away the rights of local democratic communities to speak through the local councillors.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Minister is correct in saying that as a result we have not made the progress that we all accept is necessary. We made significant progress in County Louth in turning down a plant that in the view of the authorities in Germany was not acceptable and was in breach of environmental regulations. To stuff incinerators down out throats as this Bill is doing is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with all aspects covered in the Minister's speech so he might be able to answer some of the questions I raise. He said he met the local authorities and the Waste Management Association, which I assume is a representative group of commercial waste collectors. He proposed an alternative method for licensing. Licensing for waste collectors should be done by a scientific body. The only body that can say that someone is qualified to collect waste is the EPA. I see no reason the Environmental Protection Agency is not the licensing authority for commercial waste collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he mentioned that someone with a waste collection licence from Meath County Council must go to Navan Urban District Council to get one from it and to Drogheda Corporation etc. All these commercial companies should be able to go to the Environmental Protection Agency, get their licence and collect wherever they wish. If they have the licence from the correct scientific body, I have no problem with their ability to collect and dispose <Col N="1250" /> of waste. We must, however, have a proper licensing scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily satisfied local authorities have competence to deal with the significant issues which would arise, particularly from incinerators. Incinerators produce two types of ash, apart from pollution caused as a result of dioxins being released into the air and which we all know adversely affect health. One of the issues raised recently by &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; on BBC was what happens the fly ash, which is toxic and highly dangerous, and the bottom ash, which is not as dangerous but which must be properly disposed of. In his speech the Minister said he will have the power to designate other bodies to issue licences. However, local authorities will be the initial group to issue licences. Therefore, if there is an incinerator in County Meath, the Minister's constituency, and company A gets a licence to collect the toxic fly ash, we must know they are competent and qualified to deal with it. There would have to be a hazardous dump available to which it could be brought and clear and obvious protocols for transporting fly ash. I am not satisfied that local authorities would necessarily have the competence to make decisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The credibility of companies also arises. In the UK, fly ash from the incinerator in Newcastle-upon-Tyne was spread on the allotments used for growing vegetables and on the aggregate which formed the children's playground. I understand fly ash from the incinerator in Edmonton was used in road construction and in the construction of concrete blocks, which were then used in the homes of ordinary people. It was discovered that the mix in those concrete blocks was of an extremely high volume, way in excess of the maximum limits for dioxins. Theoretically, if people were doing work on their house, for example, building an extension, they could release dioxins into their lungs which would have a significant adverse impact on their health.</P>
    <P>The EPA is the only competent body in which I would have confidence to issue licences. We are not talking about collecting compressed cardboard from the local supermarket or collecting organic refuse from the local hotel. The issue is far more significant and potentially hazardous. The companies which will specifically deal with waste from incinerators must have due recourse to the EPA. The EPA will licence incineration companies, but who will ensure the companies which may be dealing with this highly dangerous ash are qualified and competent to do so?</P>
    <P>The powers proposed by the Minister appear strange, although perhaps they are only strange to me. Where two or more local authorities have jointly made or propose jointly to make a waste management plan, they will be the licensing authority. However, the powers also talk about them &ldquo;otherwise co-operating with one another to achieve common objectives with respect to waste management in their functional areas&rdquo;. It seems the Minister could be considering the possibility <Col N="1251" /> of other adjacent local authorities forming a conglomerate outside the regional waste management plans. For example, Dublin Corporation could become the licensing authority for the north-east, or Leitrim County Council could theoretically become the licensing authority for&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for the west. It does not make sense to me. I am really concerned about the phrase &ldquo;the local authorities may, or shall, if the Minister requires them&rdquo;. From the Minister of State's speech I am not clear about the powers the Minister will have in this regard and why the Minister should become involved in this area. Perhaps the Minister will put my mind at ease on this matter. It seems a very strange provision. On the one hand the Minister is pushing forward the regional waste management plans and on the other hand is making arrangements for other significant players or people to get involved.</P>
      <P>I am really concerned about the issues concerning hazardous waste arising from section 34 and the amendment thereto, and the specialist waste contractors who will get licences from local authorities in County Louth or County Leitrim without having to apply to the EPA. If my reading is incorrect, perhaps the Minister will explain it.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech also refers to the environmental levy, with which I do not have a problem. The Minister is providing for good housekeeping between the Revenue Commissions and other bodies to ensure the levy is collected in an efficient and practical manner, something with which we all agree.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about what the Minister said in relation to section 11 which provides for the landfill levy. It seems the Minister has given the commercial waste industry a significant concession. The Minister is agreeing to impose a landfill tax on every domestic dwelling, even if the local authority is providing the service. Currently local authorities provide a service to collect refuse. In many areas certain categories of people are excluded from the local charge, such as old age pensioners who do not pay refuse charges in Dublin city, or people on social welfare. Local authorities have different views in this regard. As things stand the elected members of local authorities decide on the charge, but if this Bill is passed every home will have to be levied with a charge. This takes from the local authority the discretionary powers which elected members have to run waste management as a service and not as a business. It is being run as a service for the community, but it is now being placed in the context of the landfill levy under which every household will be levied with a charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial waste industry is very concerned that local authorities could unfairly load the levy on private operators. I am very concerned that commercial waste operators will <Col N="1252" /> unfairly load private domestic households where they have a monopoly. Yesterday at a meeting of Louth County Council concern was expressed that certain companies may have a monopoly in regions or areas, which is not good for business or competition. However, the Minister has indicated that his interpretation differs from mine and I would appreciate if he clarified the issue. Where a local authority wishes to take up some of that tax with regard to the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, it appears to me that the Minister is giving in to commercial pressure. The Minister is giving a concession whereby the local authority will run the landfill as a business for private domestic customers. That is unfair as it will mean we will not be able to exclude households from the charge where there are pensioners or people on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the issue of waste management will continue to be vexatious. Those of us campaigning for a better environment will make our voices heard on this issue during the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>Where there is a dispute between a local authority and a private collector as to the fairness of the landfill levy, what appeal procedure, if any, will be in place? Will it be a matter for the regulations, as it is one which could arise because we are dealing with the disproportionate amount of the levy? Currently it appears that local authorities are increasing charges all the time. I accept the point that they should be put on notice to explain their charges.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the rules of the House unfortunately do not allow me to respond after the Minister's reply but I look forward to what he has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator O'Dowd in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House on this very important Bill. During the Order of Business this morning a Bill with lesser consequences became the highlight while this more substantial one was ignored &ndash; which says something about politics and the manner in which we do our business in these Houses, and how we respond to the newspapers rather than the real issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not re-hash Second Stage but I said then that the transfer of powers to the county manager is anathema to me. The fact that there is a four year moratorium on it does mitigate its effects somewhat. Given that we will have a local government Bill before us in the next couple of days, it is not the direction in which one would like to see us going. We must acknowledge that the Minister had some difficulty in trying to get the waste management strategy and plans in place. This may have had much to do with the appointment of consultants who had their own views as to how it should be pursued. These issues are being addressed by politicians and professional people within the service rather than following the lines of consultants whose reports <Col N="1253" /> were almost identical in each region and have given rise to much disquiet.</P>
    <P>When Senator O'Dowd referred to the powers of local authorities to issue permits he implied that those permits could also be granted for incineration plants &ndash; I did not read that into the amendments or the Bill. Will the Minister clarify this point because that certainly would be a concern?</P>
    <P>An investigative programme on BBC 2 last week looked at the city of Newcastle in the north-east of England and the manner in which their incinerator operators had functioned. It told an appalling tale of fly ash being mixed with bottom ash, which in some instances was put on the national roads and in other cases was made into blocks for use in house construction. If the evidence of the programme is correct, the permitted limits were greatly exceeded &ndash; it was in the region of 300 nanograms per kilogram when they analysed the blocks. If we have incineration in this country &ndash; and I hope we do not &ndash; then it will have to be rigorously policed. Depending on the industry to police and regulate its operations is manifestly unsatisfactory in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>That is not the purpose of these amendments. As I understand it, private operators will be permitted to participate in the waste collection process. That is happening to some extent at present and it is appropriate that the local authority should be the body to grant those permits. They are charged with responsibility in this area and they have a vast amount of experience to set the criteria and ensure that they are adhered to in maintaining standards.</P>
    <P>I had concerns regarding the permits being used to control competition and also that the landfill levy in the Bill could be used in this way. Arguments have been raised by private operators that the dump charges being applied distort the competition between private operators and local authority waste collection facilities and it would be wrong if that were the case.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister as these were issues that were discussed in this House. It is indicative of the calibre of both the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that at all Stages of debate on legislation going through either House &ndash; we have experienced it here at first hand on many occasions &ndash; they are prepared to take on board any sensible suggestions and include them in appropriately drafted amendments. Points which came up during the debate in this House are now reflected in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill for one local authority to be nominated at regional level in order to undertake some of the responsibilities of other local authorities &ndash; it is happening to some extent already. In many regions it has been agreed that a specific local authority will give the lead on developing the regional waste management plan &ndash; previously the waste management strategy. There is nothing wrong with that where it is agreed, but a word of caution is necessary. <Col N="1254" /> Some of the thrust of the Bill is going in the direction of regionalisation being best.</P>
    <P>I would not deny that there are certain benefits, given the economies of scale that would apply by increasing the volumes. A quarter of a million tons per annum being put through will justify bailing and good environmental standards. One would need a volume of a certain scale to make it economic and some local authorities may not be in a position to go it alone and still maintain such a high standard. If we value local democracy, it is important that councils are not forced into a policy of regionalisation. If a local authority considers that within its capacity it has the necessary financial and human resources to properly manage its waste within the county, it should be allowed to do so. My local authority, similar to Senator O'Dowd's in County Louth, voted by 19 to one in favour of pursing a particular line of waste management &ndash; landfill as a strong preference to incineration. We must respect those decisions. I would not like a situation to develop whereby regionalisation in some way diluted the say and powers of local elected members who have a mandate.</P>
    <P>I sympathise to some extent with the Minister's view that as councillors we much not abrogate our responsibility in this regard. Waste management is a major challenge to local government and there can be a temptation to take a more populous line, but that should not be acceded to. It is imperative that we act responsibly, courageously and in the best interests of the people. As the Minister has been quoted on many occasions, the Paul Daniels approach to waste management simply does not work.</P>
    <P>The environment levy is an excellent provision. On Second and Committee Stages, Senator Quinn in particular raised some misgivings as to how the levy would be collected. I am glad the modalities of the collection system are addressed in one of the amendments. It is considered that utilising the resources of the Revenue Commissioners is an efficient method in this regard and there are also enabling provisions in the Bill to utilise the manufacturing and suppliers of plastic bags as a source for the collection. I do not subscribe to what Senator O'Dowd said in this regard. Ultimately it is the person at the end of the line who should pay the levy, the person who produces the waste. If we accept &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle, it is the people who fail to apply proper standards at household level where the waste is initiated who must be charged for the ultimate cost that arises because of that failure.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of my local authority yesterday, I was extremely surprised to see people coming up to a desk in the foyer of the county hall to purchase composting bins. Much more needs to be done in that area. If we tackle prevention of waste, its minimisation, reuse, recycling, composting and so on energetically and vigorously, there is no doubt that there will be no necessity to think about incineration in this process. That is the view of people at European Commission <Col N="1255" /> level. We are a small county with a small population and we must manage our affairs in this regard. I was pleased to hear that the last time the Bill was before this House the Minister identified those areas as priorities for him going forward. If we diligently pursue those at local authority level, within the space of a few years we could review the position and ascertain to what extent a reduction has been made.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that this week representatives of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government are in Nova Scotia examining the success of its system under which it has reduced the volume of its waste by 50% in the past decade. Those are the types of best practice international models we should examine to ensure we not only apply the best waste management principles but preserve the green image we have as an environmentally friendly country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments to the Bill. They are exceptionally good. In particular the amendment in regard to subsection (7), which the Minister has included, ensures that local government will have to operate on a fair basis in allowing and ensuring that it cannot pass on excessive charges to private operators to skew the charge against it. Ultimately, waste management will be an extremely costly process. We will have to comply with all the EU regulations. Those of us involved in local government know that will be extremely costly. It is important, therefore, that competition introduces the necessary efficiencies to keep the cost to a level that is sustainable and not excessive because in monopolies one loses cost effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on bringing these amendments before us and I am sure we will all be pleased to support them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I too wish the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, well and I hope he is on the road to recovery. I know his heart is in this Bill and his ambition is to make sure it succeeds.</P>
      <P>I will not cover the ground of the Second Stage debate. Senators O'Dowd and Walsh spoke eloquently on areas with which they are much more familiar than I am. I will concentrate on the environmental levy. The Minister hopes that no income from such levy will be received. It would be true success if no income were received from such a levy. That would be a change having regard to nearly every other levy we have heard of. It would be a success if every citizen were to stop using plastic bags and as a result all the damage they cause by way of litter and environmental cost would be eliminated. It would be a failure if no income were received from the imposition of such a levy and plastic bags continued to cause destruction and litter the environment.</P>

    <P>I read through the amendments to check if any steps have been taken since this Bill passed through this House many months ago on its road to success. As Senator Walsh said, I supported <Col N="1256" /> the Bill enthusiastically because it has the worthy objective which everyone must support, that of the removal of plastic bags from the environment. To do that, we must make sure it is a good law and that it works. We must make sure that the public responds to the imposition of an environmental levy by refusing to use plastic bags and by being threatened by the high price of 19 cents that will apply to their use. We do not want to pass a law that is unenforceable. We do not want to put a Bill through this House which will not work.</P>
    <P>There was much reference in this House in the past to the dog muzzling Bill. I was not here when that Bill was passed, but I gather Members reacted to a strongly felt need to do something after some incidents and they passed a dog muzzling Bill which was not and could not be enforced. The prohibition Bill was passed in the United States in 1919, but by 1932 it was found to have given rise to many more problems than it had been aimed to eliminate and it was abolished in that year. Those laws were passed with the best will in the world and the intention was that they would succeed, but they did not. Will the imposition of an environmental levy succeed? When we discussed this Bill some time ago the Minister told us he hoped it would be in operation as early as October. I understood it would be in operation in January, but he said that he hoped it would be in force as early as autumn this year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this Bill coming back to us today to see if we can find solutions or answers to the problems and questions we have. How will it work? How will this levy be collected? I am concerned about this. The few words that I heard do not show that the steps have been taken or a decision made. I know that many good heads and hearts are behind this. The officials who are working on this have put a lot of effort into it. The Minister of State said in his speech:</P>
    <P>The use of any arrangement or scheme under paragraph (7)(<i>k</i>) would not militate against the imposition of the levy on all relevant retailers. It would merely mean that the Revenue Commissioners could agree a scheme to collect the levy payable by a group of retailers through the relevant manufacturers-distributors which supply them with bags while allowing the Revenue to apply their enforcement effort directly on retailers not subject to such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand the purpose of that and I think the amendment is there. Can we see that this will work? I do not understand how it will. The Minister will say that this is enabling legislation. It will enable the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister or other collection authorities to take steps in that direction, and that is fine. We are getting closer to the day that I thought we would see, and I still do not see how it will work.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an issue about which I am concerned. A customer will be charged a 15p or 19 cent levy by a retailer, but nearby there will be someone who will not charge that levy or will pay <Col N="1257" /> it for the customer. The customer might threaten to shop elsewhere. Competition is such that we must ensure it is fair. To the best of my knowledge, there are no plastic bag manufacturers in the State so the onus will be on the distributors. It is possible for a retailer to travel to Newry, put a six month supply of plastic bags into his car, return to the State and use the bags. How will the levy be enforced in those circumstances? It is not as though that will not happen. It is already happening with such things as beer. Retailers cross the Border and fill their car boots or van &ndash; it is legal to do so as it is supposed to be for their own use &ndash; and use that to undercut competitors in this State.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages of free trade and the EU is that smuggling has been almost eliminated because there are no longer different laws in different areas. If a retailer wishes to respond to those customers who do not want to pay the levy &ndash; there are quite a few who feel that way &ndash; the retailer only has to cross the Border and buy those bags. I bet that within days of this Bill coming into operation, bags will be available in the North. I do not have an answer to this. I wish there was one.</P>
    <P>The companies I am associated with and their competitors are working very hard to change our customers' habits. A number of customers are changing their habits. It is easier to change their habits by using the levy. When I ask a group of 20 customers what they will do when this legislation comes into force I find that six say they do not use or intend to use plastic bags while another six say that it suits them to use plastic bags but they will have to adjust to it. The remaining eight say that they prefer to use plastic bags and will continue to use them. They accept that if they are forced not to use them, reluctantly they will not do so. Those are the approximate proportions. Almost 50% of customers still use, and will continue to use, plastic bags unless we can convince them not to do so.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to convince people not to use plastic bags if the legislation is easily got around. There will be a sufficient number of retailers who will be unable to resist the customer if he or she threatens to go to another retailer where the levy is not charged. I hope that does not happen. It will not happen if the Bill introduces a levy that is enforced on all retailers. We must make sure that is done. I thought we might have learned by this stage and got closer to achieving that. Maybe the Minister will explain how this might be done.</P>
    <P>It is some months since the Bill passed through this House and it has been amended by the Dáil. Maybe the Minister has a secret and will tell us how this will be done. As a nation, we would love to see the elimination of plastic bags &ndash; retailers would certainly love to see that as they are a huge cost to us. Customers know that the cost is paid in the price of their groceries. If this legislation is to work, it has to be seen to be fair and unavoidable by any section of retailers. Customers will <Col N="1258" /> then know that no matter where they shop they will have to pay the levy. That is how we will get them to change their habits.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister in his objectives. I know his intentions are right. I hope this Bill will be enforced. I have read through the Bill and the amendments and I know it is not the purpose of the Bill to describe how it will work. If it is enabling legislation and the Minister is able to satisfy those of us who worry that it will not be easily enforced, I welcome this Stage.</P>
    <P>I support the proposed changes. I am sure they help the Minister to enforce this legislation and make it work. I want to hear the Minister's view as to how this will work. How will we make sure that we do not create another dog muzzling Bill? How will we make sure that the Bill achieves the worthy objectives that it sets out to achieve?</P>

      <P>I am a member of a local authority which passed a regional waste management plan. As I said on Second Stage, as a democrat and an elected representative, I stand over the right of any elected representative or local authority to reject a proposal put to them. This is the essence of democracy. It is an essential democratic principle which is being set aside every day. Those of us who were in counties affected by motorway schemes know exactly what I am talking about. There is a major democratic deficit relating to decisions that are made and this Bill fundamentally undermines local democracy in removing one of the fundamental powers of local representatives and giving it to the county manager. We will rue the day that we made that decision. I have not doubt that it will come back to haunt us.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not do what the Minister says it does. It does not provide a clear policy direction or an effective legal framework for the management of waste. It does the opposite. We only have to look around us, especially those of us who are members of local authorities, to see how the Government has failed in its responsibility to the community in devising an effective and environmentally sustainable waste management framework. It is the opposite of that and the Bill undermines an environmentally sustainable policy specifically where the collection and management of waste is concerned. It is a bad day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments made in the other House relate specifically to the issue of granting a permit for waste collection, the environmental levy on plastic bags and a levy of landfill. I echo the remarks of Senator O'Dowd on the issue of the permit. I am concerned about the framework set <Col N="1259" /> out for granting permits, not that I oppose it in principle. It is extraordinary that, should a local authority decide to privatise waste collection, there are few, if any, regulations for the granting of a permit. I welcome in principle the concept of a permit, but we will once again have to wait until the regulations are published before we see the fine detail of the structure for granting permits. These regulations will be published on the Order Paper and we will never get an opportunity to discuss them, even though they are important and relevant to our day to day business.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, as are other Members such as Senator O'Dowd, that the Minister can prescribe the structure, function and manner in which a local authority can make a decision about a permit. What is the point in granting the power to a local authority if the Minister can tell it how to give the permit or to whom to give it? The idea of having two local authorities work together is fine in principle but may not work in practice. There may be serious question marks over the applicability of this, such as where a local authority grants a permit for the collection of waste in a local authority area well away from its geographical area. I have considerable reservations about this amendment. Unfortunately, the Minister of State's remarks to the House did not reassure me sufficiently in this regard.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what Senator Quinn had to say about the structure devised for the collection of the levy on plastic bags. When we discussed the Bill previously, I supported the principle of the levy because it had to be done. However, the framework the Minister of State has devised is clearly unworkable and will make a nonsense of the idea. By this time next year, we will be examining a failed idea.</P>
    <P>The environmental levy on landfill is a sound idea in principle and is set against the context of the principle of the polluter pays, one we all support and which is a fundamental principle of European Union law and directives in this area. The environmental levy on landfill does not operate in the context of a broad environmentally sustainable policy. The opposite is the case. Landfill charges are passed on in an increasingly unfair and unjust fashion to domestic householders and consumers and have become extremely onerous for many households to the extent that for many people, especially elderly people on pensions, single parents and the poor, the annual increase in landfill charges means they face an extremely onerous annual charge.</P>
    <P>We should examine a policy whereby there is an incentive for reduction. I heard the Minister of State and Senator Walsh pay the usual lip service to the concepts of reduction and reuse. Unless real and structured incentives exist to send less material to a landfill, the idea of an environmental levy is useless because it will only add to the unfairness. We should have a system where there is an incentive to recycle, separate and reuse waste and put less of it in the wheelie bin <Col N="1260" /> for deposit in a landfill. Unless that exists in a structured, tax-driven manner, which is my suggestion, there will be no movement towards an environmentally sustainable policy.</P>
    <P>What exists is an incentive for waste collectors to collect more waste because the more customers they have, the more money is generated. These are commercial operators who do not provide the service as a charity. There must be a profit motive at the heart of it. Since there is such a motive, there is no incentive to reduce unless we move the profit motive clearly towards a reduction instead of an increase in the amount being collected. We are not on that policy road and there is no sign we are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>Instead we have this pussy-footing around with ideas of environmental levies, a levy on plastic bags and so on. We hear great speeches from the Government about changing our ways, reducing, reusing, recycling, sending bottles to the recycling centres and so on, but it is all meaningless because the fundamental policy is wrong. The Minister of State referred to his energetic and vigorous approach to the issues of reduction, reuse and so on, and to the wider concept of the effective management of waste, but I put it to him &ndash; his amendments show this clearly &ndash; that it is a sluggish, half-baked approach to an environmentally sustainable waste management policy. The message is coming clearly from the people and communities, who are aware that the approach we take is wrong, that it is the Government which must change its ways, not the communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is bad legislation. The approach of the Government to waste management has been disastrous. It has gone from bad to worse and we find ourselves with a Bill which compounds the situation and effectively undermines the role of local authorities in this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has demanded that each local authority put in place a waste management scheme rather than putting together, with some decent form of leadership, a generic waste management plan and a proper set of waste management guidelines for the country, thereby doing the work for local authorities. The idea of each local authority having to draw up a separate waste management plan makes for a cumbersome, complex and overlapping system. There will be a waste management plan and a set of charges in one area which will be out of line with the charges in the neighbouring local authority as well as various proposals which will differ in local authorities. The entire approach has not been thought out. It is a case of putting the cart before the horse. The Minister concentrated on imposing charges rather than on the recycling issue.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will pay more attention rather than discussing extraneous matters with another Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very off-putting for another Senator to begin to speak quite loudly to the Minister of State when one is addressing one's remarks to him.</P>
      <P>The Government has been putting the cart before the horse instead of devising a comprehensive waste management plan which would have recycling and re-use as its fundamental approach. Each local authority must devise a separate plan and impose a separate charge otherwise the Government will use a sledgehammer, to so speak, and those local authorities will be told that the Minister will sort them out. The Minister should have provided leadership on the issue in the first instance. Instead there is new legislation directed at local authorities which do not conform to what the Minister wanted. I do not blame local authorities or citizens for not being over the moon at the prospect of having an incinerator in their back garden.</P>
      <P>The bin system which has been put in place in my local authority is ludicrous because 20,000 households do not have that system. These people will continue with the black plastic bags on which a levy may be placed. The black plastic bag is now part of the waste management plan which does not allow for the recycling or segregation of waste. The green and grey bin system &ndash; it resembles Murphys in England; the grey Murphy, green Murphy and brown Murphy &ndash; is very unsuitable for many houses in an urban setting. There has not been the slightest consultation in this regard with householders, including old age pensioners or owners of houses with steps leading to them. The manner in which the waste management system has been introduced is a mess and it has been introduced largely under duress. The Minister threatened to dissolve local authorities which did not introduce the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental levy will be another cumbersome issue. It is four years since the Minister promised to put a tax on plastic bags. He is now proposing a tax on plastic shopping bags. The levy will be collected through retailers of which there are approximately 20,000 outlets. The Minister of State has admitted that this will be administratively complex. Of course it will be administratively complex to collect the levy. While it might be deemed more practicable for manufacturing distributors, it will still be a mess to operate. Given that four years have passed without imposing a levy on shopping bags, would it not have been simpler to ban plastic shopping bags? Why not completely ban plastic shopping bags? Local authorities will have to collect all the charges imposed. We are aware what has happened in the Minister of State's city of Cork. People have gone to jail for refusing to deal with this issue. The administratively cumbersome process of collecting the levy will now be imposed on each retailer. This will amount to a very small <Col N="1262" /> sum of money. How this process will operate in 20,000 outlets is mind boggling.</P>
    <P>The amendments refer to the co-operation of local authorities in implementing the waste management plan. The Minister is suggesting that each local authority implement the plan rather than putting in place a coherent waste management system for the entire country. The devious aspect of the amendment is that it makes provision for a body other than local authorities to have a permit to deal with waste management. The amendment proposes granting such permits for the collection of waste. This is effectively beginning the process of the privatisation of refuse collection. This is an enabling provision which will allow local authorities to off-load the collection of waste to the private sector. We are aware of what is happening in Dublin Corporation in regard to the water treatment plant in Ballymore Eustace. The private sector is involved in the new development there despite the arrangements between management, staff and the unions in Dublin Corporation. This will result in a charge for water distribution and we all know the hassle and political controversy which took place because of that issue. At least one Deputy was elected to the other House on his opposition to water charges.</P>
    <P>One cannot quantify the extent of opposition in Dublin to what is seen as an essential service. One should not compound the situation which is currently developing by proposing to off-load the collection of waste to private contractors. Approximately 7% of householders in the Dublin Corporation area had paid a charge which had to be paid by the end of last month &ndash; it is not a successful collection rate. I can imagine what ructions will take place if Dublin Corporation off-loads the collection process to the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what to do about this legislation which is wrong from start to finish. The legislation was rushed through by the Minister who simply wanted to conform to a European Union directive without considering how waste management could be implemented in a proper and coherent fashion. That has not been done in the parent or present Bill; rather the problem has been compounded. The amendments and the Bill are unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Senator O'Dowd asked why we should not designate the Environmental Protection Agency to grant waste collection permits for the country as a whole. Apart from any consideration as to whether it would be a useful or necessary exercise, it is intended that local authorities should utilise the waste collection permit system to uphold operational requirements and conditions in order to support the proper implementation of the local and regional waste management plans. Section 35 of the 1996 Act provides explicitly that the local authority may require the <Col N="1263" /> holder of a waste collection permit to arrange for the segregated collection of household or commercial wastes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the transport of hazardous wastes, section 34(2) of the 1996 Act provides that the agency may give guidance or directions to local authorities in relation to the controls and measures to be undertaken in permitting the collection and movement of hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd asked what is entailed in the provision for co-operating authorities. As things stand in relation to waste management planning, there are three categories of local authority: those which have adopted a single regional waste management plan, as in the case of the four Dublin authorities; those which are committed to making a regional plan; the six authorities in the south-east region which currently have individual plans but propose to make a single regional plan &ndash; Cork Corporation and County Council have proposed to make individual plans but in accordance with the common waste management strategy. The provisions of subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) are intended to encompass these different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd also raised the matter of the power of the manager to prescribe a single permitting body. This is only an enabling power but it would enable the Minister in the future to pass the function to the EPA or perhaps a national waste agency, if one was established. The Senator also raised the matter of the proposed amendments of a new section 73. These proposals have nothing to do with waiver systems or existing <Col N="1264" /> local authority powers to waive existing charges. It is an enabling provision to prevent charges being loaded on private collectors. In the event of a dispute on the level of charges, it would be open to the collector to take legal action if he considered that a local authority is in breach of the proposed regulations. The question of alleged illegal activity in another jurisdiction is not relevant to the proposed collection permit system in Ireland and the implementation and enforcement of that system.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Senator Quinn that the detailed implementation of the levy on plastic bags is being examined at present and will be reflected in regulations. These will be the subject of further consultation with the retail sector to ensure that the levy can be effectively applied and implemented. The provisions of the Bill are simply the general enabling powers which will underpin the regulations. It will be evident to the Revenue Commissioners if a retailer is supplying plastic bags and in that case the retailer will have to maintain detailed records. It would also be relatively easy to monitor whether a retailer is actually passing on the levy to individual customers.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Senator O'Meara that there is no question of the Minister telling local authorities who to permit or in what manner. What is provided for is a power to enable the Minister to require a group of authorities to nominate a single permitting authority, to be chosen by the local authorities concerned. Plastic bags cannot be banned under relevant EU regulation.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to disrespect the Chair, but I asked the Minister of State a simple question and he advised that he was trying to get certain people back in. Then there was an indecent rush to put the question before my finding out the information I required. I do not know if the Cathaoirleach was advised to do that, but he did not handle the situation correctly. The Cathaoirleach heard the simple question that I asked.</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, has three motions for recommittal, which I propose to deal with first. If a Senator moves, under Standing Order 111, that a Bill be recommitted either wholly or in respect of certain sections or amendments, where the motion is opposed under Standing Order 112, the procedure is that the Chair allows the proposer to make an explanatory statement of the reasons for the proposed recommittal and allows a statement from the Senator who opposes the motion before putting the question. I will now deal with the <Col N="1267" /> motions individually in the sequence in which they appear on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to have the Bill recommitted for a number of reasons. When the Seanad was being instituted in 1937, one of the reasons given by Mr. Éamon de Valera for doing so was that it would prevent hasty or ill-considered legislation passing through Parliament and that it would provide a second opinion on legislation and an opportunity to examine legislation that might not have been treated fully in the other House.</P>
      <P>These are precisely the circumstances we find ourselves in today. The Bill we are considering was not properly debated in the other House. My main concern is the new section in the Bill dealing with the ban on opinion polling. When the Electoral (Amendment) Bill was in this House, there was a lengthy debate, but there was no reference or proposal of any ban on opinion polling. It was not discussed in principle in this House, nor was it discussed in detail on Committee or Report Stage. The Bill then went to the Dáil where the full Second Stage debate took place without any proposal to ban opinion polls. It then proceeded to Committee Stage in that House. At this stage a proposal was made by my party to ban opinion polling. I do not regard this as a party political issue, but as a matter of public policy. The Government put down its own amendment, the nature of which I will come to in a moment, but the matter was not debated and the Bill was guillotined in the Dáil without consideration being given to the section dealing with opinion polling.</P>
      <P>We have now arrived at the position of having a Bill pass in both Houses without discussing a major departure in public policy or how it will operate in practice. We have here, in the shape of the main Government amendment, effectively a new Bill. It contains definitions and is short, although we have dealt with shorter Bills, but it is a new Bill which makes a very substantial change in public policy that has not been debated in either House. Not only is that bad practice, it is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House exists precisely to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen. My request today exactly reflects the spirit of what Mr. Éamon de <Col N="1268" /> Valera intended when he founded this House over 60 years ago. I am sure those on the opposite side who share the spirit of the founder of their party will see he would have been shocked by that practice and would have wished them to use this House, of which we are all very proud to be Members, in that spirit.</P>
    <P>Is this new undebated proposal on opinion polling a matter of national urgency? The answer is no. Nothing will be lost by recommitting part or all of this Bill to a committee for consideration over the summer. There is no urgent clamour for the imposition of a ban on opinion polling. It can wait to be dealt with properly, so why rush this Bill? I will not accuse the Leader of the House of rushing Bills through as he has been very good in allocating full time to them, but this Bill is being rushed.</P>
    <P>It is not only the Attorney General but also the person whose advice he sought, as well as lawyers with whom I have consulted, who believe that this Bill may be constitutionally flawed and may not stand up to scrutiny in the Supreme Court or the High Court. While I cannot read the mind of the President, it is likely that this Bill will be referred to the Supreme Court for adjudication before it is finally signed into law. There are serious constitutional doubts, some of which the Attorney General shares. I would like his advice to be published to help the public debate.</P>
    <P>There has been no denial from Dr. Gerard Hogan of Trinity College, a very eminent constitutional lawyer, that his advice also placed a great question mark over the constitutionality of the Bill. All the lawyers I asked for advice have said there is a case to answer because the Bill may well be unconstitutional. It would be foolish, wrong and reckless of us to rush through legislation having been told by several lawyers &ndash; I hesitate to use the term eminent lawyers&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;as all lawyers, by definition, regard themselves as eminent &ndash; that it may be struck down at the first obstacle. Why not debate the matter in the calm way legislation requires?</P>
      <P>Many fears have been raised on the subject and much of the debate has been hysterical. I took great exception to the comments made by some media commentators describing this legislation as Hitler and Goebbels-like legislation or repressive or Third World legislation. Many other such epithets rained down on politicians. As I have said before on debates on media reform, if people in the media want a reasoned debated, they should be careful to ensure the language they use is not out of touch with reality, hysterical or offensive. These are issues with which we can all engage and on which there are at least two points of view. Let us have the debate, but let us get rid of the hysterical language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are fears on the part of the media. Most media people do not trust politicians, fearing an attempt to clamp down on the messengers, the <Col N="1269" /> bearers of bad news. They are concerned this is the beginning of a war through repressive legislation. Their fears are baseless. This proposal is not a direct attack on the media. However, the penalties in the Bill are draconian and out of all proportion to any offences which might be committed. There is a further case to answer.</P>
    <P>To journalists who have been shouting so loudly on this question I say we too have our fears and suspicions. We trust the media no more than they trust us. There must always be an air of tension between the two estates. We are not in their pockets, they are not in ours, they ask questions of us just as we ask questions of Government. There are fears, for example, concerning the over-concentration of media ownership in one group. If that group happened to have a particular agenda, there is the possibility that it could distort opinion coming up to an election.</P>
    <P>Politicians also fear an absence of standards. The established opinion polling organisations behave honourably and honestly and conduct their business properly but, in the absence of a ban, what is to stop cowboy operators springing up before an election and introducing information intended to distort public debate? There is no point in the people involved apologising once the damage has been done.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, legitimate questions to be asked on both sides. These fears will only be met head on if the two sides sit down to talk and put reasoned cases. We could then see what the media are afraid of and, at the same time, forcefully express our fears about the way in which they operate. In that way, much of the mistrust could disappear.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been absent in this debate so far is evidence. No evidence as to the exact impact of banning opinion polls in other countries has been brought into this debate. Plenty of such evidence exists and there are also many experts in our universities, including Dr. Richard Sinnott and Dr. Michael Marsh, and among the opinion pollsters themselves. There are plenty of people who could provide objective, sober, dispassionate analysis of the impact of opinion polling on electoral behaviour. It may well transpire that it has had no effect at all. People make up their minds for a variety of reasons such as local, party and inherited issues, or because they hate or love somebody. Opinion polls probably have only a very small effect. They appear to have an effect in Britain where, in the last general election, the polls induced many people not to bother voting because it was clear Tony Blair only had to get up on the morning of the election and drive into Downing Street that evening and he would get elected, so great was the gap in the polls.</P>
    <P>However, the British have a different electoral system. No one would take an election here for granted. Given that we have proportional representation, multi-seat constituencies and so <Col N="1270" /> forth, there would be very few people saying at the beginning of an election it is all over because the polls say it is. Opinion polls are not a factor in discouraging people from voting here.</P>
    <P>I would be happy if only the section on opinion polling did not proceed now and was referred back to committee. We will be doing a bad job if we do not do that. The other House has not behaved well. There is no justification for guillotining legislation at any stage. It is disgraceful that large rafts of legislation find their way onto the Statute Book without having been discussed in the lower House. We do our best in this House but because of the way this Bill has come to us we are not being given the opportunity to examine it in detail.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Members opposite in the spirit of the House to which we are all proud to belong. We should pass good laws rather than laws which will not have the acquiescence of a large section of the population, as this one will not if last night's opinion poll is to be believed. This proposal has raised doubts. In the spirit of this House and of good law making, I appeal to my colleagues and friends on the opposite side to accept the proposal in the good faith in which it is proferred and refer the Bill back to committee. The committee could return early after the recess and the Bill could be on the Statute Book by early October. We will do a good day's work for this House and for democracy if we follow that advice.</P>

      <P>This morning when Senators Coogan, O'Toole, Norris, Costello and others made arguments similar to that put forward by Senator Manning, I replied that all these points could be made during the debate on Report and Final Stages. There will be no guillotine. Members may speak for as long as they wish and all views may be expressed. There has never been a guillotine in this House under my leadership and there will not be one today.</P>
      <P>In the newspapers during last weekend and on radio this morning I have read and heard various views regarding this proposed legislation. Anyone who thinks the media will give politicians a fair break is not living in the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal came from Deputy Olivia Mitchell. She proposed that no public opinion poll shall be taken or published in the seven days prior to any election or referendum and no opinion poll whatsoever shall be published in the seven days prior to any election or referendum. That proposal was supported by Deputy Gilmore. Both Deputies were asked by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, if they were speak<Col N="1271" /> ing on behalf of their parties. The Minister of State was assured this was the case. In fact, Deputy Gilmore said:</P>
    <P>In the last critical week of an election the opinion pollsters should stay out of the ring and leave it to the contestants and the electorate. I support the proposal made by Deputy Olivia Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to say, &ldquo;I assume they are speaking for their parties, Fine Gael and Labour&rdquo;. When Deputy Molloy, as a matter of clarification, asked Deputy Mitchell if it was true that 14 days was what she had submitted originally, Deputy Mitchell said:</P>
    <P>I changed it several times. On reflection, I realised that 14 days was too long. I have the final copy here and I can read it if the Minister wants.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said, &ldquo;I have it here.&rdquo; Deputy Molloy, in conclusion, said, &ldquo;I accept the principle behind the proposal and I will be willing to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.&rdquo; That is what happened in the other House. We must deal with the proposal before us. The Bill was initiated in this House.</P>
    <P>There has been no guillotine in this House on any legislation during the past four years. I accept the sincerity of the proposal from Senator Manning, former Leader of the House and Leader of Fine Gael in the House. I respect his views. He has been an eminent Senator and has enhanced the proceedings in this House in the long time I have been here. However, with regard to the <Col N="1272" /> points he has made and particularly the point regarding the recent British election, we cannot make an analogy with the British system. The number of Independent Members in the other House is in double figures and we also differ from the United Kingdom in having proportional representation. In the last general election, 624 votes decided five Dáil seats, and these 624 votes were fifth, sixth and seventh preferences.</P>
    <P>Opinion polls are of the utmost importance. Is it fair that someone who has worked hard for an entire Dáil or Seanad term, served his constituents loyally, faithfully and well can be damaged by a particular interest group which controls the media, not nationally but locally, and which for reasons best known to itself does not want him to be re-elected? Such a group could announce to its readers, two or three days before polling day that a certain person had 40% support and would top the poll and that someone else was in trouble. That is not fair. The media have, for four years and ten months, an opportunity to make their case. For the week before polling day, the ordinary men and women of Ireland and the ordinary candidates who are men and women of Ireland should be given their opportunity.</P>
    <P>We are not discussing the principle behind this proposal. I believe all political parties are in favour of having an agreed time when there would be no polls. I would like to see the House debating this issue rather than to-ing and fro-ing with votes, as we have done today. We will stay for as long as this matter takes and if it takes until next week I do not mind. There will be no guillotine or stifling of debate. We are here to listen and to debate and pass legislation.</P>

      <P>In moving the motion we wish to state we are doing so because of the seriousness and urgency of the situation. As has been pointed out on more than one occasion, it is not good practice to rush legislation and those of us on this side of the House have objected to the speed with which the Government side has attempted to move legislation through the House. Our specific role is to give due and detailed consideration to legislation. The speed at which the Government has moved this Bill through the Lower House is one reason for such adverse public reaction. A suspicion has been generated that in some way the Government is moving fast as they are trying to hide something from the public. There has been a negative reaction to this approach. It also looked like a bitter and petty reaction to the vote received by the Government candidate in the Tipperary South by-election. To some extent it is interpreted as a scapegoating of the media and specifically those companies which carry out opinion polls.</P>
      <P>What we need is a debate on the use of opinion polls and their potential effect during elections and the role of the media not only during elections but in general. I specifically ask Members to separate from the issue the growing negativity and personalised reaction to media commentary about us and our actions as parliamentarians. As a former journalist I specifically ask Members to stand back and look objectively at the commentary about us and how we conduct our business, and to ask if some of it at least is fair. I know there are Members who have an increasingly negative and bitter feeling towards how the media comment on us as public representatives, but I put it to colleagues that free speech and free expression of opinion, especially when we do not like it, are fundamental to our democracy. A situation in which the media can adversely comment on us is a mark of our democracy and I ask Members to consider what would happen if the opposite were true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision inserted in the Bill has been <Col N="1273" /><Col N="1274" /> interpreted as an attempt to stifle democracy and free speech. Personally I do not think that was ever the intention but I am not in the least surprised it has been interpreted in that way, and we must take that point of view into account. We must also take public reaction into account. As Senator Manning and others pointed out, we have a duty and this week an opportunity to consider and take into account public reaction to this measure. That is our role and we must take it on board, and it is in this context that I move the motion.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 46 relate to the Bill, but not as amended by the Dáil and therefore have been ruled out of order. However, we tabled them as we believe the entire Bill must again be considered by the House for the specific reason that it has been significantly altered by the Lower House and returns to us as effectively new legislation, and we should consider it as such.</P>
    <P>The amendments are technical in nature, and many of them are drafting amendments. Our legal advisers, whom we are very lucky to have, have spotted mistakes in the Bill which have not previously been spotted. In a constructive and positive way, as we have done on numerous occasions in the past, we have put forward the amendments for consideration by the House in an attempt to be helpful. However, because the legislation is being rushed through it will not be possible to correct technical errors in the Bill. Therefore the Bill will have 46 technical errors when it forms part of the Statute Book. Many of the errors are minor, but it is not good practice to put legislation on the Statute Book which we know for a fact to be flawed, even if some of those flaws are minor.</P>
    <P>Issues of public importance and constitutional law have been raised in relation to the amendment passed by the Dáil without debate. Knowing constitutional issues have been raised, should we simply pass the legislation and turn a blind eye to the problems we know are evident in the Bill? We constantly and increasingly worry about our standing with the electorate and the public. We do nothing for our public reputation, or for the reputation of the House, to knowingly pass legislation without consideration in particular of constitutional matters raised by those in the wider public whom we know to have greater knowledge than us about these matters, and by those charged by the Government, the State and the Constitution to comment on these issues. How can we ignore the reports of issues raised by the Attorney General and the concerns raised previously by a former Attorney General? It is negligent to do so and undermines our constitutional position and reputation. If it is so commented upon in the public domain we have no one to blame but ourselves.</P>
    <P>There are major issues to be debated. The Leader of the House said in response to a previous motion that there is no guillotine in this House &ndash; that is true and there never should be one. One cannot have a proper debate on Fifth <Col N="1275" /> Stage. It is not possible, as we have just seen in regard to the Waste Management (Amendment) (No 2) Bill, 2001, where significant amendments have come before us.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of major importance that has grown in the public mind in the last week. A week is a long time in politics and it is a long time in opinion polling during an election. Let us not scapegoat the messengers and let us not be seen to put a rein on free speech, whether it be on ourselves or on issues in the public domain. Let us do a good day's work in this House, not a bad one.</P>

      <P>All the points I made previously were in response to Senator Manning's motion regarding the rushing through of legislation. If an allegation is made in the House it should be fair-minded and have substance. Last week our Whips had to meet countless times to re-arrange business when the time we had allocated was not taken up. I ask people to be reasonable and honourable &ndash; they may talk for as many days as they like as there will not be any rushing through of legislation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Cathaoirleach said this morning, what happens in the other House is the business of that House. This House has not been rushing legislation through, apart from some exceptional circumstances. With regard to the legislation before <Col N="1276" /> us today, all the time that is necessary will be afforded to it. I do not want Senators making the allegation that legislation is being rushed through &ndash; it is neither fair nor true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell<b></b>proposed this amendment in the Dáil and Fine Gael won the Tipperary South by-election. The Labour Party had a very fine candidate in Mr. Denis Landy, and two or three days before the poll his vote was put at 3 or 4% above what he actually got in the election. It may or may not be the case that this candidate was affected by the poll.</P>
    <P>Seven days is a reasonable time to allow people to make up their minds on who is to govern the country. Unlike ourselves who are privileged to be Members of Parliament and have decent salaries and standards of living, there are many people who do not have this and could be heavily influenced by the media. They should not be put in that position. All parties have contributed to the success of the country since 1987 and as legislators we have to act responsibly. So what if a few less newspapers are sold or ratings and advertising goes down? It is only for seven days out of five years and that is not unreasonable. We are not, and should not be, dictated to. Seven days is the bare minimum and we should discuss the pros and cons of the Bill with the Minister and his officials present. We will be here for as long as is necessary to discuss it.</P>

      <P>My note of what the Leader said to Senator Manning was that the media do not give politicians a fair share and they have four years and eight or ten months to do it. Maybe I am wrong, but that is what I heard. I am not sure what relevance that has to the debate in hand, unless what we are really doing here is having a go at the media. I am sure the Leader will have time to respond to that.</P>
      <P>It seems that we are trying to turn the electorate into three wise monkeys. We do not want them to say or hear anything and we certainly not want them to do anything. That is the basis on which we are building a failed piece legislation. Time will prove that. This legislation is both reactive and regressive and of the worst type. It is something that politicians do towards the end of their regime, and that is something I will come back to. It proposes unnecessary actions and is driven by unfounded argument. It is a poor way for us to conduct our business. As a thoughtful House of the Oireachtas, with a legislative function and responsibility, it is not and should not be the way in which we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>It is also based on the faulty and failed premise that the people are really dumb and do not understand how to deal with the media, that the public cannot deal with the facts presented by an opinion poll and that the aggregated views of the electorate would be so much a danger to the health of Irish political life that we must strike it down. That is what this seems to be saying. There is no basis on which to move forward and do our business. We have debated many times the lack of involvement of the electorate with the work of politics. Time and again we have said that nobody takes any notice of the great work we do or the great things we have to say andthat nobody is making any judgment of how well we do our jobs. Yet the first time we see any measurement or yardstick being applied to us, we run a mile from it. It sends out an incorrect signal, and is one we should not support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should encourage the articulation of the views of the electorate. We should be looking forward to creating circumstances where people can offer their views on us, our legislation, policies and views. That should be something we would welcome. Only a Legislature, Government or political body which chooses to listen can be successful. If we do not want to hear, and we refuse to allow people to speak in aggregate, then we are certainly not ready to listen. We are afraid that if <Col N="1278" /> people hear how others are voting, thinking or what their intentions are, it will in some way create a flow away from us and we will lose them. If we are going to lose them that easily we do not deserve to be here in the first place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it comes down to. If we are afraid of the people we seek to represent, if we cannot handle, challenge and deal with their views, then we are in the wrong business. This is the business of engagement, interaction, challenge, leadership, direction and coping with the response we get from the electorate. That is what we need to do.</P>
      <P>We should be facilitating and encouraging political debate. We should encourage anything that allows us a clearer insight into the attitudes and views of our electorate. It is only when we can see things from the perspective of those we seek to represent that we can change their attitudes, lead them in another direction or manage their expectations. We certainly will not do that by saying we do not want them to speak or listen to what they say and then making sure that what they have to say has no influence on their neighbours or the people around them. This is in no way supportive. It is the very opposite of participation and engagement.</P>
      <P>It is also something which I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, to be unconstitutional on two grounds. I want it to be recommitted so that we can tease out these issues in more detail and have an exchange of views with the Minister. We could listen and learn from each other and move things forward. We propose to do this on Committee Stage where we would go through the details, offer a viewpoint, hear a response, make a reply, take a modified point of view and attempt to get the Minister to go forward. That is what we are about in this House, but we are not doing that here. That is a mistake.</P>
      <P>The right to free speech, enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution, is being seriously threatened here. This point was cogently made by at least two Attorneys General and by another constitutional lawyer. Not all of those were made to this Government, one of the Attorneys General gave his advice to a previous Government. The Constitution is very clear on the role of the Attorney General. Since I joined this House 15 years ago, on almost every Bill that I have challenged, I have been told that the reason my proposal could or might not be accepted was on the basis of advice from the Attorney General's office. That is something which we, and Governments, have to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is an Article in the Constitution which requires us to deal with this and gives probably the strongest reason for the recommital. I will go into more detail than I did earlier today and I ask the Leader to dwell on this. I accept the point he made this morning about the House being able to deal with and do its own business under Article 15 of the Constitution. The House is also subject to the Constitution. Its Standing <Col N="1279" /> Orders must be put together on the basis of the Constitution and be amenable to it.</P>
    <P>The important point I wish the Leader to consider is that the Constitution makes a distinction between Bills initiated in the Seanad from those initiated in the Dáil. The latter, if amended by the Seanad, return to the Dáil where the amendments made are considered. A Bill initiated in the Dáil and amended in the Seanad is sent back to the Dáil which is obliged by the Constitution to consider only the amendments made by the Seanad and not the whole Bill. That is contained in Article 20.1 which states:</P>
    <P>Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Éireann shall be sent to Seanad Éireann and may...be amended in Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann shall consider any such amendment.</P>
    <P>That is the point about legislation initiated in the Dáil. In terms of legislation initiated in the Seanad:</P>
    <P>A Bill initiated in Seanad Éireann if amended in Dáil Éireann shall be considered as a Bill initiated in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It begins again and returns to us as if it had been initiated in the Dáil. Therefore, it should go through all Stages and that is the reason this Bill should be treated in this manner. That is what is written in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Leader argued this morning that Article 15, which allows the House to establish its own Standing Orders, takes precedence over that. I do not accept that point and I am certain that the Constitution, in making a clear distinction between the way we deal with Bills referred back from the Dáil depending on whether they were initiated in the Dáil or Seanad, does so for a reason. Our Standing Orders should reflect that difference and they do not. Standing Order 103 deals in the same way with all Bills referred back to the Seanad, even though the Constitution deals with them differently.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of the Bill does not refer to section 59 which deals with polling. Neither was it mentioned in the financial and explanatory memorandum circulated initially. This means section 59 was not discussed in the House. We have not had the opportunity to deal with it on Second Stage or to amend it on Committee Stage, and we will now have one shot at it on Report Stage. That was never the way it was intended we would do our business. There has been a lack of discussion and it is wrong we should conduct our business in this manner. I appeal to my colleagues on the Government side to recognise that. I accept they are subject to the Whip and cannot do anything about it and we recognise we will be defeated on this. However, there is a deeper issue.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of a long discussion we had on the rod licence Bill in the last week of a session just before Christmas. It was dealt with in exactly the same way. It was rushed through the other House and, when it was discussed in this House, we tried to point out some of the problems which were clear to us, but it was pushed <Col N="1280" /> through to cause interminable grief for politicians for years after.</P>
    <P>The legislation we discuss is reactive. Every Government has introduced reactive legislation. We should keep a list and circulate it every time we discuss new legislation. Do Members remember the Bill to introduce dog muzzling or to deal with wandering horses? Every time a child is savaged by a dog or someone falls off a horse, or is kicked by a wandering horse, we introduce legislation. This Bill is similar. Someone had a good idea following the by-election in south Tipperary and legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>There is much more important and urgent legislation than this which needs to be dealt with. The Bill does not bring any honour on politicians and is of no use to the job we do. It does not protect us and leaves us open to ridicule. It shows we are afraid of the people and cannot cope. It sends out all the wrong signals. It undermines the role of the Seanad which is supposed to be a thoughtful legislative Chamber where we conduct our business by due consideration of the issues through a broad discussion, focused Committee Stage and general Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad to modify legislation has also been undermined. This legislation should have been returned to us as a matter of principle for us to debate the issues because they have not been discussed. Can anyone accept or agree that it is a proper way to conduct business by enacting legislation which is not discussed fully in either House? The Cathaoirleach said it is not our business to comment on how the other House conducts its business but, as Members of the Oireachtas, we must take the broad view of legislation which we are required to discuss.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House should write to the President asking her to consider two issues &ndash; how we have conducted our business and the business we have conducted. She should consider how we have conducted our business on the basis that our process under Standing Orders of the Seanad is out of kilter with, not amenable to and in contravention of what was contemplated and envisioned in Article 20 of the Constitution. She should consider the content of the legislation because it undermines the right to free speech as articulated in Article 40. I ask her to consider referring the Bill under Article 26 to the Supreme Court for a ruling. If the Supreme Court finds the Bill is unconstitutional or has been compiled unconstitutionally, that reflects the failure of the political system. We effectively have our wrists slapped.</P>
    <P>Introducing legislation on the basis that we cannot trust the people with information is the basis of fascism, censorship and a totalitarian state and is the basis on which all dictatorships have been run since the beginning of history. It is the mushroom policy of keeping the people in the dark. We cannot have any hand, act or part in this type of development. I do not know how we as Members of a responsible House of the Oireachtas can take a decision which ignores the views put forward by the Attorney General. That cannot be right and we should examine it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> Most importantly, since this was mooted a week ago, every public view articulated on talk shows and phone-ins has opposed the measure. We are acting the bully by putting it up to the people and coming out with our fists high saying we will not be changed, moved or shifted by the views of the mere people whose support we seek at elections. We are effectively saying that we know better, we will teach them to know better, that they should understand better and that they will not have their way on this because we are doing it our way.</P>
    <P>Our way should be the people's way. It is not that we should run in front of them but that, if there is a difference of opinion, we should try to manage their expectations and views and change their attitudes to the political process. We should not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, which is what we are about here, or try to ensure the people do not have their say or have their voice heard.</P>
    <P>Neither should we have a cut at the media. We do not need to do this. We can take them on on our own terms whenever we need to do so. They are not all-powerful. If they set themselves up as the moral authority, we can also expose them and it is our role to do so if we see them doing that. We should not be slavishly for or against them. We need to have a clear view.</P>
    <P>I recognise I have spoken at some length on this issue but, in terms of what we are dealing with and the basic principles involved, namely, the right to free speech, the way we conduct our business, respect for the people's views, a free press, the manner in which we have political engagement, the participation of the community, engagement of those we seek to represent and for the solid constitutional, legal and other views put forward by eminent lawyers in recent days, it would be the height of foolishness for us to rush through this legislation.</P>
    <P>As a fall-back position, will the Leader recommit section 59 and accept this is put forward with the best possible intentions and objectives in the interests of transparency? It would send a positive signal from the Upper House of the Oireachtas that Members care about the people's point of view and will represent them without shutting them up.</P>

      <P>Article 15 of the Constitution states that each House shall make its own rules. Standing Order 103 provides that a Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil shall be placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. Prior to these motions, we did exactly that when we dealt with the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. That Bill has far-reaching implications and I would contend it is just as important as the Bill now before us. As that is the norm, I do not understand the hullabaloo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The hullabaloo is about capturing the imagination of the media. I wish to inform the House that there is no general election imminent and the worst thing any politician could do would be to overdo it at the wrong time. Senator O'Toole got his elevation last week, on which I congratulate him because he richly deserved it. He has been a wonderful Senator and has made magnificent contributions. However, his last one would not be in my top ten. I have always respected his views and I listened carefully and attentively to what he had to say.</P>
      <P>This aspect has been debated in a very relaxed fashion and I hope that for the remainder of the evening, week and month there will be no muzzling of anyone. Senators should not allow themselves to be rushed because that is not the intention of this side of the House. There will be no rushing on this side and we do not want the opposite side to be caught in the jam going out the door for the summer holidays. Please do not allow that to happen.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is incorrect. A poll was taken since Deputy Olivia Mitchell tabled her amendment. The result was 53 in favour of a seven day poll ban and 47 against. Therefore, the Government is doing something right by supporting the Fine Gael-Labour amendment. There is all-party agreement on the issue. If the Independents have a difficulty perhaps that is why they are Independents. They were all born into the family. Most of them were in Fianna Fáil. Perhaps it is because there was no room in the inn that they had to get in somewhere else. However, it is wonderful to have them here because they make a great contribution. All I ask is that they allow the legislation to be debated and stop filibustering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 94, line 30, to delete &ldquo;a presidential&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;an&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down so that we can air the issue of which polls are subject to this ban and which are not. I cannot understand certain ingredients in this Bill. Why have certain polls been chosen while others have been omitted? Whatever the benefits of banning opinion polls from Dáil elections, to ban them from presidential elections is absolutely absurd. It is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>Supposedly, in Dáil elections issues arise which are of some importance to the public and the media. In presidential elections there are no political issues involved. That is one of the big problems. There are no issues at all because they are not allowed to discuss politics. Banning opinion polls removes one of the key influences on that particular election. It is an influence and there is nothing wrong with publishing the influential information. Presidential elections are non-contests in terms of issues. Information on presidential elections is pretty scarce to begin with and the sort of information provided by polls is invaluable.</P>
      <P>I contend that opinion poll information influences people in a small way. There is nothing wrong with that because it tells people what other people are thinking. It tells people how many think this, how many think that and how many think the other. Why should people not be entitled to that information? It is material. Someone may say, &ldquo;This candidate is very close to winning and that will bring me to the polls. I was not going to vote otherwise.&rdquo; That is material and a very good reason for voting. As Senator Manning said in his speech a little while ago, someone else may well decide not to get out of bed because the result is a foregone conclusion according to the polls. That is legitimate and no one is obliged to vote. The information is useful in letting people know there is no point in casting that vote. It is also useful in letting them know that there is every point in casting that vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of banning opinion polls when political promises are allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged is ridiculous. The one thing we <Col N="1286" /> know about opinion polls is that they are fact. They are information, they are solid and they are accurate. Promises from all political parties and indeed from Independents are inaccurate, dishonest, not kept, exaggerated and totally untrue. They are honoured more in the breach than in the observance, and yet they are allowed to go unchecked. The media will be able to have a field day in publishing promises which mean nothing and will be forbidden from publishing accurate figures. Where are we going?</P>
    <P>Someone asked me if I should declare an interest in this. I really do not know whether I should or not, to be honest. I am quite sincere. I have no interest in this, but I am an employee of Independent Newspapers, who probably have an interest, and if that means I have an interest, so be it. I disagree with Independent Newspapers on so many other issues, however, that I do not see why I should declare an interest on an issue in which I do agree with them because it makes no difference to me, as an employee, whether or not opinion polls are banned. I must say, however, that I am an employee in case anybody does not know. It is in my declaration of interests.</P>
    <P>There is another area which I do not understand and I have touched on it in this amendment. Why are opinion polls allowed in Seanad elections? The Minister will state that Senators are not democratically elected by a popular vote and, therefore, it does not arise. That is the sort of contorted logic which one would expect from a Government which can put forward this sort of proposal. Senator Norris and I have an electorate of about 40,000. We, or somebody else on our behalf, could easily carry out a telephone poll during a Seanad election. Our electorate is almost as large as that of a Dáil constituency.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and more importantly, Senators O'Toole, Quinn and Ryan have an electorate of over 100,000, which is as big as that in any constituency in the country. It may not be a popular election in the sense that there is a geographical area which one can pin it to, but it would be easier still to have an opinion poll carried out among those people. A random accurate sampling of those people could be carried out by telephone and the results could be published.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason one cannot have opinion polls in a Dáil election but we can have them in a Seanad election. This is the sort of nonsense which we must put up with in this Bill because it was hastily thought out. In fact, it was not thought out at all.</P>
    <P>Opinion polls can be held during by-elections for local authorities. Before anybody says to me that they are not elected democratically, let me say that many by-elections in local authorities are dealt with by nominating substitutes. Senator Coogan will confirm this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no reason political parties should not carry out opinion polls for sensible <Col N="1287" /> reasons before making those nominations to find out who is popular and who is not. Under this Bill they can do that and such polls can be published. If a political party is putting somebody forward in a by-election to fill a vacancy, the most sensible course of action is to carry out an opinion poll to find out who is most likely to be elected at the next election and then put them forward as a substitute. I do not see anything wrong with that. It is a sensible course of action. However, I do not understand why such opinion polls should be allowed and published while other opinion polls are not. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to address that problem.</P>
      <P>The reason the amendment was proposed in the Dáil was the by-election. That amendment in the Bill is due to one of the biggest electoral cock-ups of all time. It is a knee-jerk reaction to a by-election result which has come as a result of two parties thinking that it is in their interests to have no opinion polls because of one opinion poll which was published. Fine Gael thought that opinion polls should be banned because they thought there would be complacency as a result of the opinion poll which was taken and their man might lose, and Fianna Fáil thought that the opinion poll did them damage because they had some sort of momentum going and it stopped their candidate in his tracks. I do not know whether they were right or wrong, but one of them was certainly completely wrong.</P>
      <P>I commend Senators Manning and Coogan and the rest of the Fine Gael Party for changing their stance on this so quickly.</P>

      <P>I suppose that Senator Manning, quite rightly, is not bound by front bench decisions any longer. He decided to persuade his colleagues that this was a mistake and he is lead<Col N="1288" /> ing them now on the path of righteousness. That is what we want to see in a political party and it is a tremendous achievement to persuade a partner in one's own party in such a short time that he or she has made such a terrible mistake. It was a pretty hasty decision in the first place. I gather it went through the front bench quickly and was not given lengthy consideration, that it was introduced on Committee Stage without a great deal of thought and that on reflection they decided that this issue, which they had raised and which the Government had run with, was one which they should not have run with at all. Therefore, they have come into the Seanad and said that they want a proper debate, and they are right. That is commendable.</P>
      <P>What they have done, of course, is left the poor unfortunate Government holding the baby. The Government did not really want this in the first place anyway. We now have the Government, who did not really want it, supporting it and Fine Gael, who raised it in the first place, opposing it.</P>

      <P>This is good stuff. The House will be glad to hear that I must leave for a few minutes but I will be back, but I want to make a serious point before I finish. Opinion polls are not just informative; they are also entertainment. People should not lose sight of that. They are solid entertainment. Opinion polls coming up to general elections are one of the most enjoyable parts of those elections for the general public. People talk non-stop about opinion polls. There is nothing wrong with that sort of entertainment. What is happening here is the politicians are taking two decisions: they are stopping entertainment at their own expense &ndash; they would not stop entertainment at anybody else's expense &ndash; and they are stopping information about themselves which they do not want people to have. This is utterly inexcusable. I would like to see this proposal to ban opinion polls of any form excluded but in order to have a Committee Stage style debate on this, I am prepared to introduce only these amendments regarding opinion polls at Seanad and presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, even though I feel I may be placing myself in some jeopardy in that I may be threatened by the congratulations of Senator Ross. I had noted the heavy irony with which he delivered bouquets of congratulations liberally around the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, there is a glorious inconsistency in the amendments themselves. This is all part of our harassing intent in regard to this Bill. We intend <Col N="1289" /> to try to make a dent in it or at least make a mark of some kind on it. When I say it is inconsistent, I mean that it is rather like that old tune, a line of which ran, &ldquo;I stepped out and I stepped in again&rdquo;, because in these amendments we are deleting the word presidential and inserting a reference to Seanad elections. This creates a nice kind of balance. There is a certain inconsistency in doing so but it is probably a deliberate and glorious inconsistency.</P>
    <P>Of course there are all kinds of odd features contained in this legislation. Senator Ross is correct when he says that it has opened up certain risks and chasms. In fact, a Member on the Government side said to me in a moment of exasperation during one of the divisions &ndash; I was given permission to quote the Member by name but I will not do so &ndash;&ldquo;This was an amendment of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, was it not? We did not want it.&rdquo; They certainly ran with it when they got it. Within the Opposition parties in the Dáil, I noted with some amusement that Deputy Gilmore stated he was fully in favour of it. Then Deputy Quinn attacked it and said the party would be objecting to it. Deputy Gilmore said he would bow to party discipline and authority. There were masses of inconsistent responses.</P>
    <P>In terms of how the Bill can fall short, one newspaper pointed out that there is absolutely nothing in the legislation to prevent, for example, a broadcast or print media source in Northern Ireland commissioning a telephone poll from there and printing it in newspapers available down here. Therefore it will not work, unless the Government, in an act of benevolence towards Northern industry, wishes to boost the sales of Northern newspapers.</P>
    <P>I notice another feature not included in the Bill. Because there is a certain definition of a opinion poll, constituents have been in contact with me wondering, perhaps humorously, if it will be illegal for betting shops to take odds on election candidates. That is a kind of opinion poll or survey of the betting public. After all, political commentators frequently refer to voters as &ldquo;your average punter&rdquo; before elections. It is quite likely that if somebody hired a van and went around the polling stations, keeping a distance of 100 yards or whatever is specified, he could offer odds to the people going in and out. These examples are absurd perhaps, but the very idea of the Bill seems absurd.</P>
    <P>The very absurdity of the Bill should not conceal the fact that it is a matter of very serious concern. I have already referred to a constituent who contacted me by telephone this morning. I also received an e-mail from a graduate of both university systems, an elector in both the constituency represented by Senator Ross and myself and that represented by Senators O'Toole and Quinn. This constituent states:</P>
    <P>I write in a totally personal capacity as a member of both university constituencies. I am appalled almost beyond words at the passage <Col N="1290" /> in the Dáil of the Electoral Bill, in particular the proposal, almost ludicrous if it were not in earnest, that free expression of opinion be banned. This issue is at the core of the democracy here. Whatever the political difficulties that may be caused by the publishing of these polls in the days prior to an election or referendum, the benefits of free speech vastly outweigh them. I believe that the Constitution has something to say on this also.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that he would attempt to have this referred. He is asking all the Members of the House to write to the President. The Irish National Newspapers Organisation sent me a fax saying they have petitioned the President to refer the Bill.</P>
    <P>The correspondence of my constituent, who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the Nice treaty referendum, continues thus:</P>
    <P>What is almost as important is that this plan rushed through in peak of anger after the Government, as Governments do, lost a bye-election, reflects contempt for the electorate. In the first instance, we were too stupid to make up our minds and need to be swayed by the publication of the views of others; in the second, akin to the reaction of the political establishment to results of the Nice referendum, a negative to the establishment is seen as a reflection of the fickleness, perfidy, stupidity and churlishness of the electorate rather than a reaction to the isolation and aloofness of the political establishment. Finally, I hope the university Senators will defend the rights to free speech and free expression.</P>
    <P>By opposing this Bill vigorously, we are defending the rights to free speech and expression.</P>
    <P>It is important that Senator Ross has tabled these amendments. The inconsistencies are in the manner of a parliamentary tactic. They are rather curious when they include the Dáil. Perhaps the Minister of State will address this. When the Dáil is included, why is the Seanad ignored?</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning, I referred to the fact that Fintan O'Toole, a distinguished journalist, in discussing this matter on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night, categorically stated that the Bill had passed. He said, &ldquo;There has been no debate on this law in the Oireachtas, which has now been passed.&rdquo; Apparently, a highly distinguished correspondent for <i>The Irish Times</i> believes we are a unicameral State. Is it the Government's position as well? Is this the reason the Seanad was removed from the Bill?</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is quite correct to include the Seanad. Every time there is legislation of this nature, where the Dáil is mentioned the Seanad should also be mentioned as a matter of course. I am happy to support this amendment and I have little doubt that it will be put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bouquets scattered around by Senator Ross, if picked up, would be found to be <Col N="1291" /> very thorny and full of nettles as well. Doubtless, the Senator was being heavily ironic. If he had listened carefully to what was said in the debate on the Order of Business, by both Senator Manning and myself, he would know nobody said anything about the value or lack of value of opinion polls, whether they are of benefit or if they influence people. The issue we raised was not about the benefits of polling seven days before an election or anything of that kind, but concerned the Government's decision that the processing of legislation would be cut off at the knees. The Government made a decision to guillotine a serious aspect of a very serious Bill. We feel very strongly that the opportunity to debate should be given to one of the Houses. I call upon the Minister of State to allow this discussion to be a Second Stage debate to examine all the issues concerned.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers made interesting points about the value of retaining polling up to seven days before and election or not at all. Such comments make one reflect on whether one should vote against it. The more I listen to speakers who are against the concept of banning polling, the more I begin to question the issue myself. I have not been fully convinced and I want to hear more debate. That is the purpose of the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, the Lower House decided that the issue would be decided by the Government without consultation. That is not the way to pass legislation. In a true democracy, opportunities are given to everybody to examine every aspect of a Bill. Therefore, we rose to our feet this morning, not as Senator Ross said, with the intention of doing an about turn, but with the intention of having the issue examined and debated fully prior to a decision being made &ndash; a decision based on well considered concepts about the value of polling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In my years in this House, I have not heard such outrage from the public as I have heard about the way this item has been handled, particularly in the other House. I know we do not debate in the Seanad what has happened in the other House &ndash; we are debating amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49. I have great difficulty in understanding why the Government is pushing this legislation through in spite of the total absence of debate in the other House and our not being allowed to have a Second Stage debate on the matter. There will be an inquiry into the constitutionality of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Words such as dictatorship and fascism were used earlier. These are the words that come to mind when a government begins to act like the present Government. It is incredible that it thinks it can stifle information. This Government is the one that supports a Freedom of Information Act, admired throughout the world. Before freedom of information legislation was introduced, we looked at similar legislation in other countries and created the best legislation there is. I gather <Col N="1292" /> that other countries are now looking at our freedom of information legislation. Then the Government comes along with a proposal to stifle information, because it does not want the public to know how other people feel.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the proposal is worthy of consideration in relation to the Nice referendum. It seems when the public opinion polls showed a huge majority would vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, large numbers of people decided not to bother going out to vote and we ended up with a very low poll. I can understand the need for action on that and perhaps that is the objective. However, it is only one of several objectives and, as Senator O'Toole said, it is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There is no need for this insistance on getting it through this week without debate and with such unseemly haste.</P>
    <P>I telephoned a young politician in France last night to ask about the position there, because I understood France had a similar law in place. He told me France had introduced a similar law 15 years ago, but that a Bill is currently before the French Parliament which will overturn the law which cancelled polls one week before elections. I have not heard that mentioned here today or in the other House where no debate whatsoever took place. Here we are jumping into something the French did 15 years ago yet decided to change because they realised they had made a mistake.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State realise the embarrassment this will cause for a country like ours which has been held in such high regard elsewhere in Europe? We will become a laughing stock. They will ask what the Irish are doing introducing a Bill similar to one the French enacted 15 years ago, perhaps for very worthy reasons, which they have now introduced legislation to cancel.</P>
    <P>Ireland used to be the butt of jokes ten or 15 years ago. Irish jokes were always being told on British television. One does not hear those any more. Talking about this last night, we were told that one of the reasons was that the image of the Irish person 15 years ago was of someone who was not very clever or sensible, was on low income and was forced to emigrate because he or she could find work at home. Now the image of the Irish is of young, bright, articulate, intelligent, hi-tech, successful people who are among the wealthiest in Europe. We are very proud of that image. Then we are seen to do this, introduce a Bill and disallow debate on it only to discover that the French have changed their minds about similar legislation they introduced 15 years ago. That is sufficient reason to slow down and think twice about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me address the amendment on the presidential elections. Again I refer to France. During the last presidential election in France, a newspaper based in Geneva in Switzerland published a poll three days before the election and invited the French people to check out on its Internet site how they intended to vote. What will happen if UTV decides to conduct a telephone poll of 1,000 or 10,000 people south of the Border during the next presidential election and then decides to publish it as it is entitled to do? Can we say the law is achieving what it set out to do? Of course not, because we would be unable to do anything about it. I have taken UTV as an example because it is on this island and could make local weekend calls so the exercise would not cost much. It would be unfair competition for newspapers although I am not greatly concerned about that.</P>
      <P>I hate to think that, as an independent, highly regarded State, we are passing laws that make a mockery of what we are trying to achieve. The Government will pass the law only to find it does not work, having been told by us that it could not work. We are debating all three amendments so this applies to presidential and Seanad elections. We have to think this out. We need to hear from the Minister what steps will be taken if the <i>Irish News, </i>the <i>Newsletter</i> or the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> decides to conduct and publish a poll here. Will we ban it on this side of the Border? It is censorship not to allow newspapers into the country because they are breaking our law. I do not believe either we would do that, or that we would or should be able to do it.</P>
      <P>What happens during a presidential election if a medium outside the State publishes an opinion poll taken inside the State? Will we ignore it or ban it? If those questions are answered, we can allow the next step to proceed. I also ask the Minister how he would handle the scenario that has arisen in France, where a law was introduced 15 years ago to outlaw the publication of opinion polls eight days before elections and which has now introduced a law to cancel it? I urge the Minister to think this through and provide a response that will put to rest the minds of the people. I will support the amendments unless I hear something new to persuade me to the contrary.</P>

      <P>As I said, as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in 1991 when the idea of banning opinion polls was first mooted, Mr. Padraig Flynn has confirmed that the Attorney General of the day, Mr. John Murray SC, now a Supreme Court judge, sounded a note of caution as to the constitutionality of the proposal. Mr. Justice Murray said that it could be vulnerable to challenge on the grounds that it might interfere with the rights of the public, opinion poll organisations or, indeed, the right of candidates and political parties to impart and receive information. That was then, this is now and we should not move beyond this point at this juncture without having available to us the best legal advice we can obtain.</P>
      <P>That advice must come to us from the Attorney General. We deserve to know from the Attorney General that the relevant constitutional provision protecting the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions is not being infringed by anything we do as legislators. That would be a bad day for democracy. If the Government is determined to persist in not making available to the House the views of the Attorney General I hope the President will convene a meeting of the Council of State and subsequently exercise her right to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for a test of its constitutionality.</P>
      <P>Opinion polls can have four possible effects. Their effect can be absolutely neutral. Some people might not pay attention to them and not even read about them in newspapers. They can also increase or induce apathy. This is very dangerous. If an opinion poll indicates a clear-cut outcome some people might not bother voting because they feel their vote would make no difference. Public apathy and cynicism about politics is already on the increase and this, perhaps, represents the biggest single threat to democracy. The falling turn-out at elections and an increased reluctance by people to become involved in politics represents a problem which strikes at the core of the democratic process. In every general election since 1981 the turn-out has fallen and the situation is even worse for referendums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third possible effect is that a voter who is very interested in politics might decide to make the maximum use of the PR system and give his number one preference to the candidate who had scored lowest in the opinion poll and work through an order of preference to whomever he wants to favour most. The final possible effect, which has received much comment, is the band<Col N="1295" /> wagon effect. People reading opinion polls might wish to support the winner. I heard a prominent political commentator say on television that she reserved the right to join a bandwagon and wished to know where it was going.</P>

      <P>RTE also did a <i>vox pop </i>of which many Senators will have heard. It showed clearly that opinion polls could and do influence people and could also increase apathy. None of us wishes to jeopardise freedom of expression. The nub of this matter is the advice of the Attorney General. I would like to hear this advice before we proceed. Perhaps the Minister of State will impart that advice to the House. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that we are discussing three amendments, in the names of Senators O'Toole and others. The first proposes that presidential elections should not be included in any ban on opinion polls. The second, in the names of Senators O'Toole and Ross, proposes that Seanad elections should be covered by a ban on opinion polls for seven days before the election date and the third amendment proposes that by-elections to the Dáil should be covered by the ban on opinion polls.</P>
      <P>The question of opinion polls has been hyped in the past week and the manner of this hype is regrettable. An article in one of last Sunday's newspapers carried the headline &ldquo;Just like pigs at the trough, arrogance and greed are the hallmarks of the current Dáil.&rdquo; The article continued at some length on the issue. For the many people in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in local government who have given unstinting and selfless service over many years, that was gratuitously offensive and was unworthy of the person who expressed the opinion. If such intemperate language was used about a minority there would be an outcry and it would be described as racist, sexist or homophobic. It is regrettable that the debate has descended to that level.</P>
      <P>What influence do opinion polls have on presidential, Seanad and by-elections, to make my point relevant?</P>

      <P>The people who have tabled these amendments have been strongly influenced by the media. The media have an entitlement to express their point of view. However, the Irish electorate, which is politically sophisticated, has an interest in the outcome of opinion polls and in politics generally. It would have been better if it had been acknowledged that opinion polls are extremely good copy. They are commercially valuable for newspapers and I see nothing wrong with newspapers protecting their own commercial interests. However, it is disingenuous to raise this issue under the guise of protecting freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>All that is being banned is the systematic taking and publication of polls within the last seven days of an election campaign. I know of no scientific evidence on this matter but there may be anecdotal evidence.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 49 refers to by-elections. On the evening of the count in the Tipperary South by-election, after watching the second half of the Munster final on television, I listened on my way home to a radio discussion of the outcome of the by-election. A number of political commentators were participating and one of the issues raised was whether the TG4 opinion poll had in some way influenced the outcome of the election. The general view from the participants, who were all representative of the media, was that that it had not, with one exception. That exception was that they felt the Labour candidate who was at the bottom of the TG4 poll with about 16% may have suffered by people transferring votes elsewhere because of the opinion poll. In my view that type of anecdotal evidence is important and needs to be factored into the debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our political system, based on proportional representation, has a large sensitivity to a small number of votes. Many seats are won by only a handful of votes and therefore anything, other <Col N="1297" /> than the merits of the candidates and political parties, that unduly influences the election should be looked at seriously. Those seats can decide the Government and there is a considerable amount at stake politically and nationally.</P>
    <P>After the last referendum, a number of people said to me in almost apologetic terms that they had not voted and regretted it. Because of the opinion polls leading up to the vote, they had assumed that it would be passed. That can occur either way. We want to encourage as many people as possible to participate at elections. A worrying aspect of the democratic system in the western world &ndash; not just in Ireland &ndash; is the number of people not exercising their franchise. I would not suggest that having opinion polls is the primary reason, but if they are influencing even a small proportion of people not to exercise their franchise, then there is merit in doing it.</P>
    <P>Opinion polls can be carried out and published at any time other than that one week.</P>

I accept that your ruling is correct and I appreciate your tolerance on it. I will now come back to the issue and the amendments we are dealing with. We felt it was necessary to put down these amendments, not because we wanted these particular proposals to be applied to elections, but simply to point out how ludicrous the legislation is, how rushed it has been and how it has been cobbled together.</P>
      <P>The definition of an election to this House does not even include the issues we mentioned. For the sake of posterity we would like to put our hands up and say we are here too. We must also provide for presidential elections &ndash; we should look at all elections and treat them equally. We cannot accept the definition of an election which does not include elections to this House. Maybe we are just trying to make ourselves seen and heard, or being assertive. Maybe we want to protect the presidency in the same way. Even this negative legislation should include all elections in its definition.</P>

      <P>In page 32, before section 35, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;35.&ndash;No opinion poll shall be taken or published in the 7 day period prior to any election or referendum and no opinion poll whatsoever shall be published in the 7 day period prior to any election or referendum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those were the terms, and in the new legislation section 59 states:</P>
      <P>(3) A person shall not carry out or cause to be carried out an opinion poll on any of the 7 days immediately preceding the polling day at an election or referendum.</P>
      <P>(4) A person shall not publish or cause to be published on any of the 7 days mentioned in <i>subsection (3)</i> the results of an opinion poll, being a poll that&ndash;</P>

      <P>I will address the amendments before us. Amendment No. 47 seeks to delete a presidential election from the provisions of the section. The amendment is not accepted as opinion polls could have a more serious effect on the outcome of a presidential election than other elections because of the nature of the election. It was claimed by the Fine Gael candidate that this occurred at the 1990 election.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 48 seeks to include Seanad elections in the prohibition of opinion polls. Seanad elections are excluded as they are not direct elections and it would be difficult to conduct a professional poll among such a disparate electorate&mdash;</P>

Also the elections are to different panels in the case of panel elections or different university establishments. An Opposition amendment was accepted on the Seanad Committee Stage debate to exclude <Col N="1304" /> Seanad elections from some of the Bill's provisions because of the vocational nature of the Seanad and now I am being asked to include Seanad elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is typical of the attitude of this Administration &ndash; not only to the people but also to the Parliament. None of the points, bar the bare points in the amendments, was addressed by the Minister. I would have thought that the Minister, although he is supplied with a script &ndash; and we accept that &ndash; would have taken the trouble to take the points that were made and replied to them. Some people here went to a great deal of trouble to make serious points in this debate and they have done so all day. If the Government does not take this particular Bill seriously, then that is fine if they want to rush it through but it is showing a complete contempt for the Seanad as they did for the Dáil on this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government on this Bill is quite simple. I commend Senator Walsh at least for speaking on it &ndash; although I do not agree with him he spoke on it and did so articulately &ndash; and Senator Rory Kiely for putting a point of view with which we do not agree. At least they are defending it. There is another point of view &ndash; we are not so intolerant on this side that we do not believe there is another point of view &ndash; but for the Minister to come after God knows how many speakers have made serious points on these amendments and to read a one page script written by civil servants makes me wonder what is behind this Bill. I would have expected &ndash; and I accept that he is a Minister of State of great competence &ndash; that he would come here with the authority and respect for this House that he would actually reply to the points made here. This is inadequate and contemptible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take one or two points which the Minister made &ndash; I think he only made two, so it will not take very long. He addressed the issue of the Seanad elections. He is completely wrong about that. Obviously the Government did not think this through. It would be the simplest thing in the world &ndash; not difficult &ndash; to get a sample of Senator Quinn's constituency and take an opinion poll by telephone on it. I believe it consists of some 100,000 people now and the Minister <Col N="1305" /> can correct me, but is that not the size of an average constituency? We are talking about a geographical constituency for the Dáil and a non-geographical constituency for the Seanad &ndash; the numbers are roughly the same. Let me tell the Minister how difficult it would be. You get a book with 100,000 names in it, look up their telephone numbers, dial numbers which have been selected at random and ask them which way they are going to vote. That is an opinion poll. It is very simple to do and would be just as accurate as any other telephone poll that was taken and which is forbidden.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary anomaly there &ndash; it just was not thought about. This is a completely cocked up Bill and there is no logic behind it whatsoever. Senator Quinn might well think of doing that at the next election because that sort of opinion poll would give very valuable information. I have done it in local elections before &ndash; if you get a reasonable sample you know where your strength is and find out what the issues are. It is just a formula and then you get people to vote for you. I did it myself in Bray. I was miles behind in the first local election then did an opinion poll, found out where the strength in every camp was, found out what the issues were and the idiots went and elected me. That is what happened and it can be done at Seanad elections. Let us not have this kind of inconsistency that is going on. It is perfectly fair to do it at Seanad elections and even on the panels. Any Senator here can correct me on this; there are about 900 or 1,000 votes on the panels, and one could easily conduct an opinion poll there that would be pretty accurate. Maybe because of the nature of the electorate they would not tell the truth in that case. There may be a difficulty there as they are notable for not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>To talk about the vocational nature of the Seanad is nonsense. It is not the vocational nature of the electorate &ndash; it is utterly irrelevant when it comes to the electorate &ndash; but only of the nominating body. One is not going to be polling the nominating body, but the councillors, Deputies and Senators who have votes. Out of those 900, one could easily get a good sum which might give one an accurate response. There is inconsistency in what is being said.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not reply to the point I made about the Presidency or anybody else. There are no issues in presidential elections. They are mindless beauty contests. There cannot be any issues because the President has to be above politics by definition. Opinion polls are probably the most accurate, interesting and relevant information one can get on presidential elections because they are solid facts. They allow one to know where the various candidates stand and they influence one's vote. There is nothing wrong with that. To know where public opinion stands is a valuable tool when exercising one's democratic right. I do not accept that these issues, minor as they may seem in the bigger political picture <Col N="1306" /> which has exploded in the Government's face, are being considered.</P>
    <P>There is some validity in what Senator Walsh said about the press being somewhat partisan on this issue. I cannot see how we can blame them. One would not expect them to do anything else. If we said to the press, we will ban advertising, we would not expect them to say that is a good idea, that they will not allow stories that sell newspapers. Opinion polls happen to be an issue that sells newspapers, but they also happen to be something that the public want. That is the whole point of them. I do not know very much about selling newspapers, but I know that opinion polls sell them. I accept that, but there is nothing wrong with that. There is a great hunger for this type of information. That is why newspapers sell more if they carry an opinion poll on the front page. The population want and have a right to that information. For people to say the press are getting hysterical is like saying they should not have the right to defend what is a commercial interest to them, but it is not an evil commercial interest, it happens to be a commercial interest which the public also want. The evidence is there that newspapers sell more when they carry opinion polls. This has been presented&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, made a coherent and valid case for what the Government has done. That appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday or the day before &ndash; I am not sure of the date. John Waters who is in a prominent position was allowed to have a go quite freely and say that he believed that banning opinion polls was perfectly all right. This is not completely and utterly one-sided. Partisan articles have been written on the other side. It is also insulting to think that in presidential elections or other elections the public will be bamboozled by articles on one side and they will not get to consider the other side. The press does not have that sort of power. Where the power lies in the media is not in the press but in television and radio. They are far more powerful than the press. They make a far stronger and far more lasting impression on people. It is absurd to be paranoid about the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State did not respond to one or two other points raised by speakers to which he should have responded. Once one suppresses information of this sort, where does it stop? Who makes these decisions that one thing is bad for people to hear and another thing is good for them <Col N="1308" /> to hear? If this is allowed, and I am being serious about this, the next thing that will be stopped will be the presenting of ideas. Ideas are far more dangerous than information.</P>

      <P>There are no ideas but there are plenty of people. That is why we will lose. Ideas are far more dangerous and subversive than information. If the presenting of information of this sort is to be stopped in the last seven days &ndash; some people wanted it to be 14 days &ndash; before presidential or Seanad elections, the next thing they will do is stop ideas being presented in these types of elections. I can see that happening because they are deciding that information of this sort is bad for the public.</P>
      <P>We saw censorship here before. I happen to approve of it in certain situations where violence is involved. We got rid of censorship under section 31. We are now seeing censorship of completely and utterly harmless, but extremely entertaining and important information. The next thing we will see is censorship of more information and then we will see censorship of ideas.</P>
      <P>We are going down a very dangerous road. I do not think the Government has any evil intent in this. It has blundered into this. It played a little political trick by trapping the Opposition into taking a position which it did not really want to take. It then decided to run with it, but its heart is not in it.</P>
      <P>Before I put the amendment to a vote, I ask the Minister of State in subsequent amendments to reply to points made by individuals. If he is going to read from his script, which he is perfectly entitled to do, he should also reply to the points made by individuals in the House.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 50 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 94, line 36, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;over eighteen years of age&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of definition. I am somewhat confused by this clause. It is really a matter of drafting and perhaps the Minister could help the House in this. Section 59(1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; means a systematic inquiry conducted by means of questioning a sample of persons considered to be representative of the population of the State or any part thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the likely opinions of the population of the State as a whole or part thereof on matters relating to an election or referendum referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i> including the manner in which the population of the State or part thereof may vote in such election or referendum;</P>
      <P>I assume this excludes by definition anyone under the age of 18 years, but what if an opinion pollster or an organisation or an individual, wishes to poll people who are under the age of 18, and is that legal? I presume this will be taken and is assumed as being people over the age of 18 and therefore being of the age of majority, but it does not say that anywhere. I would like to know where and how this is defined and why we are to understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue concerns a matter of some significance. Members of the House will be aware that there is a very pro-active attitude among teachers to gain the interest of students in the democratic process. It has become common in many schools to role-play an election at election time. The children are encouraged to express their views and newspapers regularly publish the results of the poll taken in local schools and compare how close the results are to the actual election results.</P>
      <P>The Bill as published defines an opinion poll as: &ldquo;a sample of persons considered to be representative of the population of the State or any part thereof&rdquo;. This goes way beyond the question of opinion polling for elections. These might be the views of school students who do not even have a vote. This is now part of normal school work, it is part of civics teaching in most post-primary schools. It also features at primary level and it is used as an attempt to deepen the engagement with the democratic process, to ensure that there is a greater understanding of the democratic process of elections. People are encouraged to participate in elections. The school class will debate the election, talk about the issues, look at the election material and offer points of view. A mock or quasi-election is then held and the results and conclusions are published. This is now very definitely a breach of this section.</P>
      <P>It probably indicates some of the worries that this legislation will intrude into the most unlikely parts of the life of the citizens and society. I would have expected this to be discussed with amendment No. 67, which deals with persons engaged in polling for academic or research purposes. This is one of the daft consequences of this proposed legislation and there are some others also. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment and at least ensure the normal educational processes and the operation of civics classes and the chance to give students a greater understanding of the electoral process would not be interfered with.</P>
      <P>I do not misunderstand the section. It is absolutely clear in its meaning. Prior to the last referendum the various Departments circulated information about Europe to schools. There was no referendum on the euro but there might have been. We are seeking to bring children and young people to a greater understanding. Effectively, that activity would be in breach of the legislation and that is another reason for not going through with this ridiculous, ludicrous, insidious and invidious Bill. I ask the Minister of State to recognise that the clean thing to do would be to withdraw the whole thing. If he cannot do that he should at least ensure that those who are not adults, who are not voters and who are part of the school system are exempt from this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Independent Senators for putting down this amendment. It has the effect of showing the daft nature of this proposal when it is closely examined. Of course, we are the only ones getting an opportunity to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read the definition of &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; it occurred to me straightaway how broad it is. In a school a leaving certificate or pre-leaving certificate class of 17 year olds could be barred from holding their own opinion poll. That is daft in the <Col N="1313" /> context of civics classes, learning about politics and training in the political system before engaging to a full extent in it. It shows up how crazy this proposal actually is. I appeal to the Minister to accept this reasonable and simple amendment thereby avoiding a proposal the applicability of which enters into the realms of craziness.</P>
    <P>A number of Members have said it was never the intention of the proposers of this amendment to restrict the free flow of information. The thinking behind it was to avoid undue influence by opinion polls on the voter. That was based on the thinking that the voter is influenced by opinion polls despite the fact that we have no evidence to that effect. Earlier in the day I would have said the same but as the debate has gone on I am beginning to wonder. I reiterate that we have to look again at the proposal before us here. The implications are not only daft, some of them are actually horrendous to contemplate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No one would do other than encourage participation in civic classes. It gives young people an interest and an insight into what is not the most easily understood electoral system in the world &ndash; our system of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>The word daft was used but the interpretation being put on this is not just daft, it is also mischievous. Though I am no lawyer, section 59 seems fairly straightforward. It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; means a systematic inquiry conducted by means of questioning a sample of persons considered to be representative of the population of the State or any part thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House we try to improve legislation and one of the reasons we do so is that we want to ensure the law never becomes a laughing stock. We want to ensure that we never come to a pass such as that referred to by Senator Walsh whereby we pass a law and instruct the Garda to ignore it because if it is tested in court the judge will throw cases out because he will realise they are not covered by the intention of the law. That is such bad law. It is such bad thinking and something that should never happen in this House. If we pass a Bill it becomes law because it is to be enforced. I spoke earlier on the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2000, about the dog muzzling law enacted many years ago and about which Senator O'Toole often talks. If we jump in without attention and pass legislation in the knowledge that it is not going to be enforced, then we are making a laughing stock of ourselves.</P>
      <P>One of the surveys carried out regularly which makes us hold our heads up high is the democratic survey. It shows that Ireland is high up in the democratic stakes. That is judged by the examination of a number of the different freedoms we have. We are reasonably high up because of education whereby we have instilled in young people a sense of how the democratic process works. One of the ways in which it works is through those young people we have spoken about of 17 and 18 years of age. In all the schools I know transition year &ndash; at 16 years of age &ndash; is where this instillation takes place. Now there is also the leaving certificate applied whereby skills and intelligences that are not otherwise measured are measured so that the seedbed of those talents is fertilised to ensure they grow.</P>
      <P>One of the ways that is done is to involve young people in opinion polls coming up to elections. If we are now going to provide that is against the law it is very bad. If this was taken in the cool calm of a normal debate where the Minister listening to the case being made was accepting amendments, I have no doubt that the Minister would say he understood the point. Then this would not apply to anybody under the age of 18 years. Yet I have a sense the Minister of State is not going to say that. I sense he is not going to take this very good amendment on board. I am not sure what words he will use to decry it but it is wrong if he uses words such as &ldquo;well, that is not the intention of the Bill so I am sure that no judge will ever prosecute such persons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not good lawmaking. Either the Minister reconsiders and takes this whole Bill back for consideration of a Stage or he accepts this amendment. There is no in between in this case. We will damage the infrastructure of our democratic process if we do not manage to make this the sort of Bill we can stand over and declare ourselves proud of as good legislation. Let us make sure <Col N="1315" /> this amendment is accepted or drop the whole Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said. Not alone are these opinion polls and samplings conducted in transition year in secondary schools, they are also done in primary schools. The definition of &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; has to be very clear. At first glance one would take it that the sample used would be taken at random from the register of electors, but that is clearly not the case. Clearly there is no such commitment set out in the definition. It can be any sample. It is possible that the sample could be one of children attending a primary school.</P>
      <P>In many primary schools in my area this exercise is gone through during elections. In two cases of which I am aware opinion polls conducted in a certain school reflected accurately the tally of the local polling station in the election two days later. It is extraordinary that these opinion polls were correct almost to a vote. They were accurate to an extraordinary degree. One might say that it was an exercise in fun in many ways and it was a serious exercise in a sense, but nevertheless it would appear that it could be a serious offence under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, must make a clear statement here regarding the sample to be used. Either there must be a clear definition or, as was suggested, the Bill should be taken back and reworked totally in the next session in October. He should not turn the law into what Mr. Bumble called &ldquo;a ass&rdquo;. If the interpretation to be taken from this is, as it appears, that this kind of civics exercise which is carried out in all schools nowadays cannot proceed without fear of sanction from the law, the Government will be a laughing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to explain to the House that I did not refer to primary school pupils because of the fact that the age of criminal responsibility has been raised to 12. I felt it did not apply to them in that sense. Senator Connor is absolutely right. Opinion polls are conducted in primary schools. However, I do not think the law would apply to them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter raised in the case of schools, the poll would have to be representative of the population of the State. It must be related to an election. If students are not voters, then the poll would not be directly related to the election. Classroom polls are not normally made for publication. However, there could be some press reporting of the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment, this amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;over eighteen years of age&rdquo;, into the definition of opinion polls. If the people carrying out the poll questioned people under 18 years of age, then the case for prohibition and publication in the section would be <Col N="1316" /> stronger. One must, if one can, rely on the professionalism of the polling organisations in the matter. The proposed amendment is not considered necessary and in the circumstances I cannot accept it. The Senators may wish to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. He said it would be representative of the population of the State but he left out the next few words, that is, &ldquo;or any part thereof&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is representative of &ldquo;any part&rdquo; of the State. The Senator should not tell me that the class is not representative of any body at all. That is typical of the patronising element which has gone into this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State left out those words. I do not think he did it deliberately but he was probably misguided by somebody. To say that school children are not representative of any part of the State is patently and self-evidently untrue. They represent themselves.</P>
      <P>The more I think about it, the more ridiculous I think this now becomes. I do not know whether the Minister of State is actually saying that these polls will be banned or that they will not be banned. He is not telling us. I think he does not know.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that they are not normally meant for publication and that may be so, but they could be published. If I get an opportunity in my professional capacity to publish the opinions of school children at the next election, I will put them in a newspaper.</P>

    <P>This is just bad drafting. It is a bad Bill. It is badly thought out. This will be a running sore and it will be an issue in the next election. There will be schools which will conduct polls and the question will be whether the teachers can be prosecuted for carrying them out. Perhaps there will be the wonderful vision where we lock up a few school teachers, which in other circumstances might not be a bad idea but in this case is not a particularly good idea. It is ridiculous that Senator O'Toole or someone else could be prosecuted because some teachers carry out an opinion poll.

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 94, line 38, to delete &ldquo;referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the section which defines an opinion poll. A number of difficulties arise from the definition of an opinion poll set out in the Bill and these difficulties are serious enough to render the Bill questionable.</P>
      <P>The Bill defines an opinion poll as &ldquo;a systematic inquiry conducted by means of questioning a sample of persons considered to be representative of the population of the State, or any part thereof, for the purpose of ascertaining the likely opinions of the population of the State as a whole, or part thereof, on matters relating to an election or referendum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the recent by-election I canvassed for our candidate in Tipperary South. It is my habit, when canvassing, to inquire of the person who answers the door how he or she intends to vote. I introduce myself and ask if the person has made up his mind how he will vote. That is a question. If one canvasses 50 houses it is a systematic inquiry. A canvass can take place outside an election as well, but in the context of this legislation the relevant time period is the week coming up to an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider a canvass that I would do in my own constituency or any other to be complete if I do not ask the person how they intend to vote. I can ascertain by their body language, their answer or their non-answer what their intention is. I may not be as experienced as some Members of this House, but as one who is fairly experienced in this process, I can come back from visiting 50, 70 or 100 houses in an afternoon and have a pretty good idea of what is going on. The definition of opinion poll here raises a question about that kind of inquiry. Like my colleagues, I have from time to time carried out this canvass accompanied by a person with an electoral <Col N="1319" /> register or a sheet of paper on a clipboard and a pen.</P>

      <P>Some political organisations within constituencies would argue that it is not an effective canvass unless they ascertain as closely as possible how that person intends to vote. They go back to their election office with the information and try to work out how many people will vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour etc. I know people who do that. It is considered the most effective way to gather information about what is happening.</P>
      <P>It is possible to do a relative sample either throughout the election or from one year to another. It is possible to ascertain how opinions are going and particularly to establish the mood of the electorate in the last two weeks of an election campaign. If that is not an opinion poll, I do not know what is. It would only be published to a small number of party people and it is used for party reasons. The definition of opinion poll here relates very closely to that activity and that is one of the reasons this legislation is so problematic.</P>
      <P>It might not be the intention of the drafters of this legislation to outlaw the activity I have outlined. Senator Walsh might be able to look into his heart and know what the spirit of the legislation is, but not everybody can and Senator Walsh will not be available to everyone who asks the question. The legislation should be without ambiguity, but it is full of ambiguity and, as we saw from the previous amendments, it is full of problems. The definition of opinion poll, accurate as it may be, actually describes other very basic and central political activity, which we all as members of political parties engage in before and during an election campaign and certainly during the last week of a campaign.</P>
      <P>If I am being told that activity is now within the confines of a ban, we have a problem. It is time to accept that we have a difficulty here, withdraw the legislation and go back to the drawing board. Of course, I am pretty sure that will not happen.</P>
      <P>Among the comments made in the past week in favour of the general ban is the belief, particularly among those in political parties and especially the largest party in the State, that the publication of an opinion poll in the last week of an election actually influences or may influence the outcome and therefore we should not have one. We should create a space in which the electorate can reflect without the influence of an opinion poll and make its decision based on issues and other factors. What evidence do we have, except our own impression, that an opinion poll is influential?</P>

    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Senator O'Meara is now making points which would be more relevant later in the debate when we come to the question that the Bill be received for final consideration. At this stage we are discussing her amendment No. 52 which, she stated, refers to the definition of opinion polls and not to the effects opinion polls might have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling on that and I will save my point for later in the debate. I have made my point adequately on the definition of opinion polls. I suspect that other Members, particularly on this side of the House, will probably have other examples of where this definition can be applied not only to the taking of an opinion poll but to activities which we would consider to be normal political activity and which, in my opinion, it was never the intention of the legislation to curtail or ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. There is an issue here about the way we do our business and I will come back to it again. Perhaps it might be easier to come back to it knowing that people recognise that tomorrow's newspapers are written and programmes are put to bed for tonight; therefore people cannot deliberately misinterpret the reasons for opposition.</P>
      <P>There is a way in which we do our business here. The reputation of this House is dependent on people working to a set of beliefs, principles and philosophies. These may differ from each other but are nonetheless valid and we are required to articulate them as strongly and firmly as we can.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senator O'Meara are absolutely correct. An opinion poll is not what people might think it is, would like it to be or what it might be interpreted as in the future; it is as defined in the words from line 34 down to the end of that subsection.</P>
      <P>This amendment is closely related to my amendment No. 60 and I would have been happy to deal with both of them together. The work of party activists, functionaries, canvassers or workers is effectively the polling of the opinion of people. I was quite astonished by an earlier response from the Minister. I know him well enough and long enough to know that he would not deliberately mislead the House, but I am sure his view in answer to an earlier question that this related to polling organisations was not meant to be an exclusive position. There is no mention anywhere of this being confined purely to polling organisations. If it were, it would take many of the problems out of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are problems like the one I raised earlier about schools and the problems raised now by Senator O'Meara. It is not just the publication that is wrong, but also the taking of the information. That is why this amendment is important. The proposal is that we take away the words referred to in subsection (3), which refers to an <Col N="1321" /> election or a referendum and they are defined earlier in the section.</P>
    <P>During a canvass people ask questions at each of the doors they call to. One person does Auburn Drive; the next does Auburn Walk; the next does Auburn Crescent. They all come back to meet their canvass organiser at the end of the evening and they have now broken the law. I am not saying that might arise, or that anyone will take action against them. That is what brings the legislation into disrepute. As long as those words are included, and reference is made to people working in these situations, a difficulty will arise down the line.</P>
    <P>We cannot work on the basis that people may be breaking the law, but that it is okay because it was never intended that the law would apply to them in such situations and that no action would be taken. One cannot operate on that basis as the legislation would be brought into disrepute. On that basis all we would need to do is publish legislation, say what we intend by it, and get rid of lawyers. That might have many attractions, but things do not work that way. Lawyers point to the words used and argue as to what they mean and whether what a person did was wrong.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider what we are doing. We are walking into a morass and bringing the legislative process into disrepute. This is not good legislation and will not work. I ask the Minister to park it and revisit it in the autumn so we can see what needs to be done to meet the specific needs of people.</P>

      <P>I support the arguments put forward by Senators O'Toole and O'Meara regarding the clarity of the legislation. Legislation must be unequivocal: there should never be a question mark about the intention behind it or about the spirit of the intention. If it is clearly defined it will be clearly understood.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara spoke about polling, a process we all undertake to find out where our strengths and weaknesses lie. Recently I was in Great Britain for a personal reason and while there I noted they have a peculiar system, namely, if somebody is voting for Labour in a household, they put a small plaque in their garden indicating that, ensuring people know where they stand. I was in the greater Manchester area and the large farmers had plaques with &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo;. If that process was introduced here, candidates who counted the plaques would be polling. That is how farcical this can become. There is a need for either clarity in description or removal of the section and a new start made.</P>

      <P>The intent of this amendment is, unapologetically, to negate the purpose of the section. It seeks to delete the word &ldquo;preceding&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;following&rdquo;. If one were to do that, one would forbid opinion polls being taken after the event, which seems to be a perfectly sensible proposal to suggest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to explain it in more simple terms. The reason is obvious. The Bill states there should be no polls taken for seven days beforehand. Will the Minister of State indicate where that will leave us on polling day? I ask him to answer the question of whether newspapers or anyone else will be able to publish one minute after midnight on the night before polling day or later on polling day the results of a poll taken eight days beforehand or one taken that night. In other words, will it be possible for a scientific poll to be taken just after midnight on the night before polling and the results published in the newspapers that day? It is a sensible question. It is not beyond the practical bounds of possibility for a newspaper, the media or anyone with a good organisation to publish the result of such an exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am envisaging is that eight days beforehand a poll could be taken on a scientific basis with the express purpose of the results being read out on the news at midnight on the night before polling day or taken one or two hours after midnight on the night before polling day and the results read on the news at 8 a.m. on polling day. That would have a bigger influence than the <Col N="1324" /> results of any poll taken just beforehand because it would inform the people about the state of opinion as they go to the polls. One could carry out polls throughout polling day and give a running commentary on the state of the polls, or one could carry out polls, as they do in the United State which seems to be fairly ridiculous, giving the results which are published before a large number have voted on the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the references in the Bill to timing are all to do with the preceding seven days. What is to stop a polling organisation breaching this by taking a much more up-to-date poll and publishing the results of an eight day old poll? What will happen to it if it publishes a poll taken in the seven forbidden days before polling day? That is the reason I tabled this amendment and I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's answer in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and appeal to my colleagues opposite to understand that this is not a game. As I said when I last spoke, the media are all gone home to bed until tomorrow morning. There is, therefore, nobody here trying to make an impact on them. There are serious points at issue. We are making idiots of ourselves with this legislation. We are putting through legislation that is inoperable, unworkable and based on a false premise. A series of amendments show specifically that under this legislation it could be determined that pupils in their civics classes could be at variance with it or that canvasses at election time, putting together opinions at the end of a night's canvassing which is practical work, could be in breach of it. This legislation is not only aimed at polling organisations, which would make some sense. There is also the point made by Senator Ross.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have been opposed to this legislation have said that the way to approach this matter is to have a voluntary code between political parties and media outlets to ensure there would be a moratorium on this type of reportage for a period of three days, the day of the election and for two days prior to it. People would be supportive of such an approach. Instead we have this nonsense. We will have entry polls, exit polls and polls taken on the day. Every possible use will be made to subvert the legislation. We will find ourselves in a situation where the last position will be worse than the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to convince the people that this is bad legislation. It is badly drafted. It does not discharge the purposes or the objectives for which it was intended. It makes a laughing stock of all of us. As to the idea we have heard across the floor three or four times that this is not what the Bill is meant to do, while that may be the case, if words are written, they mean what they mean. This is not <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> time where we can say they do not mean this or they were not intended to do this, that or the other. It is our business to pass legislation that is accurate and <Col N="1325" /> not open to all sorts of varying interpretations and which can be implemented.</P>
    <P>This is a disastrous section. In dealing with this legislation, we are not getting respect in terms of getting answers to our questions and a clear understanding of where we are at. Senator Ross asked the Minister of State to state that this legislation does not exclude opinion polling on election day. It does not forbid, criminalise or outlaw it from midnight on the day before polling day. I want that on the record to enable the people to realise that what we could finish up with would be a position where the last one could be worse than the first. Any of us here can envisage what will happen. Eight days before the election an opinion poll will be taken and the results not published. On the morning of the election another poll will be taken. The headlines on polling day will be that this is what has happened in the past week. We will finish up with the last position being worse than the first.</P>
    <P>I am failing to make any impact on the Minister of State. Someone somewhere should talk to somebody. I want to give the Minister of State an opinion poll. In the course of this afternoon I spoke to four people who have no involvement in politics. They are ordinary people who go about their day's work. All four unsolicitedly asked me what was my position on this legislation. They were appalled that we should allow it to go through. I am not giving the Minister of State that information for any reason. It may mean nothing other than they are the type of people to whom I speak all the time.</P>
    <P>This is poor legislation which undermines the work we do. The amendment tabled by Senator Ross highlights once again the type of nonsense into which we are moving. We are walking into a morass where our last position will be worse than our first. This legislation does not do what it sets out to do. It leaves us worse off than we were before and creates all sorts of anomalies.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally the reflection of a rushed piece of work and we are paying the price here. It has not been discussed, parsed and analysed in any other place except here in the course of the afternoon. I would welcome hearing the views of our Fianna Fáil colleagues on this I do not want to hear views about the reasons we are doing this. I ask them to ignore our motivations or think they are the worst, but to deal and engage with the issues we raised which are serious. I would have been out of here two hours ago if I thought there was a serious understanding of our position on the far side of the House, but I will not move from here as long as people take the negative view that they cannot see the problems with this legislation. The Minister's party workers will suffer as much as anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be an extremely interesting amendment. I do not imagine Senator Ross wishes to be helpful to the Government in its campaign. If the Government was serious about the principal intent of this Bill, then he has <Col N="1326" /> certainly unearthed something which seems to frustrate that intent. If it is serious one would anticipate that it would accept this amendment because it helps the Bill achieve what it sets out to do. If it is to accept any amendment at all, or if it is serious about anything other than a media bashing exercise, then this is obviously an item it will have to take on board. If there is a way around this, which I do not think there is, I will be very interested in hearing the Minister's suggestion.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I am in favour of opinion polls is that sometimes they isolate questions which are of concern to the electorate, but which political parties have decided to neglect. This is one method of concentrating the mind of even an unwilling Government or Opposition on those matters. I will find it difficult to understand if the Government reject this amendment.</P>
      <P>The question regarding timing, such as one minute after midnight, is interesting. It is possible that opinion polls affect voter's intentions. There is the bandwagon effect, and, on the other hand, there are people wishing to jump off a sinking ship. One can see this by watching the coverage of American elections. Because of the time zones, exit polls in one time zone are announced while people are still voting in another. It has always seemed to me that this effect tended to even itself out. The people are entitled to the fullest possible information.</P>
      <P>I support this amendment, and look forward to its being put to a vote. I remind my colleagues that voting is part of the democratic exercise. I hope we have about 16 further votes this evening, principally because I have missed attending the theatre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said. I do not know if the Minister and his advisers understand that we are banning the taking and publishing of opinion polls for seven days preceding the election, but that does not include the day of the election. The date of the poll commences at one minute past midnight and there will be seven hours before polling booths open.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, material for an opinion poll can be collected or put together up to seven days beforehand and can be published. It will still be early enough to make the morning newspapers. This information can be used in all the media &ndash; written, spoken and visual &ndash; on the day of the poll. The biggest news impact comes from early morning radio and the morning newspapers. That could influence people. A colleague has said that some people will want to jump on a ship that is sailing fair, while others will want to jump off a ship they think is sinking. For that reason the Minister will have to explain how he will get around this problem. It makes a joke of so many things in this Bill and particularly in relation to definitions which I was last speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> I make these points to the Minister and his advisers only to be helpful. The whole idea of banning opinion polls was to ensure that they would not have an influence on voter opinion for a clear period before an election. If they are published on the day of the poll, they could have a very clear impact because they had been prohibited for the previous seven days. I am often dubious about the influence of such polls, but if they are to have influence, they will certainly have influence if this is allowed to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this amendment has thrown up an interesting point. It is hard to see that there is not some validity in it as regards having an opinion poll published on polling day. If it is not permitted to gather the information in the seven days before the poll, it would presumably affect the validity of the poll. To be consistent, however, publication should be prohibited. In saying that I would not go as far as to suggest that the gathering of opinion on the day of an election should ever be prohibited. The exit polls which this legislation allows, but which may be overtaken by electronic voting, is a quite useful facility for people and the media. It has often turned out to be quite accurate.</P>
      <P>The amendment before us does not deal with that issue. All the amendment does is to put forward the deletion of the word &ldquo;preceding&rdquo; the day of election and inserts &ldquo;following&rdquo; the day of the election. This negates the whole purpose of the legislation&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was a child, we went off chocolate and sweets for Lent. We were allowed to finish our pledge at midday on Easter Saturday <Col N="1328" /> and we hoarded our sweets waiting for that moment. We looked forward to it no end, because we had not had sweets for six weeks. We waited for the Angelus on Easter Saturday and then gorged ourselves with sweets and chocolates. This is a bit like chocolate legislation. It is a bit like saying, &ldquo;Chocolate is not good for you, so it will be banned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What will happen? Every television and radio station will advertise for their audiences to tune in at midnight on the eve of election day, only hours before voting begins, and will tell them what is happening. The country will wait for the news because it has been deprived. People are currently interested in opinion polls, but on that day they will be on the edge of their seats waiting for the findings. This is bad legislation, it says people will be informed at midnight on polling day and not one minute past it. Each newspaper will advertise that people should read it before they vote because the opinion polls it will have conducted seven days earlier will tell them what is happening. People will be on edge waiting for them. If not this way, the media will find some other way of circumventing the provision.</P>
      <P>This is bad legislation and I do not want the House associated with it. None of us wants the Oireachtas associated with it. However, the other House will not be blamed for it because it did not have a chance to have a say in it. If there are flaws in the Bill, and it is flawed, no one can blame Members of the other House because they did not have a chance to do anything about it. We will be blamed for introducing flawed legislation.</P>
      <P>I am saddened we are not listened to when we make points, such as those about children not being able to conduct an opinion poll in their school during a general election, and by the fact that opinion polls can be launched on the public, hours before they go to vote. If the Government believes, and other parties have a sense, that there are flaws in publishing opinion polls, perhaps we should opt for what is done in Germany where there is a voluntary code of practice in the media whereby the larger papers agree not to publish opinion polls and few of the smaller newspapers breach it. This is the type of provision which should be voluntarily rather than statutorily applied.</P>
      <P>The Government is wrong and, as Senator Ross pointed out, it is bad legislation. I urge the Minister of State to respond to the deep concerns expressed by everyone on this side of the House. Senator Walsh also expressed deep concern about the flawed Bill. I hope the Minister of State considers withdrawing it.</P>

      <P>I have certain reservations and comments to make about opinion polls. I fought an election in 1987 when Senator O'Meara's then party leader was elected by just four votes. If an opinion poll had been published the day before suggesting one candidate led another by 20%, it would have been grossly unfair because people might have thought that if one candidate was so far ahead, there was no point in voting for the other, although they wanted to. An opinion poll could have suggested one candidate was far ahead which might have made people unwilling to vote for the other candidate. The result was neck and neck. Who would have been responsible in that situation?</P>
      <P>I have many reservations about opinion polls, although I have been involved in a number in recent months.</P>

      <P>Yes, but every voter does not have access to it. I would question the sincerity of the media which, in fairness, have an understanding that this does not happen 24 hours prior to elections. It would be most unfortunate, to say the least, if this were to happen. It would be shameful. I do not see this happening given the many editors and producers who have the good of the country at heart. What use is information which is eight days old? Given our experience as legislators, we know that stories which are 24 hours old are not used.

As Senator Ross has highlighted an issue which could cause major difficulty in regard to the legislation, perhaps we should consider the issue overnight. Perhaps we could get the considered view of the Minister of State regarding the proposal before us. We are all here in the interests of passing the best, most accurate and most workable legislation possible and Members on this side of the House wish to be part of that plan.

      <P>Having listened to the debate at length I am concerned that a poll could be introduced. I agree with the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, that should there be a doubt in this regard perhaps the matter should be considered again. Given what he has said, I believe there should be a moratorium. The media has always honoured that understanding. Regardless of the legislation, I hope that no one would comment for the last two or three days prior to an election. It would be very low-minded of the <Col N="1332" /> media if they produced a poll the morning of polling day.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Government side has seen the light in this regard, even though there was a great deal of toing and froing, note-passing and people running in and out before a conclusion was reached. I thought the actual debate would have resulted in common sense on the issue, plus the fact that we said earlier that any Bill which goes through should be unambiguous and clear in its content. This amendment is seeking clarity on the issue because a &ldquo;freeby&rdquo; newspaper, for example, with a particular agenda might decide to publish something at 12 o'clock the night before an election. At long last there is some movement on the opposite side. It has been a long day and if we had this type of reception earlier I am sure the debate would be over long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome what appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel. I suspect the Government side is anxious to come back with a way of closing a loophole which has been identified on this side of the House. Given that the Leader of the House recognises this section is full of holes, I want to point out another few holes in regard to his comments.</P>
      <P>First, he made the case for a voluntary code of practice. He spoke about the moratorium RTE operates in the 24 hours preceding polling day. For the information of the Leader of the House, that is not just a voluntary moratorium but it is very much predicated on news values. In other words, if a story breaks in the print media, that moratorium is subject to the reporting of that story which could be related to an opinion poll.</P>
      <P>Second, even if an opinion poll was taken seven or eight days preceding election day, the fact that it has not been published and that no one else has the material makes it not just a valid news story but a big news story, one which would be trumpeted, advertised and promoted. People would be told, &ldquo;Listen to the news bulletins, we have news for you&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Third, while our native news media might engage in a voluntary code of practice, there is absolutely no reason to believe that news organisations based in Great Britain would take that view. They would look on this as an opportunity. Sky News, for instance, considers Ireland a very important part of its target audience. It has advertising which is targeted specifically at its Irish audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> This aspect dealing with opinion polls is so flawed and so full of holes that it is simply bad legislation. I am pleased there is some dawning of the light on the opposite side, even though I suspect the overnight consideration which is being sought is simply an attempt to close the gap which has been identified.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an exciting and challenging time for local government, a time of change and renewal. Local government is now recognised by our Constitution as a fundamental part of our democratic system and I am privileged to be here in the Seanad today to take Second Stage of the Local Government Bill, 2000. It follows directly <Col N="1334" /> from the earlier constitutional Bill, on which I was also honoured to speak in this House.</P>
      <P>I want to set out the context in which the Local Government Bill was drafted. It has long been recognised by all political parties that the local government system in Ireland is in need of overhaul. At least we can all agree on that, even if not on every detail of the way to go about it. Those of us within the political system and the local government system in particular recognise that local government is different from other public sector bodies. Local government is seen by many primarily as a service provider at local level. It is this but it is also much more. Unlike other organisations, it is democratically elected and now has a constitutionally recognised role of democratic representation for local communities. For the past 20 years or so, until fairly recently, local government was overshadowed and was not doing well, often through no fault of its own. Its funding base contracted, new local development initiatives did not connect with it and local government began to lose its rightful place at the heart of local communities. Within the system the central policy role more often than not fell to the executive, with the elected council taking a back seat as regards policy development. All of these developments combined to devalue our democratic system. They devalued local government and local democracy. It was obvious that action was needed to reverse these trends.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill is just one part of an ongoing process which started in earnest four years ago, a process which has been driven relentlessly by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, throughout that period. It will facilitate continued improvements and lasting change long after we are all gone. It is important that I acknowledge the work of others.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Acts of 1991 and 1994 set the tone for a more enlightened approach to local government. They removed statutory controls and relaxed the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine. Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment in the rainbow Government, published a White Paper, Better Local Government, in 1996. The Bill before us today incorporates and builds on much of that work and I acknowledge this fact. The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contained an explicit commitment to local government renewal and this is now endorsed by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way and achieved much in the past four years. In considering the Bill, we must look at it against the broader canvas of the local government renewal programme. It is one component of an overall package. It is incumbent upon me to outline some of the other measures that make up that package and what has been achieved to date. Local government is now constitutionally recognised with a fixed electoral cycle and guaranteed local elections, with a consti<Col N="1335" /> tutional basis which now provides a solid foundation for this Bill. The new Local Government Fund, established by legislation in 1998, is delivering significant additional resources, as borne out by this year's allocations. In 2001, somewhere in the region of £720 million is being provided to local authorities, delivering almost 64% more than in 1997 for general purpose needs. On top of that, the national development plan is delivering major increases in capital funding for local authority projects. It is providing essential services and infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing economy and a developing society.</P>
    <P>Strategic policy committees are up and running and it is encouraging to see them beginning to operate as intended. They will allow the elected member to develop a central role in policy development, in partnership with relevant sectoral interests, and with proper back up. The disappointing delay in getting them started due to industrial relations issues is now behind us and I look forward to the introduction of modern management systems which are necessary to support the process, with directors of service now being put in place. I am delighted to say that the recruitment process is almost complete.</P>
    <P>The establishment of county and city development boards was another milestone in repositioning local government and raising its profile. These bring together the wide range of State agencies operating locally together with the social partners and local development bodies under the local government umbrella, a unique opportunity to maximise the combined impact of all involved at local level. Working in partnership, they are devising a strategy for economic, social and cultural development attuned to the needs of the county or city concerned and will oversee its delivery. This represents a new way for the public service to come together and operate on a collective basis for the common good and crucially, under the democratic leadership of local government. The CDBs are now up and running and have directors and support staff in place.</P>
    <P>Another key objective in the Government's renewal programme was to achieve better efficiencies, to modernise local authority and to support local authority members. An equalisation model to facilitate the allocation of resources from the Local Government Fund in a way which takes account of local authority needs and resources has been put in place and will be further refined in co-operation with local authorities. Modern financial management, accounting and audit systems are well on the way to full implementation. Proper service indicators and new corporate planning systems have been introduced. Support for necessary IT systems to underpin these initiatives is being provided. There is an ongoing pilot programme of one stop shops with funding support from the Department. A major programme of information and training <Col N="1336" /> for councillors began with a series of seminars for new councillors.</P>
    <P>The second phase saw an intensive focus on the chairs of SPCs to support them in key policy areas such as roads, housing, planning, etc. The third phase sees this programme now being extended to all councillors, in co-operation with the representative associations. New management structures in local authorities are being implemented to strengthen management and staffing capacity and to provide clearer accountability and responsibility, as well as opening up better career prospects in local government.</P>
    <P>Senators will understand from what I have outlined that this is a renewal programme designed to build on progress to date. It is tailored to Irish circumstances and can significantly improve the lot of local government. We have recognised that local government systems vary widely across different countries. In any country it derives from particular traditions, history, culture and circumstances, and prospects for change must provide for that. In some countries functions such as policing, public transport or social welfare are delivered by the local government system but we must be honest and ask ourselves if this is a realistic goal. Given Irish circumstances, is it likely that in the short term at least such services will be subsumed within our local government system? Is there public demand for that to happen, much as we might wish it?</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that we have to approach change in a realistic way taking account of how functional responsibilities have evolved, and how they are currently organised, if local government is to progress. Thus, our starting point must be where we find ourselves today. From there we must move forward in a planned and progressive fashion to renew our system of local government. On that journey we should be open to all possibilities as anything is possible. We must move from a realistic assessment of where we are, from an assessment grounded in reality, not in unrealistic expectations.</P>
    <P>Before and after the Bill was published the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, engaged in an intensive consultation process with local authority members through the local authority representative associations. Through their submissions, and an extensive series of meetings, the Minister was able to hear their views first hand. As a result of that dialogue the Minister promised to look again at some of the issues raised, and many of the amendments brought forward during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil reflect that commitment. The Minister very much appreciates the hard work and effort the associations invested in the process and he has conveyed his thanks personally to them. Indeed, I add my own thanks to the GCCC, the AMAI and LAMA.</P>
    <P>I would like to flag some of the more significant amendments which were made to the Bill in the Dáil. The title &lsquo;borough' will continue in local government law, as promised to the Mayors of <Col N="1337" /> Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford. For the first time ever in local government law the special historical position of Kilkenny has been recognised. The proposed ban on the dual mandate has been omitted. A new provision dealing with the prohibition of multiple membership of local authorities is incorporated in the Bill in response to suggestions from the local authority associations. The period of persistent non-attendance giving rise to loss of membership of a local authority has been extended to 18 months. The provisions dealing with access, information and transparency in relation to local authority meetings and agendas have been further strengthened. Specific provision has been included to deal with incompatible outside work being undertaken by local authority officials. A substantive new section has been inserted to promote local authority support for the Irish language. Various amendments throughout the Bill underpin the developing local authority role in promoting social inclusion. The ownership of Temple Bar Properties Limited is transferred to Dublin Corporation. The foregoing gives an indication of how some of the concerns expressed by the local authority associations, the Opposition and other interests have been taken on board.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a stand-alone measure and it cannot be looked at in isolation. It is an important element in the Government's ongoing programme of renewal which is already putting into practice the theory and objectives behind much of the Bill. The Bill provides the statutory framework to carry forward the wide range of initiatives mentioned earlier. Real and worthwhile change can only be achieved by taking account of the needs of all involved, which in this case means 1,600 councillors, 30,000 staff and the electorate from whom local government draws its mandate. The Bill aims to provide a framework to facilitate change in such a way as to encourage those involved to take ownership of the process. At the end of the day people are the key to success. The Bill is designed to allow local government to evolve in new directions and facilitate progressive change.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms that the Bill does not go far enough. However, reaction to some of the more innovative proposals has been controversial. I see that as a reliable indicator that radical change is unlikely to find widespread acceptance in local government circles. For example, no amendments have been put forward to redraw the map of local government as we know it. The Bill attempts to strike a balance in terms of the change required to enable the local government system to meet the demands of a modern, inclusive, 21st century society. At the same time it retains the solid foundations which have served us well for over 100 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a blueprint for change and modernisation as well as a platform for future change. It does not therefore abandon local government as we know it, rather it builds on past work and current structures. The county and city system is <Col N="1338" /> maintained, as are the town local authorities, in all, comprising a grand total of 114 elected local authorities. In future these authorities must operate on a new basis, with a new ethos, building on the concepts of partnership and inclusion. We must place greater emphasis on working together, be it town and county or adjoining counties and cities, and the Bill provides for that. While the policy and executive roles are continued they are subject to significant change and rebalancing designed to enhance the role of the elected council.</P>
    <P>Many provisions in the Bill present members with a renewed opportunity to reclaim their rightful role as the policy makers. The Bill aims to promote a strong but workable framework in which the executive operates within policy parameters determined by the elected council and local government operations are overseen by that council with the necessary support. This legislation emphasises the links with the communities from which local government derives its mandate and supports community involvement in a more participative local democracy. It will provide for improved financial and organisational systems and procedures as well as for more efficient service provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to reinforce the rightful position of the elected council in determining local authority policy. The corporate policy group, with an elected Chair, will have a key role to play in this process as a kind of cabinet to deal with over-arching corporate affairs. That is the corporate plan for the life of the council, the annual budget and overseeing of the executive. The Bill places the executive under a duty to implement democratically settled policy and provides for executive functions to be carried out accordingly. However, any system is only as good as the people in it, the extent of their dedication and their availability to do the job in hand. No amount of legislation, no matter how reforming, can achieve that. The kind of commitment I am referring to is borne out by the service of councillors throughout the local government system. This too is acknowledged and the Bill provides for practical supports to assist members by way of a salary-type payment, allowances and training. There is also provision for pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the Bill is to consolidate and update our local government law to provide a modern statutory foundation for local government. At long last general local government law will be found between two covers in a format which is accessible to councillors, staff and the public. That will represent a definite improvement on the current situation of a variety of overlapping provisions, scattered over a wide range of enactments with archaic terminology which is complex and impenetrable. In contrast, the Bill provides a modern statutory framework for local authority operations with a range of general powers available to all local authorities. It provides for the repeal of legislation dating back a century and a half. Separate Bills to update rating law and <Col N="1339" /> water services are being prepared and will complete the process of modernising the service codes and repeal the remaining pre-independence statutes.</P>
    <P>I will mention briefly some of the specific provisions in the Bill. Part 2 contains key provisions establishing local authorities within a modern legislative format. It follows directly from Article 28A of Bunreacht na hÉireann which provides that there shall be such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law. That law shall be the Local Government Bill now before us. Section 10 divides the State into local government areas of counties and cities. Within the counties, and forming part of them, are the town local authorities. Each of these areas &ndash; county, city or town &ndash; has a local authority known, as appropriate, as a county council, city council or town council; or borough council in some cases.</P>
    <P>Parts 3 and 4 deal with local authority membership and local elections. Local elections are fixed at five yearly intervals to be held in the month of May or June, with the next local elections in 2004. This is now guaranteed by the Constitution, thus ending a long history of postponements which served to diminish local government. A mechanism is included in section 22 to allow for alteration in the number of members of a local authority. This involves a report by the independent Local Government Commission provided for in Part 11. This commission also has a role as regards the review of local electoral areas under Part 4; the alteration of local authority boundaries under Part 8; and the establishment of new town councils. As regards co-options, section 19 provides that in future, co-optees to a local authority must be nominated by the party for which the departing member concerned was elected.</P>
    <P>Part 5 deals with the position of the cathaoirleach which, under existing law, is the generic title. Existing mayors and lord mayors continue and it will be open to any local authority to adopt the title mayor or cathaoirleach. From 2004, the cathaoirleach of counties and cities will be elected by direct vote of the people and will hold office for the life of the council. The directly elected chair will be a powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government. The cathaoirleach will be directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council; a full-time cathaoirleach who must work with the council to deliver on the full potential of the office, which is highly visible and accountable; a person elected by the people who draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community, with influence well beyond any formal powers and with the capacity to bring together the various elements of local governance. Experience elsewhere bears out the undoubted potential of such an office.</P>
    <P>As regards meetings of local authorities, Part 6 establishes a statutory right of public access, and <Col N="1340" /> restricts the right to meet in committee to special cases and subject to special procedures. Schedule 10 sets out a comprehensive, updated and consolidated code for local authority meetings. The framework for local authority committees and joint committees is set out in Part 7.</P>
    <P>Part 9 contains a general statement of local authority functions, while individual services such as fire, waste, planning, etc., are carried out under the relevant specific legislation, which for convenience is listed in Schedule 12. However, the Bill itself provides a range of general powers available to all local authorities, including democratic representational role broad powers to promote the community interest, including provision of local amenities; flexibility to take action ancillary to any express statutory powers; by-laws to regulate matters of local concern; land acquisition and disposal; establishment of a community fund to support local projects; discretion to introduce a community initiative scheme whereby an annual contribution can be introduced for a specific community initiative, but only following extensive local consultation; and an office of mayor, civic honours and the ceremonial role.</P>
    <P>The Bill emphasises the need for town and county authorities to work together, and to combine their operations to the fullest extent and with a focus by all authorities on serving the public by whom rigid organisational distinctions are often seen as unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Part 10 allows for necessary inter-authority co-operation in the performance of functions. It provides the flexibility for service arrangements to be made on foot of local agreements between town and county authorities or between adjoining counties and cities.</P>
    <P>Part 12 will allow for the modernisation of financial management, accounts and audit to provide transparent, user-friendly and comparable data for all authorities. For reasons of greater effectiveness the water services function is consolidated at county level in Part 9, as was proposed in Better Local Government. In saying this, however, the Bill allows for joint arrangements to be worked out locally where this may be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Part 14 sets out the respective roles of the elected council, manager and staff. An array of mechanisms is provided to enable the elected council to maintain a proper overview of local authority affairs, to develop, make and steer policy and to oversee the executive, and with proper supports and back-up as referred to earlier. Local authority personnel and management law is also consolidated and updated.</P>
    <P>Part 15 provides a comprehensive new ethics framework for members and officials. It is regrettable that the actions of a very small few can bring the whole system into disrepute. This Part provides an open and transparent framework which will apply to all aspects of local authority operations and will involve: disclosure of interest in any matter which arises, an annual statement of interests, a public register, active implemen<Col N="1341" /> tation, and with a role for the independent Public Offices Commission; along with codes of conduct for staff and members.</P>
    <P>Part 21 restates existing law as regards the non-performance of certain functions and Part 23, as already mentioned, provides for the transfer of Temple Bar Properties Limited to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>This is a unique occasion in terms of local government legislation. For the first time ever in this State we have the opportunity to consider a Bill to provide the statutory framework for our local government system. The last such legislation for Irish local government, the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, was before the Westminster Parliament at the end of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us now is designed to improve local government, both in its operations and in its relevance to the communities it serves, and to modernise its procedures. It provides a modern legal foundation for our local government system, one which is founded on principles of democracy, partnership and community. It provides the framework to carry forward the renewal programme already well under way. It will significantly enhance the role of the elected council and it will allow local government the freedom to develop in the new directions essential to the development of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>It is a Bill worthy of your trust and confidence, and a salute to local government. I confidently commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. T. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coogan has 15 minutes or any lesser amount of time he chooses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Chairman, I do not know whether you are trying to encourage me to shorten my contribution, but in making my points I will try to stay within the boundaries of the 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, has shown wonderful stamina in being here throughout the day and into the night, but at the same time I would have preferred if the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, were here. I am sure the Minister would have preferred if he was here and no doubt the Minister of State also would have preferred if he were here, considering the day he has gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the recognition that the Better Local Government policy brought in by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, under the rainbow Government in 1996 was the foundation of the Bill and of the structure which is being put in place. If I can carry the simile through, in so far as the actual foundations of Better Local Government were the foundations of the Bill, unfortunately the structures the Government is putting in place are very shaky. It is more akin to bungalow bliss than an opportunity for building something which would both be attractive and work<Col N="1342" /> able. The reason I say that is he has missed a golden opportunity to advance local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of minor housekeeping measures, some of which perhaps would have come about anyway, but there is nothing earth-shaking in it. It seems that when the Minister started out some years ago he said that he liked a little item at one end of the shelf and asked could he have it, along with two other items at the other end, to put in the Bill. I also congratulate the Minister of State on complimenting LAMA, GCCC and AMAI for their input, but he pulled the hood over their eyes at one stage.</P>
    <P>Local government provides a variety of services, such as sewerage and water services, roads, housing of all types and mortgages. Additionally, it provides for road maintenance, landscaping, amenity areas and investment in the arts. The work of a local authority is very varied. I have mentioned only some of its aspects. Planning is another important one. A huge spectrum of tasks is carried out within local government. A factory, for example, would have fewer products than local government.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the role of the local authority member and the dramatic changes that have occurred. Some years ago, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in this House when he established the position on SPCs. I pointed out that this would involve more work for local authority members, but he argued that it would involve less. The General Council of County Councils carried out a survey and discovered that the average working week for a local authority member was approximately 33 hours. One might say there is bias in this figure. However, some members have to travel for hours to work &ndash; for example, from west Cork into the city and back again. The Minister of State is aware of this. Such a journey could take four hours or half a working day before getting any work done. This is very demanding. Therefore, 33 hours is not an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Apart from driving &ndash; some may not have to travel such distances &ndash; there are other demands made of local authority members. For example, there are members serving not just on one but perhaps two area committees and SPCs. A member may chair an SPC and then have to attend a policy committee and meet other chairpersons. There are ordinary meetings that have to be attended, as well as regional authority meetings, which involve more travelling. A person may also be a member of a city or county development board.</P>
    <P>From the number of duties and the time commitments involved, local government service is almost a full-time job, and requires very able people. These are ordinary people who are, very often, learning their role as they go along. They give of their time freely for little or no recompense.</P>
    <P>Section 142 deals with the Minister's right to make payments to local authority members. Reasonable payments are referred to. Consider<Col N="1343" /> ing what I have just said, not including the telephone calls members and their families receive at home, often at unsocial hours, and the need to travel at night, often in poor conditions, the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is not sufficient. Payment should be commensurate with the amount of work local authority members do. I am aware that is a regulation the Minister can make and hope he will take it into account. As a former member of LAMA and a local authority, he should recognise the validity of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of the General Council of County Councils, my nomination body on the administrative panel. Therefore, I speak on behalf of local authority members and do not apologise for making their case as well as I can. Will the Minister of State relay the points I have made to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in order that when he makes the regulations, he will not account only for the workload? He should also account for the following. When the Minister offered a gratuity to other members to resign or retire, he offered them the carrot and the stick. He offered them a gratuity but said he would replace this with a salary. He made this point before the last elections. People either made a decision to take the gratuity or continue in public service. As far as they were concerned, they had a contract with the Minister and assumed that by giving up perhaps £20,000, although staying in public service, they would receive a salary. That was in June 1999. The Minister is now saying that he can backdate only to May 2000. He has a contract with elected local authority members, which he should honour. He should ensure any recompense made would extend back to the period to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I said that the General Council of County Councils, LAMA and the AMI were very involved in making submissions and meeting the Minster, his advisers and civil servants from the Department. They were making suggestions that would enhance the role of local authority members. One point, of which Senator Walsh is well aware, is that the idea of the direct election of mayors is not agreeable to 90% of elected members. I refer to members of his party. He is aware of this because he has often been told. Why is he not amenable to the idea? One might ask what difference does it make. Local communities elect the people whom they believe are capable. The people concerned select their chairman, deputy chairman, deputy mayor, mayor and lord mayor. They thought they were able to do that. It has allowed for individuals to be honoured by their own for one year to act in an honorary position representing their cities or counties.</P>
    <P>I had that opportunity on a number of occasions during the years. It is one of the greatest honours that a local authority member can receive. This Bill would mean that this system would end. Are we replacing these individuals with people who have more responsibility or authority? The answer is no, we are not. We are <Col N="1344" /> simply replacing them with others who would have had the same status under the old system, in which the manager still rules the roost. Another opportunity has been missed by the Government to take some of that authority away and return it to the members through those who are directly elected.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh is aware that I was not averse to the concept of direct elections. I was averse to the term of five years. However, I thought that the basis of the direct election of mayors would be that they would have more power and authority and be answerable directly to those who elected them. The Bill does not provide for this. I do not want to be told that it may in the future. I can address only what is in the Bill. I can safely say that 90% of elected members will say this is a farce.</P>
    <P>I spoke to three people last night who were mayors of my city. Their positions were honorary. I asked them if, at the end of their one year in office, they would have liked to continue for another year. They all answered that they would not as the role is too demanding. If a term of one year is too demanding for a person, what must five years be like? He would not wish to continue holding the office, no matter what salary he would be offered. Because the position is only honorary, most of the duties have to be performed at night, which upsets family life. That aspect of the Bill is a farce.</P>
    <P>What has happened with regard to the dual mandate is even more of a farce. This Bill was mooted over two years ago and only arrived in May 2000. Since then, it has been languishing while the Minister's own backbenchers have fought tooth and nail to hold on to the dual mandate. They did not want to let it go. A clever move was made to suggest that it was the four Independent Members who were holding it up.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party clearly stated, and still does, that the dual mandate should be removed. It would have voted with the Government on that section of the Bill. Even without the Fine Gael Party the Government could have got it through, but for its own backbenchers. It is time the cover was lifted on that so the public and the elected representatives realise what was really delaying the Bill.</P>
    <P>Eventually the measure had to be thrown out, thus weakening the Bill. I know the Minister is very upset about this because he fought to retain the measure until the last minute, appearing on radio in the final few days to say it was still there. He believes it to be central and pivotal to the Bill. I agree with him because I am aware that the duties of local authority members, which I outlined earlier, take up so much time that it is impossible for an elected member of the Seanad or the Dáil to combine them with the duties of either House. I know of SPC meetings held on a Wednesday which I am not able to attend. The dual mandate will end some time so it is a pity the Government did not have the courage of its convictions and stick to the measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> I want to return to one or two areas related to consultation and dialogue mentioned by the Minister of State. I wonder has he taken the opportunity to look back at the effectiveness of SPCs. The principle behind their structure looks good on paper, but while some are extremely effective others are simply not working. I do not know why. The idea was that local authorities would be more open to community interests, but I can assure the Minister of State it is working only in some places. If he wants it to work, he had better go back and fine tune it.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill as a missed opportunity to hand more authority, power and responsibility to local authority members. It can be said that members are afraid to make decisions and that, unfortunately, they did not make decisions on regional waste management strategies. They did make decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>And got punished for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What annoys me most about it is that if a local authority did not decide in the way the Minister wanted, it was decided they were wrong and the issue had to be revisited, but it was all right if they decided in favour of the Minister. That is not democracy. If it is a regional decision, it should be voted on a regional basis. If a local authority finds difficulty with a strategy because it does not believe in it, feels it is dangerous or is not satisfied it knows enough about it, so be it. That is democracy at work.</P>
      <P>A heavy handed Minister intervening to remove more power from a local authority by giving it to the manager is not local democracy. That is happening in parallel with this Bill. I hope the Minister of State takes the points I raised back to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that he takes them on board and that there is an opportunity to revisit the Bill or introduce another which enhances the role of the local representative and enhances and guarantees local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to welcome the Minister of State to the House given that he has been here all day, but it would be appropriate to compliment him on his kind remarks about local government. As somebody who has served as Lord Mayor of Cork and had a distinguished involvement in local government, I would expect him to have an incisive view. That came across in his earlier comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with those who wished the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, a speedy recovery to good health. It would also be appropriate for the House to compliment him not just on the introduction of the Bill, but also on his deep commitment to local government. He championed the constitutional recognition which had been sought for many years. He is amenable to consultation, making himself available, for example, at a meeting in Tralee last summer attended by over 600 council<Col N="1346" /> lors who were afforded an all day session in which to express their views on various aspects of the Bill. He also consulted widely with the various associations, the parliamentary party and other interested parties prior to the publication of the Bill. It is a hallmark of his office that he has been open to suggestions from all sides and he deserves great credit for that.</P>
    <P>Local government is a great challenge. The system is undoubtedly in need of an overhaul having experienced a gradual erosion of powers which pre-dates my entry into politics by a long time and continued subsequent to my involvement in politics at local level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Local government has served us exceptionally well. Town local government goes back centuries while county local government has been with us since its enactment in 1898 followed by elections in 1899. It was a forum for democratic self-expression in the years before the foundation of the State and helped spawn independence. It played a key role in the early days of the State in the provision of housing and water supplies to rural areas, as well as roads, planning, fire services and environmental amenities. At that stage local government was also involved in the provision of health services and upon reflection it might have been better to have left it there rather that allow it take the route it did.</P>
    <P>Local government has also displayed a wider vision of contributing to local communities. My local authority, for example, established the Wexford national heritage park, which is a tremendous tourist attraction in the county, the 1798 visitor centre in Enniscorthy, assisted in championing the Dunbrody ship, which was built in New Ross and is now a major tourist attraction there, and built the new marina at Kilmore and a swimming pool in New Ross. A range of public facilities has come about because of the vision and contribution of local government which has been a major force for good and development. Those who have participated in it can be very proud of their achievement.</P>
    <P>As we embark on a new century it is time we looked to broaden the functions of local government and loosen the central control that has always applied and which constantly seeks to extend its remit. Piecemeal change has taken place, some of it reactive and some of it for electoral gain. There is now a need for a more comprehensive approach. We need go no further than reminding ourselves that a world competitiveness report in 1995 ranked Ireland lowest on its administrative centralisation table, in other words, our local government was most dependent on central government. When one considered the countries which had just emerged from the communist system which was very centrally controlled, it is a fairly stark comment on the system we have allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>Local government is also big business. The Minster of State rightly pointed out that there are 1,600 local councillors, 30,000 local government <Col N="1347" /> employees and a spend of over £2 billion a year yet it would be fair to say the directors of the system have very little control over some fundamental areas of the business they are charged with running and directing. On the finances of local government referred to by the Minister of State, I come from the school which was critical of the removal of rates on houses and the abolition of water charges. These did more than remove a method of financing councils; they took away an element of responsibility from the elected members. To that extent, they undermined some of the pillars which had previously stood local government in good stead.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that any Government will reverse what has happened. I acknowledge the £720 million which has been made available through the local government fund this year. This amount has increased by 64% since 1997 and has addressed many of the financial shortcomings which inhibited the activities of local government before that time.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill does not attempt to address the question of the city and county management legislation. The SPCs were established to deal with what has happened as a result of policy being initiated by managers and often pursued by them, rather than options and information being provided to councillors to enable them to make decisions independently. Often the system did not work in the way intended and the manager had his own preferred policy. There is a need for a new management system and the introduction of SPCs and the consequent appointment of directors of services signal a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The partnership between management and councillors is necessary but if it is to work effectively, councillors must be provided with research and other resources to enable them to do their job effectively. This problem must be addressed. I hope the introduction of new systems, particularly of corporate policy groups, will do this. Corporate policy groups, with directly elected chairs at their heads, provide an opportunity for us to look at greater empowerment of councillors, who hold a democratic mandate from the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister advised the three local authority members' representative associations to come together to put forward amendments to the Bill. One of these amendments proposed that executive functions be transferred to the corporate policy groups, which would operate on a similar basis to the Cabinet at national level, with the executive presenting various policy options and the corporate policy groups making decisions. If the corporate policy groups were developed into playing this role local government would be strengthened and enhanced. This development would also have an enhancing effect on politics generally because elected representatives would be seen to be taking responsibility, creating initiatives, taking charge of services which are important to people at local level and giving an account of their stew<Col N="1348" /> ardship at the ballot box. That is the essence of democracy.</P>
    <P>From a councillor's point of view, the question of directly elected chairs has been one of the most contentious aspects of the Bill. I agree with Senator Coogan when he says a person who serves a term of one year on a voluntary basis is almost certain to feel relief when his term of office comes to an end because such positions are, in effect, full time. Local government has suffered because the system of one year terms of office prevents the continuity which is essential for the pursuit and implementation of effective policies. It has been suggested that the direct election of chairs would attract single issue candidates or people who lack experience of local government or commitment to it. It is for that reason the requirement that candidates for chair would have five years experience of membership of a local authority was included in the Bill. In most careers experience is required of people who seek senior positions.</P>
    <P>This issue will be pursued continually by the representative associations. The Minister was sympathetic to the proposal but legal advice has placed a doubt over it. The implications of the legal advice will have to be examined carefully. It is possible that other mechanisms could be used. There is a nominating procedure for the presidency, for example. The procedure for nominating candidates for the presidency through county councils was used successfully on the last occasion. It was a good use of local government powers to nominate people outside the mainstream of politics for the presidency. There may be mechanisms which could be used to achieve the same objective.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate has been a contentious issue for some time. We are in an era of specialisation. An Oireachtas Member has a different remit from a local government member and the separation of the two would be to the benefit of national and local government. I understand that some people feel there is an electoral advantage in being a member of a local authority and that the experience gained there will stand one in good stead when one becomes a Member of the Oireachtas. There is some validity in that argument but there is a stronger benefit to be obtained by separating the two roles.</P>
    <P>The question of the dual mandate should be re-examined between now and 2004, with a view to separating them. In the interim there is a valid argument to be made for paying all councillors equally. After that time a gratuity could be used to compensate people who had foregone it previously and may have been encouraged to stand for the Oireachtas. An effort should be made to end the dual mandate in 2004. There were particular difficulties on this occasion because of the numbers in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not object to declarations of interest and disclosures being made annually by local authority members but I have serious difficulty with this information being published in newspapers <Col N="1349" /> for prurient reasons. This matter should be examined, perhaps by an Oireachtas committee. Only if people transgress should the detail of a member's interests and property be published in newspapers, to become the subject of local interest and public house talk. There is very little to attract people into the profession of politics and this is a pity. I support the inclusion of a code of conduct in the Bill. It is a pity that because a tiny number of politicians have been guilty of transgressions everyone is under suspicion.</P>
    <P>Various Government services should be devolved back to local authorities. The people who are administrating services such as policing, health management, public transport, education and the distribution of lottery grants within the jurisdiction of the council should be available to account for their stewardship of those services at local level in the same way as at national level people administering public services are obliged to come before committees of the Oireachtas.   </P>
    <P>Section 142 relates to remuneration and pension, which is long overdue. Senator Coogan has rightly pointed to the number of hours involved. It is a total anomaly that the only people working free gratis in the public service were local councillors. That will be addressed and I hope the Minister, having accepted the proposal that came from LAMA, will ensure that the salary, pension and gratuity attached to it is commensurate with the workload and commitment of the people involved in local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to address the issues in the Bill. It is an important recognition of the work done by local councillors. I never have been and never will be a local authority member, but I appreciate and respect the commitment they give to their local communities.</P>
      <P>I am one of the few people in either House of the Oireachtas who is in favour of the dual mandate or at least opposed to legislation outlawing it. That serves no electoral purpose and the people should decide who they want to represent them. If we try to constrict and restrain involvement and participation in politics, we will get the wrong result. I know it is meant in the best of ways, but I am happy that it is not in this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are not doing anything to attract people into politics. What we went through earlier today was part of that. Here it is again tonight. I have discussed aspects of this legislation with the National Union of Journalists, which is a very important affiliate of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions. It has problems with this and I have considerable sympathy for that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who have a bad public image and get bad publicity do so because nobody sees the real work they do. I always say to teachers that if I could allow microphones and cameras into the classrooms of teachers in ordinary schools, people would be amazed at the amount of work they do. The same is true of county councillors. They are <Col N="1350" /> not respected because the work they do is never seen and it needs to be. I fully support them getting adequate remuneration for the work that they do. They are entitled to it and should get it. As a trade unionist, I value social, capital and voluntary commitment from people but a work input is required to make the system work and people should be paid for that.</P>
    <P>Part 6 of the Bill refers to the meetings and proceedings of local authorities. I am particularly concerned about the elements of work that can be taken in committee. Section 45(3) is far too generalised in stating that a meeting can go into committee, in other words become private, because of the special nature of the meeting or an item of business to be or about to be considered at the meeting or for other special reasons. There should be an entitlement to have confidential meetings and go into committee, but the reasons should be much more specific than that.</P>
    <P>It should be like the Houses of the Oireachtas in the way that we are governed by the Constitution. We have an entitlement to go into committee, our committees regularly go into private session and that is as it should be. However, some issues should not be taken in committee. The work which councillors do in their input to the council's budget, the rate etc. should be public. This is far better than people just grandstanding on the night they strike a rate or when they decide on service charges. Let us see the input they make during the course of the discussions. They should not be in committee. It does not serve the councillors well that it should be.</P>
    <P>Every time we send people abroad to international meetings they are subject to negative press comment, but it is better to take it on the chin and say that it is important that council members go to look at waste management or whatever. It is better to be up front and deal with it.</P>
    <P>Last week it was not considered sufficiently newsworthy to publish the expenses of Senators in the main. They could not wait to get at them two or three years ago, but the reality is they just get tired. I know that there were some exceptions and Senator Connor very unfairly got his name up in lights. If that kind of information were made available and we insisted that it be published in a particular way it could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the way in which the meetings can be taken. It is wrong to simply cite &ldquo;special reasons&rdquo; and go into committee. There is nothing to be gained. Let us hear the councillors and the kind of creative input they make into working out the budgetary meetings of the council in the course of a year rather than those guys who stroll in on the council meeting when the hard decisions have to be taken and grandstand it for the press to show that they are the hard men.</P>
    <P>Let the people and the press see the work the local authority members do and in that way it will have to be reported in a much fairer way. It is <Col N="1351" /> in line with the greater powers that we are now correctly giving to local authorities. I would look for even more devolution of power. We should look on local authority meetings in the same way as we look on meetings of Oireachtas committees. They should be subject to similar requirements and not the wide open arrangement in section 45 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a serious void in the audit area in that there is no definition of an auditor. That may sound a bit odd, but I would like to see such a definition. The Bill states that the Minister may from time to time appoint people to the local government audit service. Who can be appointed to it? After the Public Accounts Committee inquiry there was huge concern among politicians and the public that auditors be auditors. There is now a move that they be part of recognised accountancy bodies, having gone through recognised, supported and approved audit examinations to become auditors. This Bill is not saying what an auditor is or what the qualification is, and that should be there.</P>
    <P>The powers of the audit committee should be increased. It will become a crucial committee with the amount of money being dealt with and rather than simply commenting on the audit as it says in the Bill, they could have much greater powers than that.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the approach that has been taken to employees in local authorities. This Bill gives them all the category of employee. There are various categories of people employed by local authorities. People had different rights and entitlements and I am sure the advisers and draftspersons who have the status of civil servants will recognise what I am talking about here. Officers of local authorities had statutory entitlements in terms of their conditions of service, superannuation, job descriptions and other issues. They had direct appeal to the Minister and Ministers determine their conditions of service in many ways. This will change as a result of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Previously their functions were determined by local government statutes, as distinct from employees whose conditions are determined by laws relating to contracts of employment. They will now move from having protection under statute to a position where they will simply be protected under the normal contracts of employment. I am being careful with my words. It may be that at the end of the day this will turn out to be all right. However, I have discussed this with IMPACT, which is very seriously concerned. This has been done without any consultation. There was one meeting with the representatives of these people despite the fact this constitutes a major change to their employment status.</P>
    <P>As a person who for a good number of years has negotiated pension entitlements, arrangements and protection for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I would expect Members to show an equal concern and sympathy for officers <Col N="1352" /> of local authorities who until now were covered by the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts. These Acts are not mentioned in the Bill, and I will closely examine the Minister's response. I hope Members agree that we must examine this matter so that we protect the employees and ensure the rights and entitlements they currently have under the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts do not deteriorate in any way through the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I could go into significant detail on these issues and will perhaps return to them on Committee Stage. It is appalling that a Department should have so little consultation with a significant group of employees whose conditions of employment and pension entitlements are very much part of what is being addressed in the Bill. To gain the trust of employees and to produce a confidence building measure, there should have been serious negotiation and agreement with IMPACT, the representatives of these people. I ask the Minister in his response to clarify the issues I have raised and to give a commitment to ensure there will not be a deterioration in conditions, that the entitlement to appeal to the Minister will be maintained, that the method by which the Minister may devolve his authority regarding conditions of service of these officials will be agreed with representatives of the union, and the superannuation arrangements will be maintained and protected.</P>
    <P>I join in the good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. He got a raw deal in terms of the Bill. He also got a raw deal from the media, which I defended in many cases during the course of the day. It was appalling that on the day the Government changed its mind and the Minister announced a U-turn on the dual mandate, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; ran a week old interview with the Minister which had not previously been aired and in which the Minister spoke against the dual mandate. It was unfair, and that is the type of situation which would arise under the provisions in the previous Bill. The Minister has given this Bill his best and I am sorry some things did not work out. I like his courage in dealing with it. I did not agree with his point on the dual mandate, but the Government should have made its position clear earlier. Neither did I agree with the Minister's attempt to downgrade Kilkenny. Apart from that I compliment the Minister on what he has done and I hope he returns to full health as quickly as possible. Perhaps he will be in Croke Park to cheer on Meath on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Senator O'Brien. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who has put a tremendous amount of time into the Bill. Many people were very critical of it and said it would not ever reach the House. I found Senator O'Toole's contribution very invigorating. If he is not elected to <Col N="1353" /> the Seanad in future he could always run for a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator would be successful if he ran for a local authority as he spoke from the heart about the entitlements of councillors. They have worked extremely hard and have donated a very large amount of their time to local authorities and local government without any reward. They were criticised morning, noon and night for not doing enough, but they worked on a voluntary basis. They got travelling expenses and many people made hay out of the fact they were getting so much, but the same people did not see that councillors were taking days off work and had to forfeit part of their salary as they looked after local concerns. They also had community meetings, etc.</P>
      <P>Local government has come a very long way, and this Bill enhances and brings it forward. Everything in the Bill may not be satisfactory to everybody, but it contains much with which local councillors will be very pleased. They are going through quite a lot in terms of SPCs, new county enterprise boards and regional meetings. There has been much in legislation over the years improving facilities for local one stop shops, and the public is definitely benefiting from improvements in local government.</P>
      <P>People raised the issue of chairmen being in office for five years and agreed that much can be said in favour of a one year term. However, there are some people who enjoy being chairman of a county council, and it takes almost a year to get to know the workings of a council. I maintain that the first year is spent learning how things operate, and learning from mistakes, and that the minimum term should be two or three years, when people can really get to enjoy the position. People should be broadminded in this regard.</P>
      <P>Many people were very critical when they spoke about the dual mandate. Members of the Oireachtas will be forced from having a dual mandate as they will not be able to handle the workload. By 2004 people will opt out from having a dual mandate. If the payments system introduced in the last local elections was offered again, every Member of the Oireachtas would remain on the sideline and stick with one job. Members will be able to get minutes from local authority meetings and all they will need to do is keep abreast of what is happening in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill, including the salary being provided for the first time for councillors and the gratuity. There is no doubt the issue of superannuation will have to be examined. Other powers will have to be given to councillors in future. In terms of national Government the work load is getting too much for Ministers, and they will have to devolve their powers to a far greater extent to local government. I refer here not only to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but to <Col N="1354" /> other Departments. Members of local authorities in turn will have to be remunerated for their efforts.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the payment to councillors can be backdated to the date the Bill was introduced. I would like the Minister to examine backdating it to the last local elections. It is something all councillors expected, and the Minister will have to examine this issue seriously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be elections every five years. It is only right and proper that the seven and nine year periods have been abolished. The people have the chance to change their councillors if they are not doing their job. I welcome the legislation and will have more to say on it on Committee and Report Stages. I wish the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, a speedy return to the House and compliment him on all his work. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for all his work in local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, on his work today. He has spent ten hours in the House today and we are not finished yet. He deserves great credit for spending that time with us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on bringing it forward. It is important legislation that has been long awaited. There are many aspects of the Bill that I want to refer to but it would not be possible in the time allocated. Section 142(1) provides that regulation be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance for the payment of allowances towards local authority members. This is probably the most important part of the Bill because local authority members have served this country since local authorities were set up and only received expenses and very little remuneration for their work. Their workload entitles them to a salary and pension scheme and the Minister has in his wisdom brought forward this Bill which will ensure that very shortly they will have the salary they so richly deserve. Reform of local government is an important issue at this time of economic boom.</P>
      <P>I send my good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for a speedy recovery and hope he will be back with us after the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with this legislation is that it is presented to us as a major reform measure. Reforming local government essentially means shifting the balance of the respective roles of the executive functions and those reserved for local authority members, but that is not the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill from the point of view that it builds on the White Paper, Better Local Government, published in 1996. In 1899, when local authorities were established, the balance of power was in the hands of the elected members. That was the case right up to the time of independence. The first serious attack came about in 1925 when the reserved functions began to shift more <Col N="1355" /> towards an executive appointed by the Minister. In a sense this meant that local authorities were operated as an adjunct to the Department of Local Government. That continued up to the 1950s with the county management Act which established a powerful chief executive in the local authority with extensive executive powers which totally took away the reserved functions of local authority members. There is every reason to believe that many local authorities were unethical when they had extensive reserved powers. That problem informed much of the change in the 1930s and 1940s, but we now live in a transparent era and I had hoped that the essential element of the reform provided for in this Bill &ndash; this will not be revisited in a comprehensive way for maybe a generation &ndash; would provide a shift in the way that functions are divided.</P>
    <P>Local authority funding derives from rates which are still raised by the local authority &ndash; that is now a small part of their budget &ndash; and the rest is raised from the rates support grant and other grants-in-aid which come from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The discretion that local authority members have over the rates support grant or any other grant-in-aid from the Department has not increased. Members have discretion over the funds they raise through rates and other charges. Policy can be made to direct how that money is spent within the law. In most cases, and certainly in the local authority that I serve on where 20% of our total supply of funding is derived from local funding &ndash; rates, water rates and so on &ndash; the remaining 80% comes from the rates support grant and others. We have no discretion over this matter. The chief executive, the county manager, has total discretion and from either a practical or policy point of view we do not have a function. That is the case for all local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is where the reform really misses the target. Local participative democracy does not have a role. The people elect the county councillors and would like to think that those they elect have a major say in the way the budget is ordered, within the law, in the same way as the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have a significant say, if they wish to exercise it, in financial policies and the way budgets are spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the functions of local authorities, but the functions have not changed, they were always there. They are presented to us here as if they are something new but, for instance, the democratic representational role was always there in the sense that the members of local authorities were democratically elected and were there to provide a representational role. We always had the powers to promote local amenities, it depended on the chief executive-county manager who was in place. Some of them were extremely cautious about providing funding while others were a little more adventurous, which meant that good local amenities were provided in some counties but not in others. We have <Col N="1356" /> always had the power to introduce by-laws to regulate matters of local concern. That was always a function reserved to local authorities. The one area where members had power over the chief executive was in regard to land acquisition and disposal. It is somewhat disingenuous to present these functions as being representative of something new when that is not the case. The fact that the elected members have no greater role in exercising these functions is a serious flaw.</P>
    <P>The Minister had much to say about directly elected mayors. I accept the principle of directly elected mayors and chairs, but there should be a condition that would exempt anyone from contesting these offices who did not have previous experience of serving in a local authority. It would be expected that the directly elected mayor or chairperson, as alluded to in the Minister's speech, would have certain experience. He stated:</P>
    <P>The cathaoirleach will be directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council; a full-time cathaoirleach who must work with the council to deliver on the full potential of the office, which is highly visible and accountable; a person elected by the people who draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community, with influence well beyond any formal powers and with the capacity to bring together the various elements of local governance. Experience elsewhere bears out the undoubted potential of such an office.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to show that a directly elected chair or mayor has any influence over the executive.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure what is the reserve function of a directly mayor. That is not clearly stated in the Bill. We know what are the reserve functions of a directly elected member of a county council but there is nothing in the Bill that states that a newly directly elected chair has any power to influence an executive decision. That is not reform. The script that was written for the Minister reads well, but at the end of the day it means nothing.</P>
    <P>Many people will find it ridiculous that a chairperson of a local authority will be elected and presumably will have to be well paid for that job, but he or she will not have any major power in influencing policy. That person will not be elected by the electorate in an electoral area but by the electorate of the county, borough, city or town. The person elected could be a popular local singer or a popular footballer who sees an opportunity to be elected because of their local fame but who has no experience of the work or functions of a local authority. People may say &ldquo;a plague on all your houses&rdquo; because of the usual attitude of some people towards those in public life and they may reject a person who has been a member of a local authority for a long time in favour of a person with no experience of that work. There is an argument to be made that for a person to be eligible for election as mayor or <Col N="1357" /> chairperson, and I appreciate there are legal difficulties, he or she should have some experience of local government.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of our electorate I suppose we have to say these things but I do so genuinely in that I am delighted that at long last it has been recognised there is a need to remunerate elected county councillors, borough councillors or city councillors. The point has not yet been made in the debate that Members of the Oireachtas are out of that loop. I am delighted about that. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was called the Minister for Spite by Members of the Oireachtas at a parliamentary party meeting because they will not get such an additional salary. They were wrong to say that. It is right that Members of the Oireachtas will not be paid such a salary. Although I exercise the dual mandate, I believe we should not exercise it and I would welcome its abolition.</P>
    <P>Given that Oireachtas Members will be out of the loop, I call on the Minister of State to ensure local elected councillors are decently remunerated for their work. It will be easier for him to do that now that Oireachtas Members will not receive such remuneration. A minimum salary of £12,000 per year or a little more should be paid to an elected member of a local council. I am sure <i>pro rata</i> salaries will be paid to members of urban district councils, town commissions and so on. That is an important point. One of the major reforms in this legislation is that we are recognising the statutory role of elected members of local authorities. It is often ignored that local authority members, as part of their reserve function, have a statutory role. If they did not perform them, the local authority could not function. It is only right and proper that they should be well remunerated for that. I threw out that figure and I hope the Minister of State will seriously bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the general thrust of the Bill, it is regrettable that this opportunity is lost to bring about real reform. The Acting Chairman is a member of a local authority. He and I sit on the same local authority and I know from his performance as chairman of it that he would like greater powers to be devolved to elected members. This Bill does not provide for that. That is where it signally fails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, on his powers of concentration having been here ten hours on the trot and his brain is still working. It is almost 11.40 p.m. and I do not know whether my brain can keep going at this stage. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. It will give us a platform to debate local government in the widest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, a speedy recovery. I record my appreciation of his commitment and dedication to local authorities. I found the Minister, who had been a member of a local authority and had wide experience of the work<Col N="1358" /> load of councillors, very accessible when we were discussing the drafting of this Bill. I appreciate that he made himself available to facilitate us when many concerns were expressed at the initial stage.</P>
    <P>Local government in Ireland has a proud history and is well served by dedicated staff and public representatives, but an overhaul of the system was well overdue. It had lost its place at the heart of the community. Over the years managers and staff had begun to take on the role of formulating policy and the council took on the role of agreeing to management proposals.</P>
    <P>This Bill has taken many months of intensive and at times agonising consideration at all levels to reach this stage. We welcome its arrival in the Seanad as an example of reforming and dynamic legislation which will set the basis for a responsible and efficient local service for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill are positive although I have some difficulty with some aspects of it on which I will expand. The Bill sets out to enhance the role of the councillor and to give them additional power, support and community involvement. Having been a member of a local authority for 16 years, I have a fair knowledge and experience of the diverse functions of local government and the various authorities. The input made by councillors over the years cannot be emphasised enough in terms of the demands of their workload, their work with resident associations and all they have to put up with. When I became a county councillor 16 years ago I was well able to cope with the workload, but I would have to say something different today.</P>
    <P>This Bill is wide ranging and I would like to have had more time to go into the detail of it. I welcome sections dealing with the funding of local authorities. It is essential to secure the necessary resources for the programmes of local government renewal and the Minister has acknowledged that. The sum of £730 million was provided for local authorities in 2001, 64% more than was provided in 1997. That improvement was complemented by major increases in capital funding for local authority projects under the national development plan to provide for essential services in infrastructure for a modern society.</P>
    <P>The Bill also caters for a modern financial management accounting and audit system. I welcome this as it gives a picture of how the money is spent, something I never understood in all my years as a councillor and I have a Bachelor of Commerce degree. I am glad to see that there are changes incorporated in the Bill which will adopt a more simple approach. It will give us an indication of how money is spent and the manager the opportunity to explain it exactly.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with, and clarifies, co-option. That is very important. During the years some councils allowed a party to co-opt one of its members. Independents, however, will be sorted out by standing orders. This aspect of the Bill is a little <Col N="1359" /> loose and I would like to get confirmation of how it will work. Sometimes it does not work well. There have been difficulties in my council as to how independents were co-opted. The sections dealing with the five yearly interval for local elections in Chapter 4 are to be welcomed. It was outrageous that there were no elections between 1991 and 1999. It diminished local government.</P>
    <P>Part 7 will give statutory recognition to SPCs. This country has become too &ldquo;committee-ited&rdquo;. I am concerned at the proliferation of committees at local authority level and will list some of them. There are regional assemblies, regional authorities, county and city development boards, health boards, vocational education committees, harbour authorities, enterprise boards, SPCs and area committees. I cannot see these functioning as designed.</P>

      <P>What about the sheep dipping committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I did my best to list as many as I could. I do not think these committees can have the necessary back-up staff to function properly and efficiently. We will need more research to allow councils to effectively carry out their functions. I welcome the concept of the SPC because it is policy driven and will work with outside interests and in partnership with community interests. I have some concerns about local boundary alterations. My area, Terenure-Rathfarnham, has seven seats, and is almost like a constituency. This does not seem like local democracy to me. I would like the Minister to revisit this matter before the next local elections.</P>
      <P>The three areas generating huge controversy are the directly elected mayor or chairman, the dual mandate &ndash; which has now been put on the long finger &ndash; and the provisions in regard to payments. The first potential stumbling block in the Bill is that of directly elected mayor. This is a radical and new concept. I do not want to give the impression that I am opposed to change and innovation. However, the model and logic of how this new structure might work has not been made very clear. It has caused me some concern and apprehension as to how it might be implemented.</P>
      <P>I endorse the call made by the General Council of County Councils that a detailed working of the new system should take place within two years of the first elections of directly elected mayors. Any adjustments, in what is a new dispensation, could then be made. New dynamics in the relationship between manager, members and mayor will arise in this uncharted territory. It will need to be monitored in a very exact fashion to ensure the balance of powers is adjusted in the best interests of elected members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions regarding the salaries and pensions of councillors will be widely welcomed throughout the House. For too long we have had local democracy on the cheap. We have expected councillors to carry the burden of local represen<Col N="1360" /> tation without a realistic consideration of the demands on their time and commitment. The days when one could have membership of a council on an amateur basis are long gone. Today's local authorities need informed, motivated people who can devote time to the complex issues involved in representing local communities. The introduction of a credible and realistic salary is overdue and will be welcomed by all elected members. I hope there will be no undue delay in bringing together the various elements of the salary scheme. I hope also the Minister will give priority to meeting the leaders of the representative associations in the autumn in order that the level and detail of the salary scheme, and a corresponding pension scheme and gratuity, can be produced without delay.</P>
    <P>We must also take long serving councillors into account in the pension scheme and gratuity. One must look at the workload and the number of committees that one must attend. A salary of less than £12,000 to £15,000 would be an insult to councillors, considering the work they do and the demands put on them. I call on LAMA and the General Council of County Councils to make these points when discussing the provision of payments.</P>
    <P>The question of research backup must also be discussed. There must be provision for those establishing offices to serve their communities. It is impossible to do the work without some back-up services. I would like to think that there would be a statutory entitlement to time off to attend council meetings.</P>
    <P>It may not be a good idea to reopen the discussion on the dual mandate. However, as a Senator, I had no problem with its removal. There is an emerging workload at local government level, and such a proliferation of committees and structures, that being a local representative has become an almost full-time job. We can no longer serve two chambers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to acknowledge the workload of councils. They are the basic framework of politics in this country. Without local authorities we would not be sitting here or get a chance to talk about this Bill. When it comes to negotiating the salary scheme, the Minister should reflect on how much work councillors do and how much they help in making democracy work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Costello.</P>
      <P>It is late in the evening and very late in the term. The long awaited and long promised Local Government Bill, 2000, is finally with us. It is substantial legislation. Unfortunately it is not the reforming legislation heralded by the Government, nor is it the reforming legislation described by the Minister of State tonight. Despite its size there is not much new in it. This is to be regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much new in terms of the major issue facing every elected member of a local authority, regardless of whether they are represented <Col N="1361" /> in the House, which is the power of the elected member. As Senator Ormonde and others have pointed out, the workload of and demands on councillors have increased but their powers have diminished. Earlier we passed the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill and further diluted local democracy and undermined the role of the elected member by handing over one of the reserved functions to the manager, namely, the power to adopt a waste management plan. That is regrettable, but I will confine my remarks to the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where electors are beginning to ask why they elect us. I will give two short anecdotes to illustrate my point. During the Seanad elections in 1997, I met an elected councillor in the Dublin area who pointed out that the poverty partnership programme in her area had more funding than the council of which she was a member. No one on that partnership was elected.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting, of which there are many, organised by the National Roads Authority and its consultants to draw up the route selection programme for the five new motorways to be built under the national development plan. Outside this meeting were represented community groups affected by one of these motorways in the Tipperary area. All asked elected councillors attending the meeting what, if anything, we would do to represent their views. The short answer was that there was very little we could do to represent their views because these major road programmes will not come before elected members in any form over which we will have influence.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the largest road development project which will have most impact on the lives of individuals and communities we represent will not be debated by elected local authority members in any formal way. This is one example of how down the years legislation has been passed which has undermined in a real and unfortunate way the power of the elected member to the extent that we are left with a large workload but little power. Unfortunately, the Bill does not address this issue.</P>
    <P>While changes are proposed in the Bill for directly elected chairs of councils, remuneration for councillors, which is welcome, and other matters referred to by the Minister of State, overall it is not the reforming legislation we would have asked for. The Minister of State referred to the role of local authorities in partnership and inclusion. How can we implement a programme of partnership and inclusion when we do not have power to make changes and major decisions which affect people's lives? In terms of roads, waste management and other areas, we have diluted the role of the elected member and, to a large extent, we have created unaccountable structures. In the longer term, we have, unfortunately, created an even greater cynicism among the public about the role of the elected member.</P>
    <P>I look forward to debating the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage when we will be able <Col N="1362" /> to examine it in fine detail. In some sections, especially where amendments made in the Dáil are concerned, there are elements which must be closely examined.</P>
    <P>The directly elected chairs are a new initiative and I join with others in questioning how they will work in practice. In theory it is a great idea to have someone who, with the mandate of the people, is given the role to serve as chair of the county or city council for five years. Unless that office is given some powers of initiative or is enabled to cope with the executive powers of the manager, it is an empty role. I understand the concerns of councillors, especially those who have served for a long time, about the potential of a person who has never been a member of a local authority being elected to that position for a local reason, such as dumps, incinerators, roads or hospitals. That is one area we will examine closely to see how it works out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and sympathise with him for having such a long session. We are approaching midnight and we have not sat this late for a long time. However, I am glad there has not been a guillotine of the legislation and I compliment the Leader on that.</P>
      <P>As many speakers have said, the Bill is a fine tome which is large in size and weight but leaves a considerable amount to be desired in terms of quality. It is not that there are not good measures in the Bill but they should have been much better. The legislation is built on the White Paper, Better Local Government, of 1996, introduced by Deputy Howlin, then Minister for the Environment. There are some good measures in the Bill and some good ones were introduced prior to it, such as the new structures in area committees, special policy committees, integrated area plans and city and county development plans. These are interesting and worthwhile developments which have the intention of providing a better local service with policy and delivery elements as part of it. That is useful as a background.</P>
      <P>The other background element is the constitutional recognition of local government which is very important. We know local government is in a position to enhance itself in future. Much of that was brought about because 1998 was the centenary of local government in Ireland and a number of measures were prompted as a result.</P>
      <P>The most serious deficiency in the legislation to which speakers have referred repeatedly is that the role of elected members has not been enhanced in terms of powers. Unless I as an elected member of my local authority can say I have greater power than I had prior to this legislation, it is not of much use. I will not receive remuneration for the service I give but ordinary members will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While new structures are put in place, there are no new powers to do things. No local funding is provided to allow local authorities to do all they would like to do. They are still very much dependent on the combination of the rate support fund <Col N="1363" /> from the Government, which Deputy Howlin introduced for water service charges and is ring-fenced, and part of the Government fund itself. Most local authorities still work on a shoestring.</P>
    <P>The real powers reside with the manager. Not until there is an opportunity in terms of powers and funding to carry out in full the work of local authorities will we have good local government. Given that the managerial system is being strengthened by way of legislation, more decisions will now be taken by the Minister which will encroach further on the decisions of councillors. This is not a healthy sign. There is no point in the Minister lecturing us about councillors not making decisions. What he means is that they will not make the decisions he likes. That is a different matter which has come up on several occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been seriously embarrassed by having to reverse his decision on the five borough councils of Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford which he said would be abolished. However, the greatest embarrassment relates to the dual mandate to which the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, and the backbenchers of most parties, were opposed. The Minister did not bow to the backbenchers on this issue but to the four Independent Deputies. These were the only people who were listened to, which is not healthy for democracy. That just gives the Minister a bad name both inside and outside the House. I wish him well and hope he makes an early recovery and comes back with more legislation before the time runs out.</P>
    <P>On the issue of directly elected chathaoirligh and lord mayors, I share the reservations expressed by the General Council of County Councils and the other representative bodies. It is not appropriate that someone who has no experience of local authority workings should be the senior person to whom elected local authority members will be responsible. That person would then be in a position to run the show in local authorities. There is a need to have a CV. One may say that his could be left to the discretion of the electorate, but given that the media has huge power, someone who has a high public profile and not necessarily experience in dealing with complex aspects of local government, could be in the most senior position in local authorities. While that respects the democratic position it does not respect the need for good government which is part and parcel of democracy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be disclosure of interests. A register of interests must be compiled and elected local representatives will be answerable as is the case for Members of the Oireachtas. While I would like the Bill to be a more hard-hitting in terms of giving more powers to local councillors, nevertheless, it includes many good aspects. I welcome the remuneration for hard working members of local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a vision for local government. Many other Ministers for Local Government had an opportunity to do what he has done but they did not do it. There is some criticism of the Bill but in general it is welcomed, which is to be expected. The criticism of the Bill is unfair, unjust and somewhat hypocritical. It must be acknowledged that a great deal of reforming legislation has been introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Wallace and Molloy since taking office.</P>
      <P>The central aim of the Bill is to enhance the role of the elected member, support community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy, modernise local government legislation, and provide the framework for new financial management systems and other procedures to promote efficiency and effectiveness and to underpin generally the programme of local government renewal. We should acknowledge that the Bill is doing just that. Perhaps it is fair to say that if anyone in this House or in the other House had an opportunity to frame this Bill they might either include or exclude aspects of it. However, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is the person responsible and we should welcome what he has done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to the workload of county councillors and so on and a general acknowledgment of many of the good aspects of the Bill. The greatest single reform the Minister has introduced here is the preservation of democracy at local level. He has done so by ensuring that local authority members receive some reward for the work they do. If things continued as they were, being a member of a local authority would become the preserve of millionaires and those who could afford to be away from their businesses. However, the Minister has ensured that ordinary men and women will represent ordi<Col N="1365" /> nary people at local government level, which is central to any democratic process.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this reform &ndash; perhaps other reforms such as roads, housing, infrastructure and so on could be administered by the Department &ndash; which is necessary if local government is to continue into the future. Many councillors have demanded this reform. Many people have left local government because they could not afford to continue in that service. This is the Minister's greatest achievement.</P>
    <P>There are councillors who will say that they would prefer things to continue as they were. There are Senators and Members of the other House who spoke about the dual mandate and said that it should be surrendered. There is nothing to stop any Member of either House from opting out, people who are critical of this provision of the Bill and of the fact that the Government changed its mind? What about it if the Government changed its mind? That is what democracy is all about. People have that option.</P>
    <P>The last time the issue of the workload of local authority members was debated in this House, it was said that the workload of a county councillor was 19 hours per week. It was said tonight that county councillors work approximately 33 hours per week. I wish to inform this House and the media that no person in local government will serve their community with a time involvement of only 33 hours. A councillor can do 50 to 60 hours when all is added up. It is not solely time spent in the council chamber but meetings with communities, residents and the many objectors' groups. A councillor's spouse or partner is often involved, giving a free service. Democracy now costs money.</P>
    <P>The body of people in local government are honest people across all the parties. I do not know any person who has served in local government who has not lost money in doing so. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on that reform.</P>
    <P>Senators have referred to various figures. Surely a county councillor is worth what a county council road worker earns, that is, about £16,000 per year. That is the minimum councillors should be paid. There should also be a proper job evaluation to find out what the real input and real cost is.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with one other matter in the Bill which amends the Abattoirs Act, 1998. I warn the Minister about this matter. An interdepartmental group has been sitting for some time to consider the future role of local authority vets. I say to that group to leave the power of the veterinary officer with the local authority and not to centralise it. It should be kept separate because local authority vets are the people involved with the National Food Authority and it is vital for the protection of the consumer that they remain separate. It cannot become involved with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I will fight that with every bit of energy in my body.</P>

      <P>It is now 15 minutes past midnight and I do not wish to repeat the points that have been made. This is a very important Bill. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and I wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, a return to full health at an early date.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues in the Bill that are a source of concern. One of them relates to the status of various towns across the country. Expectations had been raised over recent years in relation to the increase in status of a number of towns from town commission to the status of urban district council. This Bill does not cater for those towns. I refer in particular to Shannon in County Clare. It is one of the fastest-growing towns in the country. It is a relatively new town, at 45 years old, that has expanded dramatically in recent years. The definite and strong belief was that it would acquire the status of an urban district council as an improvement from the status of town commission. Unfortunately, this Bill has done nothing to empower that council or to enhance its authority within its local community and area. The people of the area are extremely disappointed and the public representatives of Shannon are confounded that all the promises that emanated from the Department of the Environment and Local Government over recent years have come to nothing. The co-operation between Clare County Council, the Shannon Town Commission and SFADCo has resulted in absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>I am sorry this matter is not taken into consideration in the Bill. I say to the Minister that it is still not too late. We still have to deal with Committee Stage in this House and I ask him to address this matter specifically on Committee Stage. If we are serious about devolution of power to local public representatives and local authorities, here is a case in point where this should and must be done. I appeal to the Minister to respond positively.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of this House not to put on record our appreciation of all councillors since the foundation of the State who gave of their time and energy, in most instances causing the devaluation of their properties or their business interests. They served the country and their respective local authorities at a time when they did not get a ha'penny return. They did not even get expenses initially and then only minimal expenses. Most serving members of local public authorities lost financially as a result of their service. It is time we respected that and put on record our appreciation. Were it not for them, we would not have a local authority system today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to remunerate councillors is extremely important and very welcome. I concur with Senator Callanan that there should be an initial payment of £15,000 per year. Every coun<Col N="1367" /> cillor should receive at least that sum per year. I ask the Minister to consider that figure as a starting point. Councillors do a phenomenal amount of work. The expansion in the number of committees, sub-committees and SPCs has created a huge workload for councillors. That must be recognised and respected and they must be properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>The Government has egg on its face in relation to the dual mandate. A fundamental principle on which the Government went to the electorate in the last election was that the dual mandate would be abolished, but it succumbed to the pressure from the four Independents Members. The Government then came under further pressure from the four Progressive Democrats Deputies. They caved in on the token gesture whereby, though the dual mandate continues, Oireachtas Members who are members of local authorities will not be paid. Once one gives in on the principle, that is it &ndash; and to discriminate against Members of the Oireachtas is unconstitutional. This is a farce.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have resigned permanent and pensionable jobs in teaching and other professions to be full-time politicians and legislators. A county councillor is not a legislator. A county councillor is a local public representative. A Member of the Oireachtas is elected to legislate. Those are two very distinct functions and to say there is a cross function is a nonsense and is not a justification for succumbing to political pressure from within the Government. I ask the Minister to address the issue again. The fundamental issue is the principle of the dual mandate. The Government has caved in to pressure on that and should now deal with the issue with a sense of fair play.</P>
    <P>As someone who has served on a local authority for 22 years I say it is vitally important that the chairman of the local authority has service and experience on local authorities. I do not care about their political persuasion. Learning on a local authority is an extensive process and one will be a member of a local authority for a number of years before one has expertise and knowledge regarding all that goes on. For someone totally inexperienced to come in and take over as chairman is not good for local government and cannot be effective. Unless there is the co-operation and goodwill of the elected members and unless they have the authority to elect their chairman this is a recipe for disaster. I ask the Minister to look very seriously at that issue again.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the funding needed to have proper local government is not provided for in the Bill. Having been elected as a councillor since 1985, I can say that local government members are the Cinderella of any political system. They do extraordinary work and give as much time to their jobs as Deputies and Senators. They go to meetings and try to be available to all sorts of interest groups from one end of the week to the other. The remuneration that has been spoken about should be even greater because local government members are full-time workers. They have to juxtapose their jobs with the demands of the local authority. One thing that has happened with the development of the SPCs is that external people have seen from the inside the amount of time given to meetings. We would not have as many items on the agenda per day in the Seanad. The typical agenda of a council meeting can run on forever. That is because we are dealing with very complicated issues and programmes right across the board from infrastructure to planning.</P>
      <P>On directly elected cathaoirligh, it is an intrusion on the democratic system to find that if one person is there for five years there will not be an opportunity for councillors to be elected through rotation. It brings a tremendous amount of pride to villages and rural areas when the cathaoirleach can bring the council to those areas and hold specific events which provide the public with an understanding of what local authorities do. That will be lost with one person having five years without having what happens in Germany where the directly elected person is the chief executive and has power and funding. I presume the Minister was thinking in terms of our European neighbours. What is missing in the Irish system is that one has the honour of being cathaoirleach or mayor but not have the power to go with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the National Roads Authority is the subject of ongoing controversy the length and breadth of the land. That controversy has been raised by Senators on both sides of the House. I am appalled at what happened in relation to the so-called powers of local authority members. Attending public meeting after public meeting one is asked what one can do about consultation. I have mentioned the Nenagh to Limerick road <Col N="1369" /> which is exercising the minds of hundreds of people. They are very irritated that they have a week to make submissions having had one opportunity to look at the plans on very badly printed maps. When we addressed the National Roads Authority with the engineer &ndash; who was anxious to have more consultation &ndash; one week was given to the people whose lives will be affected by the selection and implementation of the route. I am glad I can make that point because if we are talking about local democracy we are surely talking about consultation. It is very sad for councillors to have to say we have no part in this other than to approve or disapprove. If we do either, the manager can go ahead and do whatever, or the Minister can intervene. We do not have powers.</P>
    <P>As regards residential density guidelines, the Minister looked at the Bacon reports and juxtaposed Dublin with Clonmel, Tipperary and Limerick. He does not seem to be aware that there is a totally different ethos relating to housing developments and needs in those areas. Everything may happen in Dublin from the perspective of the Minister but it does not from the perspective of those from the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>We have two enforcement officers in County Limerick. Two have left and we cannot get anyone to come and work in the area. The most important aspect of legislation is ensuring that proper planning is being adhered to by developers. It is enforcement officers who do that. Why do people not want to work in local authorities? Why are we losing our planners and engineers? Is it because of lack of competitive remuneration compared to the private sector or is it because the work load is so great that they are as frustrated as councillors? These are the questions that should have been addressed in the Bill. There is frustration at all levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason people are leaving local authorities is very simple. It is because the Celtic Tiger is out there alive and well and they are being offered a great deal more money.</P>

      <P>I too would like to have seen urban district council status for Mullingar. I would have liked to have seen a town of its size &ndash; 16,000 or 17,000 and projected to be 28,000 within the next five years &ndash;  included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the trust, work and dedication of this Minister. In 1985, during the life of the disastrous 1983 to 1987 administration, two out of every three lights in every town and village was turned off and there was no money for footpaths. Pot-hole candidates were elected in 1991 because of the lack of investment. Before us is the Minister's achievement. Local government is now constitutionally recognised with a fixed electoral cycle. Guaranteed local elections on a constitutional basis provide a solid foundation for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Local Government Fund, established by legislation in 1998, is now delivering significant <Col N="1370" /> additional resources. This is borne out by the allocation in 2001. In the region of £270 million is being provided for local authorities, delivering almost 64% more for general purpose needs than in 1997. This is an incredible increase in the delivery of services by the Minister. In addition, the national development plan is delivering major increases in capital funding for local authority projects, ensuring essential services and infrastructure will be in place to meet demands in a growing economy and a developing society.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome this legislation to the House. On a point raised by Senator O'Meara, there are three councils which did not implement a waste management plan. This is the reason the Minister had to take back the power for a four year term only. He did so in order that a plan would be put in place.</P>
    <P>The area councils, now being established in all counties, including County Westmeath, are an enormous success. It is about bringing local authority work to parish councils, all local communities and committees. The decisions are coming from the grassroots. I welcome this move and hope the Minister will remunerate the various positions required for these local councils. I see the opportunity for real local decentralisation, as happened in Castlepollard in my area of north Westmeath and other parts of the county, where we can now tax our cars, get a driver's licence and make planning applications. We will have our library increased to three times its current size. There is real local authority decentralisation taking place in every county.</P>

      <P>Only a former member of a local authority would have had the experience to know how important these matters were. I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his recovery from illness. I look forward to him devolving further power to councils and the people who want these services created.</P>
      <P>The provision of a salary for members of local authorities is long overdue and I am pleased that it will be enshrined in legislation. I congratulate the various organisations involved such as the General Council of County Councils, the AMAI and LAMA for their hard work during the years as well as past chairmen and members of these organisations. They sent deputation after deputation to the Minister to try to have all these provisions included in the Bill and to have all these problems addressed on behalf of their members. The Minister is a former secretary of LAMA and was aware of the needs which had to be addressed in regard to salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been easy to come to an agreement on salaries but the suggestion of an evaluation of the workload of county councillors will surely help the Minister in assessing the initial salary to be provided to recognise the valuable work being done by the members of local authorities whose families have done Trojan work. We were always <Col N="1371" /> told that it was an honour to serve the public. The trust the public places in a member of a local authority or the Oireachtas is sacrosanct. Their families are the real Trojan heroes of the public service. The public representative gets kudos from time to time, but the families get nothing for the difficulties and hard work they must endure from early morning until late at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension rights should also be addressed in the context of salaries. It is great that this issue will be addressed. This is long overdue. I hope members of local authorities will be able to enjoy them. During the years I have noticed that due to the hard work and dedication of quite a number of members of local authorities, their communities will not accept that they must retire and they often die in office. I hope this provision, once it has put in place, will be a little incentive for them to enjoy the fruits of their hard work in service of their parish or area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the guarantee in the Bill that local elections will be held every five years. At one stage there was a period of nine years between elections. That was not healthy for local democracy. I also welcome the inclusion of the SPCs in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Nowadays the work of a member of a local authority is the equivalent of three day's full-time work per week. If we bear this in mind, their work must be rewarded generously. This must be done because there is a need to retain those with experience.</P>
      <P>On the dual mandate, I always thought that the legislators, who on Mondays and Fridays went back to their constituencies, were familiar with legislation and of great assistance to councils on which they served. They also were able to keep a check on the executives of local authorities and the public representative's role in view. If I were faced with the choice of deciding whether they should be remunerated, I would be mindful of the fact that local authority work accounts for 70% of my workload. It is an honour to serve on my council and I would wish to continue serving the people and the parish to which I am committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county's population has fallen by 34% in 30 years. I am aware that parts of the counties of the Senators opposite also have been decimated by declining population. If I lost the determination to continue to give freely of my time every Monday night, as I have done for the past 20 years, to improve the lot of the parish in north Westmeath in which I was born, I would retire from public life. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated last week in the House that in his time he has seen, as I have in the 19 years I have been a Member of the House, many good men and women who had good jobs become Members of the Oireachtas. They had good prospects for promotion in their fields but gave them <Col N="1372" /> up in the interests of serving as a Deputy or Senator, and often finished up many years later losing their seats and having no job to which to return. In many cases they faced financial ruin. This must be addressed as it is not fair. The general public does not expect this of us.</P>
    <P>Those who see the salaries we receive as Members of the Oireachtas or the small reward we receive for being members of local authorities know the demands placed upon us, such as attending functions and participating in fund-raising activities for charitable organisations or family disasters. Between one thing and another, the demands on public life are incredible. The drive to serve one's community and parish and try to do some good is admirable. The satisfaction one gets from this is the only reward for being a public representative.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill a safe passage. I know more amending legislation will be needed to update and improve the Bill in years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>By any standards, the legislation is very significant. It is a large Bill running to over 300 pages and over 200 sections. With this Bill, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has sought to introduce reforming legislation. He has at times been subjected to criticism but, in time, after our closely examining what he set out to achieve, he will be seen as a reforming Minister and a friend and supporter of local democracy. He was a member of a local county council for many years and has a great understanding of the workings of councils. He was a member of the representative body for many years. I wish him a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>What the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, set out to achieve did not please everybody initially, but the plan, as set out in the Bill, is enormous. He did not try to diminish the role of the local councillor but to enhance it. He set out to involve the local communities more, support local democracy, modernise local government by introducing new frameworks regarding its operation and update archaic legislation, some of which was introduced in the 1800s. In general, he tried to underpin the programme of local government renewal &ndash; an ongoing process that will not end after the enactment of this Bill. He must be congratulated for the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is a new ethics framework for councillors and staff. There is an independent commission to deal with local authority boundary changes, etc. The Bill emphasises the role of the elected council in determining policy, particularly the partnership model concerning the strategic policy committees. They are only some of the bodies that involve local people working with councillors for the betterment of an entire community.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of a number of items in the Bill, such as the dual mandate, salaries and directly elected mayors. People forget the other elements of the Bill which will probably be considered in the next few hours or days. They tend to emphasise a few key issues at the expense of the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> Let us consider the dual mandate. I supported the abolition of the dual mandate &ndash; I have always said so &ndash; but not because it is impossible to do both jobs. It is possible to do two or three jobs, but one must work a lot harder. I know from my own experience as a councillor since 1985 that the workload of a local councillor has increased tenfold in terms of the number of meetings one has to attend and the number of functions. The amount of paperwork has increased enormously. The work of a local councillor is very difficult, not impossible to do in conjunction with another job, but getting increasingly more difficult. However, it is no more difficult for a Senator or a Deputy to be a local councillor than it is for a Deputy to be a Minister. Nobody says a Deputy cannot do the job of a Minister &ndash; of course he can. However, one has to work a little bit harder.</P>
    <P>If one works harder, it must be recognised and remunerated. A lot of discussion was concerned with this issue of salaries. There is a provision in the Bill for the introduction by regulation of a salary for councillors. I welcome that but the salary must be realistic. People have mentioned many figures, such as £10,000, £15,000 and £20,000. As is done with Senators' salaries, will the Minister make councillors' salaries proportional to those of Deputies so they will not be looking for another rise in a few years as inflation and expenses rise? We all know that more money is needed as time goes by. The salary of a councillor should be at least a quarter or third of a Deputy's salary. Why not?</P>
    <P>The amount of work councillors do night after night is phenomenal. Their families suffer as well. There is no joy in it. One receives no thanks. One gets nothing but abuse most of the time. Therefore, the position must be properly remunerated and structured in such a way that the salary will rise automatically. Will the Minister of State seriously consider the matter? Additionally, the salaries should be backdated to the time of election, if this is possible. There should also be a pension which should be backdated to the date the councillor was first elected. This again is reasonable. No matter what job one is in, if a pension is included, it goes back to the time when one gets the job. These demands are not impossible; they are small.</P>
    <P>The public does not fully realise how much work councillors do, but if anyone wants to take on the job, and they do sometimes rush into it, they suddenly find themselves swamped with paperwork and meetings and wonder what hit them. It is a great privilege to do it even without remuneration because one is serving the community at local government level more than any other. This must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The issue of directly elected mayors was referred to. I foresee difficulties in this regard. I do not know how a mayor will cope for five years. It is very demanding. The present system of having chairpersons change every year is a good idea. Maybe, in time, we will amend this legislation or maybe it will work out. I am willing to try it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> In my council of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the job of the mayor or cathaoirleach is almost full time. There is another weakness in this regard. Very high profile people may get elected to a mayoralty who do not have any knowledge of local government or they may not have the same wish to serve as other councillors. This happens in London where candidates spend enormous amounts of money to get elected. There may be a limit on what people spend in elections, but a high profile candidate with no great commitment to local government could easily seize such a position. I am not sure that is good, but it can be examined again.</P>
    <P>With regard to SPCs, most councillors serve on two of these. In my own area, some of them work and some of them do not. It is a great idea but much work is required to make them operate efficiently. Some members of the public on these SPCs, representing various groups, have been disappointed with what has happened to their input because they are non-executive and have to report back to the full council. Given time, they will enhance local democracy.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues I could discuss, but it is 12.50 a.m. and other speakers wish to contribute. In this regard, I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who has been here all day while the Senators have drifted in and out, attended for votes and had tea.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who has been mentioned already. I also wish the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, a speedy recovery. He is responsible for this reforming legislation. Some may not be fully satisfied with it but it can always be amended. There are aspects of the Bill with which I am not too happy, but I will address them later.</P>
      <P>County councillors and local authorities have existed for a very long time. I was nominated to contest a Dáil election in 1969 on behalf of Fianna Fáil. I failed to receive a nomination to contest local elections at the subsequent local election convention. That meant I never became a member of a local authority. I did seek to become a member of one but that is how democracy, being as it is, fell for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the work done by members of my local authority, including Senator Jackman and others, and I commend them for their dedication. When I sought the nomination there was no such thing as councillors being paid. The subject was never mentioned. Most community work at that time <Col N="1375" /> was voluntary. Local representatives worked on a voluntary basis with expenses. They worked hard, often neglecting their businesses, which in some cases they lost. Those days are gone and we need to ensure that members of local authorities are remunerated justly. Work for other organisations such as coaching in sporting organisations used to be voluntary too but is now remunerated. That is the current trend.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section introducing remuneration for councillors. I am pleased it mentions that councillors have a 33 hour week. Some say they have a 40 or 50 hour week. They have a long week, given the number of functions they have to attend and they deserve proper remuneration. I agree with Senator Lydon's request that the Minister pay councillors justly, having weighed up the work they do. Setting the figure as a percentage of a Seanad or Dáil salary has been mentioned. The figure seems to improve with each speaker and this could develop into an auction. The Minister should, however, remunerate councillors properly.</P>
    <P>Pay and pensions should be index-linked. Salaries should increase in line with the cost of living. Councillors should receive a decent pension on retirement. It is very important that pensions are backdated to the day on which councillors were elected. Pay should also be backdated. Provision was made before the last local elections to offer a package to anyone who wished to retire. I understand the Bill provides for back payment until the day of the Bill's introduction. I appeal to the Minister to backdate pay to the day of the last general election.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the dual mandate. I have already explained that I tried to become a member of a local authority. I did not succeed in getting the nomination and refused to stand as an independent because I am loyal to my party. I have been a Member of this House for many years and the dual mandate has made no difference to me. I have always got on very well with councillors throughout the country by virtue of not holding a dual mandate and would envisage no problems for Members of the House if the dual mandate was abolished. It would benefit local government and the workings of national Government.</P>
    <P>I was an external member of a county committee of agriculture and regret the abolition of these and the local aid committees some years ago. The local authorities have done great work in providing local services. They are of greater benefit to the community than regional authorities because they are more <i>au fait </i>with local needs. The same could be applied to agriculture.</P>
    <P>My biggest problem with the legislation is the direct election of mayors or cathaoirligh, which will take away power from elected representatives. The position of elected mayor or chairman for five years could be full-time. As has been mentioned, the person might not have much interest in politics and might get fed up with the post after two or three years. He might resign <Col N="1376" /> because he finds he is neglecting his business or the pay might not be good enough. Will that cause another direct election to replace him? </P>
    <P>In County Limerick there are 28 councillors. Seven members are elected from the Castleconnell&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right to ensure the gender balance is maintained. There are seven from the Bruff electoral area. I remember 20 years ago when there were only five elected to the council from that area. Four members are elected from the Kilmallock area, five from the Rathkeale electoral area and five from Newcastle West. If one of these, let us say a member from the Bruff or Castleconnell electoral area, was elected chairman of the county council area, would that lead to an increase in members of the county council from 28 to 29, given that the chairman of the council will automatically be a member of the council? Is there provision in the Bill for membership to increase?</P>
      <P>This provision could also mean extra representation for one area. Previously this was decided on an equality basis. If one area's representation on the county council increases with the election of the mayor, it will disenfranchise other areas. This is unfair and needs to be examined. Directly elected mayors will unfairly increase the representation of one area and increase the number of councillors. I oppose this proposition. Given that the mayors do not need to be elected until 2004, we have three years to correct the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and join other Members in sending my good wishes to the Minster for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who has shown himself to be a very reforming Minister. I also welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House. He is a veteran of the Seanad at this stage and certainly has staying power. The Local Government Bill and supporting measures provide a package which, if utilised, will tilt the balance significantly in favour of the elected council. It is the Minister's aim to ensure that this package is fully utilised.</P>
      <P>The Bill revises the council and executive framework so that the elected council has an updated series of mechanisms to oversee, monitor and direct the implementation of policy by the executive. The manager operates within this policy framework and has a duty to carry out and put into effect decisions of the elected council. While major policy decisions continue to be vested in the elected council, the SPC framework allows for more in-depth involvement by all councillors in policy development from early stages, with better support and information and training opportunities which are being further developed with the involvement of the social partners and other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> I have been a local authority member for 22 years and it has been claimed that the local community had no involvement in local government. The establishment of SPCs has answered that accusation. Until now, policy development has, by default, fallen to officials, with limited scope for input by councillors. The preparation of the draft annual budget for the authority and the local authority corporate plan should be undertaken by the manager in consultation with the corporate policy group and submitted to the council for consideration and adoption with an annual progress report by the manager of the corporate plan. I have served on a local authority for 22 years and I have had the honour of being chairman twice. In my experience the manager presents a draft estimate for consideration by the members who, if they wish to make amendments, must make them in the full glare of the public, even if the amendments are unpopular. The manager has the privilege of making proposals in the book of estimates behind closed doors with his subordinate officials. This is not a fair way of doing business.</P>
    <P>The corporate policy group consists of chairs of strategic policy committees and the cathaoirleach. It is a sort of cabinet and reflects the representational balance on the council. It has an over-arching role in corporate affairs. The corporate policy group can require a report on any matter related to local authority functions and the cathaoirleach may require the manager to defer action on any such matter to allow for consideration by the elected council. The directly elected chairman with a five year term will raise the profile and public interest in local government. The chairman will have real potential for community leadership working on behalf of the elected council.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns expressed by members of local authorities to me and to the Local Authority Members Association. It has been suggested that a person with a high public profile might stand as mayor or cathaoirleach but might not have the necessary experience to discharge the functions of that office. In the past it was noted that when a council had a weak chairman, in the subsequent local election the members lost their seats. It would be unfortunate if a weak cathaoirleach or mayor was subject to the will of the manager. That would not make for good local government.</P>
    <P>I have never been a supporter of the dual mandate. I was elected in 1979 to Westmeath County Council and to Mullingar Town Commission. On gaining election to this House I resigned my seat on the urban authority because I believe there is no case to be made for having a multiplicity of mandates. I consider that to be undemocratic and not the best way to do business. However, I accept that there are members of local authorities and of the Oireachtas who do not agree that the dual mandate should be abolished and I respect that. Local authority members are under extreme <Col N="1378" /> pressure of work. Any local authority member who works a 33 hour week is living it up.</P>
    <P>Democracy costs money. When elected members of local authorities attend conferences they are often criticised in their local media for attending a conference which was not relevant to their work. It is important that councillors attend seminars and conferences, if only to inform themselves about how to go about their business. The powers-that-be did not always recognise the fact that democracy costs money and councillors have been the poor relation of democracy.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the relevance of town commissions and to the fact that their powers have not been increased. This is not the case. As a nominee of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, I consulted the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on this matter and I passed on his reply to all local authorities, including town commissions. I received a positive response from councillors and a very complimentary telephone call from a town commissioner who is a member of the Fine Gael Party. This commissioner recognised that the Minister is devolving powers to town commissions.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is not treating members of the farming community fairly. I spoke at Westmeath County Council about the attitude of the NRA to landowners along the line of national primary and secondary routes. During the foot and mouth disease crisis the people of Ireland demonstrated their feeling for the land and for the people who work on it. The landowners who are affected by the implementation of NRA decisions must be treated fairly.</P>
    <P>Salaries for councillors are long overdue. Councillors have been the doormat of democracy. They have been paid nothing for doing long hours of hard work on behalf of their constituents. It is time the role of councillors was recognised and that we should get a salary commensurate with our input to local democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and I appreciate the length of time he has spent here. I welcome the Bill, which is innovative and part of a radical approach by this Government to all aspects of local government. The Bill has a substantial number of sections and fundamentally sets out the role of the elected representative and the executive function of county managers in the future. It involves the incorporation of operational procedures for counties' financial management, the flexibility of powers within the counties and sets out corporate planning and development for counties. It also sets out the independent commission for the establishment of boundary changes within the counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managers must operate within the policy framework. They have a duty of care to the elected representatives and this is very important. It is important also to define the role of the elected representatives and the functions and duties of managers and officials towards the <Col N="1379" /> elected representatives. In future the manager must take on board and put in place the recommendations and decisions of the council.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is a definition of who the chair shall be. He will be elected by a direct vote for a term of five years. Although I have my own views on that, I accept the decision. To some extent this gives an opportunity for inclusiveness and will bring in people who function in different sectors of society. At the same time it opens up new opportunities for chairpersons and to work with rather than be restricted by the managers and the officials of councils. It may give a certain innovation at council level that should be welcomed. At the same time we must respect the elected representatives. As a member of councils myself, I have always supported the role of county councillors.</P>
    <P>It also sets down in statute that elections will be held every five years with the next election to take place in May or June 2004. I welcome the fact that it also incorporates functions of the SPCs which are in their embryonic stage at the moment. They have much to offer and sections 48 and 54 allow county councils to work together to set up SPCs. As someone from the west, I believe there are opportunities for us particularly in Roscommon when dealing with national primary routes. Things that affect Roscommon also affect Mayo, Sligo and other counties.</P>
    <P>Part 14 sets out a statement of strategy. If requested, managers must supply information and this is important. They must not incur costs within the council that they have not outlined before a meeting and explained to elected representatives. It requires the manager to inform the council before he makes any financial commitments and this is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the ethical aspect of the Bill. Sections 176 to 179 outline the ethical responsibilities of elected representatives, officials and managers. This is not before time and will be good for us all. Even though there are procedures in place at present, this defines the responsibilities of all concerned. There are many public questions about decisions taken by councillors and officials. This is something that will protect the right and interests of individuals in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 43 allows for payments to councillors and I welcome that. I am not setting down any parameters as to what the amount should be, but I believe the labourer is worthy of his hire. He has a new commitment in this Bill and the other legislation on better local government. I believe the Minister will recognise that in a properly planned way in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Now that we are at the conclusion of Second Stage, I thank all the Senators who contributed here tonight. I know local government is a subject that is close to the Senators' hearts and the debate just finished reflects their obvious commitment in that regard.</P>
      <P>The diverse and wide ranging contributions during the debate by the Members of the House reflect the importance of local government in our society and show how it impacts in a very real way on the daily lives of each of us. Local government is integral to our continued economic and social development at all levels, locally and nationally. I know we share a common desire to support the local government system to cope with the increasing demands being placed on it. Everyone agrees there is need for the renewal of local government and the Government's renewal programme aims to move forward in a progressive way to deliver on this objective in a realistic and practical manner. In doing so, we hope to enable local authorities to provide quality customer service to the communities they serve.</P>
      <P>Local government is facing huge challenges, higher expectations and greater accountability than ever before. The Government's renewal programme aims to equip it to perform efficiently and effectively in this changing environment. To do this, however, the local government system needs a modern, legal framework and this is the first time any Government has brought forward such legislation. The Bill acknowledges the need for change and provides a practical framework for local government to reshape its operations with the full involvement of members, staff and local communities in a more participative and representative democracy.</P>
      <P>A number of detailed matters were raised relating to different sections of the Bill. These will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage and a full debate at that time will provide the opportunity to deal with the matters comprehensively. I refer particularly to questions of local authority staffing and meetings mentioned by Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the next step on the journey of local government renewal and I wish the House well in its more detailed deliberations tomorrow. I again thank everyone who participated this evening and the staff of the House who were here very late tonight. It was a very important debate and I appreciate the contributions of all the Members.</P>
