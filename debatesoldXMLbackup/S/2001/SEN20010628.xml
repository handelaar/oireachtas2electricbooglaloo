      <P>I have received notice from Senator Glennon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to outline the options which were considered by Aer Rianta and her Department prior to their decision to proceed with a new east-west runway at Dublin Airport, which will have major negative consequences for the surrounding areas and particularly their communities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in view of the closure and loss of jobs at Precision Castings in Roscommon town, to consider establishing a special task force to promote alternative job creation in the area.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of the House I would like to extend sympathy to the family of the late Michael Moynihan, who served in this House from 1973 to 1981 and who was also a distinguished Dáil Deputy and junior Minister. I would also like to express our sympathy to his colleagues in the Labour Party, which he served with great distinction over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is encouragement in his political career for some of us in the Upper House in that he contested seven elections before becoming a Member of the Dáil in 1981. He was also a member of Kerry County Council and Killarney UDC and an executive member of the Transport and General Workers' Union. He was a great Kerry man and won a seat for the Labour Party in an <Col N="854" /> area which at that time was not considered easily captured. Once he got the seat he held on to it and is succeeded by his daughter, Breeda, to whom we particularly express our sympathy. We also express sympathy to his wife, Mai, his son Maurice and the other members of his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Michael Moynihan. I had the pleasure of having a chat with him on his last visit to the Houses a few weeks ago. He was always certain of a very warm welcome from all sides whenever he came to the Houses. Those who knew Michael will have many memories of him. His most striking quality was his extraordinary natural courtesy. He was a very quiet, soft-spoken man, a gentleman in every respect. His entire career was based on a genuine concern for other people. He was very close to the people he served, and that closeness was rewarded by the confidence they consistently placed in him over a very long period.</P>
      <P>He was very much in the old style of Irish politics, and of Irish Labour politics. He was very much the champion of the underdog and would take up unpopular causes and fight for the people who very often were not capable of fighting for themselves. He was also very good company. Always very quiet, he was a great observer of the human condition and had a very good sense of humour. It was always a pleasure to be on a trip with him or sit and talk with him quietly over a cup of tea to exchange views. One learned much from him as he had a great sense of wisdom and common sense.</P>
      <P>He was a big man in every sense of the word and I join with the Deputy Leader, on my own behalf and that of my party, in expressing sympathy to his wife and family and to the Labour Party which he served so well over such a long period and to which he left a lasting monument in terms of a seat which is still held by his party and his family. He was a good public servant. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish to be associated with the expressions of condolence to the family of the late Michael Moynihan. He is very much in the far reaches of my memory. Many decades ago, when Kerry was re-divided and west Kerry was transferred from the constituency of Kerry South to Kerry North, there was no Spring on the ballot paper for the first time in living memory and the new name of Moynihan that appeared on it was a point of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Moynihan was all that previous speakers have said. It was most extraordinary and surprising that a man who spoke so quietly, and often with a chuckle, had a voice with such a deeply resonant timbre that carried across a room when he spoke in public. He had an ideal public speaking voice. He had great concern for his constituency, huge commitment to his town of Killarney and dedicated his whole life to public service <Col N="855" /> and public representation. Like Robert the Bruce and the spider, he simply kept trying until he made it. He showed a great sense of commitment to his work and he and his family have been highly respected in his South Kerry constituency for many decades. We express our condolences to his wife, to Breeda, his daughter, and to the rest of his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too express my sympathy and offer condolences to the family of the late Michael Moynihan. He was a gentle giant. He certainly was a giant in the trade union movement and in the Labour Party. He was an extremely courteous man with whom one could always have a quiet chat.</P>
      <P>He entered politics in much the same way as most politicians, at local level, winning his first seat on Killarney Urban District Council in 1955 having already contested the general election in 1954. Of all the politicians who have come into Leinster House, few contested as many elections or traversed such difficult terrain to get elected as Michael Moynihan did in Kerry South, which could not be regarded as traditional trade union Labour voting territory. However, as other people have said, he stuck at it.</P>
      <P>He was a very steadfast and passionate man who believed deeply in championing the rights of the underdog. He was, first and foremost, a trade union activist in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. All his life that was his anchor in the community and he made it relevant to the community. He did not engage in highfalutin' talk or esoteric intellectualisation but had direct contact with people on the ground. On that foundation he built up his base and got elected to Kerry County Council, to this House where he served for a period, and to the other House. His daughter, Breeda, is now a Dáil Deputy.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to a very fine man, a very generous and courteous man, a great servant of the Labour Party and the trade union movement, a man who was passionate in his oratory and in his beliefs. Ar dheis Dé go rabh a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join with other Senators in a vote of sympathy to the family of Michael Moynihan, his wife, sons and daughters, in particular Breeda Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I grew up politically with Michael Moynihan in the days about which Senator O'Toole spoke. Michael Moynihan fought six general elections and one by-election, one of which I particularly remember. It took place at a time when politicians spoke outside churches. Being a raw young fellow I thought that because I had arrived first I would be the first to speak, but I discovered that there was a pecking order when I was approached by one of my own supporters from Fianna Fáil and told that it was done on the basis of seniority. However, I was totally amazed when Michael Moynihan, having spoken, asked the people to wait, introduced me as being there on behalf of <Col N="856" /> the Fianna Fáil Party and apologised for speaking too long. This is the kind of man Michael Moynihan was. He was nature's own gentleman.</P>
    <P>Michael Moynihan's record in elections shows his perseverance. His election win in Kerry in 1981, displacing the late Chubb O'Connor, sent shock waves through the Fianna Fáil organisation in Kerry South, and we had to accept that Michael Moynihan or whoever replaced him was there to stay. I sympathise with his wife, Mai, their children, and in particular Breeda. I also sympathise with the Labour Party on the loss of one of its greatest stalwarts who helped to build up that party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to the late Michael Moynihan. Everything that has been said about him is true. He was a great colleague. He was elected to Killarney Urban District Council 1954, and I served for ten very happy years with him on the council, from 1985 until he retired.</P>
      <P>He was always a very kind man, thoughtful and very generous with his advice. He served on Kerry County Council on and off over a period and, as has been said, following his sixth attempt he became a Member of Dáil Éireann in 1981. It has been rightly said that his most enduring quality was perseverance. Michael Moynihan never gave up.</P>
      <P>He was a great trade union figure as well. When he became a psychiatric nurse in 1938 in St. Finnan's Hospital, Killarney, he joined the union. He became a branch secretary in Killarney and served on the national executive of SIPTU. He was loyal to his union and, as has been said by other speakers, he always willing to take up a grievance on behalf of a person and to see it through. He never gave up. He battled to the very last, whatever the issue.</P>
      <P>He contributed greatly to Killarney's industrial success. He played a huge part in bringing Mr. Hans Liebherr to Ireland from Germany in 1956, visiting Germany with a delegation to ensure that he came. He smoothed all sorts of industrial relations problems over the years. I was a young man barely out of short pants when the Pretty Polly company came to Killarney in 1966, but I remember driving a man named Williamson, the original sales director who did a deal with my father-in-law for the land, and bringing him back to Cork Airport the next day. The people involved were the late Mattie O'Shea of Fianna Fáil, Michael Moynihan of Labour and the late Terry Clifford of Fine Gael, and that showed how well Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour co-operated. Sadly they have all gone now. They were the people who brought Pretty Polly to Killarney in 1966. That trio also played a part in bringing Liebherr to Killarney many years previously, a company which went on to develop hotels and other enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency was very proud of Michael Moynihan when he became Minister of State with responsibility for tourism during his term as a <Col N="857" /> Dáil Deputy. He lost his seat in 1987 when Fianna Fáil won it. Although he was in his 70s, he regained that seat in 1989. While he gave those opposite a knock-out blow in 1981, he delivered for us in 1989. He ran every year, except in 1969 when he would not run because he was a great believer in coalition with my party. In 1969 the Labour Party set its face against coalition and he declined to run. The Labour Party had to get another candidate &ndash; a very nice man too. However, its vote slumped and Michael Moynihan came back when the Labour Party changed its policy and built its vote back up. The truth was that he probably had more Blueshirts in his background than many of us on this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No wonder he had the views he had. That was his background in east Kerry. He was a next door neighbour of mine since 1968 and he was very helpful to my late father when he built his house there. He could not have been a kinder neighbour. I lived on one side of him for a number of years and when I built my own house, I lived on the other side of him.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to his wife Mai, to his daughters, Catherine and Breeda, a Member of the other House who succeeded him in 1992, and to his sons, John, Maurice and Michael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I can add very little to what has been said this morning in paying tribute to the late Michael Moynihan. I had the honour of serving with him on Kerry County Council from 1979. As has been said, Michael Moynihan was a resilient man and had great dedication to the Labour Party and to the people of South Kerry. The highlight of his career, apart from being elected to the Dáil in 1981, would have been his appointment as Minister for Tourism, especially coming from a county like Kerry. He was so proud of that achievement and he handled that portfolio with honour and dignity. He was very grateful for being given that type of opportunity. I extend my sympathy to his wife and family and, in particular, to Breeda, a Member of the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Order of Business is agreed. I was very pleased with the outcome of the meeting yesterday between the leaders and the Whips on the programme for the rest of the session. That sort of consultation would lead to more harmonious relationships in the House if it took place more often.</P>
      <P>I am happy with today's Order of Business but I have been asking one question every day for the last two weeks, that is, when we can expect the reports of the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the Arms Trial. We were promised them six weeks ago. I ask this question because we were told at the time that these matters could be discussed in the House. Obviously, if the reports do not appear until after the House has risen, we cannot discuss them. Will the Deputy Leader enlighten me on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also express my thanks to the Leader for taking on board the two suggestions from this side of the House &ndash; one to deal with tomorrow's proposed business this afternoon, thereby enabling us to co-ordinate this week a bit better, and the other regarding the commitment given to Senator Norris to have a debate on the Nice treaty referendum early the week after next. We appreciate the commitment given on those two issues.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise the issue of the delivery of broadband services throughout the country. I raise one issue which I would like Members to consider and the Deputy Leader to take into consideration when arranging a debate on it. Over the weekend Chris Horn of Iona Technologies asked that the State buy back the fixed line business of Eircom. People might wonder why that is the case. The fact is that the delivery of broadband may well depend on the fixed line service. There has been confusion about this in many countries. It is an issue I do not intend getting into but it is complex and complicated because it depends on the availability of the lines for the provision of the service. If the lines are being held by some private company, then it becomes impossible to roll out the service. That is the only point I will make on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress the importance of the Government having a strategic view on the fixed line service in order to look at it in the context of the roll out of broadband and the development of IT throughout the State. It is time to have another look at this in terms of our future. Will the <Col N="859" /> Deputy Leader ask the Minister to consider coming in to have a discussion on this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how we are fixed in regard to a debate on health. I hope we will be able to fit one in before the recess. Every day there is a new surprise in terms of some unsavoury event from the past. There is nothing more shocking than to find that an animal vaccine was injected into children and that secret drug trials were done on children in care and children in the wider community by a major multinational drug company. That is a very serious matter and it indicates the degree of neglect in the operation of some of these companies in relation to some of the most vulnerable citizens.</P>
      <P>Linked to that is an equally tragic development where a cancer patient has to go to the High Court to vindicate her right to get lifesaving health treatment. It indicates that there is something seriously wrong with our health system at a time when we have the resources to deal with it. I ask for a full debate on the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate at an early date on the insurance business? I do not know if Members have noticed but their car insurance premium has gone up by about 40% this year, even though they may not have had any accidents or problems and inflation is running at about 5.5%. I congratulate the Tánaiste who is taking a hands-on approach to trying to put some type of cap on insurance. I would like a debate in this House which would enable us to support her.</P>
      <P>The way motorists are being treated by insurance companies is grossly unfair. There is a cartel and there is no opposition as they are all united. The advertising of cheaper insurance is merely a cherry-picking exercise by some companies and it is not providing cheaper insurance to anybody. I appeal for an urgent debate to deal with this very serious problem of how motorists are being treated by insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members are concerned about the increased carnage on our roads. Will the Deputy Leader exhort the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to bring in measures which have long been promised and which would make our roads safer &ndash; measures such as the points system and prohibiting motorists from driving while using hand held mobile telephones?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in calling for a debate on Eircom. I would like it to be broadened a little. The reason is that we have to see it in the context of the negative aspects of privatisation. Just this morning people have been talking on radio about the closure of local pay phone boxes by Eircom. One telephone box has already been removed and a further 700 are to follow. This is a worrying development. We all have connections with the <Col N="860" /> countryside in which banks and post offices have been closed and now even the humble pay phones are to be removed. We should discuss this matter during the debate on Eircom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the court's decision that a lady suffering from cancer should receive treatment. I am very pleased the lady in question will finally receive treatment. As recently as three weeks ago, I sought to arrange treatment for a cancer patient who had been turned away from hospital on two occasions. When I telephoned the relevant hospital, I was informed there was no point in the lady coming in. I asked whether it would make any difference if I accompanied her to the hospital and stayed with her until a bed became available. In other words, I would demand her right to be hospitalised. I was informed that under no condition would she be seen in those circumstances. What is a person to do?</P>
      <P>I do not blame the current Minister for Health and Children as to do so would be facile and futile. It is time, however, we recognised the enormity of this crisis which will not go away. The Minister should come into the House to inform us whether it will now be necessary for us all to resort to court to avail of treatment, be it in a public or private capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Farrell's call for a debate on motor insurance. Will the Deputy Leader bring to the Minister's attention the manner in which insurance companies load the policies of people aged 70 and over without subjecting them to any medical assessment? These people have clean driving records and it is abhorrent that, having driven all their lives with the utmost care and responsibility and not having been involved in accidents, they are being disgracefully treated on age grounds at a time when they are most in need of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call to bring the Minister for Public Enterprise into the House to debate Eircom. The west has been treated very badly in view of the removal of broadband services. A monopoly will develop in this area and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come into the House to explain that. Mr. O'Reilly's monopoly position will have very serious consequences. This is akin to a private company owning our airports, waterways or national roads.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my call for a debate on tourism. We are midway through the tourist season and I would like to know the up-to-date position on the Government's proposals to restore the industry to its former position.</P>

      <P>A nation's civilisation is measured by the manner in which people with disabilities are treated. Civilised countries install ramps and lifts in state buildings etc. I was impressed to dis<Col N="861" /> cover that from yesterday US Government websites will be treated in the same way as Government buildings. Will the Deputy Leader ask the relevant Minister to investigate the possibility of introducing software to allow users to navigate by voice rather than by mouse and photocopiers which loudly declare when the toner has run out? I was unaware of these developments but we should aim to follow the lead shown by the US.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to recent reports that an all-party motion critical of the failure of the British authorities to co-operate with the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings will be tabled in the Dáil. If this is the case, the Seanad should debate a similar motion. Uncovering the truth is an important element of the healing and reconciliation process, however embarrassing it may be for the British authorities. The Dublin and Monaghan bombings represent the greatest atrocity carried out during the past 30 years and they must be fully investigated. Only when the truth is uncovered can the different traditions on this island and between Ireland and Britain be reconciled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House to debate the issues of housing and homelessness, particularly the fact that local authority housing lists are growing at an alarming rate? In Drogheda, the lists have doubled from 300 to 600 in the past four years. The debate should focus on the fact that local authorities are now responsible for homelessness. However, unlike the health boards they are not uniformly applying regulations in this area. This is giving rise to difficulties as health board directors of homelessness no longer have any statutory responsibility in this area. A debate would help to clarify these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I called for and received a somewhat diluted commitment from the Leader for a debate on the trade union movement. In view of the controversy surrounding one of our trade unionists, Mr. Mick O'Reilly, who appears to have been very badly treated, it is important that we debate this matter. If trade unions wish to run themselves in a manner of which Joseph Stalin would be proud, it would be useful for us, as members of a parliamentary democracy, to debate the role of the social partners, particularly that of the most powerful social partner in Ireland. Perhaps the Deputy Leader would give us a commitment to arrange such a debate prior to the recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning raised an issue he raises regularly in regard to a report on the arms crisis. I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has completed his report which will go to Cabinet next week. I hope <Col N="862" /> the Minister's report and that of the Attorney General will be available to the House prior to the recess.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about broadband services and I agree that it would be highly undesirable for access to be denied due to the lines being controlled. Senators Norris and Burke raised wider issues in regard to the debate on Eircom. We will see whether time can be arranged to debate the matter before the end of session.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Ridge spoke about health issues. Other Senators have called for a debate in this area for some time. I share Senator Costello's concern about the accidental use of animal vaccines. It seems extraordinary, given the potential confusion which could result, that two products would have such a similar name. The case of the cancer patient to whom Senators referred is <i>sub judice</i>. As I understand it, an agreement rather than a judgment was reached in this case to the effect that the ERHA would find a bed for the patient.</P>

      <P>Senators Farrell and Liam Fitzgerald raised the issue of motor insurance which is a recurring concern among Members, ranging from the lack of availability of affordable insurance for young people to the burden placed on compliant drivers by uninsured drivers. Although this is an issue worthy of debate, it will be difficult to find time for all these matters before now and the end of this session. However, we will do the best we can.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the related issue of road safety and the matter of motorists using mobile phones when driving. On a drive from Kerry the other day I saw the drivers of two large articulated trucks negotiating bends and coming off minor roads while holding hand-held mobile phones to their ears. That does not appear to be sensible. It is an issue that requires some degree of control. It has been argued by the motoring organisations and others that even hand-free mobile phones do not particularly improve the safety standard, but it seems to be common sense that it is preferable for motorists to use a hand-free as opposed to a hand-held mobile phone. Given the expense of buying a motor car, I do not understand why the extra expense that would be involved in putting in a hands-free kit cannot be taken care of.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke raised the matter of tourism. It would be useful to have an update from the Minister and we can see what can be done about that.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about access for disabled people and an initiative taken regarding US websites. Given that we are one of the world leaders on software, it seems that is something that should also occur here. I will speak to the relevant Minister about the issue and see what can be done to progress it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Senator Walsh raised the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. As to the motion on that in the Dáil, what they do in the Dáil is a matter for the Dáil, but it would be useful to introduce a similar motion here, if that were necessary.</P>
    <P>The issue of housing for the homeless was raised by Senator O'Dowd. He spoke about the inconsistencies and anomalies between various local authorities. When the local government Bill comes to this House in the next few weeks there will be an opportunity to raise some of those issues with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke about the unions and the social partners. He might have a private discussion with Senator O'Toole about that after the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delayed because I got a call to vote in the Dáil, even though I was ready to come into the House.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to allow me, as the shareholder in the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, to discharge certain functions which are essential if the proposed sale of the INPC's business and principal commercial assets, chiefly the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal, to the Tosco Corporation is to be completed. The Bill also includes a number of provisions which could be activated at some stage in the future in the unlikely event that the current sale process cannot proceed to completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 May last, legal documents were signed by the INPC and Tosco Corporation which commit the parties to completing the transaction on 16 July, subject to the fulfilment of certain pre-completion conditions. The most significant of these is the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas to give me powers to perform a number of functions, without which the proposed sale cannot be successfully concluded. In those cir<Col N="864" /> cumstances, the Government agreed to give priority attention to this Bill in spite of the fact that there are many other pressing items in its overall legislative programme. I am appreciative of the fact that both Houses of the Oireachtas have been able to find time for the Bill among the other items of business on their respective agendas.</P>
    <P>Senior officials of my Department and the chairman and chief executive officer of the INPC recently met the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to explain the terms of the proposed transaction and how it came about. I hope the committee members found the occasion worthwhile &ndash; my officials certainly did &ndash; and that it will have compensated in some measure for the limitations which have recently been placed on the time available to debate the matter here in the House.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the other House last week, Deputy O'Malley reminded us of the circumstances in which he was instrumental in establishing the INPC back in 1979 during the so-called second oil shock, when Ireland was badly in need of additional oil to make up for the shortfall in supplies through the normal channels. At that time, a number of oil producing countries had made it known that they would provide incremental oil supplies only on a state to state basis. The INPC was established to provide a State presence in oil trading in that regard and, in view of the urgency of the situation, it was decided to establish it as a private limited company under the Companies Acts, with the Government as shareholder, rather than have recourse to the more usual method of establishment as a statutory State body with its own dedicated legislation.</P>
    <P>Three years later, as part of the oil industry's response to a downturn in world demand for oil products, the private sector oil companies which built and operated the Whitegate refinery decided to withdraw from the facility. The refinery was then acquired by the State and responsibility for its operation was entrusted to the INPC. A further expansion of the INPC's role came about in 1986, when the company also became responsible for the management of the Whiddy oil terminal after the facility was gifted to the State by Chevron, the then owner. The House will recall that the terminal, which dates back to the late 1960s, had been inoperative since the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster of 1979 and Chevron was prepared to pay the State a sum of US$44 million to be released from its contractual obligations to reactivate the facility or to restore the site to green field status. In the event, Whiddy continued to lie dormant until the installation of a single point mooring facility made the tanks accessible once again in 1998.</P>
    <P>A problem soon emerged with the operation of Whitegate in the State sector as the companies active in the Irish market were adamant that they would not do business with the refinery. In response, an arrangement known as the manda<Col N="865" /> tory regime, or MR, was introduced, which compelled those companies to source 35% of their overall requirements from Whitegate at a premium price which was passed on to the consumer as a levy at the pumps. Without the income associated with the MR, the refinery would not have been able to survive for long, given its technical limitations and the other factors which militated against it operating on a fully commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the capabilities of the refinery have been improved but its basic drawbacks have remained. Whitegate, for example, lacks scale, technical sophistication and the benefits of integration with the more profitable sectors of the oil business. It operates in a market which is dominated by the local affiliates of the multinational oil companies and is entirely dependent in commercial terms on international refining margins. These margins are outside its control, are subject to wide fluctuations and are more often negative than positive. Against that background and in spite of dedicated and highly professional service from the INPC's management and staff over two decades, Whitegate's fortunes have been dogged by uncertainty and the threat of closure has never been far away.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, State ownership and particularly the availability of financial support under the mandatory regime has provided a lifeline for the INPC, without which Ireland would undoubtedly have lost the benefit of the strategically significant facilities operated by the company. At the same time, it has not been a satisfactory substitute for a proper commercial environment within the mainstream oil industry. Successive Governments have always been concerned about the potential threat to competitiveness posed by the MR and, as the arrangement is subject to annual review, Ministers in charge of the energy portfolio and the INPC itself have always had to live with the prospect that MR support, and consequently the refinery, might not survive from one year to the next.</P>
    <P>Dependence on the MR has tended to become especially worrying whenever the necessity for investment at the refinery has arisen. This occurred most recently in the context of the need to adapt the refinery to ensure that its products would be able to meet new emission standards for motor fuels under the EU Auto Oil I programme which were to be effective from the year 2000. The proposal that went to Government at that time seeking approval for the auto oil investment, the cost of which was then estimated at over US$100 million, made it abundantly clear that there was no prospect of the INPC raising the necessary finance without the assurance of MR support at a level commensurate with the need to make the necessary loan repayments in addition to compensating for ongoing operational losses.</P>
    <P>It was not a very encouraging prospect, but I am glad the Government was prepared to accept my recommendations and allow the INPC to proceed with its proposed upgrading project, which <Col N="866" /> eventually entailed expenditure of US$75 million. This was a matter of life or death for Whitegate because without the upgrading project, there would have been no market for the refinery's motor fuel output once the new environmental standards came into force. Whitegate would have had to close and with its closure Ireland would have lost an important contributor to security and diversity of oil supply.</P>
    <P>The rather bleak prospect of Whitegate's continued reliance on the MR to service its debts and maintain ongoing operations prompted the Government, when approving the new investment, to request the INPC to seek out possibilities for additional commercial activities to underpin the core refining business. No particular type of option was prescribed and nothing was ruled out. It was left to the INPC to use its best efforts to come up with options that could be identified and developed into workable proposals.</P>
    <P>The company's enthusiastic, energetic and professionally conducted response to that challenge led to a situation in which the INPC board recommended to me a proposal submitted by the US based Tosco Corporation as representing by far the best and most advantageous prospect in both financial and strategic terms. This assessment was subsequently confirmed by my expert advisers and last July the Government was, therefore, prepared to permit the INPC to confer preferred bidder status on that company.</P>
    <P>During the intervening year there have been intensive discussions on the proposal between the two parties. My officials and those of the Minister for Finance, with the help of independent financial and legal experts, were closely involved in this stage of the process to ensure that the shareholder interests were fully addressed throughout. Their attention to the detail of the small print and its implications meant that at times the process did not move as fast as some might have wished. However, we are dealing with a proposal to dispose of a strategic State asset. It is better in the long run that all concerned should be clear from the outset about what is expected of them once all the formalities have been completed.</P>
    <P>The long process of negotiation has produced a proposal which I have been prepared to recommend to my Cabinet colleagues simply because I consider it to be in the best interests of INPC, of its workforce and of the country. Some concern has been expressed about the fact that the actual sale and purchase agreement and other documents on which the transaction is based have not been made public. I want to assure the House that this is simply because those documents contain provisions which are subject to the requirements of commercial confidentiality. All of the important elements of the deal have been incorporated in speeches and published statements in summary form and have gone on the public record. If and when the transaction is completed, a data room will be established where all relevant information will be made available, subject to the usual provisions of the Freedom of Information <Col N="867" /> Act, 1997. In the meantime, Senators can be assured that the elements of the package are those which have been publicly stated.</P>
    <P>There was a public hearing at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise with the Secretary General of the Department and his officials where the issue was thrashed out fully and all who wanted to go that public meeting were welcome. There are no secret documents, hidden clauses or behind-hand deals of which I am aware, and this will become apparent when the time is right.</P>
    <P>In the first place, in any disposal we think of the price achieved and in this case, INPC will receive US$100 million from Tosco. INPC will also retain the proceeds from existing debtors, and will be paid for its trading stocks at market prices on completion of the sale. INPC, and eventually the National Oil Reserves Agency, will also retain certain stocks originally acquired in 1990, at the direction of the Government, for strategic rather than trading purposes. On the other side of the equation, INPC will continue to be liable for the existing debt of about £70 million, most of which is due to the Auto Oil I loan, and for existing liabilities to trade creditors. The funding of the ESOP will also come out of the sale proceeds.</P>
    <P>After all of these adjustments have been made, the net proceeds to the Exchequer will be considerably less than the headline figure of US$100 million. What exactly the net figure will be is difficult to say with certainty, as it changes from day to day in line with fluctuations in oil prices and currency exchange rates, for example, and the final amount will have to be recalculated at the time of completion. However, some indication may be had from the fact that a snapshot of the situation at the end of April 2001 put the net figure at approximately £70 million. Even allowing for adverse currency and price movements in the interim, the final outcome will be a positive transfer to the State, and this is considered satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The proceeds to the State will, as is usual, be paid into the Exchequer, and it is not for me to decide that any portion of them should be applied for a particular purpose. I say that because I am aware that there is a strong body of opinion that moneys realised by the sale should provide a basis for financial assistance for a new pier and other developmental works in the Bantry area. I can only say that I will mention the representations which have been made to me in the proper quarter, that is, to the Minister for Finance, but obviously I am in no position to say what might be decided in a matter which spans a number of areas of responsibility outside my own. It would also involve the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and his Department.</P>
    <P>While the transaction will undoubtedly be satisfactory for the State in financial terms, the principal benefit is the fact that for the first time in almost 20 years, there can be a solid basis for <Col N="868" /> the future of both the refinery and the terminal, and for the strategic contribution they make to our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main elements in the Tosco proposal is a written undertaking to operate and invest in the facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years. I have been given to understand by Tosco's chairman that in the corporation's plans for the Irish acquisitions, 15 years is only the beginning and that Tosco is here for the long haul. This commitment includes an undertaking to carry out whatever developmental work is necessary to meet new environmental standards beginning with Auto Oil II &ndash; I spoke of Auto Oil I earlier &ndash; which is due to come into effect in 2005. The task of investing to meet such requirements would present further major difficulties in the context of the need for increased MR support if the refinery were to remain in State ownership.</P>
      <P>The Tosco commitment to continued operation of the facilities is a major consideration in national and strategic terms. Since 1982, as we have seen, the State has been prepared to support INPC through the operation of the MR because of the strategic significance of having refining capacity on the island. However, State support has rarely been more than barely adequate, especially as regards developmental requirements &ndash; a welcome lifeline when nothing else was available but a poor substitute for a proper commercial environment.</P>
      <P>The proposed deal with the Tosco Corporation changes all that, and offers the prospect of a secure and prosperous future for the refinery and the terminal in the context of a major player in the oil industry, which has the resources and the motivation to operate and develop these assets. In other words, the new owners, in responding to their own commercial imperatives, without assistance from the State, will thereby underpin the contribution that these facilities make to our oil supply security. Furthermore, they will do so on a basis that represents a significant improvement on the State's own ability to make commitments under the MR or any alternative support mechanism that could be realistically or legally contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> In addition to its national significance, Tosco's commitment is good news indeed for the INPC staff, who have had to live with the continued uncertainty of employment on a year-to-year basis under the mandatory regime. The new owners are undertaking to preserve existing jobs and conditions of employment, including pension rights, within the framework of the 15 year commitment. At the same time, the Tosco Corporation's economic scale and technological capabilities offer the prospect of career development opportunities which would never have been possible within the confines of a stand alone INPC.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil, in my visits to that part of Cork I found the staff of INPC, employees and management, extremely dedicated and committed. I spoke in the other House of the friendly air which always permeated the operations, the welcome one got, the keenness with which the employees tackled their work and the difficulties which management and employees surmounted working together. Even in the short period I have been in the Department I know of many difficulties which they overcame. Above all, there was a sense that this is an east Cork facility which was good to have in one's neighbourhood, that there was a commitment to keeping it there and, most of all, of working in an enthusiastic way. There were no boundaries between managers and workers. There was just a keen edge to getting the work done and to contributing to the local economy, which they have done so well over a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>How binding is the commitment to continued operation of the INPC facilities under new ownership? That question was raised by a number of Deputies in the other House and is one which is very understandable as we move from the familiar territory of State stewardship, however unsatisfactory in this case because of the MR, to placing our trust in what for most of us is an unknown quantity.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I emphasise that Tosco Corporation's key commitments have been requested and given in the most binding possible legal form. However, it would be foolish in the present instance to depend on possible legal remedies alone, and it is more pertinent to ask whether we are sure that the prospective purchaser has the capability and the incentive to deliver on its solemn undertakings under the terms of the agreement with the Irish side.</P>
    <P>What is the Tosco Corporation and does it have the critical mass to deliver on its promises? Although not well known on this side of the Atlantic outside the oil business, Tosco Corporation is a multi-billion dollar undertaking whose resource base will increase later in the year when it is expected to merge with the US oil giant, the Phillips Petroleum Corporation. Already the third largest refiner and marketer of oil products in the US, Tosco, enjoys substantial benefits in terms of operational scale, technological capabilities, business integration and operating synergies <Col N="870" /> that are far beyond the State's ability to replicate for Whitegate.</P>
    <P>The INPC facilities will find a niche within the overall Tosco business plan, adding value to the extended Tosco family while continuing to serve the Irish market. I am aware that there are fears on the part of some of the smaller Irish oil companies that they will no longer be able to source their supplies on competitive terms. However, I am aware that throughout the talks Tosco has always been anxious to secure the benefits of all of the revenue streams enjoyed by the INPC, as one might expect.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the existing contracts between INPC and its customers will pass to the new owners and will fall to be regulated under normal commercial terms and arrangements between the parties. I have no reason to think that the corporation would subsequently turn away business from these customers. Of course, in conducting its business here, Tosco will be subject to Irish and EU legislation on competition and related matters, including health and safety and environmental matters, on the same basis as any other company and it would be open to any parties who feel that they are being unfavourably treated to seek the appropriate legal remedies.</P>
    <P>References were made in the other House to the possibility that the proposed transaction might encounter difficulties at EU level. My Department has received a standard inquiry from the EU Commission seeking information about certain aspects. I understand that a reply to that query will issue by close of business tomorrow and any further information will be readily provided on request.</P>
    <P>Acquiring the Irish facilities is a very significant first step outside the US for Tosco and not one that the corporation is taking lightly. It will have carefully calculated the acquisition as a business proposition and will be expecting a return on its investment. It will also have taken account of the fact that in using Ireland as a base for its entry into Europe it is putting its reputation on the line in making a high profile commitment that goes beyond the $100 million dollars I mentioned earlier. In summary, Tosco has not only the resources but also the clear incentive in terms of its own self-interest to honour its commitments under the proposed transaction by making a success of its acquisitions in this country, now and in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions which are a prerequisite for completing the proposed transaction and are consequently necessary to ensure that Ireland secures the benefits I have already mentioned. It has been clear for some time that because INPC is not a statutory State body, legislation of this kind would be necessary to underpin the proposed transaction. However, it was only in recent weeks, with the signing of the legal documents, that we had an assurance that there was a definite deal on the table and a clear indication <Col N="871" /> of the provisions that would have to be enshrined in the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two principal provisions that are central to my functions in relation to the completion of the proposed sale. Section 6 empowers me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to authorise INPC to dispose of its assets, including its shares in the subsidiaries that operate the refinery and the terminal, to the purchaser. This is fundamental to the whole transaction. The section also allows me to authorise the INPC to make payments in relation to the establishment and funding of a trust to provide for an employee share ownership plan, or ESOP, to facilitate the proposed sale.</P>
    <P>Following a number of meetings between union representatives, the company, senior officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and myself, agreement was finally reached on a specific offer in relation to a proposed ESOP which the unions recommended to their members. I understand that the results of the employees' ballot on the offer, announced earlier this week, indicated that a majority of over 80% of employees were in favour of acceptance. This is a very welcome outcome. Not alone does it represent fulfilment of a significant pre-completion condition but also indicates the very strong support of the workforce for the future of the company under Tosco. As Senators will know, I have always believed that securing the co-operation of the workforce is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of change in any State company and INPC could well serve as a model in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives me the authority, once again with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to provide a guarantee in respect of certain potential liabilities of the INPC under the sale and purchase agreement. Some disquiet about this provision was expressed in the Dáil but such a guarantee is usual in a transaction of this kind and there is nothing either extraordinary or sinister about it. The potential liabilities in question, which include potential environmental risks, are based on the general principle that INPC is liable for issues which pre-date the sale while Tosco will be liable for matters relating to post-completion circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that within that general framework and as a result of the very hard bargaining that took place on this particular aspect of the proposed transaction, there are now very significant limits in place in terms of both time and money on the extent of INPC's &ndash; and hence the State's &ndash; potential exposure. In money terms, that liability is capped at US$75 million and the terms of the guarantee &ndash; with one exception &ndash; will expire over varying periods, the longest of which is 12 years, depending on the nature of the risk. If, on the other hand, INPC had pressed Tosco, against industry norms, to take on all responsibility for potential risks, such an <Col N="872" /> approach, if accepted by the purchaser, would have resulted in the certainty of a very substantial reduction in the purchase price on offer. The one exception to this relates to the jetty at Whiddy Island, which was destroyed by fire in the 1979 disaster. The derelict structure is completely non-productive and neither Tosco nor any other commercial company could be expected to take responsibility for it. Consequently, the State will continue to bear the potential liability it acquired in relation to the jetty when it took over the terminal in 1986 and the Tosco deal does not involve any additional exposure in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the INPC that it may be possible to insure against the environmental risks covered by the guarantee for a relatively modest once-off payment. I have requested the company to actively pursue this aspect, not only in respect of potential environmental risks but also in relation to all of the contingent liabilities under the sale and purchase agreement. I understand that the INPC has requested quotations from a number of sources, and these will be carefully examined to ensure that they fully address all of the potential exposures on cost-effective terms. The Bill requires me and my successors on an annual basis to lay before each House a statement setting out the amount of any payment which was made during the year under the guarantee, together with an indication of the amount covered by the guarantee that was outstanding at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>On the subject of environmental and indeed safety risks, questions were asked in the course of the debate in the Dáil about Tosco's record in these areas, chiefly in the light of a number of well publicised accidents at its California facilities. I would be the last person to minimise the importance of operating to high standards in relation to safety and environmental sensitivity, and I raised these matters personally with the chairman of Tosco when I met him on two occasions. I understand that Tosco's safety record is now close to the top of the league table in the US and that statistics show that the safety record of refineries it has acquired has actually improved after the Tosco takeover. I believe that the company has taken to heart the lessons of the past and I understand that it has radically overhauled its approach to safety and quality control, using the DuPont and other recognised industry standards. These standards, regarded as representing the best commitment to safety in the oil industry, aim to achieve zero deaths, injuries, work related illnesses and incidents. I have never before come across reference to the term &ldquo;zero deaths&rdquo;. It is part of the DuPont industry standard. Human endeavour is an aspect.</P>
    <P>Tosco's philosophy places primary responsibility for safety, health and the environment within the operating companies, right down to the level of each individual employee, backed up by management systems that are geared towards continuous improvement. In an expansion of existing programmes, a new senior corporate <Col N="873" /> office for safety, health and the environment has been formed, headed by a senior vice-president who reports to the chairman, to carry these concerns to the highest level within the corporation. Tosco has learned the hard way that in addition to the obvious and overriding humanitarian considerations, accidents, whether they involve death, injury or environmental damage, are bad for business. In addition to costs associated with lawsuits, compensation, fines or clean up programmes, they mean expensive disruption of production and lost revenues. It is in the self-interest of the operators of facilities to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that they do not occur in the first place.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Tosco in coming to Ireland would be subject, like any indigenous company or incoming multinational, to the safety and environmental laws that apply to the industry in question. Whitegate and Whiddy, if they operate under the Tosco banner, will continue to be governed by the existing strict EPA and HSA regimes. The management and staff who are responsible for INPC's enviable health, safety and environmentally friendly culture will still be at their posts. The same employees and management will continue to run the INPC/Tosco facilities. In the interests of maintaining the return on its investment, Tosco will have every incentive to ensure that INPC's long-standing record on safe and good neighbourly operations is maintained.</P>
    <P>The State's motivation in supporting INPC over the years has been grounded in the contribution it makes to security of oil supply. A further major element in our oil security apparatus is the maintenance of a 90 day oil reserve in line with our obligations in the context of EU legislation and the emergency oil sharing arrangements maintained by the International Energy Agency. Since 1995, responsibility for maintaining these reserves has been a matter for the National Oil Reserves Agency, or NORA as it is more commonly called.</P>
    <P>Although NORA is a subsidiary of INPC, I have expressly excluded it from the terms of the proposed sale. This is because NORA does not have a commercial function, but acts as the agent of the Minister. It is the custodian of oil stocks which have been acquired on the basis of a dedicated levy on consumers and taken out of the market to be set aside for strategic purposes. Arrangements are being made to ensure that NORA will continue to function within the public sector. The agency, which had separate representation throughout the talks with Tosco, will enter into arm's length, commercially-based contracts in respect of storage of a volume of its stocks at Whiddy and Whitegate. This is to be expected as NORA needs to have stocks in Ireland for strategic reasons and the main available tankage is situated at those locations. NORA has other commercial storage contracts at home and abroad and will continue to welcome further competitively-priced bids from storage providers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> In order to provide a clear legal basis for the safeguarding of strategic stocks in the context of the Tosco transaction, the Bill as amended includes a provision in section 7 which will allow me, notwithstanding the provisions of any other legislation, to order, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the transfer of the agency and its stocks out of INPC. The section also provides for the transfer from INPC of the stocks which were acquired by the corporation in 1990 during the Gulf crisis before NORA came into being. The intention is to ensure that these stocks can continue to be reserved for Ireland's strategic purposes as part of NORA's overall stockholding.</P>
    <P>These are the provisions of the legislation that impinge directly or indirectly on the proposed sale. At the same time, some account must be taken of the possibility, however unlikely, that the proposed transaction for one reason or another might not proceed to completion. I am, therefore, taking the opportunity to include provisions in the legislation to permit a share sale to another purchaser or purchasers in the future and to allow INPC to implement an ESOP in the event that the sale to Tosco is not completed. Hopefully, these particular provisions will never have to be acted on and the transaction will go ahead to completion.</P>
    <P>For almost 20 years, the INPC facilities have had to operate outside their natural private sector environment and no one would try to argue that this was anything but a stopgap arrangement, characterised by uncertainty, limited planning horizons and less than optimum levels of investment. The Tosco proposal offers the opportunity for the refinery and the terminal to thrive in their natural environment as part of a major oil company which has the resources, incentive and cultural disposition to invest in and develop the business. These strategically significant resources will be retained for the country, but on the basis of robust business models rather than artificial, uncertain and, ultimately, inadequate external support mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The mandatory regime levy enabled Whitegate and Whiddy to continue their work, but the levy was eventually passed on to consumers at the pumps. The levy was limited because it only allowed INPC to continue on a yearly basis. It did not allow for expansion and £70 million had to be devoted to meeting the requirements of the Auto Oil I programme. The Auto Oil II programme will come into force in 2005 and will involve further expansion with regard to environmental aspects. It will ensure business in this area is conducted in a proper environment and there may be further Auto Oil programmes in the future. All this means that INPC in its current form could not continue to exist, flourish, expand, progress or fulfil its environmental requirements</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those in INPC who kept the oil flowing over the years. Where one might have expected a history of low morale, lacklustre performance and industrial dissension, INPC and its staff can look back on an exemplary record of <Col N="875" /> productivity, industrial harmony and safe and environmentally friendly operations. Now, for the first time in 20 years, there is the prospect of job security and career development. I congratulate INPC management and staff, past and present, and I pay particular tribute to the current chairman, who was a board member for many years, and other board members over the years who, in terms of civic duty, gave their time and commitment to the successful operation of INPC.</P>

      <P>The Minister addressed some of the issues that have arisen, but I received representations from Mr. Donal Gordan, a director of Tedcastles Oil Products. It is a major Irish-owned company which has concerns about the Bill. I am sure the Minister and her Department received a copy of the letter, but I wish to outline some important parts of it. He stated that Tedcastles operates through its subsidiary, TOP, a national network of 170 service stations and provides a wide range of commercial and agricultural fuels. The company considers, in common with other indigenous fuel companies, that its ability to source fuel supplies from the national refinery in Whitegate is essential to its ability to compete with the major international oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national refinery has given Irish companies an opportunity to offer competitive choices to their customers. While 74% of the market is controlled by four major companies, Irish companies own significant regional areas and have a large market share in, for instance, Munster and Connacht. Given the importance of Whitegate to the Irish economy and the consequences of allowing a global company to operate as a private monopoly, it is imperative that some key obligations be imposed on the purchaser of Whitegate to operate this important national asset in a way which recognises its strategic importance. Excellent <Col N="876" /> though the private owners of this company will be, market forces could operate against indigenous companies so that they will not be able to source their product as easily as other international companies can. I have been asked to raise this issue and the Minister will, no doubt, be able to answer it.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was debated in the Dáil, Deputies inquired about the view of the European Union on this issue. The Minister said she has received the standard inquiry from the EU Commission which she will respond to by the close of business tomorrow. Can the Minister explain the nature of that query? Is it part of an ongoing correspondence between her Department and the European Union or is it a matter which has arisen only now? This point could have been clarified if the matter had been resolved with the European Union before the legislation was brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important that the career structures of the company's present employees be maintained. Given the consent of the workers to the move from INPC to Tosco, which was expressed in their vote, it is important that they be offered new careers and opportunities in their new roles.</P>
    <P>The process offers a significant foothold to a major American player in the European market. This is an important factor in Tosco's coming to Ireland. We speak the same language and already have important facilities in County Cork. One asks, however, why European companies which were asked to tender did not value the asset as much as the American company does? Given our strategic importance in Europe and our increasing involvement in the European Union, what consideration did the Minister and her Department give to the fact that we are moving outside the European Union and placing a strategically important reserve in the hands of an American company? I have nothing against American companies but I ask why the facility was valued so little in Europe and so much in America? The fact that Tosco is opening its European headquarters in Dublin is a significant development. The company clearly intends to become an important player in the European market and the move is good for the company and good for us. I merely raise these issues and look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>I have been told that Tosco is in the middle rather than the top range in terms of its world environmental and safety records. The Minister has referred to these issues at length in her speech. I welcome the personal assurances she has been given by the chairman of the company and the fact that the company has undergone significant change following recent safety and environmental problems. The company will be required to upgrade its facilities in Europe considerably. I presume the Environmental Protection Agency will oversee this process and I know the agency will pay particular attention to this issue. It is, however, a matter for concern. I <Col N="877" /> acknowledge that the Minister has drawn attention to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the concern expressed in the Dáil about the sale and the purchase agreement. Some Deputies requested that the documents relating to the agreement be made public. The Minister properly said that commercial factors dictate that the documentation should not be made public at this stage but will be available under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act. The Minister said, &ldquo;There are no secret documents, hidden clauses or behind-hand deals of which I am aware, and this will become apparent when the time is right.&rdquo; I wonder about the phrase, &ldquo;of which I am aware&rdquo;.</P>

It will lead to an increasing role in Ireland and Europe for a significant American player in the oil business. My only concern relates to the Tedcastles issue and I hope the Minister will address this concern in her reply.</P>
      <P>In an effort to expedite the business, Opposition amendments which were tabled in the Dáil have been withdrawn. Can the Minister comment on one of these issues?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The Minister expressed concern about the length of her speech. In the case of the Minister for Public Enterprise, patience in waiting is never a waste of time and we have been reassured in that belief today. The Minister has been informative and insightful. I welcome the Bill and the manner in which the Minister has succeeded in securing the co-operation of both Houses to bring it forward at this early stage. This is in line with commitments entered into in relation to the proposed deal. The Minister must discharge cer<Col N="878" /> tain functions to enable the proposed sale to proceed to completion.</P>
      <P>I am heartened to learn that Fine Gael and, I understand, the Labour Party have welcomed the Bill. The Bill contains many positive features and heralds a new regime for an organisation which has suffered much trauma, insecurity and uncertainty for a number of years. Because of the assurances which have been given to the Minister and her officials and because of the expertise she has brought to bear on the matter, we can be confident that a new era is dawning for this operation.</P>
      <P>INPC's refinery at Whitegate played a key role in Ireland's overall arrangements regarding security and diversity of oil supply. In February 1999, in approving a major life or death investment programme at Whitegate, the Government took note of the financial insecurity of INPC's refining operations and the continuing dependence on the artificial support under the MR regime which is still in existence. Thankfully we have heard that it will no longer be required if and when this proposal of sale is completed. From the State's point of view, these security of operations were vital. We now have the prospect of a new regime committed with security of operations for at least 15 years and with a commitment to maintain existing jobs and employment.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, we need the security of supply and the stocks and services are also very important concerns and I understand that they have been met by the proposal of sale which is before the Minister for her consideration. The Minister referred to the history of the INPC and I wish to comment very briefly. It goes back to the 1970s when Ireland and the rest of the world were subjected to two huge crises, referred to as the oil crises &ndash; in the early 1970s and in 1979. These crises had a huge impact on economic activity. Economies were moving forward and seeking full employment and high growth and low inflation. Ireland in particular had these same targets and was hit like a bolt from the blue with a second oil crisis in 1979. The effects were in many instances quite devastating. The disruption to supply, the insecurity and the uncertainty had a major impact on commercial and industrial activity at the time and had a significant impact on the quality of social life. Not alone was there insecurity of supply for commercial operations, there was also insecurity of supply for private motorists. We all recall the stark scenes of petrol stations closing down for days and sometimes weeks at a time and large queues outside service stations as people tried to access a gallon or two of petrol. The whole country was in turmoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in this context that the then Government and Minister, Deputy O'Malley, decided to establish the INPC. We know that at the heart of that crisis was the decision by the major oil producing companies to pump up the price of oil or to refuse to sell oil except on a state by state basis. They allowed the market become demand led by acutely cutting down on the availability of supply. <Col N="879" /> There is no doubt that the establishment of the INPC at a time of such monumental crisis which had the potential to do irreparable harm and damage to the economy, was a very significant contribution to the stability of the situation in the short to medium term. In the period of time since then, it has served a very vital function in providing a cushion of security for consumers.</P>
    <P>Following the second oil crisis, there was a downturn in the world demand for oil. Domestic and commercial consumers decided to exploit other means of energy supply. In 1982, as part of the oil industry's response to the downturn, the private sector owners of Whitegate decided to get out. The State acquired the refinery and the INPC was entrusted with the responsibility of operating it. A further development took place a few years later when in 1986 the Whiddy oil terminal was given to the State by the then owners.</P>
    <P>Whitegate has been problematic from the word go. The State, while accepting, acknowledging and determined to ensure that this vital national resource should be continued, was always aware of the problems of operating the mandatory regime. The operation could not and did not have the facility to move into a proper commercial environment. It simply could not survive in the kind of commercial environment of the time or since. It has constantly relied on the mandatory regime in its efforts to survive. When there is a levy on companies, that levy is passed on at the pumps and the effects are felt right through the system. Successive Governments were determined to continue that arrangement because of the vital resource involved. That arrangement has continued, some would say successfully others would say it has flipped on from year to year.</P>
    <P>Not alone did it hamper the development of that operation which never became commercially viable, but it also created enormous consequences for the employees. They were living in an employment environment that was full of uncertainty with little or no prospect for job security or career development. I endorse fully the sentiments expressed by the Minister and Senator O'Dowd and other speakers in the other House. The employees had a most remarkable and commendable record of achievement over those years. There are many examples of employees in vital national resources who certainly would not have matched up to the calibre of person employed in Whitegate. I do not wish to be divisive or negative but when one considers the environment in which they were forced to operate and the vital resource they had to provide, and the uncertainty that successive Governments could neither alleviate nor allay, they did a magnificent job in keeping the oil flowing. Oil was a fuel that was needed and they kept the supplies available in an uninterrupted way. All due credit must go to them.</P>
    <P>The State faced the ongoing problem of quality of operations to meet international standards. The conditions laid down in Auto Oil I had to be <Col N="880" /> met. The forthcoming Auto Oil II is in 2005. Further substantial investment was going to be required to meet the quality and environmental conditions in line with Auto Oil II. The State has been in the recent past faced with serious dilemmas in having to provide substantial investment to upgrade and refurbish facilities in Whitegate. In line with this commitment to ensure the continuity of this key facility, that investment has been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister had to look to the desirability of providing this support system on an ongoing basis and the financial implications of doing so. I commend the Minister for setting in train an investigative and assessment process between her senior officials and the industry and also for calling in key independent experts to look at the overall situation and to identify the commercial prospects for future viability.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from what the Minister has said that the prospects were not good. The power of the Government to continue with this kind of investment was, I understand, called into question. Given developments and EU directives, the desirability of continuing to invest in a facility that was not capable standing alone had to be seriously looked at. Consequently, as a result of extensive research and a directive from the Minister to identify and target the commercial operations interested in an arrangement with INPC the Minister, having considered the offers and following expert advice, was happy that the best offer was from Tosco Corporation. She recommended the Tosco offer which has been examined in minute detail during the past 12 months. On some date in May an agreement was signed with a view to finalising the matter in mid-July. In line with that the legislation is before the House.</P>
    <P>As I do not profess to have a great degree of knowledge or expertise on this industry, I spoke with some of my colleagues from Cork last evening when I realised I would be contributing to the debate. I apologise on behalf of Senator O'Donovan who cannot be here. He had intended to take this Bill and would have a great deal of local knowledge. I had the opportunity to discuss the matter with him and was reassured to learn that clarification on the main concerns of the employees in regard to job security, conditions of employment, pensions for present employees and pensioners was sought in the other House and by the employees, to whom the Minister referred positively today in terms of the discussions that have taken place with them. I understand they have been assured that their legitimate concerns are being met in the terms of this legislation. That is a reassuring prerequisite to the new arrangements. I commend the Minister on section 6 in which includes the facility for an employee share ownership plan. It will be a tremendous benefit to the employees, who have greeted it warmly.</P>
    <P>I knew nothing about Tosco Corporation until I began to discuss the matter last evening with my colleagues. I am aware it is a multi-billion dollar <Col N="881" /> operator and that it is expected to merge with Phillips Petroleum Corporation, thus further enhancing its status in the world oil market scene. I understand INPC will be a constituent part of this overall operation. That Ireland will be used as the hub for further expansion into Europe and beyond by this large corporation will ensure that INPC's role for the future and the development of its employment prospects will be assured. I am happy that INPC is entering a new era. Tosco's chief executive officer has assured the Minister that the 15 year period is only the beginning in the corporation's plans for using the Irish hub.</P>
    <P>I wish the project well. The Minister's decision to accept the proposal is a good one and I have no doubt that INPC will make a significant contribution as a constituent part of this large corporation in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;we are used to her in full flow. I am sure that on Committee Stage her talents will be given full range. Like my colleagues I have been circulated with a memorandum from Tedcastles. It has some concerns but I am sure the Minister will be able to assuage them. However, I wish to put one or two of them on the record and ask if they can be looked at.</P>
      <P>The context has already been laid before the House by other Senators. There are four large major oil companies and seven smaller Irish-owned companies which have a local distribution network and receive oil on what is a fairly advantageous basis. I understand there is some dispute over charges between Tedcastles and INPC. It is concerned that there might be a private monopoly in oil refining. It is concerned about the monopoly aspect although this seems to be more or less inevitable and it is unusual for a commercial company to complain about the operation of the free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also raised concerns about the size of Tosco and pointed out that it has a turnover of £23 billion, 23 times the net purchase of oil per annum in this country. I understand from the Minister and also from sources within INPC that this is precisely the reason the deal is going ahead. It is a question of economies of scale and even the giant American oil companies, such as <Col N="882" /> Exxon and Mobil, have merged precisely to provide even further economies of scale. Because of the size of the new entity that will own and operate the refinery there, it will be in a position to secure crude oil on a better basis and at a cheaper level than a small individual Irish refinery could do.</P>
    <P>Two questions remain from my point of view. Tedcastles says no commitments are being given in relation to the supply of fuel to existing customers with a heavy reliance on Whitegate. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. Whether it is possible legally to put this kind of guarantee into the financial arrangement into which the Government is entering is a matter on which I cannot comment but perhaps the Minister would do so. Aside from imposing obligations to honour the commitments given by Tosco in its discussions with the State, it is also vital that the new owners be obliged to treat all customers of the refinery fairly and on a non-discriminatory basis. I assume it would be in its interests so to do but perhaps the Minister would like to give an assurance to this group, which clearly has an interest in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said clearly that the Bill is ready to facilitate her in the disposal of the principal assets of the company, Bantry and Whitegate. However, she has not said anything about the surviving entity, if it does survive, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. I assume it is not being totally dissolved and there is a future for it. It is significant and important that we should have a long-term Government oil policy precisely to avoid falling into the kind of difficulties we had during previous unanticipated turbulance in the oil market. I would like to think the Government as a matter of form had a continuing alertness to changes in the oil market. I assume the INPC will be retained at least as a skeleton. Will it have an office, will it have staff and what will be its function in terms of Government or will it be completely dissolved?</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I ask that, and I will not tread into dangerous ground even though I am rather tempted because I am a gossipy sort of person, is that I have had some slight acquaintance with the present chief executive officer of INPC who is in the Visitors' Gallery today. He is not only a charming person but also a man of very subtle intellect. I will not give details but I have had the pleasure of observing him in operation, at close quarters, outside the borders of this country. It seemed that, in his capacity as chief executive, he was able to operate in an area on the margins between politics and business, in the sense that he had considerable diplomatic skills and was obviously taking a very long range view of the requirements at this stage in relation to the provision of oil supply. I hope the Government will continue to have the advice of somebody of that standing within the oil industry and with that close view because it is important that we secure the oil position for this country. I ask that question in relation to the INPC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> I also have another question. In the apparently unlikely event that we have a bonanza in terms of oil being discovered &ndash; that is a possibility because, with improving technology, it is now commercially feasible for companies to go out to greater depths on the Atlantic shelf &ndash; what happens if, to everybody's surprise and delight, we literally strike oil and find that we have reasonably satisfactory and ample supplies of oil somewhere off the coast of Ireland? Will the absence of a State owned and controlled oil refinery place the discoverers of this oil, and the country, at a disadvantage? That is a hypothetical question concerning the future. What are the downsides or disadvantages of not having an oil refinery in this country? </P>
    <P>Before I proceed to amble around the Minister's speech, I wish to refer to the question of the environment and health and safety. The Minister said something which I found interesting. She said that Tosco has learned the hard way. That seems significant. She also stated that the company has an ambition of &ldquo;zero death&rdquo; and so on. That is very reassuring for the employees. I would certainly like to be sure I worked in a profession where zero death was the aim of management. That does not seem an extravagant aim. I hope their view of safety is a little more refined than that. When the Minister says they have learned the hard way, I assume they have a reasonably muddy track record in this regard. It is worthwhile for us to keep an eye on them and particularly to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency does so.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to distribute my poisoned bouquets only to the commercial world. I am not sure that the Department has a great record either in this area. I am particularly worried by the Minister's reference to Whiddy Island after the <i>Betelgeuse</i> explosion. She said:</P>
    <P>The derelict structure is completely non-productive and neither Tosco nor any other commercial company could be expected to take responsibility for it. Consequently, the State will continue to bear the potential liability it acquired in relation to the jetty when it took over the terminal in 1986, and the Tosco deal does not involve any additional exposure in that regard.</P>
    <P>What is the intention with regard to the derelict site? How derelict is it? Is there no use to which it could be put? Will it be left in a state of ruin? Is it an eyesore? In other words, is it sufficient just to say we have a derelict structure and we will absolve Tosco from any involvement with it, setting that company's mind at rest? What of the impact on the locality of the continuation of a derelict area? I suggest we have a responsibility to tidy it up.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to welcome this Bill. It is understandable that we should wish to involve ourselves in something which has economies of scale and would be of advantage. Apparently, a <Col N="884" /> guarantee is being given that it will be operated on a full commercial basis for at least 15 years. That is satisfactory and I congratulate those involved in negotiating such a deal. It is also satisfactory, I have been informed directly, to the senior management and it is significant that, in a ballot of the workers, 80% were in favour. It seems, therefore, that the people most directly concerned are virtually unanimous in considering this a good deal. That is understandable. There seems to have been a little sealed circuit in Whitegate, outside which there was nowhere for talented executives to go. In the new situation, as part of a much broader structure in a multinational organisation, they can pursue their careers to the limit of their talents. That is good. It is also good that personnel can move in the other direction, bringing in expertise from the parent company to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd was concerned that there was apparently little interest from Europe and significant interest from America. I would have thought that a fairly clear reason is that Europe is not exporting oil to America. For the American oil companies, it is obviously a positive consideration to have a beachhead into the enormous European market, strategically based in Ireland with a literate workforce and a favourable economic climate.</P>
    <P>I was rather pleased by the unintentional literary echoes of the various acronyms used. NORA, of course, suggests Nora Barnacle to me&mdash;</P>

We can tease matters out and, perhaps, enjoy ourselves in the process.</P>
      <P>I will recap briefly on my questions. I asked about the INPC, the implications of not having a refinery in the event of a possible oil discovery and the ultimate fate of the scene of dereliction at Whiddy Island.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill. I compliment the Minister on her customary brevity. She apologised for sticking to her script in this case but we know she believes in brevity. I will do my best to follow through. When I first read this Bill, it immediately attracted my attention that a $23 billion company, sounding rather like a supermarket company, was to buy our oil refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever need there was for the INPC in the past &ndash; clearly there was such a need, just as there had been a need to protect our flour milling industry in time of war &ndash; we now recognise the new situation, as described in the Minister's words: &ldquo;At the same time, it has never been a satisfactory substitute for a proper commercial <Col N="885" /> environment within the mainstream oil industry.&rdquo; I agree entirely with the Minister on that. I also like her choice of words in relation to the people involved in the companies: &ldquo;enthusiastic, energetic and professionally conducted response to the challenge&rdquo;. I gather this changeover has been very successful, as has the response to the challenges faced over the years.</P>
    <P>I have one or two queries. Whenever we sell something, we tend to use the analogy of the family silver. Is the Minister happy with the price? She seems to be. She spoke of a figure of £100 million, coming down, perhaps, to a net £70 million. That sounds like a fine figure. I know there have been expressions of concern about the transparency of the sale and I understand there is a threat of a plea to the Competition Authority in that regard. I noted the Minister's words when she said:</P>
    <P>The INPC board recommended to me a proposal submitted by the US-based Tosco Corporation as representing by far the best and most advantageous prospect in both financial and strategic terms. This assessment was subsequently confirmed by my own expert advisers and, last July, the Government was therefore prepared to permit INPC to confer preferred bidder status on that company.</P>
    <P>That does not seem like full transparency in an open market and an open auction. There has been some discussion in recent times in other fora about the need for openness and transparency when something is being sold and the danger of it being sold to the only bidder. I imagine the Minister has a satisfactory explanation for that and I would be very happy to hear it.</P>
    <P>I was in Prague last week visiting food stores and was surprised how in such a short period of nine years the retail food business in the Czech Republic had been taken over by foreign companies to such a huge extent. Therefore, I was interested to read the letter from Tedcastles Oil Products which referred to four multinational companies holding 74% of the market. I was delighted there are seven other companies also in business here, and I think that situation is fine. A word which often crops up is oligopoly, a word I love to drop in a conversation, which implies power being in a small number of hands. If possible we should ensure competition continues. I know this concern was expressed by Tedcastle Oil Products. We must avoid Tosco exploiting its position in the future and perhaps the Minister will address this matter. The real benefit is competition and its encouragement. In the past the Minister and I have talked about this, particularly as regards telecommunications where the job of the regulator is not just to ensure competition but to encourage it, which is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a query from the European Commission about the sale and I think said the answer would be given in the next week or so. Perhaps she will refer again to this as I would like my mind to be put at rest on it. The <Col N="886" /> EU Commission is seeking information about certain aspects of the proposed transaction.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris talked about the possibility of finding oil off the coast. Is there anything in the deal which gives future promises in any way? When somebody sells a business they promise not to go back into the business or into competition within a period of time. Is there anything in the deal which says the State has no intention of either allowing or encouraging somebody else compete with the purchaser or that the State will never again compete in this area? I do not believe the State should be involved in this business &ndash; in general, competition is much better. I doubt if there is an intention on the part of the State to become involved in the business again, but can the Minister assure us that no promises were made regarding the future and that Tosco has not been given a guarantee of which we are unaware?</P>
    <P>It seems the task given by the Minister to INPC has been grasped by those in authority and that they have come up with what seems a good sale. I compliment the Minister and her officials on their success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. To a large extent I welcome the legislation. It is not normal for the Labour benches to welcome legislation which has the intent of privatising a sector which is in State control, but many of us have recognised that the situation in relation to Whiddy and Whitegate has been quite precarious for a considerable period and that the entire operation is fragile in that it almost operates on yearly basis. A certain degree of stability and continuity is required for the industry and for workers in terms of career prospects and working conditions. In that context the offer outlined by the Minister appears on the surface to be quite generous. The State will get £100 million, though that is tempered by the fact the State must pick up the debts, which are in the region of £70 million. The State also has the benefit of existing creditors, so there will probably be a small margin of profit.</P>
      <P>The rights of the workers are guaranteed. There is an ESOT and career prospects for the workers in the deal. I understand no redundancies are being proposed. The Minister might clarify these points in relation to the workforce particularly whether there will be full retention of the existing workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the background of INPC and its establishment under Deputy O'Malley when he was Minister giving a State structure which would allow countries in the Arab world to make oil supplies available to us. Shortly afterwards the private sector found the project in Whitegate and Whiddy was non-commercial and offered the location and facilities to the State. At the time the State had little choice but to purchase them. In many ways it was the opposite to what is currently happening, with the private sector now taking over from the public sector. As I understand it, it was never a very profitable <Col N="887" /> enterprise and probably operated only with the benefit of the mandatory regime, namely, the stipulation that 35% of all oil supplies had to be sourced through it, and the levy, which I presume continues, at petrol pumps relating to the refinery and which was built into the cost of fuel. When Tosco takes control, will there be a decrease in the cost of petrol and an ending of the levy?</P>
    <P>I have some concerns. At least when we had a refinery in public ownership we had security of supplies. We had our own refinery and could at least say that if the worst came to the worst we could refine and supply our own oil, which may not be guaranteed in the context of total privatisation of the industry. This must remain a consideration as there have been a number of oil crises and international conflicts. There is some concern as to how we can guarantee continuity of supplies. There has been much criticism of terminating our merchant navy in terms of a supply line with other countries and that we are cut off from what would be a much needed source of supply in times of crisis. What guarantees have we from Tosco that we can ensure a diversity and security of supply in future?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated we have a commitment that the refinery will remain in operation for 15 years, which is good. It means work can be planned and that those working in the refinery can look forward to a degree of stability, pension rights and a greater level of career continuity than at present.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there might be a down side. On the face of it, it seems to be all up side. Has anybody asked why Tosco is offering what, on the surface, is a very attractive deal with no down side? What is in it for Tosco? American and other multinationals involved in information technology, pharmaceuticals and so on have seen Ireland as a very handy launching ground for attacking the markets in Europe, and a very desirable one given the level of skills and education, the fact that its people speak English and its position as an island off the European mainland. What is it that makes Ireland attractive to Tosco? In terms of modernisation, the existing refinery is very far down the line, being in need of very considerable upgrading to make it commercially competitive. That is not to downgrade it or say anything that might damage the deal which is, no doubt, far advanced at this stage. What reason has Tosco given for its interest in this project and why is it able to give the guarantees it has to preserve existing employment for 15 years and, on top of that, a considerable sum of money to acquire the refinery?</P>
    <P>Certain concerns were expressed. For example, is there a possibility that an attempt will be made to eliminate competition and establish a monopoly in the Irish market and that smaller operators such as Tedcastles will lose in terms of price structure? Is there a larger picture that shows the negative side? Does the Minister have concerns in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> On the plus side, it seems an attractive offer. I would normally express concern about the selling off of State assets. However, on this occasion we are dealing with a business we came into by accident in the first instance and not something that has been there since the foundation of the State. The industry has been in existence for approximately 20 years and there seems to be no major reason the State should continue to play a major role in it. Once questions of security of supply and the possible elimination of competition are dealt with, taking into consideration that the workforce seems very satisfied with the sale, it is difficult to find objections to it. I wish the Minister well with the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the legislation which moves matters on, and I agree with many of the points made by Senator Costello. I am appreciative of the fact that the position of the employees has been well regarded in this move forward. That provides a good blueprint for the way employees in companies should be dealt with. It should go on the record that this has the support of the employees, a group who have had an uncertain future in terms of career expectations and possibilities over the past 20 years. This will give them some security in the future. In turn, there will be a responsibility on those employees, when they become significant shareholders in the company, to consider the needs of the community in Ireland because there is a strategic issue that needs to be very carefully examined.</P>
      <P>The INPC was established in 1979 to ensure strategically that the State had a supply of oil at a time when the oil producing companies were providing certain amounts on a state by state basis. The difficulty &ndash; the Minister referred to the European issue &ndash; is that it strikes one on first reading as the possible creation of a new monopoly. Is this the creation of a set of circumstances that could squeeze out the smaller operators within oil distribution? Senator Costello referred to Tedcastles which has expressed concern about its security in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned on a number of levels, first, on the basis of the company itself, second, on the basis of the strategic and tactical importance of having smaller operators as well so that we will not be always at the mercy of the larger oil companies and, third, on the basis of the impact it will have on consumers, particularly in places where they currently receive a distribution from the smaller oil companies. I am concerned that the major buyers, such as Shell, Texaco and others, all of which get supplies from the INPC, might put a squeeze on the supplier and do a deal in terms of quantities of scale which would allow them to purchase at prices far more advantageous than the smaller operators and thereby squeeze out the smaller operators. I am aware that business is business, and this is a move towards market forces. I recognise that and I am not proposing an alternative at this point. However, I am <Col N="889" /> worried that if the smaller groups are squeezed out there will be a loss at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>In the past two years there has been worldwide interest in the price of oil. We have seen the price of a barrel of crude oil go from almost $40 dollars a barrel down to almost $20 dollars a barrel and back up to the high 20s. This has an immediate impact on inflation here in terms of fuel, transport and heating prices. We would experience real difficulty if smaller operators were squeezed out by larger operators, consequently allowing larger operators to operate a cartel which would lead to increased prices of fuel products and a consequent significant impact on inflation. I cannot recall off-hand the extent of the influence of fuel prices on inflation, but it is substantial and could, therefore, impact negatively on the State's development.</P>
    <P>We came from a situation in the late 1970s in which fuel oil prices had a disastrous impact on the development of the State. This led to the establishment of the INPC which has been operating for the past 20 years or so. In making the move we are making today, we need to be certain that it does not lead to difficulties in the future. I have no doubt that this can be done through some type of consumer watchdog or by way of anti-competitive monopolies or cartel legislation. I expect the Minister to put that on the record when she is replying.</P>
    <P>We should be aware that the large multinational oil companies have no commitment to this country. Whatever one might say about the smaller companies like Estuary and Tedcastles, they are at least completely rooted and involved in this country. We need to be aware of their concerns and of the need to allow them to operate freely without hindrance in a market of free competition. If it is going to be open to market forces, let it not be a market that is compromised or perverted by the over-influence of the large companies.</P>
    <P>I would like to set out a worst case scenario. Were INPC to close down or to be squeezed by the larger companies, the larger companies can always get their supplies from overseas stations, including that in south Wales and other places. They would not necessarily be at the same disadvantage. That is a concern I have and which I am sure has been well considered by the Minister's Department and many other groups. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that. I agree this is a progressive move which is necessary to develop. This aspect of the industry is too small in Ireland. It is not in the national interest, to coin a phrase, for us to be involved in this industry at the moment. This legislation is welcome and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad and the Members. Six Senators contributed and, as always, the level and range of debate and the knowledge of the subject were very comprehensive and interesting. Senator O'Dowd, the main Opposition spokesperson, and Senators Liam Fitzgerald, Norris, <Col N="890" /> Quinn, Costello and O'Toole contributed. Each in their own way put forward many points. The debate was very stimulating and I do not want to speak against the other House, my House, but the issues got a very real airing here. I will go through them now and will then seek to address the queries raised by the Senators.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Dowd, who welcomed the Bill, and all Senators for their welcome to the House. Senators will say I am plámásing them but coming to work this morning, I looked forward to coming to the Seanad and to the debate. I have said it before, and Senator Tom Fitzgerald has said it also, those who have spent time in the Seanad always feel that way as distinct from those who have not been in this House.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd said he was prepared to complete the Bill in this session and I thank him for that. He brought up the concerns of Tedcastles, as did most of the speakers. I recognise that the companies have every right to put forward their view. That is, in fact, an interchange of democracy. The same happened in the Dáil. I will deal with the Tedcastles issue and the smaller companies, including TOP which has made the most impact.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Dowd, O'Toole and Quinn asked about the European Commission inquiry. The European Commission made what we would regard as a standard inquiry about matters of State aid. The Department would regard it as an inquiry of a routine nature. We are required to send back the responses by 3 July, but we have been in contact with it orally. We do not anticipate any consequences which would be adverse to the legislation and the sale. Senator O'Dowd asked whether European companies bid. When we asked the chairman to look in the marketplace, 31 companies were approached or approached INPC. In the end, the number narrowed until the chairman and the board were of the opinion that the Tosco bid was the one most likely. Tosco's European headquarters will be in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about the selection process and how we arrived at Tosco. The Department engaged Arthur Andersen to conduct the selection process. The Tosco bid represented the best way forward for the company. Senator Costello also raised the company's environmental record and said he thought it was in the middle range. I should address that environmental inquiry because each of the six Members who spoke raised it. Any company that operates here operates under the law of this land in regard to the EPA and the HSA, all of which are welcome developments that came about as a result of directives from Europe. They have had major benefits for employees. There was an accident at one of Tosco's plants in California in 1997 or 1998 which resulted in four deaths. I would prefer if we were open about this. We knew about it and it was mentioned in the Dáil. There was considerable strengthening of its environmental and safety concerns after that. That is what I alluded to <Col N="891" /> when I said it had learned its lesson. A senior vice president of Tosco is in charge of environmental and safety issues. It now seeks to adhere to the DuPont criteria in regard to health and safety which are regarded throughout the world as of prime excellence. When Tosco comes here, it will adhere to EPA and HSA requirements. The same INPC people will operate the plant and will be in charge of health and safety. INPC has an excellent record in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Liam Fitzgerald for his positive response. He spoke about NORA and the very important role it will play. NORA will continue as a semi-State, free standing agency, or perhaps it will fall under the aegis of an energy agency. We are not quite sure yet, but we are sure that we are keeping it, that it will be a semi-State body and that it will have responsibility for strategic stocks about which many Senators spoke and which would be needed.</P>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald also engaged in a very positive discussion on the ESOP and the fact 80% of employees had voted in favour of it. Senator Norris raised the Tedcastles issue, to which I will refer, and its reliance on Whitegate. He asked if INPC would vanish. There will be a period of winding down. I anticipate that, for about one year, various matters will have to be attended to in the company. The decision has been taken to retain NORA, so we will have INPC-Tosco and NORA with its reserves. The INPC will continue in operation while consequential issues remain to be addressed. I join in Senator Norris's praise of the current chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked whether we would be at a disadvantage if oil were discovered and we did not have an oil refinery. I am reminded of the old story in Celtic mythology about Hybreasal, the isle of the blessed, which was supposed to be surrounded by oil. We will have a refinery in Tosco-INPC which has given a 15 year guarantee. The Senator spoke about the muddy track record which we openly acknowledge, although the use of the term &ldquo;muddy&rdquo; may be somewhat severe. The accident which occurred certainly served as a warning. As a result of the measures it recently introduced, Tosco has moved up a comparative table of environmental and health and safety adherents among US oil companies. The company is now almost at the top of the table.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked about the pier which is a derelict area. There is no compulsion on Tosco to take responsibility for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we could consider a development such as the Giant's Causeway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn wholeheartedly approves of the commercial mandate. He spoke about the lack of transparency which exists. Commercial confidentiality requires that a small number of matters cannot be publicly aired prior to the deal's con<Col N="892" /> clusion. However, we will then open a data room in the Department where all relevant material will be open to perusal.</P>
    <P>In regard to competition, the Senator asked whether Tosco would exploit its position. This links into the question about Tedcastles and the small operators which I will address in detail later. The euro query is a routine query to which we will respond in detail and to which we do not anticipate any adverse reaction.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello recognised the need for stability in this operation. The mandatory regime was previously renewed on a year-on-year basis. Although I do not say it with any sense of rancour, the previous Government made a formal Cabinet decision to remove the mandatory regime, although it reneged on that within three months. A company could not be expected to operate or expand in those circumstances. I do not know how the INPC sustained its confidence and work standards and planned its work year on year, not knowing what fate would befall it.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello welcomed the provisions of the ESOP and asked about the number of employees and conditions of employment such as pension rights. The work conditions of the 225 employees are guaranteed under the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked whether we could expect to see a reduction in petrol costs. That was one of the main questions I asked as one would like to see benefits accruing to the consumers. When operations commence under the new arrangement, I intend to ask Carmel Foley, the Director of Consumer Affairs, to monitor this area. Experience shows that expected reductions do not always materialise unless they are followed up.</P>
    <P>It struck me as I listened to Senator Costello that I asked the same questions he posed today one year ago when this process commenced. He asked what is the down side. I recall thinking that there must be a down side to this arrangement and I sought to discover if it existed. I am convinced this is a good commercial deal. If there is any down side, it is that this is a new arrangement. The propped-up manner in which the INPC operated resulted in a great deal of uncertainty. A future has now been mapped out for a minimum period of 15 years and the company has indicated its intention to expand further. Employees will now have work stability and will be able to avail of career development opportunities. Change brings its own concerns but, having studied this proposal in detail, the positives far outweigh the negatives.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Costello, I also asked what was Tosco's reason for locating in Ireland. I wondered why such a big US company wanted a base here. The primary reason was that the company sought a foothold in Europe. Tosco's top man is a Mr. Tom O'Malley, who visits Ireland four times a year to play golf in Waterford. We can be assured that he will not be some absent mogul. The com<Col N="893" /> pany was anxious to establish a foothold in a country which it found compatible.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole welcomed the provisions in regard to employees' rights, the strategic interest in Ireland and the retention of NORA, formerly an INPC subsidiary, which will now operate as a separate semi-State agency. The Senator spoke about the need for a continued supply in this sector.</P>
    <P>All speakers referred to Tedcastles and the smaller companies. Senator O'Toole highlighted the danger of the bigger companies coming together to form a cartel, leaving the smaller companies on the fringes. Were that to happen, the matter would immediately be referred to the Competition Authority which would move very swiftly to counter any such arrangements. Tosco is coming to Ireland to operate on a commercial basis and to do business with anybody who wishes. It would not be in its interest to rule out dealing with smaller companies.</P>
    <P>A Senator asked what would happen in the case of an emergency. The State has special powers for dealing with emergencies regardless of the ownership of the refinery. Tosco spoke on that. It wanted to come into Europe and to have a base in a compatible country to operate its business.</P>
    <P>We spoke about the disadvantage of not having a State refinery if we were to strike oil. The pier has been derelict since the 1979 disaster and there are no plans to do anything with it. No strictures regarding that have been laid down by the EPA from a safety point of view. The strategic process has been addressed. A standard query from the EU has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the possible takeover of the refinery by a foreign company posing a danger to competition. Tosco has said it will keep the refinery open. That issue is an obvious one that would be addressed in a chamber such as this whose Members have a vocational interest, the knowledge and depth of interest to address such an issue. I am content that the Competition Authority would not allow such a situation to develop and would move swiftly if there were any move towards establishing such a cartel.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this worthwhile debate. I found it stimulating and interesting as I am sure all of us did. I thank the Members for their welcome and support of the Bill.</P>

I relayed to the Dáil that the chairman of the INPC had come to see me when we were bringing this matter to a close. He told me he was seeking a quotation from various insurance companies to put a cap on the State's liability. He mentioned Coyle Hamilton and other companies. He was of the opinion that the company could get such a guarantee under insurance. I was keen to examine that amendment in the Dáil as Deputy Stanton, in moving it, had the good of the country and of the company at heart.

Section 1 states that a map is to be deposited by the Minister in the Ordnance Survey Office on some date in June 2001 with the official seal of the Minister. It is to be deposited for the purposes of any Act of the Oireachtas passed in the year 2001. Can the Minister deposit a map in June 2001 without the President having signed it? It will be July before the Minister can fulfil that duty. This is technical matter and I wonder whether the timescale available will allow the Minister to fulfil that duty. We have only got until tomorrow, Friday, because after the weekend we will be into July and the Minister only has until June 2001 to do this. Will that difficulty invalidate this section?</P>
      <P>I notice that in section 7 the sum of money in terms of the provision of the guarantee is not in Irish punts, sterling or euros&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the query on the depositing of the map, a &ldquo;deposited map&rdquo; means the map deposited by the Minister on 21 June 2001, which is sealed with the Official Seal of the Minister and signed by the Minister and has at the top of it the words and figures &ldquo;Deposited for the purposes of any Act of the Oireachtas passed in the year 2001.&rdquo; The date &ldquo;21 June&rdquo; is only the date on which a person went over with the map and deposited it. If the <Col N="896" /> Bill is passed, any time in 2001 would apply. The Senator is wondering if this must be signed and sealed by the President by the end of June. No, there is a statutory time within which the President signs Bills, and she may do so at her discretion within a range of days, but this does not have to be signed by the end of June.</P>
      <P>The Senator's second query related to the use of dollars. We checked that with the Attorney General and he said it was in order to use the dollar currency in legislation rather than other currency.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to insert a definition of the term &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; into the Bill. The word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; is not used in the Bill but related terms such as &ldquo;defraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; are used. Due to the collective construction of the Bill with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, the insertion in the Bill of a definition of fraud would have the effect of providing a definition of the term for all existing Companies Acts as well as for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was proposed on Committee Stage in the Dáil by Deputy Naughten. At the time the Minister expressed reservations about including a definition of fraud in the Bill on the basis that the Companies Acts have operated and been interpreted effectively without a specific <Col N="898" /> definition of the term. She pointed out that where no definition is provided for a word or phrase used in legislation, the word or phrase would have its ordinary meaning, subject to the context in which it is used. Definitions of specific terms are usually provided in legislation where these are necessary or helpful to a proper interpretation of particular provisions.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's reservations, she agreed to consult the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter. Neither is disposed to the provision of a definition of fraud in the Bill. They endorsed the view expressed on Committee Stage that the concept of fraud is clearly understood as involving something which is not only wrong or dishonest but which is done intentionally, knowing it is wrong and dishonest, especially where some material gain is obtained by unfair means. To define the term specifically would not serve to give any greater meaning to what is already understood but might serve to limit the application and interpretation unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>In light of this advice and in the absence of a compelling need for the provision of a definition, I cannot accept the amendment. I hope the Senator will accept my explanation.</P>

Having heard the Attorney General's advice, I am happy to concur and withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;where such a relationship is defined during the financial period in question by:</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 22 of the Bill which amends section 9 of the Companies Act, 1990. It addresses the question of what is meant by a related company for the purposes of section 9. Section 9 permits court appointed inspectors to extend an investigation of a company to the affairs of a related company where this is necessary for the purposes of the investigation and where the court approves.</P>
      <P>The point of the amendment of section 9, as provided for in section 22 of the Bill, is to get away from the concept that a company investigation should only be allowed to extend to the affairs of other companies that are either owned or controlled by the investigated company or that are in the same group of companies as the investigated company. Rather, it should be possible for such investigations to extend to the affairs of any other company whose affairs it is necessary to investigate to satisfactorily conclude the investigation of the primary target company.</P>
      <P>It is important to note in this context that the extension of the examination of a company's affairs to the affairs of a related company is subject to a double test under section 9 of the 1990 Act. First, the inspectors must consider it necessary for the purposes of the primary investigation to extend their inquiries to the affairs of the related company and, second, the extension of the investigation must be approved by the High Court which appointed the inspectors in the first place. I am satisfied these provisions will ensure there is no unwarranted intrusion in the affairs of companies that have had a proper and above board commercial relationship with the target company.</P>
      <P>I hope Senator Coghlan will be reassured by my comments on this proposal. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 1 to 4, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or may give directions to an officer of any such body requiring the body, or in the alternative such officer, at such time and place as may be specified in the directions, to produce such books or documents as may be so specified or in the alternative fulfil obligations or an obligation arising under Part V of the Act of 1963 or under Parts III or IV of the Act of 1990.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will await the response of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to section 29 which provides for the repeal and replacement of section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, relating to the examination of the books and documents of a company in certain specified circumstances. The power, under section 19 of the 1990 Act, to require production of books and documents is exerciseable in respect of the bodies listed in that section, essentially all companies registered or carrying on business in the State, as it is the books and documents of the bodies concerned which may be examined under the section.</P>
      <P>There is no need to extend, as this amendment does, the power to require the production of a company's books by the officers of the company. Where a company has been required to produce books and documents under section 19, subsection (3) provides that any person who appears to be in possession of the books or documents may also be required to produce them. This would include an officer of the body.</P>
      <P>The second aspect of amendment No. 3 is to extend the powers available under the section to include not only the production of books and documents but also a power to compel companies or their officers to fulfil obligations arising under Part V of the Companies Act, 1963, or Parts III or IV of the Companies Act, 1990. These Parts of the relevant Acts relate, respectively, to the management and administration of companies, transactions between companies and their directors, and disclosure of interest in shares. These Parts impose a range of obligations, both on companies and their officers, from their requirement to keep registers and accounts to the making of annual returns and the obligation to disclose interests in shares of publicly quoted companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would provide the director of corporate enforcement with a statutory power to compel companies and company officers to comply with particular obligations under these <Col N="901" /> sections of the Companies Acts where the director considered that they had failed to do so. This would constitute a significant extension of the powers available to the director in the enforcement of the Companies Act. Such an extension is not considered appropriate as it would give to the director power to compel persons to take particular action based entirely on the director's own opinion as to the person's obligation to do so. Decisions of the director in that regard would not be subject to any judicial endorsement or approval as would be normal. The director will have a range of powers available to him or her in cases where a person appears not to have fulfilled an obligation under the Companies Act. The director may institute summary proceedings against the person or may choose to impose a fine pursuant to the provisions of section 109 of the Bill. In the latter instance, the person or company liable to pay the fine would also have to remedy the default in respect of which the fine is imposed.</P>
    <P>In addition, under section 371 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended by this Bill, the director may seek a court order to compel a person to comply with an obligation under the Companies Act. This is a more appropriate mechanism by which the director could seek to enforce compliance with the Act.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained to Senator Coghlan the Government's position on this matter and that he can be reassured by my clarification of why I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

We have seen all sorts of cases, which unfortunately have been referred from the tribunals to the High Court and elsewhere. We read of an unfortunate case where one company director stated not, as far as I recall, that he had burned papers but that he had kept no documents or records of correspondence with his lawyers, which one would assume would have been a <i>sine qua non</i> in running a business. The Minister of State understands my concern but I accept what he said and appreciate it. On the basis of his advice, I feel no need to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to extend the grounds for the exercise of the powers available under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, relating to the examination of books and documents of companies and other bodies. This would involve extending the list of reasons in subsection (2) of section 19, for which the director of corporate enforcement would be permitted to exercise those powers.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that this list be extended to include a range of matters such as a company impeding litigation, arbitration investigation or the enforcement of court orders or that an employee of the company requires to exercise a right of action against a company. These matters are not related to suspected wrongdoings on the part of a company in relation to its obligations under the Companies Acts. It is not appropriate for the director of corporate enforcement to be given power to have a company's books and documents examined on the basis of these actions by the company.</P>
      <P>What Senator Coghlan wants to achieve is already available under the law in civil matters. If there is a civil case to be dealt with, for example, under property law or employment law, the concerns of the Senator in these situations can be met under other legislation.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section in the Bill amending section 266 of the Companies Act, 1963. Subsection (3) of that section requires the directors of a company to lay a statement of the affairs of the company, including a list of the company's creditors, before a meeting of the creditors where the company is being wound up through a creditors' voluntary liquidation. The amendment proposed <Col N="904" /> here would require that the statement of the company's affairs prepared by its directors should also be lodged in the companies registration office in addition to being provided to the creditors at their meeting.</P>
      <P>It is an offence for the directors of a company not to provide a statement of the company's affairs to the creditors in a creditors' voluntary liquidation and this should be sufficient to ensure that the directors meet their obligations or, if they do not, that there is an adequate sanction available. I see no compelling reason to require that the statement of the affairs of a company in voluntary liquidation be placed on the public record in the Companies Office. The information in question is only of immediate relevance to the creditors and I do not consider that wider disclosure of this is warranted. Accordingly, I am obliged to oppose the amendment.</P>

Specifically, section 60 provides for the introduction of an annual return date for determining the date in each year on which a company is required to file its annual return with the Registrar of Companies.

This would not achieve a solution to the existing difficulties with the policing of the annual return filing requirement, which section 60 aims to address. These difficulties stem from the fact that the Registrar of Companies does not know if or when a company holds its AGM and <Col N="905" /> is, therefore, not alerted to the fact that the company has defaulted on its annual return filing obligation.</P>
      <P>While the proposal that companies be obliged to inform the Registrar of Companies of the date on which they hold their AGM might, on the face of it, appear to address this problem, there are a number of practical difficulties that must be considered. First, this proposal would not address the existing difficulty whereby the registrar cannot be proactive in the enforcement of the annual return filing requirement but can only react to apparent omissions in that regard. Where a company fails to inform the registrar of its intention to hold an AGM, it would still be up to the registrar to prove that a company had defaulted and it would be equally difficult to prove precisely when that default occurred as it currently is to prove when a company defaults in the filing of its annual return.</P>
      <P>The advantage of the annual return date system proposed under the Bill is that it will allow the registrar to monitor companies' compliance with their filing requirement on an ongoing basis as the register will know precisely when a given company is due to file its annual return. I hope this clarifies the position.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 84, which amends section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, relating to the definition of certain terms used in that Act. The proposed amendment is for the inclusion of the definition of the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; for the purpose of the Companies Act. There is currently no definition of that term in the Acts. The implications of providing that employees or other persons seeking to enforce rights against a company should be defined as creditors for the purpose of the Companies Act would require careful consideration. Creditors may, for example, apply to have a company wound up or to have a receiver or examiner appointed. I do not consider it to be necessary or <Col N="906" /> appropriate to provide a definition of the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; for the purpose of the Companies Act. The term can be clearly interpreted by its commonly understood meaning as a person to whom a debt is owed. Therefore, the amendment is not accepted.</P>

It is not the case, therefore, that employees would be disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> other creditors of a company in liquidation in the absence of a definition such as that proposed by the amendment.</P>

      <P>The issue of contract and temporary workers needs to be reviewed in future legislation. Where companies employ temporary workers through recruitment agencies the agencies are responsible for the payment of the employees, including the collection of PAYE and the payment of PRSI. The bills are then invoiced to the relevant companies. In the case of a liquidation the agency bill for the payroll part of the service provided is not deemed to be included as a high priority payment. This means that agencies can be open to grave exposure.</P>

      <P>In page 64, before the Schedule, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;115.&ndash;(1)A member or officer of a company which has been struck off the register pursuant to section 12 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, as amended, shall have joint and several responsibility and liability for:</P>

    <P>(2) Such officers as are held jointly or severally liable pursuant to <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section shall be entitled to an indemnity from the company provided such indemnity does not contravene or conflict with section 200 of the Act of 1963 or the memorandum and articles of the company.</P>
    <P>(3) Subject to the provisions of the <i>Companies Acts, 1963 to 2001,</i> such acts and deeds which have been purportedly carried out by the company during the period of dissolution may be validated by the members of the company after the date of restoration provided always that such Acts are lawful and fully in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion into the Bill of new section related to section 12 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982. That section provides that the Registrar of Companies may strike the companies from the register if it fails to file the annual return required of every company under the Companies Act. This is known as the involuntary strike-off regime. This amendment is prompted by the perception of abuse of the involuntary strike-off regime by directors or members of companies who allow a company to be struck of in order, for example, to avoid debts or other liabilities of the company.</P>
      <P>When a company is struck off the register, it ceases to exist as a legal entity. It is difficult, therefore, for creditors and other persons to seek to enforce claims against the company. The amendment would make members and officers of a company personally liable in respect of debts outstanding or for acts and omissions of the company.</P>
      <P>On foot of the company law review group's consideration of this issue, measures to address this matter have been included in the Bill. Section 42 provides that the directors of a company that is struck off the register for failure to file an annual return may be disqualified by the court on the application of the director of corporate enforcement under section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990. This should constitute a real and significant deterrent to the abuse of the strike off regime by company directors for the purpose of avoiding debts or other responsibilities of a company as persons disqualified cannot, for the period of the court order, be involved in the formation of the company or act as an officer of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that the strike off campaign by the Companies Registration Office in <Col N="908" /> respect of the non-filing of annual returns, which has been running since September 1998, is almost at an end. A trawl of the entire register is almost complete. As substantially fewer companies will be struck off pursuant to section 12 in future years, significantly fewer creditors will be affected by section 12 strike offs.</P>
    <P>The issue of creditor protection is still under review by the company law review group and it would be most appropriate to await the outcome of the group's considerations before making any further changes in this difficult area. I appreciate Senator Coghlan's motivation in tabling the amendment, but efforts are being made to deal with this aspect in section 42. The company law review group is still reviewing issues relating to this matter.</P>

      <P>We are all concerned about abuses, but there is probably not much the Minister can do about one deal companies. It has been discovered recently that many directors used offshore companies for such deals and that is outside the Minister's control. However, perhaps the Minister and the Department could consider placing a prohibition on such company directors in regard to such abuses.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials. There was a general welcome for the Bill on Second Stage. The message was that corruption has no place in society. Some of the matters that are emerging would upset anybody who has a sense of decency. Some of the stories that are coming out on a daily basis from various places are shameful. Undoubtedly, when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment receives the reports of the ongoing inquiries, there will be other matters of which we will not be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, it is important not to lose the spirit of risk taking that is vital to any economy. People should not be tied up by legislation; the focus should not be on paper pushing and administration. There is a need for entrepreneurs who are prepared to put their livelihoods and investments at risk in an effort to create a company, such as Bill Gates and Microsoft. <Col N="909" /> Entrepreneurship is vital to the continued success of the economy and the Government, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, are committed to that aspect.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials and particularly the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who listened to the views expressed in the Lower House and took on board a number of amendments. The legislation was much better as a result of the work done in the other House which it meant little had to be done to it here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for all their work on the Bill. I welcome its focus on the enforcement of company law. I am pleased with the work of the working group on company law compliance and enforcement, which is ably chaired by the Attorney General, Mr. Michael McDowell. The report on auditing by the group stated that compliance with statutory provisions is the responsibility of a company's management and, ultimately, the board of directors. However delineated, the auditor's role cannot take the place of directors of entities who have primary responsibility in law for the direction of the entity's activities and their compliance with the law.</P>
      <P>This is an important guiding statement. I do not wish to defend auditors, many of whom have encountered difficulties in respect of the way they audited, advised and practised in companies, but the board of directors has a primary role within companies. In practice, although ignorance of the law is no excuse for any citizen, many directors of companies are ignorant of the law. Following the creation of a director of corporate enforcement under the Bill, I hope there will be other worthwhile crackdowns. A person is not entitled to be a director of a company unless he or she takes on board all the responsibilities enshrined in company law.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials. I also thank Senator Manning for taking Second Stage for me when I could not be present. I read his contribution and I agree with it. I also thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her overview of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad, the staff of the House and my officials for their assistance and support regarding the Bill. I also wish to convey the thanks of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who, unfortunately, could not be present. I was asked to step in for her at short notice and I am pleased to be in the House because I have worked with Senators on a number of Bills recently. Much legislation is dealt with at this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fully aware of the need to ensure that the provisions of the Companies Acts are enforced so that those who do business with or through corporate entities can feel secure in the <Col N="910" /> knowledge that the rules are obeyed, if not by all, then by at least the vast majority of companies. Heretofore, sadly, it has been the case that insufficient resources were deployed to enforce the provisions of the Companies Act. I hope and expect that once the office of the director of corporate enforcement is up and running, there will be a much greater willingness by those involved in corporate activity to abide by the provisions of the Companies Act and that eventually enforcement by prosecution will be necessary only in a very small number of cases.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill, we sought to be pragmatic and to put in place an office with adequate, but not excessive, powers. I accept Senator Cox's remarks in that regard. It is likely that, as the office functions over time, refinements to the enabling provisions will be identified. However, following the acceptance of a number of amendments in the other House and having listened carefully to the views of Members of the House, I believe the Bill represents an excellent starting point for the work of the director.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan made a number of suggestions near the end of the debate. I assure Senators that the company law review group will consider the many suggestions which have been made in this House and the other House. I thank all who took part in the discussions for their co-operation. The director designate has been appointed and he and his team will hit the ground running. I thank Senators for their co-operation and for the speedy passage of the Bill through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be back in this House, this time to debate the Government's legislative response to one aspect, although a very important one, of its policy in relation to standards in public life. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill deals with far more than corruption in Irish public life, as I will explain shortly. However, it contains specific measures of particular relevance to the work of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in their role as public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out the Government's legislative proposals to combat bribery and corruption in both the public and private sectors. To this end, the Bill will update anti-corruption legislation, expand it to cover areas which are currently outside its scope and make the law more responsive to modern conditions. The Bill contains measures which will ensure that corrupt behaviour is dealt with swiftly, effectively and severely by the rule of law. The Government will not tolerate corrupt behaviour or practices, no matter from where <Col N="911" /> they emanate. The message should be made clear that anyone found guilty of corrupt practices will face unlimited fines or up to ten years in prison, or both. These are severe penalties and I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>I do not need to remind Members of the need to have in place effective laws to tackle corruption. Charges of corruption levied against the few have the capacity, in the public mind, to taint everyone engaged in public life. Allegations and rumours of corrupt practices have a corrosive effect on public life with the result that public confidence in the entire system is undermined. Members have a right to be concerned at the possible erosion of confidence in politics and politicians and to demand that the law is stringent enough to deter corrupt practice in the first instance and to punish severely such conduct when it is uncovered. The Bill will ensure that our criminal law is responsive to the needs of society in fighting corruption involving public representatives or officials.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on allegations made in the course of hearings of the tribunals whose task it is to investigate payments to politicians or corruption in the planning process. They will report in due course and nothing we say here should interfere with that process. However, we must be concerned at the reports that have emerged and we must be prepared to take action to ensure that confidence in the political system, and in us as politicians, is not lost. The Government has taken action in this regard. The Local Government Bill includes a comprehensive ethics framework for local authorities which will apply to elected members and employees alike. There is also the Standards in Public Office Bill and, of course, the Bill we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>It might be of use to Senators if I give some background to the proposals in the Bill. The law relating to corruption is governed mainly by the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 1916. There was some updating to these made by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Under these Acts various activities are criminalised as corrupt practices. For example, the 1889 Act, as amended by the 1995 Act, makes it an offence for a person holding a public office, a special adviser or a director or occupier of a position of employment in a public body corruptly to solicit or receive any reward as an inducement for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the individual's duty. It is also an offence for a person to offer to such an individual any reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty. The current penalty for conviction on indictment for this offence is a fine of £50,000 or imprisonment for up to seven years, or both.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906, defines a wide range of persons, referred to in the Act as agents, who could be described for present purposes as office holders or employees, whether in the public or private sector. It provides that <Col N="912" /> any agent who corruptly accepts or obtains from any person, either for himself or herself or for any other person, any gift or consideration as an inducement for acting or refraining from acting in relation to an employer's affairs will be guilty of an offence. Corruptly giving or agreeing to give to an agent a gift or consideration for the like purpose is also an offence.</P>
    <P>The meaning given to the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; includes any person employed by or acting for another. It also refers to any person holding an office remunerated out of the central fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as well as other public office holders. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, amended this to include office holders and persons occupying positions of employment in any public body. It also includes special advisers.</P>
    <P>The amendment effected by the 1995 Act had the unfortunate effect of removing from the definition of agent in the 1906 Act some categories of person previously covered. Thus, while the new definition covered certain specific national office holders, such as Ministers as well as civil and public servants, it excluded a number of others, such as Members of the Dáil and Seanad and judges. Members of this House will agree that the categories of persons who should be covered by anti-corruption legislation should be as broad and comprehensive a possible.</P>
    <P>The 1916 Act was aimed at a particular form of corruption, namely, the awarding of public contracts, and provided for a presumption of corruption where it was proved that money was given to a public official by a person seeking to obtain or retain a Government contract. The Bill before the House today will build on these earlier Acts and will considerably strengthen the law against bribery and corruption.</P>
    <P>Corruption is not something which is of concern to us solely from the point of view of maintaining confidence in us as politicians, nor is it confined to those engaged in public life or working in the public administration of the State. Such is the international concern at the possible effects of corruption, both in terms of the erosion of confidence in the ability of the system to deliver services impartially as well as the likely distortion of trade or disruption of commerce, that there has been a number of international instruments aimed at combating corruption. The European Union, the Council of Europe and the OECD have drawn up conventions against corruption. As can be seen from the Long Title, the Bill will give effect to these conventions. That being the case, however, I will outline briefly for the House what these conventions contain.</P>
    <P>The EU convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European communities or officials of member states of the European Union aims to complement national measures to combat fraud or corruption of public officials. It was thought desirable in circumstances where the European Union was tightening links between its member states and in the context of protecting <Col N="913" /> the Union's own institutions and staff that bribery and corrupt conduct aimed at officials of other member states should be criminalised in the same way that bribery and corruption of national officials are dealt with by states. The convention deals with corruption by an official who requests or receives advantage in return for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty, which it terms passive corruption. It also deals with corruption of an official by others who promise or give advantage in return for that official acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty, which it terms active corruption. Corruption of or by members of the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are also covered by the convention. It requires member states to take the necessary measures to criminalise such activities.</P>
    <P>The OECD convention deals with situations where a person commits an offence by promising to give or by giving a bribe. It seeks to ensure as far as possible that parties to the convention adopt equivalent measures to penalise bribery of foreign public officials. The primary objective of the convention is set out in Article 1 which provides that it should be a criminal offence for any person to bribe a foreign public official, that is, to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage to obtain or to retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business. For the purposes of the convention a foreign public official is defined as meaning any person who holds a legislative, administrative or judicial office in a foreign country, a person who exercises a public function for a foreign country and any official or agent of a public international organisation.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, a Council of Europe convention, also seeks to put in place a common response to the problem of corruption. It deals with corruption of or by domestic and foreign public officials and members of domestic and foreign Parliaments or other assemblies, officials of international organisations, members of international parliamentary assemblies and judges and officials of international courts. It also deals with corruption in the private sector. The Bill before the House will enable Ireland to ratify these conventions and it is our intention to do so at an early date after the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Ireland very much supports these and other international efforts against corruption. Members of the House might be interested to know that a conference on the theme of fighting corruption and safeguarding integrity was recently held in the Hague, at which I had the honour to be Ireland's representative. The conference represented a key element in the preparation of a proposed UN convention on corruption. An important aim of the conference was to determine a common approach to be taken to fighting corruption on a global scale and in ensuring effective measures to combat corruption at all levels. <Col N="914" /> The report of the conference is expected to be available later in the year.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also a member of GRECO, the group of nations against corruption, which meets under the auspices of the Council of Europe. It recently undertook an evaluation of Ireland, with particular emphasis on the legislative and institutional mechanisms in place to prevent corruption and the functioning of the various bodies which would contribute to the fight against corruption. While the report of the evaluation will not be available until the autumn, the indications are that there was general satisfaction with the systems and procedures in place to prevent corruption in the first place or to detect and punish for it if it does occur. I might add that in international terms we are considered among the least corrupt.</P>
    <P>However, that should not make us complacent and I think it is fair to say that there is a general recognition that our anti-corruption legislation needs updating. The Bill will do this and will also ensure that there is in place a strong response to offences involving corruption. I say this because the provisions of the Bill deal with such matters as specifying a wide range of persons who will be subject to its provisions, defining clearly the actions which constitute corruption, providing for presumptions of corruption in certain circumstances as well as dealing with corruption committed abroad and providing for penalties upon conviction of unlimited fines or up to ten years in prison, or both.</P>
    <P>I will now outline in more detail for the benefit of the House the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision. Section 2 may be considered to be the central provision of the Bill. It substitutes a new section for section 1 of the 1906 Act. As I mentioned earlier, this Act introduced the concept of agent for the purpose of criminalising corruption by or of a wide range of office holders and employees in the public as well as the private sector. I also mentioned that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, had amended the definition of agent in such a way that a number of persons previously covered were outside its scope. Consequently, the Bill affords the opportunity to make the definition as comprehensive as possible as well as providing for suitable penalties for any breach. The best way to achieve this is to substitute an entirely new section for the old one.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, provides that an agent includes any person employed by or acting for another. With regard to public bodies, agent includes public office holders, persons occupying positions of employment in a public body, special advisers, members of local authorities and health boards and members of other bodies financed out of Exchequer funds. The section sets out further specific categories of persons also covered. These are Members of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, judges, members of the European Parliament representing constituencies in the State and any other person employed in or acting <Col N="915" /> on behalf of the public administration of the State.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports international efforts against corruption and in particular will ratify the EU, OECD and Council of Europe conventions. Therefore, the Bill also makes provision for dealing with corruption by, or of, foreign office holders and officials. It is important that our laws should capture such activities. Accordingly, the definition of agent in section 2 will also extend to members of the Government and national or regional Parliaments of any other state, a Member of the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors and European Commission, foreign public prosecutors and foreign judges as well as judges of any international court established by agreement to which Ireland is a party. Finally, it includes employees of international bodies and foreign administrations.</P>
    <P>Regarding the offence of corruption, the section states that it will be an offence for an agent, or any other person, to corruptly accept or obtain, or agree to accept or attempt to obtain, whether for personal benefit or for someone else's benefit, any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement or reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her position. It will also be an offence for any person to corruptly give, agree to give or offer any gift or consideration to the agent or any other person as an inducement or reward for the agent acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her position. Senators will appreciate that the offence covers not only the office holder or employee, but any other person, such as a spouse, who might have influence over the former.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that there can be no tolerance for corrupt practices within our political system. As far as the law against corruption is concerned, it should be equally clear that such activities will be subject to severe sanctions. That is why the Bill provides that the penalty to be imposed following conviction on indictment will be increased from the current penalty of a fine of up to £50,000 or imprisonment for up to seven years or both to an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both. Where an offence under the Bill is dealt with summarily in the District Court, the judge may impose a fine of up to £2,362.69, or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.</P>
    <P>The level of fine provided for may seem unusual at first reading. The fine originally provided for in the Bill was £1,500. However, this figure was re-examined in light of advice from the Attorney General's office that the change in the value of money since the level was last raised indicated that an increase was possible. That office further advised that an increase in the monetary penalty for summary conviction, having regard to the impending introduction of the euro and the need to provide for a rounded figure in euros after next January, should be no more than <Col N="916" /> 3,000, which converts to the sum provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for a presumption of corruption in certain circumstances, that is where a public representative or candidate for election is concerned. Where there are proceedings for an offence of corruption, a presumption that the person against whom the proceedings are being taken has acted corruptly will arise in the following circumstances: that the person has received a donation above the amount set out in the Electoral Act, 1997, or the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999; that he or she has failed to disclose it in accordance with the appropriate provisions and that the donor had an interest in the person's performance of his or her functions. Where these facts are proven, it will be presumed that the donation was given and received corruptly as an inducement or reward for the person acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duties.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill complements section 3. It provides for a presumption that a person holding public office or a public official has acted corruptly in certain circumstances. As this House is well aware, public office holders and officials have power to make decisions affecting many people and they are too many to list separately. However, in the mind of the general public there are certain areas where it is considered that the potential for corruption is most likely to arise and it is these which are targeted in the present amendment. The particular areas covered by this section are those related to the planning process, to the granting of licences or other permits and in relation to the sale or purchase of property.</P>
    <P>It is useful to emphasise here that the scope of the presumption as set out in this section is limited to circumstances where there are already proceedings against a person for corruption and where there is proof of certain matters leading to such a presumption. Furthermore, it links the presumption of corruption to certain areas of decision-making. Its provisions seek to ensure the maintenance of a sense of confidence in the planning process generally and in the award of licences and permits. The section provides for a presumption of corruption where proceedings are being taken under the Prevention of Corruption Acts against a person who holds any one of a number of public offices in relation to the exercise of certain functions and where there is proof that he or she received money or other benefit from a person who has an interest in the way those functions are exercised. In those circumstances it will be presumed that the money or other benefit was given and received corruptly as an inducement or reward for the person acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duties.</P>
    <P>The public office holders and officials who will be covered by this amendment include local government members, employees of public bodies, TDs, Senators, the Attorney General, judges, <Col N="917" /> Irish MEPs and any person employed by or acting on behalf of the public administration of the State. The full list of those covered is set out in section 2(5)<i>(b)</i> of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the granting of search warrants in relation to the investigation of offences of corruption. It provides for the granting of search warrants in respect of any offence under the Prevention of Corruption Acts which carries a penalty of at least five years imprisonment. In effect, therefore, all offences under the Acts, except an offence under the provisions of this section which will be a summary offence, comes within the scope of this provision.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 a member of the Garda can apply to a District Court judge for a search warrant. The judge may issue the warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of an offence under the Acts is to be found in any place and will authorise the entry and search of the premises and any person found there. There is also provision for a Garda superintendent to issue a warrant in circumstances of urgency. In recognition of the fact that such warrants will only be issued in circumstances of urgency, they will be valid for only 24 hours. The section also empowers the Garda to arrest any person who obstructs or interferes with the execution of a warrant and to demand certain information from any person who is present in a place during the search. The maximum penalty for a summary offence under this section is a fine of up to £2,362.69 or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. As I mentioned earlier, the fine will, in due course, convert to 3,000.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 relate to aspects of jurisdiction. Normally Irish criminal law is territorial in its jurisdiction, in other words, it applies only to acts done in Ireland. There are some exceptions to this, such as certain sexual offences and murder. It would be naive to think that corruption takes place only within national boundaries, requiring a purely domestic response. The increasing complexity of international business and the opening up of national economies increases the danger that some will seek to exploit this by trying to influence decisions in their favour through the offer of corrupt payments.</P>
    <P>This has been recognised and is the reason the EU, the OECD and the Council of Europe have each thought it desirable to formulate conventions to criminalise such practices involving foreign office holders and officials. It follows that as the offence, or elements of it, can be committed across frontiers, there should be legislative sanctions enabling the taking of prosecutions where any aspect of the offence occurs within this jurisdiction. Section 6 meets this requirement by providing that a person may be tried in Ireland for the offence of corruption once any element of the offence took place within the State. As a corollary, section 7 criminalises corrupt acts by Irish office holders or officials which are committed <Col N="918" /> abroad, for example, by accepting a bribe while outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that section 2 was the central element of the Bill. However, I am sure Senators will agree that section 8 of the Bill represents a significant contribution to the Government's determination to combat all forms of corruption in public life. Section 8 creates a new offence of corruption in office.</P>
    <P>Current anti-corruption legislation does not deal adequately with a situation where an office holder or official may act corruptly on his or her own initiative to secure some personal benefit or advantage or advantage for another person. In such circumstances there is no question of a corrupt payment or favour being sought from, or offered by, any person. Such a situation might arise where the individual's actions are designed to benefit one's own family. The new offence created by section 8 will criminalise any act or omission by an office holder or official done with the intention of corruptly obtaining a gift, consideration or other advantage either for himself or herself, or for any other person. As an indication of how seriously this type of corruption is viewed by the Government, the penalty provided will be on a par with that for other offences of corruption under the Bill, namely, an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>I turn to the issue of corruption as carried out by or on behalf of bodies corporate. Corporate bodies, as well as individuals, may become involved in offences of corruption. Equally, there are instances when individuals within a body corporate can contribute to such offences, whether directly by consenting to or conniving with the commission of an offence, or simply by wilful neglect of their responsibilities. For this reason, section 9 provides that responsibility for an offence of corruption by a body corporate can be attributed, where appropriate, to certain of its officers and or members. In this way, individuals as well as the body corporate can be held liable for the offence.</P>
    <P>The final section, section 10, states the short title of the Bill. It also provides that the Act or sections of it may be brought into operation by order or orders made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Those are the provisions of the Bill. It is a short Bill, but it contains a range of measures which will copperfasten and considerably improve existing legislation on the prevention of corruption. It will also meet our international obligations. It is clear that the elimination of corrupt practices is an objective to which all parties in the House are committed and that this Bill represents the best option for achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill. On that note I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I apologise for the quality of my vocal cords. Contrary to what Senator Cregan implied <Col N="919" /> earlier, it is not due to a late night or any sing-song in which I was involved. It is simply laryngitis. I apologise for the corncrake quality which the House will hear today.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome but there is a little bit of mystery surrounding it, even at this stage, that is, the length of time it has taken to get to the point, next week, of sending it to the President to be signed into law. The Bill was published on 4 January 2000, 18 months ago. Its arrival was surrounded with a great fanfare of publicity. However, Second Stage was not taken in the Dáil for a further six months and it only passed in the Dáil yesterday. Like many Bills it is coming before the House at the end of the session. It is clear the Government is not willing to take amendments so that it will fit in with its timetable. What we have here is a <i>fait accompli,</i> the Bill in its complete and final form.</P>
      <P>The Bill was described in the other House as &ldquo;a slight piece of legislation&rdquo;. That description came from one of the Government's backbenchers, Deputy Roche, who indicated that while the Bill was welcome, it certainly did not go far enough, that it should have been a stronger and more comprehensive Bill and one that had a greater sense of urgency. That said, the Bill is welcome and as far as it goes, it is worthwhile. In the first case, it is worthwhile because it updates the 1906 Act. That Act of the House of Commons is outdated. Human nature being what it is, maybe the underlying motives behind corruption remain the same. Clearly that legislation was out of date. It is good it is being reformed. It should have been updated many years ago.</P>
      <P>In her contribution, the Minister of State said it is no great surprise that this new legislation is probably one of the many direct consequences of the tribunal culture in which we now live and within which much of our political life operates. Like the Minister, I have no intention of visiting any of the current tribunals. It is not proper to take out of tribunals elements that are ongoing, elements where not everybody has been heard yet, and rush to judgment on these matters. One might say the rest of the country is doing that and that there is a whole new army of pundits who will give not just instant reaction but instant judgment on the daily fallout from the tribunals. Some of the comments are, undoubtedly, valid but there is also a need for caution. If all the answers were available at this stage, there would be no need for the tribunals to continue. Like others in this House, I prefer to wait until the sole member of each tribunal presents a report to these Houses, which set up the tribunals in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunals have created a climate in which there is a public perception of widespread corruption in public life. From listening to some commentators in the media and some ordinary people, there is an impression about that all politics is corrupt and, by extension, all politicians are painted as being corrupt. When one pursues the <Col N="920" /> argument by asking people about their own TDs or Senators, their general reaction is that the public representative in their area is an honest person who works very hard for the area, is involved in community activity, makes sure that the voice of that area is heard in Dublin and has helped to speed up payment of grants etc. When asked if their public representatives are honest, the answer is invariably &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. There is a rather strange and ironic contradiction whereby &ndash; this could be said of almost every Member of each House &ndash; in the eyes of people who know them and in their own communities, public representatives are regarded as honest people. Yet the taint of all politics and all politicians being corrupt not only persists but is becoming deeply embedded in public thinking. At an individual level, I believe most of us are seen as straight and honest but at the collective level the picture is very different.</P>
    <P>Over the years, especially since the tribunals began, there has been a tendency, when charges were made, to rush in with legislation to try to deal with the latest scandal or weakness. In reality, having an accountable and corruption-free political system has been part of our political culture from the very foundation of the State. One of the first actions of the first Government in the 1920s was to set up a Civil Service Commission and a Local Authorities Commission. The idea behind that was to have a corruption-free and impartial public service, serving no party but serving the Government of the day honestly and loyally. Among our early civil servants, one recalls men of the calibre of Joseph Brennan and J. J. McElligott, who established an enduring tradition which has given us probably the greatest public servant of recent times, T. K. Whitaker. People who talk about corruption in public life ignore the fact that the Civil Service Commission, established by politicians, has acted to ensure that we have a corruption-free Civil Service. It is important in the current climate to recognise that, even if the Civil Service is being brought under the aegis of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Reviewing the development of Irish life since the foundation of the State, there have been very few examples of corruption. Tribunals were set up in the 1940s and 1950s to examine corruption in public life and the conclusions were rather minimal. In the Ward tribunal, Dr. Ward was found guilty of selling bad bacon and not keeping his tax affairs up to date &ndash; no more than that &ndash; yet it was the end of his political career. In the Locke's Distillery tribunal, the righteous charges which were made were not sustained against the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Over the years our politics have, I believe, been honest. I recall a conversation many years ago with the late Patrick McGilligan, one of the great founders of the State, about his experience in setting up the ESB. During a visit to New York, he was asked by one of the big companies how much it would cost to buy the Irish Government of the day, meaning what sort of bribe would be needed. He was shocked by that attitude, as would have <Col N="921" /> been his successors in the subsequent Fianna Fáil Government. At a time when bribery and corruption were endemic in American, French and German politics and when Britain had its own scandals in the sale of peerages and so forth, the founders of the State were concentrating on the provision of an honest and corruption-free public service. By and large, that has remained the case over the intervening years.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, it deals with a fairly small range of matters, but they are significant and important &ndash; I will not try to score party political points. In the current overall context of reform, there is a tendency to rush in with new legislation. We are possibly on the way to creating one of the most regulated political systems in the world. The Minister indicated some of the legislation passed in recent years to ensure we operate within a climate which is properly regulated. That, I suppose, is good but we have reached a stage where we need to take stock. Those of us who have looked at the situation in other countries will have come across some scare stories. For example, in New South Wales there are more enforcers and regulators than Members of Parliament, the budget for the regulation agency is as high as that of the Parliament itself and many MPs have been accused and examined, often on spurious, slight or trumped-up charges. Obviously, there has to be a sense of balance, so that Parliament and politics can breathe and operate without undue or unfair restriction.</P>
    <P>We are approaching a stage where it may well be necessary to have one single Act rather than a whole series of Acts dealing with the behaviour of people in public life, in which I also include the Administration and the Judiciary. That omnibus Act should bring everything together, simplify matters and ensure certainty. Perhaps the next Government, if not this one, will produce such legislation dealing with all aspects of standards, behaviour and conduct in public life. Above all, we need simplicity and certainty in our laws, as I said recently during Second Stage of the Company Law Enforcement Bill. There is a common theme running through both these Bills with regard to the need for accountability and enforcement and, most of all, the need for the law to be clear, simple and certain, with no grey areas of doubt. That Bill also includes provisions to help in the fight against European fraud. That is very welcome, having regard to some well documented and rather frightening cases of European fraud involving an extraordinary degree of cynicism and huge sums of money. I am glad we are ratifying certain treaties and making it possible to deal with aspects of that situation.</P>
    <P>This is a small but welcome Bill, another legislative brick in place in the attempt to restore confidence in public life, which in many ways has been unfairly lost. In one sense I am sorry this is just one reform &ndash; I have already made my point in that regard. My final appeal to the Minister is that at some time in the near future we bring together the various strands of regulation so there <Col N="922" /> is one omnibus series of rules. That said, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this very important Bill. I wholeheartedly endorse all that has been said by Senator Manning. The Bill was published in January 2000 and was finally passed by the Dáil on 27 June 2001. It is important that we have it in this House at this time because of the different alleged corruptions we have seen in our profession and in other professions. I am sure the public will welcome the fact we have modern legislation in place to deal with the problems emerging in a modern society.</P>
      <P>The current law on corruption is not adequate, which is one of the reasons this Bill is being introduced. Our law on corruption is currently contained in a number of Acts as amended by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. The Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act, 1889, criminalises corruption by certain national office holders such as Ministers, as well as public and civil servants. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906, is wider in its application, though there is some overlap with the 1889 Act. It applies not only to the same categories as the 1889 Act, but also to corruption by agents, a term used in the Act to refer to any person employed by or acting for another, including those employed in public bodies. This very wide definition catches not only national office holders and public and civil servants who are covered in any event, but also applies to employees in the private sector. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1916, provides for the presumption of corruption to arise where benefits are received by persons charged with corruption in relation to public contracts.</P>
      <P>The changes made by the Ethics in Public Office Act had the effect of narrowing the range of persons previously covered by the 1906 Act and covered only specific national office holders, such as Ministers, as well as civil and public servants, while excluding others such as Members of the Dáil and Seanad, as distinct from Ministers, and judges.</P>
      <P>This legislation is much wider and covers many more people in public office than previous legislation. The Bill sets out a wide range of persons to be covered by the provisions, including employees, public servants, Members of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the DPP, judges, members of foreign parliaments, foreign office holders, members and officials of EU institutions and members of local authorities. It makes it an offence to seek or receive any benefit, whether for oneself or another person, in return for action or refraining from acting in accordance with one's position, or to give or offer any benefit for a like purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also provides for a presumption of corruption from the failure to disclose a political donation, as required under the Electoral Act, 1997, and the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, where <Col N="923" /> the donor stood to benefit from a decision of the person. It provides for a presumption of corruption in relation to the exercise of certain functions, for example, decisions on the granting of licences, sale and purchase of land and functions under the planning code, by an office holder, an official, a politician or any other individual where the office holder receives money, etc., from a person who has an interest in the exercise of those functions. It also contains a provision for the issue of search warrants by the District Court. It provides that a person may be tried in Ireland for the offence of corruption once any element of the offence takes place within the State, and criminalises corrupt acts by Irish office holders or offices committed abroad.</P>
    <P>It creates a new offence of corruption in office, for example, where an individual's actions are designed to benefit one's own family, as mentioned by the Minister. It also provides that responsibility for an offence of corruption by a body corporate can be attributed where appropriate to certain of its officers or members, a very relevant and important provision. The most important provision is that which provides for a penalty of an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment, or both, upon conviction, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the benefits internationally of this Bill being passed. It will enable us ratify a number of international conventions, including the EU convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of member states of the EU; the OECD convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions; the Council of Europe's criminal law convention on corruption, which relates to corruption of or by domestic and foreign public officials and members of domestic or foreign parliaments and other assemblies as well as corruption in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about the need to have this legislation in place to tackle corruption. Charges of corruption levied against a few have the capacity in the public mind to taint everybody engaged in public life. We have charges levelled at members of our own profession, in particular over the past number of years, but it is important to note they are a mere handful out of the hundreds who have served the country as politicians and public representatives over a number of years. However, there is a perception in the public mind, as Senator Manning said, that we are all corrupt and dishonest; we are all tarred with the same brush. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I endorse what Senator Manning said in this regard.</P>
    <P>Since coming to the House a few years ago I have been hugely impressed by the honesty, integrity and hard working manner in which people go about their business in this and the other House. That can be said about public representatives throughout the country who work <Col N="924" /> actively at local level, who are involved in community activities and who have striven on a voluntary basis up to now to work in the best interests of their communities.</P>
    <P>I also agree there can be no tolerance for corrupt practices within our political system. The law against corruption should make it clear that such activities will be subject to severe sanctions. That is why the Bill provides that the penalty to be imposed following conviction on indictment will be increased from a current fine of up to £50,000 or seven years' imprisonment, or both, to an unlimited fine or up to ten years' imprisonment, or both. Where an offence under the Bill is dealt with in the District Court, the judge may impose a fine of £2,362 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. These are very welcome provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that in international terms we are considered among the least corrupt, something we do not tell ourselves or the public often enough. It is a positive message which should come from this debate. There has been a small number of scandals here, but there have been major scandals in other countries in Europe and worldwide. We can be proud that here only a handful are sinning and that they will be dealt with by the law, and in particular by this Bill.</P>
    <P>As was said by Senator Manning, it is quite a short Bill, but it is very necessary. It contains a range of measures which copperfasten and considerably improve existing legislation on the prevention of corruption. It will also help us meet our international obligations, which is welcome. It is clear that the elimination of corrupt practices is an objective to which all parties in the House are committed and the Bill represents the best option for achieving that objective. It covers more than public office holders and in some cases can involve individuals or members of corporate bodies where, unfortunately, corruption also takes place. In defence of my own profession I often say to people that we have had allegations of corruption against a small handful of members, but we have seen the same if not a higher level of corruption across an entire range of professions, in particular over the past ten years, which is unfortunate. However, it is a fact of life and it is only in recent years we have seen these allegations coming to light. One scandal tends to lead to another. Currently the tribunals, which are going about their business in an independent way, are dealing with many scandals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It is long overdue and the public will thank us for putting it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation. Senators on all sides of the House have commented on it broadly. Like Senator Manning, I would have welcomed much more comprehensive legislation to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing today is responding to the possibility of there being low standards in high <Col N="925" /> places. We should remember that bribery and corruption is in the main a particular feature of emerging economies. It is something that occurs in countries shortly after they have achieved freedom and independence, in particular economic independence. There is the beginnings of a semblance of wealth and people feel they can begin sticking their hands in the till.</P>
    <P>Bribery and corruption take place only when society fails to be a watchdog. It takes place at a time in the development of a nation when society is self-centred and self-focused on achieving more independent and individual wealth without looking at the common good. It is, therefore, very much the business of public representatives to ensure that regulations are put in place to protect society from itself in this matter because in a society where people have to prove themselves and do their best in the circumstances in which they find themselves, there is very often a latent encouragement of bribery if that is what it takes to get the business done. That is one of the things we have seen in the tribunals in recent years.</P>
    <P>It should also be said that in a very real way bribery and corruption is an extraordinary depressant on society. We see it at present, particularly among people in public life. We hear it in discussions among Members of this House. It depresses everybody. Word of it gets out. In the past two years people have often asked me &ndash; Senator Manning and I have often discussed this &ndash; what would happen if it were proven that a certain person or people at a certain level were involved in corruption. Recently there have been major rows and scandals in many sectors of society, in the Judiciary, in political representation, in business and planning. The problem is that it tends to taint everybody within it and near it.</P>
    <P>Bribery and corruption fuel cynicism in society. It feeds into the barrow of those who always want to see the downside. It reduces confidence in public life. We hear more about that than most people. It creates inefficiencies if people can buy rather than win their way by persuading or putting forward the best programme for action because, in effect, it creates that sense of inefficiency. It rewards incompetence. It puts people in a position of not having to deliver. It puts them in the position of being incompetent but able to bribe their way to achieving their financial objectives and rewards, and it discourages investment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan correctly said that there is an international league table of corrupt, incorrupt and marginally corrupt countries and I regret to say that according to the most recent figures we have jumped up that league in the past two years for reasons of which we are well aware. It was in <i>The Economist</i> and not in <i>The Irish Catholic </i>or any other publication that deals with issues of public or private morality that I read that. The view is that nations that are subject to bribery and corruption are ones in which large companies, <Col N="926" /> multinational companies, significant companies of stature, will not wish to invest.</P>
    <P>It also encourages criminality because the fact that people can buy rather than win their way through fair competition makes it attractive for people to break the law, to ensure that people in decision-making areas can be bought or approached at some low point in their lives and encouraged to do the wrong thing. It brings a nation to a point of moral bankruptcy and we are seeing that at present. It is what worries senior people in these Houses. This is not about somebody taking £100,000 or £200,000, or even £1 million. It is about the impact, the deadening, dampening effect it has on the whole nation. It devastates the reputation of a nation.</P>
    <P>As it fuels cynicism, reduces confidence in public life, creates inefficiencies, rewards incompetence, discourages investment and encourages criminality, bribery and corruption bring a nation to the point of moral bankruptcy and devastate the nation's international reputation. Those are the reasons this legislation is before us today. It is more than we can allow to have a nation whose State is subject to bribery and corruption. We have seen the importance of public confidence in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the Shannon scheme which is a reflection of where we were at the birth of this State, when people with entrepreneurial gifts and talents and people in public service and political life got together, took risks, made a plan, worked out a strategy and employed the correct tactics to ensure we moved forward. We had great national movements at that time, the Shannon scheme being perhaps the one that represents all that was good in Irish life. In the 1930s, 1940s and late 1950s, when a civil servant of the stature of Dr. Ken Whitaker could sit down with a politician of the stature of Seán Lemass, deal with public life and put forward various plans for economic expansion, the best in Irish society was demonstrated. It was only when we started to create wealth, when we reached the stage that there was disposable wealth in the nation over the past two decades, that people suddenly felt they could grab it and we moved into a new period in the development of our State, that bribery and corruption became rife.</P>
    <P>It was only within the past 15 years that a Taoiseach, in a throw-away remark in the United States, stated that income taxation was still a bit of a novelty in Ireland. It was a joke but, given what we are now seeing at the tribunals, perhaps it was not that much of a joke. Many people felt they were above the taxation system. I am not referring to somebody on the dole repairing a couple of punctures at the end of a lane in a provincial town to make a few shillings to buy a few pints on a Saturday night. I am talking about people who had a structured approach to bribery and corruption, to not paying their tax, to bribing senior people to ensure that tax regimes suited their needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> We have seen what happened in the planning area. I imagine we will never know the whole comprehensive nature of the bribery and corruption that drove many planning decisions in this State. That became endemic in the system in many places and there were people on both sides of the line who considered that what they were doing was the norm. On the building entrepreneurial side there were those who felt that the only way to get something done was to shove a few shillings here or there. On the other side of the line there were people who felt it was all right to do that because everybody else was doing it. That is why, in introducing legislation to prevent corruption, we must not be seen to be &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo;. None of us is so clean that we have not done something wrong in our lives in one way or other. That is not what this is all about. This is not about claiming the high moral ground.</P>
    <P>What is good about this legislation is that it has the support of all parties, and nobody, whether a member of a party or an Independent, is claiming to be more entitled to speak than others. We have a responsibility to ensure that the reputation of this State is rooted in a fair and open system of government in which people can have trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>There is also a related issue emerging at this time. We have had a discussion about moving public sector industry to privatisation. People would hold forth in the pub on a Saturday night on the inefficiencies of the State sector, whether as regards Aer Lingus and the cost of its tickets before competition or the problems with the railways or the buses. Maybe these complaints were true but we should put them aside for a moment. There were other matters about which we did not think at the time. We did not think about whether we could be certain that every State regulation was upheld by the State sector. We did not remember, for instance, that all health and safety requirements were met in full. We did not have to worry about money going astray in those areas as everything was done properly.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the latest issue which has arisen in the UK with the privatisation of the transport area and the privatisation of Railtrack. We have seen a series of accidents in the UK and when they have been investigated, it has been found that, in the interests of profit, people failed to meet health and safety requirements and put lives at risk and caused people to lose their lives. That is one of the reasons we have to be careful.</P>
    <P>In regard to what is happening at the tribunals, these people were trying to get their hands on what were the jewels in the State crown, public industry, which they could get for a song or for a couple of hundred thousand pounds through offshore accounts. They tried to get a hold of what was, effectively, a licence to print money. Perhaps it is unfair to say this in a discussion on corruption but when I spoke this morning about the broadband facility, I was thinking about the west. If <Col N="928" /> broadband is to be made available to the west, the only way it can be delivered is through the copper wire system of Eircom. The only alternative to that is for people to put fibre optic cable throughout the country. They will put fibre optic cable into central Dublin, Limerick, Galway and the other big centres, but they will not bring it to Dunquin, Rossaveal or Killybegs. We are about to see a down side.</P>
    <P>The fixed line business of Eircom is about to be bought by one company. It will have a complete monopoly. We will be back here in five years time when people will ask why they cannot have broadband in their part of the country or their constituency. Not much can be done about it here unless the State decides to buy it back. That is one of the reasons we have to be careful about how we move forward.</P>
    <P>In talking about the need to control corruption and bribery, I take the opportunity to look at the work that has been done recently by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance &ndash; I would be its greatest critic in many other ways &ndash; and by public companies. We, in this House, have seen what we are prepared to do. Public representatives in both Houses are required to make a declaration of interest, to declare from where their funding comes and how they manage to operate. This legislation ensures that issues of bribery and corruption are dealt with in others areas of the life of the State.</P>
    <P>We are touching the tip of an iceberg with this legislation. A lot more requires to be done but this is a step in the right direction. This is the way we want to go and it is good that it has the support of all sides. I am sure some could identify changes which could be made or things that could have been done differently. The message should go out, if anyone wants to listen, that we are cleaning up operations and are trying to create an environment in which bribery and corruption will find no place and will be properly punished and treated with absolute opposition by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contribution to the debate on this important measure to combat bribery and corruption. The Bill represents one important measure in the Government's strategy to put in place a code for the behaviour of those engaged in public life. Its focus is on tackling bribery and corruption. Other measures include the Local Government Bill and the Standard in Public Office Bill and they will be further supplemented by measures to provide greater transparency in public life. As Senator John Cregan said, we should not lose sight of the fact that by international standards, Ireland is not perceived as having a problem in this area. However, that is not to say we have no problem at all. The challenge for us is to provide the mechanisms to identify the practices that could amount to corruption in the first place and to detect them when they <Col N="929" /> occur. We must be constantly vigilant in this regard. If there are gaps in our laws, we must fill them. The Bill will ensure there are no such gaps.</P>
      <P>The Bill brings anti-corruption legislation up to date so that it meets current challenges. I acknowledge our present law in this area stretches back a long way and, therefore, the changes contained in the Bill will have the desired effect of dealing appropriately with those who fall below the standards demanded of us.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier that as well as improving on present anti-corruption laws, the Bill will allow Ireland to fulfil its international obligations by enabling ratification of three important conventions against corruption under the auspices of the EU, the OECD and the Council of Europe. I also mentioned earlier that the Bill represents one element of the Government's determination to ensure that the highest standards in public office are maintained. Other proposals in this regard include those which will require public representatives to have special accounts for political donations, proposals to limit the size of donations, protection of whistleblowers and regulation of lobbyists. Taken together all these measures will provide us with a comprehensive code for proper behaviour of public representatives and officials.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning was concerned about the delay in getting the Bill to this stage. Part of the delay was due to the fact that the Government undertook a major reassessment of our code of ethics for those engaged in public life. Arising from that reassessment, the Government proposed two new sections to the Bill &ndash; which are now sections 3 and 4 &ndash; and they provide for presumptions of corruption in certain circumstances. The Bill is a better one for that and I am pleased it is a comprehensive response to the issue of corruption.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Manning's positive comments about what we are trying to achieve in the Bill. Perhaps it is, in some way, a testament to the general lack of corruption in public life and public service that we have not felt the need to update legislation which dates back to the 19th century. Nevertheless, we do not live in wonderland and it is necessary to ensure that the law will be responsive to modern conditions. Part of the reason for the Bill is to meet international commitments as much as to update it for our own domestic purposes.</P>
      <P>I accept Senators' concerns that anti-corruption provisions are contained in a number of Acts. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated on a number of occasions that the various Acts will be assembled and that they will be published as a restatement of the law on corruption under the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill when the latter is enacted. A commitment has been given that anti-corruption Acts will be contained in such a restatement at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Senator O'Toole is quite right that corruption is endemic in poorer or emerging states. A recently published index of the state of corruption in various countries revealed that corruption is linked to poverty. Countries like Finland are considered least corrupt while countries such as Bangladesh and Nigeria are considered most corrupt. It is a vicious circle in that poverty breeds bribery and corruption which lead to a failure of confidence among international communities which perpetrates poverty.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning when he drew an important analogy for us about the danger that all politicians will be considered corrupt. He said that the very person who might make such an accusation would say that their local politician, who they know well, is hard working and honest. It is important that we always bear this in mind, that is, the difficulty of all of us being tarred with the one brush. That was precisely the point I tried to make in my opening speech &ndash; that allegations against some would be read by the public as an indication of a general malaise in public life. Most of us would consider this very offensive and would wish to take the steps necessary to prevent it. The Government has moved to put in place a code of ethics for public life, with particular reference to public representatives.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to bribery and corruption in the planning process. Section 4 provides for a presumption to arise in certain circumstances concerning decisions under the planning code where a person is being prosecuted for corruption. Where such a presumption arises, the burden will shift to the accused person to show a transaction was not corrupt. Such provisions are intended to aid the prosecution of corruption offences and recognise that in some cases the accused should be required to show that certain transactions were not corrupt. Most people will recognise the benefit of this provision.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement among Members that effective legislative anti-corruption measures are required and the Bill will effectively address this issue. I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State and thank her for her attendance in the House today. I urge her to bear in mind the points made by Senator O'Toole and me on the urgent need for some form of comprehensive, omnibus legislation to deal with all aspects of public life. Such legislation operates effectively in other countries. The Minister may wish to examine the model operated in Germany in which a <Col N="931" /> political party Act covers all aspects of electoral law, the behaviour of political parties during election campaigns and their role within parliament. The legislation also acknowledges, as we are now acknowledging for the first time, that political parties are important sociological institutions which, while they must obey certain rules, play a vital part in a State's political life and, therefore, should be adequately funded in terms of research, educational work and other activities which comprise a legitimate part of the political process. Perhaps the Minister of State would convey our views to the Minister and urge him to commence work in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter. I raise it to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the position that has developed in Roscommon town with the closure and loss of jobs at Precision Castings and to consider establishing a special task force to promote alternative job creation in the area.</P>
      <P>Precision Castings has been in Roscommon town since 1976. Up until now it has employed approximately 42 people. Those people are about to be dumped on the unemployment list. This is a major blow not only to the town of the Roscommon where an industrial job has not been created for over ten years but to the employees and their families. Some of the employees have been with the company for 25 years and others were relatively new to it. They will be out of a job and they and their families will suffer the loss of an income.</P>
      <P>It is the general opinion of the people of the town of Roscommon that the Government statutory agency, the IDA, has neglected and failed to respond to the calls made over a period for an advance factory and industrial jobs to be created in Roscommon. We are facing the crisis of a loss of 42 jobs and there is no alternative employment. As an immediate measure I call for the establishing of a special task force to promote alternative job creation in that area. That is the minimum that is required at this time.</P>
      <P>Local statutory agencies such as Roscommon County Council and voluntary agencies such as the chamber of commerce are willing and available to assist such a task force. There is a vacant advance factory in the local industrial estate. It has been vacant for the past ten to 12 years. At a time when jobs are being provided all over the country, it is beyond belief that this fine facility which could accommodate any major pharmaceutical industry has been left vacant all that time. A factory owned by Roscommon County Council has also lain idle. The Minister of State will be able to appreciate the anger among the people in the town of Roscommon at the closure of its oldest industry and the fact that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the IDA collectively have failed to respond to the calls to provide industrial jobs in the town.</P>
      <P>I have led deputations and made representations to the Minister of State's office where I outlined our requests. I have brought representatives of the chamber of commerce and the county council, both elected and at executive level, to his office to highlight and explain our basic requests. While we have had encouraging words from the Department and the IDA, nothing has come of our efforts. We have reached a crisis regarding industrial and manufacturing jobs in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> It has been brought home to me that urgent action is needed. I am here to explain to the Minister of State that the people of Roscommon are not prepared to be treated as second class citizens. They are entitled to their just share of the national cake at this time. It must be explained in detail to the industrial authority that all its efforts and energies must be focused on County Roscommon, particularly on the town of Roscommon.</P>
    <P>More than 2,000 applications for planning permission have been made to the local authority this year, many of them by young couples who want to set up home. The agencies given statutory responsibility for providing employment have failed to respond to the town of Roscommon. It is of no comfort to the people of the town that decisions have been made which we all welcome regarding the BMW region, of which we are pleased to be part, and the Shannon tax corridor, which is helpful to the northern half of the county. It is of no comfort to the people of Roscommon that not alone are no new jobs being created there but some of the existing ones will be lost.</P>
    <P>At a time when we hear that the city of Dublin is bursting at the seams and can no longer contain its population due to the economic activity taking place there, one can understand the anger and frustration of the people of the town of Roscommon about the current position. These people demand special attention. I hope that in response to this matter an early decision will be made to set up a special task force, that such a task force will involve local and national statutory agencies and incorporate voluntary bodies that are willing to help and that as a result a major decision will be made in favour of the town of Roscommon to locate industrial and manufacturing jobs there in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. As he will know, I am very much aware of the town and its surrounding area and the importance of this matter, having spent my early days in neighbouring County Galway.</P>
      <P>The closure of Precision Castings will be a big disappointment to the people of Roscommon town and the surrounding area. I fully appreciate the concern experienced by the redundant employees and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the situation, the problems for the workers in the company revolved primarily around a pay issue. The union representing the workers submitted a claim which was outside the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The claim was rejected by the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The union then voted for an all out strike which commenced on 11 June last. With the strike still <Col N="934" /> continuing, the company felt it had no option but to cease manufacturing with the loss of 42 jobs. The closure will take effect from 27 July 2001.</P>
    <P>As Senator Finneran pointed out, Precision Castings has been operating in Roscommon for 25 years. It is the longest established manufacturing industry in the town. The company manufactures precision steel castings for a variety of markets and most of the production is exported.</P>
    <P>Last August the company lost a major customer to competition from the Far East. This was a serious setback and resulted in changes in overtime and shift working. The union pursued a claim for its members, which was in addition to the current national wage agreement. No agreement could be reached at local level or at the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The case went to the Labour Court last February and a recommendation was issued. The Labour Court rejected the claim and recommended that the company should set about drawing up plans for a &ldquo;gain sharing scheme&rdquo;. Due to health and safety regulations the company also needed to invest in lifting equipment. The Labour Court acknowledged that this was necessary for the company to remain viable. However, the company could not make the necessary investment while the wage issue was unresolved and yesterday's closure announcement was the culmination of these events.</P>
    <P>The question of a task force for County Roscommon also arose earlier this year when Roscommon County Council asked the Tánaiste to establish a task force for employment creation in the county. Last February, the Tánaiste said the development agencies under the aegis of her Department were fully committed to the promotion of employment in the county, which forms part of the Border, midlands and western region, a priority location for jobs promotion by the agencies. The agencies also work closely with local development bodies, including Roscommon County Development Board and the county council as well as other local bodies and interests, to facilitate an integrated approach to development in the area. In those circumstances, the Tánaiste did not consider it necessary to appoint a job creation task force for the county.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a focused agency approach combined with a local based approach to address the jobs situation make it unnecessary to establish a specific task force for County Roscommon. This would only serve to add an additional layer over the combined and committed efforts of the local organisations which work effectively together. I appreciate Senator Finneran's remarks. Roscommon is part of the BMW region and I can give the Senator an assurance, on behalf of myself and the Tánaiste, that we will monitor developments closely to ensure the current serious problems surrounding this closure are dealt with urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Minister is accustomed to visiting this House to debate matters I have raised on the Adjournment in relation to transport in north Dublin. It is said that the role of a Minister is important in the life of the country so I am sure she is gratified to realise she is such an important figure in north County Dublin, not that she needed reminding.</P>
      <P>The motion requests the Minister to outline the options that were considered by Aer Rianta and the Department prior to the decision to proceed with the new east-west runway at Dublin Airport, which will have major negative consequences not only for the surrounding area but particularly for the communities resident there. I am not opposed to development. In fact, I am much in favour of it but implicit in the use of the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; should be quality, balance and propriety for the environment in which the development is to take place. In that regard, the proposed development at Dublin Airport is open to question. Balance does not simply mean balance in the context of the development of the area we are discussing but should also apply in the context of potential spin off development in other areas where existing development should be controlled to a greater degree.</P>
      <P>The area of north County Dublin or Fingal has a long tradition of receiving visitors from overseas; it does not date from when the airport was built. It received the Danes in 795 who were defeated in Clontarf in 1014. It is interesting that the area of Fingal derives its title from the old Gaelic words Fionn Gall, which means a fair stranger. That indicates the long history of the area in welcoming strangers. Now it welcomes them not by sea, as was the case for several hundred years, but by air. They currently number 14 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport is the single dominant feature in north County Dublin. The airport provides more than 20,000 jobs. The current traffic of 14 million passengers is projected to increase to 20 million over the next five years. One cringes to think of that figure but we are told that the campus is capable of dealing with 40 million passengers per annum, subject to the necessary buildings and structures being put in place. That is treble the existing level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta's current plan is to build a second runway running parallel to the east-west runway. That runway caters for 90% of traffic at the airport at present, which represents 44 aircraft movements per hour from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day of the year, with the exception of Christmas Day. Local communities, particularly those of Portmarnock and St. Margaret's, are beginning to ask questions about the nature of the development taking place at Collinstown, as it is known, <Col N="936" /> and whether it should proceed solely at the behest of the market or whether the views of those living locally, who have admittedly benefited hugely from the presence of such a fine industrial complex, should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The views of the residents, as distinct from those directly or indirectly employed at Dublin Airport, should be taken on board. Existing development at the airport has many hidden side effects. In addition to noise pollution, particularly over the Portmarnock area, there is the serious problem of flooding. Much of it is due to the absence of natural soakage because of the extensive tarmac development at the airport for air traffic and the phenomenal use of many acres of ground for car parking because of the lack of appropriate transport infrastructure for access to the facility.</P>
    <P>In the last census, the community of Portmarnock had the highest rate of family occupancy of any community in the country at 89%. A significant number of people in the community work at Dublin Airport and, as such, are more conscious than most of the necessity for balance in the development of the airport. It has now reached the stage where they are beginning to say stop.</P>
    <P>The projected increase in passenger traffic through the airport from 14 million to 40 million is a horrific thought. Even the increase from 14 million to 20 million passengers over the next five years is sobering, particularly given the absence of real change in access infrastructure especially with regard to light rail. The plans are there and work is on schedule. I am aware things are going well in that regard but the bottom line is that passenger numbers will reach 20 million before that vital element of infrastructure will be in place.</P>
    <P>The residents' principal difficulty is with the noise levels at the airport and the fact that the construction of this alternative runway, as proposed, in direct parallel with the main east-west runway, will simply over a short period serve to facilitate the doubling of the difficulties, particularly the noise pollution. This noise pollution is causing severe difficulties in the Portmarnock area, not only early in the morning and late at night but also throughout the day.</P>
    <P>The question which arises and which needs to be looked at is the national strategy for the development of our aviation facilities. It is an issue which I have raised in the House previously in the context of the outstanding opportunity presented by the proposed sale of Gormanston Aerodrome. That facility is well served by existing infrastructure and it would take relatively little to develop it as a major facility.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is there is a real need for a second airport servicing Dublin. It need not be within immediate access of the city, when one considers that Beauvais serves Paris and Charleroi serves Brussels. Without mentioning it by <Col N="937" /> name, a certain airline has made huge profits on the demand for low cost travel, which need not be from the centre of one city to the centre of another as had been the case in the past. Recently I read of a suggestion for the possible development of an airport facility at Portlaoise, and I see nothing wrong with that. The point I want to make is that, like the vast majority of people in Ireland, I am in favour of development but we must get a sense of balance and perspective. Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Ryanair and all the companies working at Dublin Airport have been good for Fingal but the time has come to ask if further development <i>per se</i> is good for Fingal.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments. I thank her again for coming to the House to respond to this motion regarding these infrastructural difficulties we are experiencing in north County Dublin. Unfortunately these difficulties are not going away and it does not look as if they will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to be here and I apologise for my delay. We were watching the screen but never thought that the preceding motion would end as quickly as it did. That shows the efficiency of the House. I spent four hours here this morning and here I am again.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Glennon for tabling this motion. I am glad to come here not only to reply but to debate with him. I hope we can have a further meeting on the matter next week.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, proposals regarding the development of the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta which has, under the 1998 Act, statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports. Aer Rianta is currently engaged in a review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. That review is being carried out in consultation with the stakeholders, including airlines and other business customers and local residents. The plan will determine the key requirements in terms of future development of infrastructural facilities.</P>
      <P>Planning for a second parallel runway at Dublin Airport goes back as far as the 1960s when Aer Rianta acquired the lands by CPO. At that time there were 2 million passengers going through Dublin Airport and, as Senator Glennon stated, now there are 14 million. Clearly the eventual growth to such numbers and beyond was foreseen and the necessary provision was made to accommodate that growth.</P>
      <P>The provision of a second parallel runway at Dublin Airport has featured in Aer Rianta's long-term plans for about 40 years. It has also featured in the local authorities' development plans for almost 30 years when, in 1972, the then county council included the runway in the county development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> While there have been suggestions that a new runway is not required and that adequate capacity exists within the existing runway network, Aer Rianta informs me that, on the basis of its current growth projections and capacity studies, a new runway will be required by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has, of course, pursued a policy of maximising the utilisation of the existing runway network and continues to do so. In addition, the decision last year to designate Dublin Airport as a co-ordinated airport and to appoint Airports Co-ordination Limited as slot co-ordinators is serving, among other things, to extract maximum use of the existing runways.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has appointed an environmental impact consultant to assess the environmental implications of the proposed new runway. While this environmental impact assessment is an essential part of the planning process, I believe it will also be extremely useful and informative in itself in that it will lead to a much greater understanding of the issues involved and clarify for all interested parties, including local communities, the impacts and implications of expanding runway capacity at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>In this regard, by the end of this year Aer Rianta will install and commission noise and flight track monitoring equipment which will provide precise measurements of the noise generated by all arriving and departing aircraft at Dublin Airport as well as monitoring and recording the track or flight path flown by these aircraft. I understand that Aer Rianta will make the data from this monitoring system available to the local communities and to the planning authority. It would be my belief that it would be important that such data be independently assessed.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is the country's main airport. As Senator Glennon stated, Dublin Airport is highly significant in terms of the local economy of the north side of Dublin. I know the Senator understands that but it is necessary to say so because sometimes when one gets letters from people, one would think that the runway was to be built the following morning, whereas it is proposed for the end of the decade which is nine years away. Clearly planning permission would have to be sought and obtained, and we all know that that is a difficult process. The planning process will provide the appropriate forum for all interested parties to have their views heard and taken into account by the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>The Senator has spoken to me about this matter. I am arranging for a review to be carried out of the regional airports which will address, <i>inter alia</i>, the potential for growth and further development of these airports. This review, subject to the approval of the Government contracts committee, will be undertaken by Dr. Anthony Foley, who is a senior lecturer in Dublin City University. He has written extensively on the general issues of Irish industrial development, spatial strategy <Col N="939" /> and transport and he has undertaken several policy related projects. I hope to have the outcome of that review in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Senator Glennon has long been a clear advocate in this House of balanced development and he has put forward the need for the metro and Luas. I am happy to tell him that the plans for the metro have been brought forward and in the autumn we will be able to announce the number of groups which have expressed interest in it.</P>
    <P>However, he is correct in one regard. Like the Senator, I shudder when I hear blithe statements about passenger throughput of 40 million by 2020. By then, the Luas, the metro and various bus services will be in place and I cannot see how a city the size of Dublin, irrespective of the transport infrastructure provided, could cope with more than the doubling of passenger throughputs. One must remember that there will not be passenger throughput of 20 million until 2005 or 2006, and these figures are based only on projections. While one would like to move forward in some respects with heady objectives, I do not think that rate of growth can continue.</P>
    <P>We are a small island nation, delighted to have the airport and the current levels of economic activity. Aer Rianta's belief that the facility will be needed by 2010 gives time for an assessment. It is too early to assess the likely growth for this <Col N="940" /> year, although it is unlikely that it will be as high as in previous years in view of such factors as the decline in American economic activity and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. My remarks should not be considered negative but balanced and realistic.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep a close interest in this matter. Even with inflated projections, the facility will not be required until the end of the decade. There is a long process ahead, including the assessment of noise emissions and the co-ordination of slots. The long sought developments at the airport will come together at the end of January 2002 when it will be a much needed joined up airport. I applaud Aer Rianta for its approach and its management of a fine facility.</P>
    <P>The review of the regional airports could be most interesting, especially if there were proposals for channelling traffic in their direction. They are very fine airports and are doing good business. I will take a personal interest in the growth figures for this year. They could provide a basis for further debate on when additional improvements are necessary. These will also be based on the projection compiled at the end of this year and the full operation of all the new facilities and their likely impact on coping with additional numbers. At that stage and when the study of the regional airports has been completed we can produce a policy on the matter.</P>
