    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re increasing membership of An Bord Pleanála, to be taken without debate; Nos. 2 and 3, motions re the protection of young persons in employment in licensed premises and bar apprentices, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re the Flood tribunal, to be taken without debate; No. 5, Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 6, Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 7, Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to. I thank the Leader for providing an explanatory note on the changes regarding the Flood tribunal and this explanation is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The report on the Arms Trial will be published today. Will the Leader make time available tomorrow for a debate on the matter? Such a debate will be held in the Dáil and there is a long-standing commitment that the House would hold a short debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more serious matter, we all thought the days were over when we would have to condemn one sectarian murder after another in Northern Ireland. However, sadly and tragically we have to do so again this morning following the brutal murder of Ciaran Cummings, an innocent and decent young man who was brutally murdered in cold blood solely because he was a Catholic. The loyalists who carried out this foul deed must be brought to justice and placed behind bars with no <Col N="1078" /> prospect of any future amnesty. This will be cold comfort for the relatives of Ciaran Cummings, but it is the least we can ask of the authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have our good wishes as they face into another wearying set of negotiations. The scene is not hopeful. The recent Westminster elections showed a society which is more sectarian than, perhaps, ever before &ndash; even at the beginning of the troubles. In many ways this sectarianism has become politicised and institutionalised. The centre ground of the political scene is smaller and less fashionable than ever and there is evidence of loyalist terror and republican racketeering. There has been no move to hand over illegally held arms and the Good Friday Agreement is unimplemented in many key areas. The prospects are bleak.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister deserve the support of every Member of both Houses and all the people on this island as they face into a daunting, difficult and wearying task. The task will not be easy and, no matter what happens, is thankless. However, we must wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning's words remind us that there are those in Northern Ireland who do not want peace. The fact that a teenager was so brutally done to death in such a planned and contrived manner is a reminder to us all that we must strive harder in the days, weeks and years ahead. This is particularly the case this week as the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister meet. Our hearts are with them and they have our support. Almost everyone on this island is with them in their efforts.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire about the census which was delayed or postponed because of foot and mouth disease? It has been mentioned that the census will be held next year instead but economists value the usefulness of regular censuses. In the 1970s it was decided to cancel one census for economic reasons but it would be of more benefit to hold the census this year rather than next year. It was interesting to hear the Northern Ireland Minister, Mark Durkan, talking about the benefits of their census information in trying to decide upon designating areas of deprivation and how they can change. It can be of huge value to have such information readily available. The Leader should urge those responsible not to delay the census unnecessarily. I make this request not for the sake of history but for sound economic reasons. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the good wishes that have been expressed to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in the talks that are now reaching crisis point. As we have seen in recent days, the situation has deteriorated ever since the resignation of the First Minister, Mr. Trimble. It comes at the worst possible time with the marching season upon us. We are at the height of a crisis with violence, <Col N="1079" /> marches, parades and now fatalities. We are at one of the most serious stages since the Good Friday Agreement. I add my support for the work being undertaken. I hope we will be able to come to a satisfactory resolution without further deterioration into outright violence. </P>
      <P>May I also raise the issue of bullying? It appears that the majority of calls to Parentline concern bullying of teenagers by teenagers. This understated violence being perpetrated by youngsters on each other is becoming increasingly worrying. It is also becoming increasingly more apparent because in the past it was not a matter that was spoken of; it was almost a secret infliction of suffering imposed on vulnerable young victims. The Leader should bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the number of motions coming before the House daily without debate. Some of them are extremely important. The Leader of the House has begun to circulate a memorandum explaining the information he has concerning these issues. However, these motions are ideal opportunities for us to discuss issues such as increasing the number of members of tribunals or regulations concerning young people working in public houses. Such regulations refer to matters of current public concern. Trotting through these motions every morning without any debate does not do justice to the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Costello queried the rise in the television licence fee. I would welcome a debate on the value of RTÉ's programmes and particularly the mess it made of the recent &ldquo;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&rdquo; programme. I read in today's newspaper that there is a question over whether the answer to Shane O'Doherty's question last Sunday night was correct. We should also discuss the cost of sending Charlie Bird around the world on unnecessary trips or missions. Are they justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these points can be made in the debate the Senator is seeking. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to believe one tenth of what is being said in the press, and by the media generally, about Aer Lingus we should have a debate on the subject. Last week I sought a discussion on Aer Lingus. I realise we are coming to the end of this session but serious questions must be asked about what is going on in that company. If it is not possible for this House to discuss it, then the relevant committee should do so. The House has to state what needs to be said. The press is informing us but the relevant Minister does not seem to be doing anything and neither do we, although we represent the public. It is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eircom is another example. The House pushed strongly to make sure that extra benefits would <Col N="1080" /> be given to the workforce in Eircom. However, for the past week we have seen extra offers being made to make sure that prices will increase generally for the shareholders. I am not carrying a flag for any shareholders but it is a serious matter. The House pushed for the Eircom workforce to receive an extra 5% as individuals, yet 14.9% of the shareholders are now dictating their commitment to Valentia which has already admitted it is quite prepared to sell it again. I find that very disturbing because this House gave the benefits to the workforce. I do not wish to knock them but it would be wrong not to mention this matter on the record of the House. </P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate at an early date on politics and where the political system is going? There is a need for us to address the problems we have as politicians and the public perception of politics. We should have a debate on this matter to get across to the public what politics means and what the policies are. There is a measure of public cynicism which is not being addressed by politicians or the Houses of the Oireachtas. We should have a good overall debate on this subject which does not concern party politics but policy. We should address the reasons the public has become so cynical about politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We passed the Standards in Public Office Bill yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the problems in the North, including murders. We must equally address the fact that we have quite a number of cowards in this jurisdiction who direct many of the actions in the North of Ireland. We must condemn them if we condemn people who live in the other jurisdiction. The people who are dictating much of what happens in the North are living in the safety and comfort of this jurisdiction. We must condemn them absolutely. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything Senator Manning said concerning the horrific murder. I wish the Taoiseach all the best in his negotiations on the sad situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have had guidelines for bullying in schools and it is now time to have a debate on the issue in general, particularly bullying in the workplace. It is unfortunate that the summer recess is coming and we will not be able to discuss it until we resume. </P>
      <P>I have constantly raised the need for a debate on the National Roads Authority which is a hot issue. We should include in the debate the question of funding public private partnerships and what the Government's position is on tolls. Who exactly has the power to impose tolls? Where do the responsibilities of local authorities lie in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to attend the House to provide an update on what <Col N="1081" /> the State agencies under her control are doing for employment in County Donegal, particularly in my constituency of South-West Donegal? The Minister has done tremendous work in trying to correct what happened in Fruit of the Loom, but the concentration has been solely on Letterkenny and Inishowen up to this. There was an announcement yesterday that 85 workers are to be laid off in the Herdsman factory in Ballybofey in three months and that some of their co-workers in Sion Mills, just across the Border, are also to suffer the same fate. A loss like that to Ballybofey would be equivalent to over 1,000 jobs&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot tour every town in Donegal South-West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>A loss of that number in Ballybofey is equivalent to at least 1,000 in any large town or city. If the former Senator, Paddy McGowan, God rest him, were here today, Senators would have to listen to much more than I have to say. The Finn Valley area has been totally neglected by all State agencies and I am not prepared to stand by without the problem being redressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Manning's utter revulsion at the appalling sectarian murder of a young Catholic man in the North yesterday. He was cold-bloodedly murdered because of his religion. A young man at the side of the street waiting for his lift to work was the easiest target the perpetrators could find. It signals how far we have to travel before we obtain true democracy as we understand it in the North.</P>
      <P>There is a number of issues outstanding with regard to the post office network, which I understood the Government was showing some willingness to address. However, sadly nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>The Leader agreed when Senator Manning and I asked for a debate on the Flynn report, but we have not had it. I again ask the Leader to use his good offices to urge the appropriate Minister to straighten out the matters that urgently need to be addressed before we find the post office network dwindling further in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish the Taoiseach well in his talks in light of the latest tragedy. I support the many calls for a debate in the autumn session on the future of the NRA and its relationship to local authorities. </P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; is being thrown out and it needs to be debated. What does it mean? That matter deserves a full day's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Lanigan in his call for a debate on the role of politics today. Coupled with that is our thinking on the role of establishments, including the church and politics. A debate is necessary on why we are being sidelined. That should be one of the priorities. It has been said <Col N="1082" /> on the streets but we have not made any effort here to try to tease out what is going wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call, made yesterday and again today, for a debate on RTÉ before we go into the summer recess, arising from the Minister's decision on the licence fee. A very serious crisis has arisen in this national institution. RTÉ as a public service broadcaster is funded by the State. There needs to be a statement by the Minister. There are calls this morning for the whole RTÉ authority to resign <i>en masse</i>. There are threats that several serving journalists and contributors in RTÉ might do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fear of that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the benches opposite find this very sensitive for some reason. There is a very serious issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We would welcome a debate on RTÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should come into this House next week, before the recess, and make a comprehensive statement. I take it she will be making statements in the other House today because she is scheduled to take Question Time.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent referenda, two proposals put to the people were passed. One related to the constitutional ban on the death penalty and the other was to approve the International Criminal Court. Observers of what is taking place in The Hague in recent days are reminded of the value of an international criminal court, albeit one only dealing with the former Yugoslavia. The people have addressed the constitutional issue and it is now up to these Houses to bring forward the necessary legislation so that we can ratify the ICC. The United Nations is waiting for 60 countries to ratify and the road is clear for us to do so. I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>There was always significant support for the total abolition of the death penalty in this House. I think legislation is necessary as a result of the referendum decision and I would like to see that brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a young man with his whole life before him could be selected at random and brutally murdered just because of where he lived defies human comprehension in any civilised society. This tribalism underlines the difficulty and the supreme challenges facing everybody trying to save the Good Friday Agreement and make it work. This Agreement is the will of the people and it behoves all public representatives to leave their bunkers and stay in their positions of leadership to work on ensuring that this Agreement will not be sundered. As <Col N="1083" /> everybody in this House knows, the alternative is absolutely frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views on this horrific murder. The victim came from a mixed area and therefore it is most likely that those who killed him must have known who he was, and he was not picked out at random. This makes it even more horrific. Of course we wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister well. However, the one Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas who could influence a decision by a body that has promised to decommission arms should be requested and instructed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas to carry out the mandate about which he and his party talk so much and deliver on a promise they made. I say that as one who worked very hard with people associated with the republican movement in Northern Ireland in the 1980s when it was unfashionable to do so. They have got 90% of what they wished for and it is time they delivered something that they no longer object to in principle. They have accepted the principle of putting arms beyond use. I suspect they want to keep their little army in abeyance to use it as an enforcer for their law and order nonsense down here. How can they threaten criminals all over the Republic if they no longer have arms? It is time they delivered on that issue.</P>
      <P>We desperately need a debate on the public sector, not necessarily just in the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it would be a good place to start. I no longer understand what is Government policy on the public sector. One of the country's most successful public enterprises has been humiliated by the Government &ndash; we had the debacle of Eircom and now RTÉ, chaired by one of the country's most successful businessmen, is being told by civil servants that its business plan is not up to scratch. If Mr. Wright is not capable of putting together a business plan, having been a successful executive of Smurfit for the past 20 years, nobody is capable of it. The future of RTÉ desperately needs to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland's annual report was published recently and Mr. Dorgan states it will establish areas of excellence throughout the country. Is there a change of Government policy on the BMW region whereby it will be favoured by new enterprises? That seems to be at variance with what Mr. Dorgan said. I, therefore, call for a debate on Enterprise Ireland, its future policy, Government policy and the BMW region and request that the Leader ask the Tánaiste to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene because I have had a private rule for many years not to respond to individual tragedies and what we used to call the politics of atrocity. However, I was moved by Senator Manning's remarks. I would have been content to leave it at that but as <Col N="1084" /> I live in the area, I express my thanks to fellow Senators for their deeply felt concern for the worries, troubles and sufferings of the people there.</P>
      <P>Peace has a very difficult birthing and we do not expect to move from conflict to absolute calm with ease. Like everyone else, I commend the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and wish them well but, as Senator Ó Murchú said, there is a need for people to lead, not rely on legalistic interpretations of agreements, the meaning of which we all know. The republican movement has had difficulties. I know what it has meant to it to open up its arsenals to inspection but the one thing that would utterly transform how things stand would be a definitive declaration that the war was over and the putting of weapons out of use permanently. I hope that degree of leadership is shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and amused to hear Members calling for a debate on politics and the political system in view of the fact that for the last two days this House debated the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000. That was a golden opportunity for Members to make their views known but regrettably very few contributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot but be affected by the moving statement made by Senator Hayes. As someone who lives in Northern Ireland, it had an effect on him. The rest of us come from other parts of the island and one can only hope the comments made here today will carry some weight with those who have the decisions to make.</P>
      <P>In the context of Senator Burke's remarks about the BMW region, will the Leader convey some good news to the Tánaiste? It has been announced that those over 50 years of age will be allowed to continue on community employment schemes. This issue has been exercising the minds of those of us from the BMW region, and those from Dublin, and there have been many calls for action in this House. I was particularly critical of the Tánaiste's Department in this regard but we have yet another indication that the Government listens whenever it gets the message coming from rural Ireland. I had to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Tánaiste's initiative and say there are many in the north west and the midlands who will be very pleased this morning to find that their dignity will be preserved. They will not be subject to the behest of civil servants at some remote location, unaware of and insensitive to the environment in which people live.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to indicate when it is planned to hold the debate on the Nice treaty. Will he convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the absolute horror and resentment many of us on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side felt at Mr. Prodi's remarks to the European Parliament yesterday? What is this gentleman trying to do? Is he trying to totally disrupt&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Manning inquires about the Arms Trial papers that will be published today. I hope a debate will take place tomorrow about which I will inform the House on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Coghlan, Costello, Ó Murchú, Ryan, Hayes and Mooney were shocked and horrified at the brutal murder of the young man in the North of Ireland yesterday. I concur with the sentiments expressed and there were some very touching moments as Members made heartfelt contributions. On the positive side, we have had almost 1,500 days of peace since the Good Friday Agreement but there is, unfortunately, a price to be paid. I hope the Agreement and the institutions will be kept in place and join the Senators in sending good wishes to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and everyone involved in the job to be undertaken in the coming days and weeks. The Agreement and the institutions have been working well for the people of Northern Ireland and the whole island will prosper in the long term. No greater example can be given than that of the foot and mouth crisis when we came together, North and South, and worked as an island, through the Government, Bríd Rodgers and everyone concerned. If the Good Friday Agreement had not been in place, the plague of foot and mouth disease would have been rampant, North and South. There is much to achieve by keeping the Agreement intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn inquired about the census. He is quite correct that it was deferred owing to foot and mouth disease. I will have inquiries made to find out when it will go ahead. It is a vital part of our research and, from a political perspective, the change in population, particularly on the east <Col N="1086" /> coast, has meant there are certain constituencies where there should be an extra seat to ensure fairness and the proper level of representation.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Jackman and Ormonde called for a debate on bullying and education. Where it occurs in schools it can carry on into later life &ndash; in the workplace and other areas &ndash; and I will certainly have time made available for such a debate. </P>
    <P>Senator Costello also made a point regarding the motions on today's Order Paper. Regarding No. 1, the purpose of which is to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála, Senator Ormonde and many others called for a debate on An Bord Pleanála about which there were debates in both Government and Opposition time. This is perhaps being acceded to because of calls made in this House. While I certainly take the Senator's point, it is not the rule of thumb that we do these things. Including the last five weeks, by the summer recess we will have processed 23 Bills. For previous Governments that would have represented a year's work. We are now processing an enormous amount of legislation in the Seanad. </P>
    <P>Senator Dino Cregan sought a debate on Aer Lingus and Eircom. I will convey his views to the Minister. </P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan, Ormonde and Joe Doyle asked for a debate on politics and the way ahead. I took on board the point made by Senator Doyle on the Bill yesterday. A press council and commission might be the way to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Ormonde asked for another debate on the National Roads Authority. It has already been debated twice. Senator Jackman also referred to public-private partnerships. I will have no difficulty allocating time to debate the matter in the next session. Senator Bonner called on me to pass on his views to the Minister on the difficulties being experienced in the Finn valley area of Donegal and across that county. I will consult the Senator and see if he can be facilitated for perhaps half an hour tomorrow. It is a serious issue and I understand the reason the Senator raises it this morning.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Coghlan's views to the Minister regarding the post office network. Senators Connor, Rory Kiely and Ryan called for a debate on RTÉ. I look forward to reading the PricewaterhouseCooper report which will be placed in the Oireachtas Library today and perhaps we can consider the matter early next week. </P>
    <P>Senators Burke and Mooney referred to Enterprise Ireland and the BMW region. Senator Mooney welcomed the announcement that community employment employees over 50 years of age can continue in employment. A tremendous amount of work has been carried out by these employees in areas throughout the country and I, too, welcome the announcement.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also asked when the debate on the Nice treaty will take place. It will be held <Col N="1087" /> next Wednesday when the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be present.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent a good part of my life in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Indeed, my long apprenticeship for any of the more attractive posts in the political system resulted in that phrase meaning something more geographical than that I occupied a seat in the Dáil. I spent a lot of time in or around this building. Although I would not see the time I spent here before 1992 as a feature to be highlighted in recommending a political career to young people of ability and ambition, it gave me a valuable opportunity to discover that all wisdom was not in my party and that much could be gained from listening to ideas of others.</P>
      <P>Political life means that, from time to time, I and several of my fellow parliamentarians are on different sides in matters of controversy. That is a fact of life. However, there are some matters where I believe a bipartisan approach should be adopted and one of these concerns the conditions under which and in which Senators and Deputies work in the interest of enhancing democracy and its institutions. For this reason, when it was decided to introduce a fundamental change, namely, the auditing of leaders' allowances, I sought the views and guidance of the individual parliamentary party leaders who had operated the system for some years and who alone had the detailed knowledge of how those allowances were spent and what items of expenditure were required to keep the operations of their parliamentary followers up to speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this Bill proposes in relation to the audit is a distillation of these consultations. I deviated in no significant way on any item which they men<Col N="1090" /> tioned to me. Some Members may have noticed that in the other House there was some criticism of the arrangements which the Bill contains in relation to the proposed audit and to the levels of allowances. Like all Deputies, my political survival depends on retaining the support of a certain proportion of the electorate in a multi-member constituency. Members are hyper-aware that there is no such thing as a safe seat and we may as a group be particularly sensitive to any perceived or imagined advantage that the system might give to one of our rivals over us. Some party Deputies implied that Independent Members, who receive the average amount paid in respect of all members of parliamentary parties, had in effect a war chest for the next election.</P>
    <P>This House has a long tradition of active Independent Members whose contribution to its operation has been, to say the least, significant. Down the years, there has been the fullest acceptance of the right of non-party Members to have the same benefits as those who represent political parties. That is as it should be and, I suspect, may be due to the absence of geographical constituencies for Seanad Members. I would be surprised if any denunciation was heard here today of an arrangement which gave non-party Members of this House the same allowance as Senators generally.</P>
    <P>Senators have been, since the foundation of the State, a valuable resource, particularly in terms of unusual expertise for the parliamentary parties to which they belong and for the nation. For most decades during which leaders' allowances were paid, the Seanad did not formally come into the picture. When my predecessor changed the method by which the leaders' allowance was paid by calculating it on the basis of representative strength, only Members of the Dáil were taken into account. </P>
    <P>What I propose in this Bill is a clear recognition that Members of this House are an acknowledged element of the parliamentary party membership whose needs fall to be met from that allowance and, as in the Dáil in recent years, the Independents will have funds available to them to sustain their parliamentary activity. It is probably unnecessary to emphasise this &ndash; I must because it has been at times lost sight of &ndash; but these allowances in the House cannot be expended on electoral activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with three aspects of the payments made to leaders of parliamentary parties, how they are computed, how they are audited and how they are adjusted following a merger of parliamentary parties. I propose to deal with each of them but not in the order in which they occur in the Bill. These allowances have been with us in one shape or other since 1938, subject to two major qualifications in the interim. The allowance was specified as being for parliamentary purposes, including research, and, following the McKenna judgment, prohibited for use for electoral purposes. These remain the parameters for the use of the allowance and when this legislation <Col N="1091" /> was first mooted the representatives of all parties I consulted initially felt it should be left as it was.</P>
    <P>Effectively, what they told me was that we all know what parliamentary purposes mean and, if there had been any confusion about it years ago, it has long since been clarified through public discussion. Equally, breaching the ban on electoral use of the allowances carries such a practical risk of a result being challenged by a disappointed candidate that only a party leader with pronounced kamikaze tendencies would even contemplate it.</P>
    <P>These, I accept, are not unreasonable ways of looking at things. However, it is equally valid to say that the propriety of this particular public expenditure is currently self-policed and that it is appropriate that normal audit procedures should be put in place to correct this. The Bill provides that each leader will be required to prepare a statement of his or her expenditure, have it audited by a public auditor, not an employee of any State institution, and submit it with that auditor's report to the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 1(11) of the Bill sets out where the responsibility to carry out these obligations rests when a leader dies or resigns before he or she has complied with them. Its sanction for non-compliance is simple, fail to deliver and the cash-flow dries up until you do. The documentation comes to the commission for its consideration. It may seek from a leader some clarification and then report to the Minister for Finance, telling him or her whether the leader's statement and auditor's report came within the time specified, are adequate or inappropriate, or disclose expenditure which does not comply with the requirements of the relevant subsection. The commission's report is laid before the Oireachtas and the commission must retain in its office for three years the leader's statement and auditor's report, freely accessible to the public. These arrangements are broadly in line with the arrangements applying to party funds provided under the Electoral Act.</P>
    <P>A further criticism was that &ldquo;parliamentary activities&rdquo; could mean everything or nothing. I want a system which will stand the test of time, and none who joined this house in 1977, or others who came earlier, would have won a prize for predicting the items of expenditure which would feature regularly in a parliamentary party's statement of expenditure. What I have done, after serious consultations with all party leaders, is set out a list of what we regard as proper categories on which a leader's allowance could be spent. However, the subsection which lists these items states that parliamentary activity includes them. This clearly signals that the list is intended to be a snapshot of what the party leaders collectively have seen in recent years, and now see, as activities and items that have to be financed from that allowance. All in this House appreciate that equally legitimate categories which we have not thought of may arise in the future, and they can <Col N="1092" /> be added to the list eventually if they come to be a regular feature. </P>
    <P>The second new element in this Bill is to take account of mergers between parliamentary parties when fixing allowances. Where it was relevant since 1938, no account was taken in fixing leaders' allowances of accretions his or her party acquired in this House during the life of a Dáil by defection from another party or the conversion of an Independent. This seemed reasonable &ndash; the electorate had provided votes which elected a member on the basis of the badge he wore at a general election or by-election and they were entitled to expect their party to enjoy that Deputy's support in the voting lobbies and financially. Deputy Quinn, when radically altering the basis of payment in 1996, held firmly to this position. The money stayed where the Deputy started and did not go where he or she moved, whether it was to another party or to non-party status. Most thought that reasonable.</P>
    <P>Mergers or takeovers of smaller parties have not been unknown since the Oireachtas was established. In the 1920s and 1930s, what is now Fine Gael merged with several parties and the Labour Party did likewise in the 1940s and later. None of these exercises had implications for the leaders' allowance either because it did not exist or because the legal provisions then in place did not affect it.</P>
    <P>The merger during the life of this Dáil of Labour and Democratic Left was different. Both had leaders who were paid on the basis of the Dáil strength of their parties. When the merger took place, Democratic Left's leadership ceased and Labour's was unaffected. This was because Deputy Quinn's Act of 1996 provided that the leaders' allowance was based on the number of Deputies elected as &ldquo;members of that party at the previous general election or at a subsequent by-election&rdquo;. The Deputies involved felt hard done by. This was not a political smash and grab where a party captured a discontented member of a rival party or led a lonely Independent astray, this was a different matter entirely where two parties with a long-standing ideological affinity decided that they were, after all, compatible and both parliamentary parties and their members at large decided democratically that they would together become the Labour Party. I accept the Labour Party approach and agree that the same facility should be available to any party where all the Dáil and Seanad Members agree to merge in the future. I propose, however, to retain otherwise the arrangements where a defection would not cost funds to the parliamentary party to which the Member had belonged at election time, and would not travel to another party or direct to him or her in the case of opting for non-party status.</P>
    <P>The rates of allowances which the Government believes should be paid to parliamentary parties of varying strength are set out in the first part of the Bill. In this we are following, with some adjustment, the approach taken by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, when he decided to rad<Col N="1093" /> icalise the leaders' allowance system by removing the requirement that a party had to have seven Deputies elected before it received a share of the cash allocated to parliamentary parties and by extending the allowances to the Independents. As already stated, the adjustments we are making take account for the first time that Senators are members of various parliamentary parties and make demands, as Deputies do, on the services and facilities which a parliamentary party has to provide to all its members. These demands have been greater in recent years as the Seanad made greater use of specialised committees and as Senators took part with their colleagues from this House in the proceedings of joint committees, some of which have proved to impose heavy and contentious burdens.</P>
    <P>The sums the Bill will provide on their account are, like those for Dáil Members, tapered but only involve two rates for parties and one for Independents because the Seanad is smaller. Those sums are lower than is generally the case for Deputies because, while the obligations on Members of both Houses are similar, the difference in rates is a recognition of the wider functions conferred on Deputies.</P>
    <P>The second change we wish to make is in the tapering system as it applies to the Dáil. The existing four categories are being reduced to three. In 1996 Deputy Quinn took the view, not unreasonably, that the rates should be skewed in favour of the smaller parties on the grounds that a party with five or fewer Members had to keep the party flag flying on several issues with consequently a higher necessary spend per Member than a larger party or a non-party Member. I would not want to send that view down in flames, but there has been a belief in the House, at least from early in the life of the current Dáil, that larger parties had fared less than fairly under the scheme and the same would be true in the future for parties with between five and ten Dáil Members. What the new dispensation would involve is treating the first ten Dáil Members in the same way as the first five are treated at present and the next 20 in the way the next five &ndash; namely, Nos. 6 to 10 &ndash; were treated under the existing scheme. The remainder, including parties with more than 60 members, will receive the rate currently paid to Members Nos. 11 to 60. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, the principal feature of which is the revised payment of annual allowances to parliamentary leaders of qualifying parties. I appreciate the substantial increase in the parliamentary allowance paid to leaders of political parties and I am pleased to note that the number of Senators in a political party will be taken into account for the first time when its leader's allowance is being calculated. This is an acknowledgement of the increasing role Senators are playing in the parliamentary system, particularly in terms of their par<Col N="1094" /> ticipation in the joint committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>One of the main features of the Bill is that parliamentary leaders will now be required to prepare a statement of their expenditure, have it audited and submit it with an audited report to the Public Offices Commission. The leaders' allowance has very much been in the public domain in recent years and if the procedure proposed in the Bill had been in place in the past, we would not have experienced the difficulties such as those which have arisen in relation to the allowance. I note that a Member of the Seanad who is not a member of a qualifying party will receive an allowance in connection with his or her parliamentary activities of £12,500 per year. It would appear there is no responsibility on them to provide an audited account in respect of this money and they can dispose of it as they wish. Will the Minister explain why an audited account is not required from each Member who receives such funding?</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, there are some measures in the Bill which provide for taking account of mergers between political parties. The 1996 Act provides that the leaders' allowance is based on a number of Deputies elected as members of a party at the previous election. When two political parties merged recently there was no benefit to them in relation to the leaders' allowance and that is being changed under the Bill. I welcome that development.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the increase in public funding for political parties, nevertheless, the time will come in the near future when we must ban corporate funding for political parties. When contributing to yesterday's debate on the Standards in Public Office Bill, I stated that the vast majority of members of the public are cynical about politics and politicians. We must restore the confidence of the public, particularly that of young people, in the political system and this can best be done by banishing the influence of business, particularly big business, from politics. This will require the elimination of corporate funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest needs of this House is a support service for Senators. There are simply no research facilities available to Senators who are obliged to speak on different Bills in this House each week. I am sure Government spokespersons receive a degree of assistance from the offices of the relevant Ministers, but when one is in Opposition one is on one's own. The only assistance I receive is that provided by the staff of the Oireachtas Library, for which I am extremely grateful, and also that provided by my secretary, whose services I share with two other Members. This week alone we will have dealt with the Dormant Accounts Bill, the Standards in Public Office Bill, the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill and the Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. If I had access to some research facilities, my contributions on these Bills would be more <Col N="1095" /> meaningful. I do not believe it would be necessary for each Member of the Seanad to have a research assistant. There should be a central research facility for Seanad Members which, possibly, could be located in the Library, to the staff of which a number of research assistants could be added.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister stated in the Lower House that he is in favour of a secretarial allowance being made available to former Taoisigh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which represents an important step forward. The Minister is granting to the Members of this House a recognition and level of status that has been denied them since the foundation of the State. It is appropriate that Members of the House should be taken into consideration in the calculation of the moneys to be paid out under the leaders' allowance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the term of office of the current Dáil and Seanad, an enormous amount of legislation has been dealt with, which goes a long way towards reassuring the public and putting in place structures, safeguards and checks and balances which will ensure that moneys distributed through the parliamentary system can be audited in a transparent manner. We now have strict legal regulations in standards in public office, electoral and ethics legislation. These are attempts by the Oireachtas to turn over a new leaf in the conduct of public representation and service at all levels. It is important that there is transparency and checks and balances. The Minister's legislation addresses an issue that received attention and criticism in recent years. In response to public demands, the legislation provides for the required safeguards and transparency and I compliment <Col N="1096" /> the Minister on the manner in which he has addressed the issue.</P>
    <P>Public representation extends beyond the parameters that we knew a decade or more ago. Today, it is impossible to run a politician's affairs with one secretary and an office. Members of this House must share a secretary. The level of business conducted in the House, and by Members in their constituencies, is high. The question of the support we get should, therefore, be addressed. It is important that an individual or collective research facility is available to Members. It is almost impossible for a person to fulfil his or her potential without a constituency office. If it was not for my wife running mine, I would not be able to operate as a politician. I read in the newspapers, and find it extraordinary, that expenses for an office amount to £4,000 plus £1,000 for telephone charges. There is no recompense or salary for the person involved. If we are to operate to our full capacity, this issue must be addressed. To provide the services which the public demands and we believe we should give a research facility and secretarial assistance are required.</P>
    <P>In the past there was criticism of the use to which the leaders' allowance was put. The necessary checks and balances were not in place. A party must run its business in respect of which the leaders' allowance is necessary. I accept Senator Doyle's point that, in future, all political activity may have to be funded from taxes. Under law, funding for parliamentary parties is limited. Corporate funding to a party is capped at £5,000 and to an individual at £2,000. Parties will, therefore, have to seek funding from the Oireachtas. Some would regard this as good, but it was not possible in the past because of the tight finances of different Governments, in which Ministers for Finance were under pressure to fund other public services. We can, however, revisit the subject again. It would not be good to exclude the public from the political system. People should have an opportunity, even through limited funding from businesses, to support the democratic system in respect of which the financial limits are clearly set down in legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this welcome Bill. The public will undoubtedly see it as a genuine response to concern and criticism. The Minister has also taken other bold steps to bring political life to a new, transparent era in which the public will recognise that there is nothing hidden or underhand in the political system. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to make even a short contribution on this Bill. I welcome the Minister and compliment him on always recognising the difficulties that Members of the Oireachtas face and that the rates of pay, at every level, are modest. He has courageously tackled this problem. There is no media kudos for defending Members' rights and ensuring they are well paid. Members need a level of remuneration commensurate with the important work that they <Col N="1097" /> do. In the last five years working conditions have improved. Nearly everyone now has a separate, comfortable office, for example.</P>
      <P>I have been here since 1981 and have been a Member of both Houses from time to time during that 20 years. The conditions that existed when I entered as a Deputy in 1981 were quite appalling now that we can look back at them and there were few improvements during the 1980s. They were stringent times but it was not as if improvements would have cost a lot. Few Ministers for Finance had the bottle to face the media criticism that would have resulted from improving conditions here. Stories abounded about the depth of the pile of the carpet etc. and the appetite for that sort of nonsense discouraged improvements.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a pity it comes against the background of a need for transparency about leaders' allowances because of revelations of irregularity at a tribunal of inquiry in relation to the expenditure of one leader's allowance. Allowances made to leaders of political parties will now be strictly controlled by audit. All expenditure must be justified and I welcome that necessary part of the legislation. I welcome the fact that independent Members of the Dáil can get in the region of £20,000 per year and Independent Members of the Seanad can get £12,500 per year. They need that kind of back-up. I am unhappy, however, with the fact that these moneys are not subject to audit. That is not right.</P>
      <P>This morning I listened on a news programme to a debate which was not very edifying. One Member of the other House, who would be in receipt of such an allowance, did not do much to engender public confidence in how such an allowance might be spent. If a Member of either House receives an allowance as back-up for research etc. he or she should be able to show clearly that it was spent on these services. We all know the need for back-up to provide the great depth of service we require in the House. When there is a debate on legislation we need background information, which an ordinary Member or backbencher in either House is unlikely to be able to get.</P>
      <P>I sat on the Government side in the other House and I certainly never found any back-up. If I wanted to say something on legislation I had to do my own reading and rooting in the Library or search the Internet in amateur fashion. There is a great need for proper research assistance to Members of both Houses. If we are to contribute in an informed and intelligent way on complicated legislation and want to read up on the background or to raise points not dealt with in the Bill but related to the matter under discussion we need research experts who can provide information at short notice. That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran made a point in relation to the secretarial assistance available to Members of this House. Generally speaking we operate on the basis of one secretary for two Members. I have a job sharing arrangement whereby my secretary is based in what used to be my TD constituency office in my home. That position is shared with <Col N="1098" /> another Member of this House in another location in the west and it works well. I am now informed by my party administrator that my secretary has been told by the Department of Finance that what we are doing is not right. The McKenna judgment is cited to claim that by having a secretary located in my constituency I have an unfair advantage over other Members. That is a vague excuse made by the Minister's Department and I do not understand how it can be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the McKenna judgment should not be drawn into this case. It was not just my case as mine was settled in the sense that I operate with a secretary who is not based in Leinster House. Members of this House felt that, like Deputies, if they could make a job sharing arrangement with another Member of the Seanad they could have a secretary based at home or in what we would call a constituency office. In other words they could have their secretary otherwise than in Leinster House if it suited them and was by agreement. I have proposed an amendment to that effect and I hope it will be accepted. It is the only amendment to this legislation and I hope it will not be ruled out of order because it involves a charge. I look forward to a proper debate on it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The excuse made by the Department of Finance is that this cannot happen for Senators because of implications arising from the McKenna judgment. What do we say then to Deputies who have a secretary located in their constituency? What advantage have they over Deputies or Senators whose secretaries are based in Leinster House? I certainly need this explained and on Committee Stage I hope to read at least what was written to the administrator from the personnel section, which originated as advice from the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation forward. It involves not just the necessary reform to ensure transparency and proper auditing of leaders' allowances but other reforms as well. I compliment the Minister on the fact that he is never afraid to stand up for the rights of Members of these Houses. Too many of the Minister's predecessors were too sensitive to short-term media criticism. People working here are entitled to the standard of working conditions that the law provides for. The law was often broken here in the working conditions imposed on Members and the staff working with them. The law was broken in terms of overcrowding, while safety regulations for equipment were ignored. There has been enormous improvement in that area and it is not a backhanded compliment to the Minister to say that he is responsible for that improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. No other Minister for Finance in the history of the State has made such radical changes in relation to all the issues in the Bill and those discussed by Members earlier. Unfortunately, some issues remain to be addressed and Senator Connor raised one in particular. </P>
      <P>The Bill relates to the leaders' allowance under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, when it was originally introduced by Seán McEntee, and also to other more recent Acts, particularly those of 1996 and 1998, which indicated amounts paid should be dependent on the number of Dáil Deputies elected by a party at previous general or subsequent elections. The Minister has extended that now to Senators.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Bill provides for three items. It provides an arrangement for the mandatory audit of the expenditure from leaders' allowances, the need for which is evident from recent tribunals, in order to enable more transparency and accountability to the public. The Bill also provides for arrangements for the calculation of payments to party leaders and non-party Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister has clarified the allowances paid to non-party Members and the so-called leaders of their own parties, I will refer to the issue again. In recent years, parties have been dissolved and their Members have joined other parties and this Bill provides for such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The amounts payable to each Member have been revised and I am glad Senators have been included in such calculations. The Minister has shown appreciation of the work of Senators, particularly the large amount of high-profile work the Leader of the House has attempted to pursue. There is no reason Senators should not be provided for in this Bill as we are as active in the parliamentary party as Deputies. The allowance given to the leader of a party should reflect the party's number of Senators. Certain services are expected from parties and some services are provided by Senators. I accept the one third reduction in allowances for parties in Government, as services are available through the offices of the Ministers. The Bill restricts the use of such funds in election and referendum campaigns. </P>
      <P>It has been alleged in this House and in tribunals that certain funds have been abused in the past, but audits will now be carried out to ensure they are properly used. We are aware of only one case of possible misuse of funds. Without interfering in the affairs of former party leaders, the past misuse of party funds has not yet come to light. This legislative change providing for audits will ensure that Members are treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little baffled by the section of the Bill which decrees that statements must be presented to the Public Offices Commission within 120 days of the end of the financial year. The only penalty, as far as I am aware, is that further funding will be withheld should such a statement not be fur<Col N="1100" /> nished. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the penalties to be imposed if misuse is discovered during an audit. It is right that statements should be made available to Members of the Oireachtas and to the public. </P>
    <P>As Senator Joe Doyle stated, many financial Bills have come to the House in recent days, which has meant that I have not had the chance to read this Bill in detail. There should be separate bank accounts for leaders' allowances and nothing other than moneys from such allowances should be lodged in these accounts. The leader's allowance is not a salary and it will be tax-free. It has been self-regulatory heretofore, but the audit procedure to be put in place will restore the confidence eroded by the media's presentation of recent events.</P>
    <P>Senators should be included in the calculation of the allowance. I do not understand why a party with 70 or 100 Members should receive the same amount per Member as a party with only 20 Members, although I understand it predates this Bill and has been refined by the Minister. The bigger the party, the bigger the demands made on its leader and on the services provided through his offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier that he did not think there would be any objections to allowances being given to non-party Members. It is easy for the Minister to make such a claim as he has a safe seat in Kildare North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance was based in Donegal where there are two Independent Deputies, he might look on the matter in a different light. I do not begrudge the allowance to Deputies Gildea and Blaney, but ordinary Members have no access to their party leader's account.</P>
      <P>As Senator Connor argued, the level of research and press services given to Senators from their parties is debatable. As a Senator, I receive neither the constituency travel allowance given to Deputies nor the £22,000 allowance given to Independent Deputies. I perform and am expected to perform in the same way as any Member of the Upper House. </P>
      <P>My schedule has been tough in the last few days. As Senator Joe Doyle explained, there have many financial Bills in this House and one cannot contribute very much when one does not have time or any back-up assistance. All one can do is deal with the edges of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the financial Bills, I must also speak on a marine Bill later today. Last night, I received the devastating news of the loss of 85 jobs in the only factory in the Ballybofey area and I had to deal with that as well as my usual constituency work. I have seen my family for three hours in the past fortnight and I will not get home this weekend as I have to go to a conference in Carlow. I am expected to do the work <Col N="1101" /> I have mentioned on a Senator's salary, although I appreciate the advances made by the Minister in that regard. If I were to employ a secretary in Donegal out of my own pocket, I would be coming to this House for no financial reward. </P>
    <P>Every GAA club in Donegal will hold a golf classic this summer and I will be the first person they come to. If someone wants to place an advertisement for a festival in a local newspaper, Independent Members can help them from their parliamentary allowance, but I cannot contribute from similar funds. After expenses have been dealt with, I might be in Dublin without any salary. It is not that I begrudge it to the Independents, but I wonder if the playing field is even. Years ago, Senators did not operate in the same manner as Deputies, but that day is gone as most of us work as hard as our colleagues in the other House.</P>

      <P>I am trying to make my point to the Minister. I know that another Senator glanced at the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when the provision of secretarial services for ex-taoisigh was discussed. All of our ex-taoisigh have, in one way or another, been excellent ambassadors and great statesmen. There are more ex-taoisigh than ever as a result of the rapid changeover in the 1990s. They represent this country on the international stage on occasions and it is right that they should have some back-up and that everything should not be taken from them.</P>
      <P>The only gripe I have with this Bill is that ordinary Members of the Oireachtas do not receive equality compared to Independents. Front Bench spokespersons in this House, and such spokespersons in the other House who are not in Government, have to conduct research.</P>
      <P>What penalties will be imposed if an audit exposes discrepancies in financial matters?</P>

      <P>The expertise in the Fianna Fáil Party on my genealogy is one of life's best entertainments. I was quite taken by Senator Connor's comments on conditions when he first arrived in the House. I always remember my first week. I was the first Oireachtas Member to make a <Col N="1102" /> maiden speech without a tie, long before Deputy Gregory, but the then Cathaoirleach and Clerk of the Seanad dealt with me very firmly and that did not last long as I learned the rules of the House. However, I recall being told how I could make a telephone call. I was given the key of a cupboard in room LG5 in Kildare House in which the telephone was locked. I was told I could take the telephone out, plug it into the wall and make a call on condition that I locked it back in the cupboard when I was finished because of the possibility of people using it for other purposes.</P>

      <P>The Seanad was a leisurely operation at that time. I was short of things to do on many a Wednesday when the House sat and in those days I was more <i>au fait</i> with the cultural life of Dublin. The work of Members of this House has been transformed. When I returned to the House in 1997, following my unfortunate accident with the electorate in 1993, the work had been further transformed. It is a demanding House now, particularly for those who are members of political parties. The Minister used a wonderful phrase, &ldquo;someone who led a lonely Independent astray&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Labour Party did not lead me astray. I am quite enjoying myself. I am a little intrigued by my own position because I suspect I am still in receipt of the allowance I obtained when I was elected as an Independent in August 1997. I have absolutely no idea whether that is the case.</P>
      <P>I am fortunate in that I am involved in another activity but it is difficult to reconcile that work with membership of the House, hence my regular absences from it. I sympathise with other Members. I am glad I am not a member of a Government party because it would be impossible to be a Member of the House and maintain any level of serious activity outside it as it is hugely demanding.</P>
      <P>Members of both House do significant work at committees which is ignored by the 60 members of the press accredited to Leinster House and who would have great difficulty locating the committee rooms, not to mention understanding the serious and important work done in them. The Minister will be aware of the diligent work done, say, on a Finance Bill by both Government and Opposition Members as they debate it in painful but extremely important detail away from the glare of publicity. Nowadays such legislation is usually taken without the succession of guillotines that were unfortunately necessary when Committee Stages were taken in the Dáil. However, committee work is important and time consuming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> I do not have to undertake constituency work, though circumstances may dictate that will change soon but Members of both Houses must do so and the volume of work is expanding. I have one problem with the legislation to which I do not have a solution. I used to make cheapskate comments when I was first elected to the House in 1981 about the money Senators earned. I made an unfortunate comment about dividing the salary of a Senator by the number of days the House sat and arrived at a sum of £450 per day. This was used to embarrass the families of Members by teachers who should have known better.</P>
    <P>I decided as a result that people who were fortunate enough, like myself, to be in affluent circumstances should not make political points regarding the earnings of Members. Since 1982 I have always solidly supported the rights of Members of both Houses to be properly paid. However, all remuneration should be transparent and in this regard we have some way to go, for instance, in regard to many allowances, which should be verifiably used for what they are intended without swamping Members with paperwork.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a sensible and correct decision when he simplified the procedures for claiming travelling expenses to the House as he recognised reality. However, it would be simpler to ask Members to select a base and inform them that they will be paid a specific sum for travel and they would have to verify any travel outside of this. Members deserve to be supported in their work but opportunities should not be created for them to stash away money for one purpose or another.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons I am a little unhappy some allowances will not have to be verified, particularly those paid to Independents. I do not criticise Independent Members. I never had an ideological objection to party politics, unlike some of my former Independent colleagues. They make a major contribution to the work of the House and make it a livelier place that it might be otherwise. That is as it should be. If money is to be made available to Members for certain purposes, it is tautological that the public should be satisfied that the money is used for what it was intended and not to pay for an expensive family holiday abroad. We should be accountable.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner said parliamentary supports are limited and if he pays his secretary from his parliamentary allowance, he will be in breach of the McKenna judgment. That judgment related to referenda and I have read it a number of times. I am concerned that people are reading things into it. The judgment outlined the position regarding the Executive seeking to use taxpayers' money to influence the view of taxpayers about the fundamental law of the State. The Constitution regulates the relationship between the State and the citizen and is in place for the fundamental protection of the citizen. It is, therefore, in a particular way, sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I am not persuaded the judgment has many of the ramifications people believe. I would have taken the case rather than Patricia McKenna if I had not been advised that I might lose my house among other things if I lost the case. At the time Patricia did not own a house. She owned a bicycle and had no job. She was, therefore, a much more appropriate person to take the risk involved.</P>
    <P>If Senator Bonner's interpretation is correct, will the Minister explain how it is compatible with the judgment to have large numbers of civil servants doing the constituency work of Ministers? This is not unique to the current Government as the practice has been ongoing for years. How can established civil servants doing the constituency work of a Minister be consistent with the McKenna judgment? For example, Senator Connor cannot use an Oireachtas funded secretary to do his constituency work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither Senator Connor nor Senator Ryan represents a single constituency. Senator Ryan does not represent Cork North-Central or Cork South-Central and Senator Connor does not represent Longford-Roscommon in Seanad Éireann. If the Senators were elected to the other House, they would represent a single constituency. However, as Senators, they are not elected to represent constituencies. Much as I like my colleague, Senator Bonner, he does not legally represent Donegal South-West.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a valid point. I do not want to start the dialogue again because I know you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, will get cross with me and nothing in life would make me more nervous than the sight of the Leas-Chathaoirleach being cross with me. The most agreeable of men getting cross with me would be difficult to accept.</P>
      <P>The McKenna judgment did not say anything about constituencies as it dealt with referenda. One cannot make a distinction between a Member of the other House using an Oireachtas allowance to do certain work in his or her geographical constituency and a Seanad Member doing work in a geographical area on behalf of people who are citizens of this country and say it is incompatible with the McKenna judgment. I did not read that in the McKenna judgment. There are interpretations being put on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not pay too much heed to the Attorney General on these matters. He is a man of strong opinions, which is one of the things he has in common with the Minister for Finance, and it is always worth listening to them. It is always wonderful to debate and argue with him and I am <Col N="1105" /> sure he has done so with the Minister for Finance. I would be surprised if he has not. However, I would not let him be the final authority on these matters. I would go beyond that.</P>
    <P>The McKenna judgment does not mean what is suggested. I do not understand how it could make a distinction between civil servants who work in the Minister for Finance's office to look after the citizens of north Kildare, a common practice not confined to the Minister, and Senator Connor who tries to look after the citizens of County Roscommon. I am at a loss as to how that can be the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the basic principles of this Bill. Politics is important. Whether I like the Government or not &ndash; it is not difficult to figure out which of those is the case &ndash; the only way society can be changed for better or worse in a democratic society is through politics. People can write about it as journalists or academics and it is interesting, important and part of the contribution to debate. However, the job of taking the ideas of others and making them concrete in law, taxation and every other way is that of politics. It is, therefore, something which should be cherished in our society. There is an enormous amount of nonsense written about politics. Politicians are the only sector of society who must, by definition, compromise in public because we operate in the public glare. Others in many professions, including journalism, compromise in private and are able to throw up a barrage of defences about the freedom of the press to explain their compromises. Politicians are the only ones who must explain their compromises in the cold glare of publicity. I am sure the Minister has made compromises in his time. Too much is written by too many about this issue.</P>
    <P>I do not know anybody who got rich out of politics <i>per se</i>. I know people who got rich while they were in politics through the abuse of politics. The amount of money Members of the Oireachtas are paid, whether it is larger or smaller than it is now, will not be the determinant to whether anyone is rich. It will determine that people do not have a permanent worry about their family security and mean that people will not become nervous wrecks by the amount of work they must do to keep on top of their brief. It will mean that people who are members of committees will not feel they have to sacrifice their committee or constituency work to function as a Member of the Oireachtas. Whatever about our salaries, which is a separate issue, the type of funding provided to make people able to function adequately in a complex society in which instantaneous reactions are expected to every complex situation must be welcomed. It is not often I say it about the Minister, but I compliment him on it, without the usual hint of equivocation which comes at the end of my compliments.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Ryan, I congratulate the Minister on the general thrust of the Bill. I am not an elected Member, but the parliamen<Col N="1106" /> tarians in this country are an easy target for cheap jibes. If we want a functioning democracy, we must pay the rate for the job and enable people to take part in politics as an honourable and noble profession without having to worry about whether they can look after their families better elsewhere.</P>
      <P>One should not parade one's own crisis of conscience in public, but I have a small worry about this Bill. One interpretation suggests the Minister is trying to donate to me a substantial sum of public money for my parliamentary activities, which I would find difficult to justify or audit. I had the great honour of being nominated by the Taoiseach. I accepted it as an honour at the time and having been in this House and enjoyed the debates and the fellowship of colleagues on all sides. I appreciate it as a greater honour. At the time the Taoiseach did me the additional courtesy of allowing me to regard myself as an Independent, although I sit on this side of the House. This was partly a hangover of my period as a eunuch in the Civil Service for years before that and I thought it was improper for me to decastrate myself. I am so independent I am independent of the Independents on the other side of the House. There is something inherently wrong if I could by some means define myself as a one person party for the purpose of this Bill. I can solve the problem by not taking the money, but it struck me as a slight anomaly.</P>
      <P>The Minister could help Members and the effective functioning of the House by putting more money into the Library and research facilities. I have had experience of other bodies where one could call on research assistants and ask the library staff to get a paper on the workings of legislation, for example. That would be an enormous resource for Members on all sides of the House and improve the quality of work in committees, etc. If the Minister could take from Members the burden of having to burn the midnight oil looking for sources, it would be a great help. I commend him on the Bill and wish him well in what he is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has chosen to stay with us during this debate. It is good that we are focusing on the role of politics, this House and the people in it and how we do and are supported in our job. As we move towards the future, we must encourage more people to become involved and offer them a chance to make a difference, contribute to the legislation and the running of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is a captive audience, I want to draw his attention to one of the greatest difficulties facing this House and the other House, namely, that if we want to attract more young people and parents, particularly women, into this profession, we must do something about the fact that we do not have an automatic entitlement to maternity leave. While I am aware that it is not related to this Bill or part of the Minister's remit, we need to consider it. Members of the <Col N="1107" /> Oireachtas who are pregnant are entitled to the statutory 14 weeks' maternity leave and while they are on leave, their vote should be registered in whichever way they so choose. I ask the Minister to consider that simple change. He said he enjoyed listening to ideas put forward by Members, and this is one idea I would ask him to take on board.</P>
    <P>In relation to the parliamentary allowances, the leaders' allowances and the way we fund the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is vital that we ring-fence funding for the continuous training and development of Members of this House. It is not sufficient to provide allowances without ensuring that our parliamentarians, who effectively run the country, follow a programme of continuous development, education and training. I am aware the Minister is familiar with many organisations. The most progressive organisations are those which invest in their workers and put in place defined, formal schemes to ensure they are learning on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>On support services, while we have seen some changes in recent years we do not have sufficient technical resources available to us in either House of the Oireachtas. A Member may have one computer and choose to have it at home or carry a lap-top computer around with him or her. If Members have a lap-top that is linked to their office or home by an ISDN line, and when they come back to Dublin that PC cannot be linked to the network here and, therefore, it is useless to them.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance should seriously examine the area of data communications, modems, databases and other ways of ensuring that people have access to the type of information they seek.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor has tabled an amendment for Committee Stage and it will be interesting to hear what is contained in that amendment, but I suggest to the Minister that the reason one may choose to have a research assistant based somewhere outside Dublin may not be to fulfil constituency requirements. I agree with the Minister that Senators do not have a constituency. That is not their role, but they have the choice to decide that it would be easier for them to do their research and administration work with the support of somebody at a location that suits them. That is the challenge. I ask the Minister to consider that concept. It is not about giving Senators constituency secretaries or research assistants, it is about providing them with research assistants and secretarial or administrative help in the location chosen by them. If I can operate just as effectively if not better in Galway than in Dublin because I have more facilities there, why should I not have the support that is most effective for me at the location where I find it easier to work? If I am in Dublin for two days a week because the Seanad is sitting on a Wednesday and Thursday, there is no reason my secretary-research assistant, whoever that might be, cannot be based <Col N="1108" /> outside Dublin. We do not need people sitting in offices around Leinster House. There is no advantage in that.</P>
    <P>On the role of Senators in terms of legislation, one of the sad aspects of this House is that one is actually dependent on the integrity and strength of the Minister presenting legislation as to whether the views of this House are taken on board by the Department officials. Some Ministers are very good at listening to what we have to say&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;but there are others who never listen, or do not appear to listen, and on occasions appear to be ruled by the officials in their Departments. That is sad. While I may not always agree with many of the ideas promoted by people on the Opposition benches, I recognise the validity and importance of them and we should be more open in that regard. That is what the legislative process and this House is about, listening to all the ideas put forward. I accept that some of them are off the wall but very often people on both sides of the House come up with ideas that should be taken on board but which are often dismissed because it may not suit the schedule of the Dáil, the Department or whatever. That is something I would like to change and perhaps it will be reflected in the change that will be brought about in terms of the role of the Seanad, parliamentary allowances etc. as a result of this legislation. I hope in the coming years we will see a greater involvement of the Seanad in the legislative process. It is easy to become complacent when a particular Government has a majority in the Seanad such as we have in this Government.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take these ideas on board. I am very serious about the maternity leave. I am equally serious about the ring-fenced funding for continuous training and development for all Members of the Oireachtas. If we invest in our parliamentarians, we strengthen our parliamentary system and that will make for a better society. I thank the Minister for coming into the House today. I hope he has listened to us and that he will accept some of our ideas.</P>

      <P>I will not delay matters. I welcome the Minister to the House. The changes that are being made through the Bill are welcome. The support we need is beginning to be put in place. When I first came into this House, Mr. Hyland, MEP, then Deputy, Deputy Harney, now Tánaiste, and I shared an office with Mary White, our secretary, and the Taoiseach's constituency secretary. When one considers that the Taoiseach's constituency secretary had to share an office with three Senators, it is obvious that progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a sea change in terms of the workload of Senators. When I first became a Member, one could not attempt to run a business and do the work that was required here. It was <Col N="1109" /> impossible. There will be a change in the way the Seanad is made up in the future because people who are involved in business will be unable to be Members of this House and do their own work at the same time. The work of the House is becoming a full-time job and as such it has to be adequately remunerated. I have seen business people elected to this House &ndash; I was one of them &ndash; who neglected their businesses and politics. In other words, they worked half and half in both jobs, but there is no place for that type of organisation in today's world.</P>
    <P>If we are to attract people into the Houses of the Oireachtas in the future, with all the opportunities that exist in the outside world, where will we get people of value when the maximum salary is paid on the first day one is elected? There is no incremental salary scale. An attempt is being made to have an incremental type of salary increase by virtue of long service, but there is no incremental benefit to one's service here. In any other profession or job, there is a value in service. How can we expect somebody who has had all the opportunities of education etc. to come into this House? The Government has made great progress in ensuring that those who want a job get a job, those who emigrate do so by choice and those who emigrated in the past immigrate by choice. If politics is to continue to play a part, we must be able to attract people who are willing to consider legislation, sit on committees and be full-time Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes important changes which acknowledge services rendered in that a small long-service increment is being made available. The Bill also removes the anomaly whereby Members pay 6% of their salaries into a pension fund from which they derive no benefit as the maximum allowance is paid after 20 years' service. I am delighted the Bill acknowledges that we were topping-up a pension scheme from which we received no benefit and I thank the Minister for realising the necessity for such a change.</P>
    <P>The changes regarding payments to party leaders and office holders were overdue. There is now an acknowledgement that the work of the Leader, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and office holders is becoming more difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their general welcome for this legislation. The titles of the two Bills are somewhat confusing. One would think one Bill concerned <Col N="1110" /> the area covered by the other, and <i>vice versa</i>. These titles were decided upon by the parliamentary counsel, not the Department of Finance. This Bill was known in my Department as the audit of parliamentary leaders' allowances as that issue was its genesis. The other Bill concerns the pensions of Oireachtas Members and other matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor has tabled an amendment regarding secretaries, an issue to which Senator Bonner also referred. During Senator Ryan's contribution, I made the general point that Senators are not elected for particular constituencies. I wish to outline how I will address the problem of resourcing the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In the 1996 Act, my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, decided that the party leaders' allowance would be based on the number of Deputies. The change in this Bill is that the allowance will now also take account of the number of Senators. The rates and ratios are also being increased so political parties will receive more money.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Deputy Quinn decided that it would be fair to also give money to Independent Deputies. The amount given to such Deputies is, roughly, the average of the sum given to parties divided by the number of Deputies. As a result, Independent Deputies receive about £11,000, but this figure will be increased to £22,000. However, these allowances must be used for parliamentary purposes.</P>
      <P>There was some debate in the Dáil as to whether these allowances should be audited. For nine months I have been meeting the leaders of political parties, including the smaller parties. In the case of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton was leader at the start of this process, but Deputy Noonan is now leader. Experts looked at the proposals and suggested refinements. No one referred to an audit of the amount given to Independent Deputies until Deputy Mitchell raised the issue last week. There is a significant difference between giving approximately £1.5 million to the major political parties, over £800,000 to the Labour Party and £22,000 to Independent Deputies. However, I stress this money must be used for parliamentary purposes.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of the resourcing of secretarial assistants, a matter which could also be raised under the next Bill. One of the recommendations of the inquiry by the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts was for the establishment of an Oireachtas commission. The report also highlighted other issues. I am proceeding with the establishment of an Oireachtas commission. The heads of the Bill will be drafted, sent to the parliamentary counsel and I hope they will be included in a formal Bill by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process will be simple. At present the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is given a Vote every year and various matters must be dealt with. The office has an Accounting Officer and there is ongoing communication with the Department of Finance. However, there are always rows and at the end of the year I receive <Col N="1111" /> representations from sub-committee meetings by my good colleague, Deputy Killeen, concerning various matters.</P>
    <P>Under my proposals the Oireachtas will be administered by the Oireachtas commission. The majority of members of the commission will be parliamentarians. The commission will also include a representative of the Minister for Finance, the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, and, presumably, the Clerk of the Dáil will be the Accounting Officer. The commission will receive an allocation of money with which it can do what it likes.</P>
    <P>Rather than annoying me or my successor as to what should be done, the commission will make these decisions and have all the hassle of how to address these great problems. The interesting question is how to arrive at the initial allocation. On the Order of Business in the Dáil today, Deputy Rabbitte gave the impression that we had referred this matter to a consultancy to decide. Advertisements appeared, the consultants have been appointed and they will carry out a baseline study on the needs of the Oireachtas, following which we will come up with a figure.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated will not just refer to one year, as such a figure would be subject to the annual Vote. This would lead to hassle with the Department of Finance and the Minister if there were any cutbacks. The sum given will be for a period of at least three years, following which it will be reviewed. This is a new innovation. Following the recent Buckley report, the sum allocated will deal with salaries of Members and grades down to principal officer.</P>
    <P>Other issues, such as those involving research assistants, will be decided by the commission. The commission may decide that Members should have an extra assistant, that Front Bench spokespersons should receive an additional salary or whatever. All these problems will be dealt with so we will not constantly argue over how to spend money, what the budgets for parliamentary trips should be or whatever. The commission can make such decisions and the best of luck to it.</P>
    <P>The commission will be an innovation. The heads of the Bill will be drafted and discussions have started in this regard. In the past day or so a letter was sent to the Clerk of the Dáil, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach to enter into discussions on various matters regarding their responsibilities and how matters will progress. That is my intention. There will be an Oireachtas commission which will receive a large Vote and will make decisions. This is not an innovation on my behalf, as similar arrangements apply in other jurisdictions</P>
    <P>Senator Cox made an interesting point regarding maternity leave. She pointed out that maternity leave is paid, but asked how she could signal her vote in the House while on such leave. I can see possible constitutional difficulties regarding voting arrangements. This issue applies to both Houses, but I do not think we will be <Col N="1112" /> able to overcome this problem. However, I will examine the issue. Senator Cox, whom I know very well, is the last person in the House known to have given birth to a baby. I hope she is not giving a broad signal on her future intentions in this regard but if she is, I welcome that also. To finish the earlier point, the Oireachtas Commission will undertake a study to arrive at a baseline figure, and work on from there.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan outlined the difficulties regarding the McKenna judgment, a matter also raised by Senator Connor who received a letter pointing out the difficulties involved. The unfortunate problem is that, perhaps, the judgment, as such, will have to be re-examined by the courts. Some have cast some interesting aspersions on what the commission had to do during the recent referenda in the light of the judgment. It had to give equal space to the arguments for and against the three issues. It must be somewhat difficult making up arguments against some of them. Leaving aside the Nice treaty referendum, there are other issues involved.</P>

      <P>That is it. I am sure I would make myself very popular with Senators Connor and Bonner for doing what they want regarding secretarial assistance. Would I be equally popular, however, if, after the election of either Senator Connor or Senator Bonner to Dáil Éireann, they were challenged and the election was declared null and void because they had a secretarial assistant in their constituencies? That might happen.</P>

      <P>These points are being considered by the Public Offices Commission. All these areas are coming into play. Senator Ryan made the interesting analogy about Ministers. Ministers are essentially covered in the course of their activities but not during an election campaign. This issue was mentioned the other day. All these interesting questions have come to light on account of the decision arising from the McKenna judgment. The Attorney General is a person of forceful opinions but he is actually not responsible for this matter. These are reasonable interpretations to take from the McKenna judgment.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their general welcome for the Bill. I had hoped to introduce these two particular Bills earlier in the session because the impression is always given that one just brings them forward at the end of a session. The reason they are being introduced now, however, is that I could not get them expedited through the legislative process until quite recently. I thank Senators for their support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Chair has had to rule my amendment out of order on the basis that it would impose a cost. I want to make a few points about the problem Members of the House have concerning the secretarial assistance available to them. My amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(13). That the secretarial service available to each Member of Seanad Éireann be based on one full-time secretary to each Seanadóir and that the working location of the secretary can be in a place other than in Leinster House by agreement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I did not make any reference to a constituency, or anything like that, in the amendment. This matter arises because I happen to be one of the Members of the House who, with another colleague and on a work sharing basis, has a secretary based where I live. That arrangement was agreed to back in 1998, and agreed subsequently for other Members of the House. I understand, however, Members on the Government side of the House later applied to have that concession but the Department of Finance intervened and stated it could not be allowed. As a result, there was correspondence between my party's staff administrator, the Department of Finance and the personnel section of the Office of the Houses of the Oireacchtas. With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I will read the relevant paragraph from that particular correspondence, which sets out the position:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of some staffing changes in the Seanad Office in recent weeks, one of your colleagues requested a similar arrangement with regard to his secretary. However, when permission was sought from personnel by me on this occasion it was refused by the Department of Finance. The relevant authorities in the Department of Finance, while conceding that Fine Gael sought and secured necessary per<Col N="1114" /> mission on two previous occasions, maintain that this permission should not have been granted. The personnel division has now agreed that in the case of three Senators who already have constituency-based secretaries &ndash; yourself, Senator Caffrey and Senator O'Dowd &ndash; this arrangement will be ring-fenced and left in place until the next Seanad election, following which no appointments of secretaries for Senators in their constituencies will be permitted. Following the next Seanad election, secretaries to Senators must continue to be based in Leinster House. Personnel section, on the advice of the Department of Finance, has explained to me that there are implications relating to the McKenna judgment in doing otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand what is meant by the McKenna judgment in relation to &ldquo;doing otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The McKenna judgment states that one cannot confer on somebody an unfair advantage through the use of public funds. Therefore, if the Senator is elected in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon, and was perceived to have had an unfair advantage over another candidate, it is implicit from the McKenna judgment that the whole election could be in trouble. That is the reason many would think it is overly zealous activity by the Referendum Commission to spell out the arguments for both sides, but to get over that problem it must be exactly equal. I do not think that Ms McKenna, who brought her action on another matter, ever thought it would imply what it does but it is the definitive judgment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, that is broadening it very much. As I understood it, the McKenna judgment was made on the basis of the rules that apply in the contesting of a referendum; it has nothing to do with a general election. They are separate issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My record shows that I am not a great advocate of what I would call a lot of nonsensical stuff that goes on in all kinds of areas. The Senator can take it that the McKenna judgment and matters arising from it relate to the issue that the use of public moneys, in whatever way, cannot be seen to confer advantage on one person over another, whether in a referendum or anything else. This matter was always there but it had never been interpreted in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently, there were some arguments in the newspapers that raised the question of whether Deputies would be entitled to use their offices in Leinster House once an election was called. The argument is that because they are no longer Deputies they must be equal to candidates who have never been in Leinster House. This is the way we are heading on the altar of correctness. That argument also relates to the use of <Col N="1115" /> Oireachtas envelopes during election campaigns. All these questions arise from the McKenna judgment. Perhaps they should have been investigated many years ago but they are there now.</P>
    <P>At the last election, all advisers, including many programme managers, took unpaid leave to overcome this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We risk confusing the McKenna judgment with what might happen in a general election as opposed to the conduct of a referendum. Patricia McKenna took the case on the basis of a referendum issue when she felt that the Government was spending public money encouraging people to vote in favour of what it was proposing. I have no great difficulty in supporting the idea that if a Government puts forward a proposal to be decided by the people in a referendum, it is right that it could use public money in putting the arguments in favour of it. However, that was the judgment given in the courts in relation to the conduct of referenda. I know that lawyers will give any kind of legal advice&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance gets stuck with these problems that other parts of the Civil Service do not want to solve or for which they want to blame somebody else. It is like colleagues in government who say that they cannot give money because the Minister for Finance will not let them. The reality is that I devolve the best part of £50 billion, £60 billion or £70 billion out of the Department. Sometimes I wonder why Ministers are being paid. It is their job to prioritise what they want and they can move the money. If they want more money to give to one particular area, they can come to me and say that is what they want the following year and I will go along with it. That is used against the Minister for Finance. The same thing is used about the Department of Finance when other areas of the public service will not make decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About two years ago the secretary of a Department came to me saying that it wanted to change its printing machine here in Leinster House. As it was going to be a more modern one it was going to cost more. I thought it was a reasonable request and granted it, but it ran into all kinds of difficulties as to whether that machine would be used for non-parliamentary purposes. We had to <Col N="1116" /> get some interpretation for that problem. We have gone significantly down this road in the way it is being interpreted.</P>
    <P>I can probably guess who Senator Connor's running mate would be in an election in Longford-Roscommon. However, what about a candidate in Longford-Roscommon who is not a member of any party or a member of a party who is not a Senator or Deputy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Your reputation is well founded on being a great protector of the Members of this House. This is a fundamental issue, the interests of the Members of this House. The Minister has given us the benefit of all his advice on these matters. However, there is nothing unreasonable about any Member of this House who has the right to a secretarial assistant to have that person located in a place other than Leinster House if that is convenient and can be agreed. Is there any Member on the benches opposite who disagrees with that? No, there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that this will go to the Oireachtas commission, but in the meantime the Minister might have a role to play. God knows when the Oireachtas commission will become effective. Each Member of this House should have at the very minimum a single secretarial assistant. Nobody in the House disagrees with me on that. Furthermore, the location of that secretarial assistant can be outside Leinster House as long as that can be agreed between the Member and the person employed. That is eminently reasonable. It might take two years before the Oireachtas commission is in place and until then the Minister has responsibility. Given the remaining lifetime of the Government, statutorily, it might never see the light of day. It will be the end <Col N="1117" /> of the year at least before even the heads of a Bill could be published.</P>
    <P>In the other House, more than one secretary per Deputy is needed. There should be research assistants also. I have experience of both Houses. I urge the Minister to hear this reasonable plea. There is not a colleague on the other side of the House who disagrees with what I am saying. I am taking advantage of this legislation, which has some relevance to this, to make these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I risk stretching the Cathaoirleach's not inconsiderable indulgence. There has been considerable speculation in the media that Patricia McKenna might choose to run for Dáil Éireann. If she did so, what would be the position regarding her MEP's office in Dublin? Who would regulate it and what would the regulation be? Under the aegis of the McKenna judgment would she be entitled to make use of the considerable resources she has and which she uses with considerable effect? There might be a certain delicious irony in that.</P>
      <P>The way systems interpret the law depends on what the system wants to make of it. I have seen constitutional judgments that were interpreted in the narrowest possible way to minimise expenditure. For instance there were court judgments about equality legislation and the narrowest possible interpretation was put on them to minimise expenditure. A Supreme Court judgment about referenda is now being reinterpreted with a breadth that could result in the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, driving his own car around the country during a general election. Any of his staff who are not established civil servants will be <i>de facto</i> redundant for the period. There has to be a rational balance here.

If people use the money for non-parliamentary activities they run the risk I referred to in the earlier part of the debate about Senator Connor and winning the election in Longford-Roscommon. The moneys given are not supposed to be used for other than parliamentary activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Until now none of the money given to the various parties has been subject to audit, but it is only supposed to be used for parliamentary activities. The fairly large sums of money given to party leaders have not been audited. The money was given for parliamentary activities. Sean McEntee who brought in this allowance in 1938, and was not very popular within Fianna Fáil for doing so, announced a principle with which I agree. He said the money should be given for the health of parliamentary democracy, it should be given to the Opposition to help the whole process, and he also said that the party leaders could decide where the money should go. It should not be subject to scrutiny with very good reason. Why should everyone else know what that parliamentary leader wants to do with the money? Why should Fianna Fáil know what the Fine Gael leader wants to do? He may have very good ideas as to what to do with his Deputies, the principle being announced in an era of non-communications. Sean McEntee asked why everyone else should know and left the decision at the discretion of the parliamentary leader. That is a principle I subscribe to and I would prefer not to have to bring a Bill like this before the House. It is not in the interest of anyone that it is known what the leader does with that money. It is his job to make his party the most effective to win the next election and to get into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During recent events and at tribunals accusations were made that the parliamentary leaders' allowance was given for what some construe were not parliamentary activities. I do not want to make a judgment as to whether they were, but according to the McEntee tenets of 1938, subscribed to over the years, the money has not been interfered with by any Minister for Finance. It has been given to the party leader for he or she to do with it what he or she would. It is interesting to know if these accusations of improper activities are true and we have decided to audit the parliamentary leaders' allowance. I have endeavoured to make it as light as possible on the basis of the McEntee principle. Senator Ryan and I would agree on liberals and I am sure he has noted that over the past 20 or so years the most illiberal <Col N="1120" /> people here are those who call themselves liberals.</P>

However, I give those who do not agree with me on any of these issues the right to be heard. There is a monstrous group in official Ireland that says those people cannot be heard at all. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that though I may disagree with you, I give you the right to be heard. I would prefer not to have to interfere with the McEntee tenets, but things have changed and we have to have more openness. The parliamentary leaders' allowance will be audited. That was not done up to now but I decided I would oppose this on Independents.</P>

      <P>The rules are being changed regarding the parliamentary leaders' allowance but no procedure is to be put in place for the Independents' allowance. What constitutes parliamentary expenditure?

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly conscious when I introduced a similar Bill in 1998 that despite detailed consultations, one case I considered meritorious had been left out of the Bill. This time I told dozens of my colleagues that I did not wish to have this happen again and, with that warning ringing in their ears, I arranged a succession of meetings with virtually <Col N="1122" /> every group in the Dáil and Seanad over a period of several months. The Bill includes virtually all proposals put to me which did not have too high a cost or significant knock-on effects across the public service.</P>
      <P>Despite this and despite my meeting many of those who would be affected, a few matters were raised in the past few days after the Bill was circulated. I was anxious to facilitate these changes, although there are dangers in making apparently simple changes to a corpus of legislation dating from 1938. The time available did not allow the full implications of those changes on the Bill to be worked out and I reluctantly abandoned that approach. I had already indicated that virtually all of these would be dealt with in the forthcoming Oireachtas Commission Bill.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the Oireachtas Commission Bill will be in place before the next election. If I am not in office myself, the Bill might not be pushed by the new Administration, whoever that might be, or by another Minister for Finance, even if he or she was from my political party. I hope to have the Bill ready before the election and I am sure the Department of Finance will be anxious to progress it as quickly as possible. However, in case it does not, I intend to make sure the Bill is in place.</P>
      <P>There have been comments regarding the complexity of this Bill. These are understandable in that the Bill is lengthy. Legislation governing pay, pensions and other work conditions are scattered over individual statutes going back over 40 years and many subsections of those Acts have been amended several times in the interval. I have accepted the advice of the parliamentary counsel that the legislation governing the pay of Members of the Oireachtas, ministerial and parliamentary office holders and members of the Judiciary would benefit from some refinement, and this Bill tidies up some of those provisions by rewriting specific sections of the 1938 Act. Unfortunately, it involves repeating, word for word, various subsections of earlier Acts which are not being amended by this Bill. However, the changes proposed by the parliamentary counsel will serve to bring greater clarity to some important elements of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with each of three major strands which run through the Bill. The pay of Senators, like other Members of the Oireachtas, is examined from time to time by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector. The review body, which was established in 1969, is a standing body whose primary function is to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to higher public servants, members of the Judiciary, Members of the Oireachtas and other political office holders. The review body carries out general reviews of higher remuneration in the public sector every four years. Its most recent general review was carried out in the course of last year and its report was published by the Government at the end of January. In line with the established policy of <Col N="1123" /> accepting the recommendations of this independent review body, the Government decided to accept and implement the recommendations in its report.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the report concerning Members of the Oireachtas have already been put into effect by Government order. This Bill gives legislative effect to the recommendations of the review body concerning the payment of long service increments to Deputies and Senators and the payment of an allowance to Ministers of State who routinely attend meetings of the Government.</P>
    <P>The report of the review body recommended that the salary of a Dáil Deputy should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of principal &ndash; standard &ndash; in the Civil Service and that the salary of a Senator should be fixed as 70% of that of a Deputy and should be revised for the future on that basis. The review body went on to note that long service increments are payable to principals in the Civil Service. One long service increment is payable after three years satisfactory service at the maximum of the scale and a second is payable after six years satisfactory service at the maximum of the scale. A principal entering the grade at the minimum of the scale would have to serve seven years in the grade before becoming eligible for the first long service increment and ten years before becoming eligible for the second. The review body indicated that the introduction by the Government of long service increments for Deputies and Senators would not be incompatible with a link to the grade of principal, provided the service as a TD or Senator required to qualify for long service increments was comparable to that required of principals. The Government decided to introduce long service increments on this basis.</P>
    <P>The review body went on to say that the introduction of long service increments for Deputies and Senators should not result in a situation where different rates of remuneration apply to Ministers. This situation could come about because the remuneration of office holders is made up of an office holder's salary plus the salary of a TD or Senator. Accordingly, the application of long service increments could result in Ministers who are Members of the same House being paid differently, depending on whether they qualify as a TD for two, one or no long service increments. The review body considered that the principle that all Ministers are paid the same remuneration is an important one and that the arrangements for the introduction of long service increments should ensure that a common rate of remuneration continues to apply to Ministers and Ministers of State. Likewise, it considered that their introduction should not result in other office holders being paid in excess of the rates it recommended for their posts.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides that Deputies will be eligible for one long service increment after seven years and a further increment after <Col N="1124" /> another three years service &ndash; the same will apply to Senators. As a result of an amendment I introduced in the Dáil, total service in the Oireachtas will count towards the payment of long service increments, rather than just service in the House in which a Member is serving. Long service increments will apply with effect from 25 September 2000, the date of the review body report.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government decision on the phasing of the review body's recommendations, which applies to all groups covered by the report, long service increments will be introduced in four phases between 25 September 2000 and 1 April 2002. The rates in the Bill are for 25 September 2000, the first phase of the review body increases. Subsequent increases will be applied by Government order, with the full increases due being paid on 1 April 2002. In keeping with the recommendations of the review body, however, ministerial and parliamentary office holders will be paid the standard rate for a TD or Senator, as appropriate, and will not receive long service increments for the duration of their terms of office, regardless of their length of service in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The review body also considered the position of Ministers of State who routinely attend Government meetings. There are currently two such Ministers of State &ndash; the Minister of State with special responsibility as the Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State to the Government. The review body considered that these Ministers of State carry additional responsibility which warrants remuneration additional to that payable to other Ministers of State and that they should receive an allowance equivalent to that payable to the chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairpersons of certain other committees. Accordingly, the Bill provides that such an allowance may be paid to not more than two Ministers of State who routinely attend meetings of the Government and who are designated by Government order.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to add the position of assistant party Whip in the Dáil to the positions in the Dáil and Seanad that currently receive an allowance in recognition of the important work carried out by the Whips in ensuring the smooth running of Dáil business. This allowance will apply to parties with seven or more members in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One of the positions currently in receipt of an allowance is that of Leader of the Seanad. I need hardly remind Senators of the sterling work carried out by the Leader in organising the business of this House and the onerous responsibilities assumed by him. Accordingly, the Government has decided that the Leader should be paid as an office holder and that the allowance currently paid to him will become the salary attaching to the post.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that Deputies, Senators, ministerial and parliamentary office holders and those holding positions that attract allowances will be able to refuse a pay increase if they should so chose. It has long been a cause of concern to <Col N="1125" /> me that Members of the Oireachtas who express their concerns about pay increases for politicians find themselves in the unfortunate position of having no choice but to accept those pay increases themselves.</P>

      <P>I am happy to follow the established Government policy of accepting the recommendations of the independent review body which, since its establishment in 1969, has made recommendations on the remuneration of not just politicians but also members of the Judiciary and top posts right across the public service. These recommendations have at all times been based on in-depth research and careful assessment of the appropriate position of the posts concerned within the general economy. However, if any Member of this House believes that a pay increase is not appropriate, I see every reason for giving him or her the opportunity to refuse it. The Bill provides for this. A refusal will apply to a particular pay increase and further notice may be given if the individual wishes to refuse subsequent increases. An individual may later decide to rescind the refusal, but only from a current date, that is, arrears will not be paid. If there is any Member who is unhappy with a proposed pay increase, now is their opportunity to say thanks, but no thanks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is such a Member in this House but I told a Deputy in the Dáil in 1998 that I intended to oblige him on the next possible occasion. Bringing forward this section is my way of obliging him.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the sections which have to do with pensions. These are sections 11 to 19, inclusive, and section 29, which deal with pensions and severance allowances for office holders, section 27 which covers contributions to the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme, and sections 45 to 59, inclusive, which deal with transfer of pensionable service.</P>
      <P>I am introducing a number of amendments to the pension and severance allowance regime for Ministers and other office holders. I have reviewed these superannuation entitlements and come to the conclusion that a number of the existing provisions need to be amended to take account of the role and responsibilities of office holders and bring certain of the provisions relating to spouse's and children's pensions more into line with modern practice. In addition, I am providing for the transfer of pensionable service into and out of the pension schemes for Members of the Oireachtas, Irish Members of the European Parliament, the Judiciary and court officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will appreciate, the pension provisions of the office holders' pension scheme are complex. Sections 11 to 19, inclusive, of the Bill provide for certain amendments to the pension <Col N="1126" /> and severance payments available to office holders and their surviving spouses and children under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, to which I shall refer as &ldquo;the 1938 Act&rdquo; while speaking about office holder pensions. Besides providing for these amendments to the scheme, I am taking the opportunity, on the advice of the parliamentary counsel, to tidy up a number of the pension sections in the 1938 Act, which will help to explain the reason we are dealing with so many pages on pensions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, instead of an allowance, the Leader of the Seanad will be paid a salary as an office holder. The position will be pensionable as a secretarial office under the office holders' pension scheme and section 11 provides accordingly by naming the position of Leader of the House in Seanad Éireann as a secretarial office for the purposes of the scheme, with effect from 17 September 1997.</P>
    <P>At present, a former office holder who has the necessary service qualifies for a pension under the office holders' pension scheme if he or she is 55 years or older. However, it is possible for a person who is aged between 50 and 55 years to opt to take a discounted pension instead, which takes account of the increased length of time for which the pension will be payable. I propose to remove the option to take a discounted pension and reduce the minimum age for payment of pension under the scheme to 50 years. Section 12 of the Bill provides for these two changes by amending section 13A of the 1938 Act; however, section 12 of the Bill also rewrites subsection (5) of section 13A for the sake of clarity, mainly because it was too long. Section 12 of the Bill is, as a result, quite long because it breaks up subsection (5) into a number of more manageable subsections. The substantive changes are towards the end, in the amendments to subsection (7) of section 13A of the 1938 Act and the new subsections (9) and (10) of that section. The reduction in the age for payment of pension will apply from the date this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am reducing the minimum length of service needed to qualify for a pension under the office holders' pension scheme from the present three years to two years. Entitlement to maximum pension under the scheme accrues over ten years; this fast accrual reflects the responsibilities attaching to public office at this level. It is reasonable that the minimum period of service required to gain entitlement to a pension should also reflect the reality and the vicissitudes of life in political office.</P>
    <P>A person with two years' qualifying service will be entitled to a pension of 20% of the appropriate salary, building up to the existing 25% rate under the new office holders' scheme for three years' service. This change will apply to and in respect of all former office holders who have at least two but less than three years in office because I see no reason a person who was an office holder before now for at least two but less than three years should not be entitled to a pen<Col N="1127" /> sion for that service if present and future office holders are to have this entitlement. This change is being implemented by section 13 of the Bill, which inserts a new section 13AA in the 1938 Act and will apply from the date the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am also making changes to the rules of the office holders' pension scheme in so far as they affect an Attorney General who is not at the same time a Member of either House. Taking the case of an Attorney General who is a Member of either House, he or she is paid the same salary as a Minister and pensioned on that amount under the office holders' scheme. He or she is also paid a salary as a Member and the service as a Member is pensionable under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme. However, if the Attorney General is not a Member of either House, he or she is paid the same salary as a Minister and, in addition, an amount equal to a Deputy's salary. At present, that additional amount is not taken into account under the office holders' pension scheme. This is anomalous and I propose to rectify it.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill, accordingly, inserts a new section 13AB in the 1938 Act which enables this to be done. This change will apply, with effect from the date this Bill is passed, to and in respect of surviving former Attorneys General entitled to a pension under the office holders' pension scheme. An associated provision is included in section 17 of the Bill to allow a similar change to be made in the calculation of a severance allowance payable to an Attorney General who is not also a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill inserts a new section 13E in the 1938 Act which provides for an increase in a secretarial pension to take account of the new allowance payable to Ministers of State who regularly attend meetings of the Government. Payment of this allowance, which was recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, is dealt with later in section 40. Section 18 enables the allowance to be taken into account for severance payment purposes. I have also reviewed the provisions in the office holders' pension scheme for payment of benefits to spouses and children of former office holders. There are a number of outdated provisions in that area which I propose to amend with effect from the date this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The existing scheme allows a pension to be paid to the surviving spouse of a former office holder only where the marriage took place before or while the person held office. This is a very unusual provision and I am changing it to allow a spouse's pension to be paid regardless of when the marriage took place. The change is in section 15 of the Bill, which, on the advice of the parliamentary counsel, rewrites section 20 of the 1938 Act in its entirety for the sake of clarity. Section 15 of the Bill also makes two amendments to the provisions for payment of an allowance to the surviving children of an office holder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> At present, a child's allowance, as it called in this scheme, is payable only to the child of a marriage which took place before or while a person held office. In future, any child, stepchild or adopted child of a deceased office holder will be entitled to a child's allowance, subject to the rules of the scheme. The other amendment is that, for obvious equality reasons, I am extending to male children the present rule that a child's allowance to a female ceases on marriage.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill inserts three new sections, 20A, 20B and 20C, in the 1938 Act. The new section 20A confirms the existing practice that a child's allowance under the office holders' pension scheme is increased in line with general pay increases in the Civil Service. The new section 20B provides that a child's allowance can continue in payment for a child's lifetime where the child is permanently incapacitated and the incapacity arose before the child was 21 years. The new section 20C amends the provision whereby a spouse's pension ceases when the surviving spouse remarries. This provision is common to public sector pension schemes generally; however, it would normally be accompanied by a provision that payment of pension may recommence where there are compassionate grounds for doing so. I am amending the office holders' pension scheme to allow the Minister for Finance to reinstate a spouse's pension which has ceased on remarriage where the marriage has been annulled or dissolved or where there are compassionate grounds for doing so.</P>
    <P>Those are the changes I am bringing forward to the office holders' pension scheme as far as spouse's and children's benefits are concerned. I now address spouse's pensions for Members. During discussions on the Bill yesterday in the Dáil, a number of Deputies expressed concern about the poor financial situation in which some spouses of former Members can find themselves. I understand the concern that prompted these comments. The recent increases in Members' salaries, including the long-service increments which are being introduced by this Bill, will carry through into pensions for former Members and into spouses' and children's pensions that are now in payment.</P>
    <P>The pension terms for spouses of Members of the Oireachtas are very similar to those relating to spouses' pension schemes in the public sector generally and must be considered in that light. However, I have been considering some changes to the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme to take account of certain anomalies and to deal with representations that have been made to me. Any changes that are made will carry through into spouses' pensions. I hope that any changes I make will help to alleviate the plight of spouses of former Members who are in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>In my early years as a Member, I made the acquaintance of many other Members of the Houses outside the Dáil Chamber and discussed with them topics political and sporting. Our conversations rarely extended to our remuneration, <Col N="1129" /> other than in terms of banter about one and other's personal economic situations. In retrospect, we displayed, as a group, a degree of unthinking or disregard of personal economic welfare. Many years ago there was a cartoon strip in which the male explained that he took all the important decisions in his household &ndash; namely, what should be national policy on sanctions against Iraq, Third World aid and industrial and regional matters &ndash; while his wife took the minor decisions regarding where they lived, what schools the children attended, etc. There was a touch of that about many of us in the past, when we displayed a degree of unthinking disregard for personal economic welfare. I hope that more recent entrants to these Houses allow real life to intrude more often when it comes to taking decisions important to family welfare. Amending the Members' pension scheme is a matter for regulation rather than primary legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the replacement of section 31(1) of the 1938 Act which grants a special allowance to a former Taoiseach who has not reached the age of 55 and who has not applied for a discounted pension. Since I am reducing the age for payment of a pension from 55 to 50 and removing the option to take a discounted pension, it is necessary to change the reference to age 55 in section 31 to age 50 and to remove the reference to a discounted pension.</P>
    <P>Section 27 deals with the contributions deducted from Members' salaries for the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme. Subsection (1) is a technical amendment to section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, which is the legal basis for the pension deductions. Section 6A as it stands is based on there being a single rate of pay for Deputies and a single rate for Senators. The amended text takes account of the introduction of long-service increments, which are to be pensionable, so that contributions to the scheme can be deducted from them.</P>
    <P>A number of Members with well in excess of 20 years' service made the point that they must continue to contribute to the Members' pension scheme even though they have long since earned full entitlement to pension. Section 27(2) provides that deductions from salary towards the scheme will cease to be made when a person has served for 20 years as a Member of the Oireachtas. Deductions from pensionable allowances will cease when a member has paid deductions from allowances in respect of an aggregate period of 20 years. The section also provides that, where Members have already paid contributions for more than 20 years, any excess contributions paid since 26 June 1997 will be refunded.</P>
    <P>Section 29 repeals a provision relating to spouses' pensions under the office holders' pension scheme, which was included on a stand-alone basis in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1952, and which is now incorporated in the revised section 20(4) of the Minis<Col N="1130" /> terial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, being inserted by section 15 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 10 of the Bill, incorporating sections 45 to 59, provides for the transfer of pensionable service into and out of the Oireachtas pension scheme, the pension scheme for Irish Members of the European Parliament and the pension schemes for members of the Judiciary and court officers. Long-standing arrangements are in place to allow employees of public sector bodies which are members of the public sector and local authority transfer networks to transfer service when they move to another body in the networks. It has not, however, been possible for Members of the Oireachtas, members of the Judiciary or court officers to transfer service. This Bill introduces provisions which will allow this and it will apply also to Irish Members of the European Parliament whose pension scheme is based on the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme.</P>
    <P>The mechanism will be that transfer of service will be possible between the pension schemes for Members of the Oireachtas, Irish Members of the European Parliament, Members of the Judiciary and court officers, the Civil Service, bodies which are designated as approved organisations for the purposes of the public sector transfer network and any other body designated by the Minister for Finance under this legislation. The detailed operation of the arrangements will be subject to terms and conditions determined by the Minister for Finance. Those terms and conditions will take account of the enhanced pension accrual rates which apply to Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the Judiciary and court officers.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to transfer service in respect of which a pension has already come into payment. It will be possible to transfer service where a lump sum only has been paid or where contributions have been refunded, provided the lump sum or refunded contributions are paid back in respect of the previous service which a person wishes to transfer.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 to 48 define a number of terms and give the Minister for Finance power to designate organisations as approved organisations for the purposes of Part 10. Sections 49 to 52 set out the basic entitlement of Members of the Oireachtas, Irish MEPs, members of the Judiciary and court officers to transfer service. Section 53 provides that transfer of service will be subject to terms and conditions determined by the Minister for Finance or. as appropriate, terms and conditions agreed by the Minister with a designated organisation. In determining the extent to which service can be transferred, account may be taken of differences between pension schemes in terms of the length of time required to earn entitlement to maximum benefit under a scheme. If the transfer of service involves an organisation which is designated as an approved organisation, the terms and conditions agreed between the Minister and the organisation must either provide for the payment of a contribution or set out agreed reciprocal arrangements for the transfer of service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> Section 54 provides that, once service has been transferred, it cannot reckon for superannuation purposes in the organisation from which the service was transferred. Section 55 prohibits transfer of service where a pension has already come into payment. It allows the transfer of service in respect of which a lump sum or gratuity has been paid or contributions have been refunded, provided the lump sum, gratuity or contributions, plus interest, are paid back. Section 56 deals with the detail of applying for transfer of service under these provisions. Section 57 allows pension schemes to be amended to take account of these new transfer provisions where the authorities who are responsible for the scheme would not already have the power to make such amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides for the making of orders under Part 10 and requires that such orders must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Finally, as far as pensions are concerned, section 59 enables the trustees of the Houses of the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme to make and receive transfer payments for the purposes of Part 10.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with postal facilities for Members and section 35 deals with payment of the general expenses allowance to the Attorney General. As Members are aware, the provision of free postal facilities to Members under existing legislation is subject to the requirement that those facilities be used solely for matters arising out of a Member's parliamentary duties. I am aware that there has been some concern on the part of Members in relation to the operation of the existing provision and, specifically, to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo;. The case has been made that the existing interpretation of that term does not properly reflect or facilitate Members' needs in regard to their normal daily usage of the free postal facilities. I acknowledge that difficulties have arisen in this regard and that those difficulties have arisen, in large part, owing to the absence in existing legislation of a precise definition of the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo;. The difficulty is in deciding what precisely that term encompasses. In my opinion, it is debatable whether one could actually come up with a satisfactory, comprehensive and workable definition as to what exactly constitutes parliamentary duties for the purposes of determining Members' entitlements to free postal facilities.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that it would be impractical to attempt to lay down in legislation detailed parameters on the use of free postal facilities. In the absence of a precise and workable definition of parliamentary duties, it seems that the only practical alternative is to remove that phrase from the legislation. I am proposing, therefore, in section 33, to delete the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo; from section 2 of the 1962 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 37 enables the general expense allowance which is currently paid to all office holders <Col N="1132" /> who are Members of the Oireachtas to be paid also to an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Oireachtas. The allowance is to meet costs necessarily incurred by office holders in the performance of the duties of their office which will not otherwise be reimbursed. However, existing legislation provides for the payment of the allowance to office holders only if they are also Members of the Oireachtas. An Attorney General who is not a Member of the Dáil or Seanad would not be entitled to receive the allowance. This anomaly is being removed and the provision will be backdated to June 1997.</P>
    <P>All that remains is to introduce section 20, which deals with the remuneration and tenure of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Seanad Éireann. In the course of the review of issues affecting parliamentarians, the question arose of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle remaining in office during the period when the Dáil was dissolved. The general assumption was that this could not be done because there was not during that period any Dáil for which his deputy chairmanship function needed to be exercised. However, the position became less clear when legal advice was sought.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Constitution for a Ceann Comhairle to be re-elected to the Dáil without standing for election, but there is no provision in the Constitution, legislation or even Standing Orders to retain a Ceann Comhairle who does not wish to be elected to the new Dáil. However, both the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad are Members of the Presidential Commission which can be required to act during the period of dissolution. It is, therefore, constitutionally necessary to ensure that the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad will be retained in office to ensure that the Presidential Commission, which may have to exercise its function during a dissolution, will be properly and fully constituted. Since under the Constitution their positions, should they be incapacitated or unavailable, are taken by the Deputy Chairmen, it was necessary to make the same provision for the latter.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, yesterday, I stated that the numerous Acts on the behaviour of Members should be codified in one piece of legislation. The same applies to this Bill as the legislation on Members' pay and pensions stretches over 40 years encompassing a vast number of statutes, which the Minister listed and I will not repeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature for us is that Senators will receive a long-term service increment after seven years and a further one after 10. As many Senators serve in the Dáil, it is welcome that the Minister accepted a Dáil amendment that all Oireachtas time will be calculated and service as Deputy and Senator will not be counted separately. The review group recommended that <Col N="1133" /> Members of both Houses receive long-term increments similar to civil servants. It also recommended that Deputies receive the salary of a principal officer and Senators 70% of that, which is a fair way of dealing with this issue. In the past, when we got a pay increase, it was published three or four times and the public believed that we received three or four increases. The Buckley review and the review group no longer apply as we are linked to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Leader of the Seanad be treated as an office-holder for salary purposes, back dated to 19 September 1997. We welcome this but a similar provision ought to be made for the Leader of the Opposition and I will table an amendment to address that. Under the Bill, the minimum length of service to qualify for a pension under the office-holders' pension scheme is reduced from three years to two.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes the restriction that Members can use postal facilities only for parliamentary duties. Does this give discretion to a Member to use the post as he or she wishes? I wanted to help worthwhile voluntary organisations in my constituency with postal facilities but was prohibited from doing so. Can I help them now?</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach will retain their offices until the election of a new Dáil or Seanad, to ensure the proper composition of the Presidential Commission, which may have to exercise its functions during a dissolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to introduce further changes to the Members' pension scheme to eradicate anomalies, which will be done by regulation, not legislation. Will the Minister consider my proposition that time spent in this House by former Deputies will count as Dáil time for pension purposes? This is important when a person is in his or her last Oireachtas term. I welcome that the Minister is improving spouses' pensions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for his courage in introducing it and similar measures which improve the financial plight of Members, for which we are all grateful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's introduction of the Bill, his acceptance of the Buckley report and the measure bringing the position of Senators into line with that of Deputies. A great anomaly arising from percentage increases was that the gap between the remuneration of Members of the Upper House and the Lower House grew wider. I thank the Minister for accepting that the salary of a Senator should be 70% of the salary of a Deputy. I especially compliment the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, on his tenacity in promoting this proposal and having it debated. From 1997 he, other Senators and I made an issue of this because we were conscious of our pension entitlements. This ratio is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this House for 12 years and 10 years ago took unpaid leave of absence from my job. Members know that I experienced difficult times. I lived on a shoestring for many years, sup<Col N="1134" /> porting a growing family in second and third level education. My wife's running a full-time constituency office benefited me. As I stated on another Bill, there was no remuneration for that until recently, and it is less than £4,000 a year. That is why I drive a 1993 car.</P>
    <P>The Minister courageously addresses the salary issue. It will enable people who are not wealthy to participate in public life. Otherwise membership of the Oireachtas would be limited to those with the private means to support themselves, which is a bad basis for democracy. People looking back on the Minister's decision will say that he afforded the opportunity to individuals from all walks of life to enter public life and occupy a rightful position in the Oireachtas. I welcome also his decision on spouses' pensions and the retired. I knew a person who served 11 years as a Deputy. Before he passed away recently, he received a pension of £50 per month, which is extraordinarily low. Many retired Members, and surviving spouses of deceased Members, receive low pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister addresses many issues in this Bill. There are areas that involve Ministers, a Minister of State and the Leader of the House. It is appropriate that the Leader should be an office holder. The salary involved will not be of major benefit on a weekly or monthly basis but will be of benefit for pension purposes which is important. Senator Doyle spoke about pensions and people in all walks of life are concerned with how they will provide for themselves and their spouses later. There is a massive amount of attention on anybody who spends some years in the Houses of the Oireachtas and they deserve at least the comfort of having a pension they can reasonably live on or that their spouse can live on in the event of their death. That would be some consolation to people who have given a lot of their adult life to the public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken important decisions &ndash; the provisions of this legislation are testimony to that &ndash; and is to be complimented. He has opened in a practical way the opportunity for people from all walks of life to stand for the Houses of the Oireachtas in the knowledge that they will not fall into debt as a result. I have discussed Members' financial position many times over the years. The Minister said today that we talked about everything rather than people's financial position, except in a vague way. My information is that most Members who are full-time politicians have extremely high overdrafts during their time in the House, and I have personal experience of that. This legislation will take the worry and the burden off not just the Members but also their families, and I commend the Minister on his initiative in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Senator Finneran referring to former Members of the House. I recall a conversation with the late Senator McGowan about three years ago. He told me that <Col N="1135" /> after almost 40 years in politics he felt remunerated and looked after for the first time. The Bill tidies various pieces of legislation in relation to officers of the Dáil and Seanad. It also relates to ministerial and Minister of State pensions and, above all, the long-term service increment to Members of both Dáil and Seanad. I was fortunate to be outside the House for many years when my family were young and I was in a position to build up a business. I would not like to have been here in my family's formative years. Now I can give my time to politics and I appreciate that Members are being properly remunerated.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the change from the allowance system to the officer position for remuneration to the Leader of the House, particularly for pension purposes. The Bill regularises an unusual situation which has arisen in relation to the presidential commission. There was an anomaly in the case where the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach were not offering to remain in the House.</P>
      <P>Part 6 of the Bill provides for changes in the postal situation for Members. There were times that one wondered whether one should use an envelope, and I welcome the clarification on this. Lest the media think that any Tom, Dick or Harry can use the envelopes, we as Members appreciate that their use is now clarified.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for payment to assistant party Whip in the Dáil and for an increased salary for the two Ministers of State who routinely attend Cabinet meetings. Both Ministers have huge responsibilities and I am delighted to see that is now recognised. Part 10 of the Bill facilitates the transfer of pensionable service into outside schemes for Members of the Oireachtas and for the Judiciary and court officers, which is welcome. The Minister made huge changes in the self-employed pensions schemes in the Finance Bills he introduced and it is right that whatever entitlements we have here can be transferred, particularly in light of the insecurity of the job.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that, due to the review group, salaries are now aligned to some formula. The salary for a Dáil Deputy, and now 70% of that to Senators, will encourage people of high quality. There is still the insecurity of getting elected but at least&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;while here one is getting fair remuneration for one's work. The minimum age for payment of pensions has been reduced to 50. I appreciate the removal of the anomalies where wives of Ministers had difficulties and where only children born by a certain time were recognised. I would like to see widows of former Members properly looked after. That may have been suggested in the Dáil also. The Minister should examine the 25% that wives of former Members get as pensions. Some of these Members died suddenly and left young families and wives to try <Col N="1136" /> to survive. The wives were the backbone to many of those Members, particularly the Senators who did not have the use of secretarial services.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and feel sure it will have a safe passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. The question of pensions has been raised. Most Members are concerned about pensions for their spouses. As Minister with responsibility for the public service as well as Minister for Finance, I realise that a small change is not a problem as such in that particular area but a problem arises with the knock-on effects. I have looked at this area of pensions for officers etc. and I have some ideas in mind which I hope to be in a position to put into effect before the next election.</P>
      <P>As my speech indicated and Senator Joe Doyle mentioned, various Acts going back 60 years have dealt with this area. We resisted the temptation to consolidate, but will try to do so at a future date. I will deal with questions concerning other Parts of the Bill on Committee Stage. I agree with Senator Finneran's remarks on financial affairs as when I was a back bench Deputy, I gave financial advice to many Members of all parties. One thing all Deputies and Senators have in common is that they spend so much time looking after everyone else's affairs that they neglect their own. Senator Doyle and I have been here long enough to have known many Members who entered politics having established fine businesses. They ended up with nearly nothing because they neglected their businesses for the sake of public service.</P>
      <P>I recall being given strong advice by a Deputy in late 1977 or early 1978, who told me about the changes in his circumstances since he entered the House. Things turned around for him in the interim, but a fair element of luck was attached to the reversal of his situation. Senators Joe Doyle, Cassidy and Bonner know of many such cases. I do not know any ex-Member of the Oireachtas who was better off financially when leaving the House than when they entered. I can give chapter and verse, going back 60 or 70 years, of the opposite situation. Without going into the affairs of colleagues on either side of the House or from my time as an accountant, I can say that politicians are the worst managers of personal finance as they are tied up with running the political affairs of their parties and looking after constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran referred to increasing overdrafts and I wish to respond with a funny aside. After changes were made in 1998 which allowed certain allowances to be backdated, many were given a back payment of allowances. A colleague from another party said shortly afterwards, in a jocose way, that his bank manager was a little concerned as for the first time ever his accounts were in the black. The bank manager thought my colleague was on the take. Most Deputies and Senators will have had similar experiences. As Senators from my party are aware, I do not <Col N="1137" /> believe that politicians should demean themselves by being afraid of what is written about them. It must not be thought that we will not be respected. Senator Bonner and I share the same profession and, like me, he knows of no politician who goes to the cheapest accountant or doctor in the street. I have made it a goal of mine, as Minister for Finance, to try to improve the position of Members. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

Senator Doyle's amendment would have meant that the leader of the Opposition in the Seanad would be paid a salary equivalent to that of the vice-chair of a committee, but he already receives an allowance of equivalent amount. The provisions in the Bill mean that the Leader of the House will not receive one penny of back pay, although his allowance has been backdated to 7 July 1997. I have simply changed the system in order that the Leader's allowance can be counted for pension purposes from the 1997 date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Senators might think the Leader of the House is to be given a great amount of pay, I am legislating for him to be seen as an office holder in order that the amount he would have <Col N="1138" /> been given since 1997 becomes eligible for consideration for pension purposes. Senator Doyle and others may argue that if such a provision is made for the Leader of the House, it should be done for the Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad. This would not be worthwhile, however, as the leader of the Opposition in the Seanad already receives the amount that Senator Doyle's amendment would have provided. He is simply not becoming an office holder, which would have given him a different rate of accruing for pension purposes. The Leader's current salary counts for pension purposes in the same manner as any Deputy or Senator's salary, but he will not qualify for an office holder's pension until the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I understand the thinking behind the amendment, but Senator Doyle can rest assured that the Leader of the House is not being given any extra money. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes, my officials will be happy to address this matter in greater detail.</P>

      <P>As chairman of the Seanad Committee on Members' Interests, I am aware of the various concerns expressed during the years regarding all the difficulties experienced by Members. As a number of Senators said, the House only sat one day a week many years ago when a Member's salary was 75% of the salary of a Dáil Member. In 1961 a Deputy was paid £1,000 annually while a Senator received £750. Nowadays the House sits three or four days a week. All the changes made up to now have been greatly appreciated and it is hoped our salaries will reach 75% or 80% of the salary of Dáil Members in years to come.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done a great deal for the well-being of Oireachtas Members who have given years of service. I record our appreciation for what he has done for us in order that our families can survive after we are gone. Nobody has ever become wealthy as a result of being a Member of the Oireachtas, as the Minister said, but Members will be able to maintain a standard of living to which they have been accustomed prior to election to the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Title>Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to provide for the enactment of new legislation to establish an independent standards authority to regulate the safety of adventure activity centres and providers. Specifically, it will allow for the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority; mandatory registration of adventure centres and providers with the authority for specified activities; mandatory codes of safe operating practice for specified adventure activities; implementation of a regulatory scheme, involving inspection of centres and providers for adherence to safety codes and powers for the authority to order cessation of the provision of any or all adventure activities in the case of failure to observe safety codes.</P>
      <P>The origins of the Bill lie with the canoeing accident that took place on the evening of 18 February 1995 at Dunmore East, County Waterford where two young people tragically died when they were swept out to sea in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. The group of individuals involved in the canoeing expedition were under the unofficial leadership of a trainee adventure centre instructor. My Department carried out a review of the accident following which an intensified safety awareness effort aimed at the marine leisure sector was launched by the Department and organisations involved in water sports safety. Mr. Michael Davies, the father of Ross Davies, one of those who lost their lives in the accident at Dunmore East, campaigned intensively since the tragedy to have the activities of adventure centres, which operate on a commercial basis, regulated from the safety perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1998 Deputy Finucane introduced a Private Member's Bill, Adventure Centres (Young Persons' Water Safety) Bill. That Bill, which was debated in the other House at the end of March 1999, was based largely on the legislative framework introduced in the United Kingdom in 1995. It proposed that a new licensing and policing scheme for adventure centres be established by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority. The general view of Members of the other House was that regulation of the sector was necessary. However, it was felt that the Adventure Centres (Young Person's Water Safety) Bill did not go far enough as it only referred to water based activities. It was believed that any new legislation should extend to all adventure activities. The former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, undertook during the debate in the other House <Col N="1142" /> to bring forward such a Bill as soon as possible. As part of this process, Deputy Woods, established an interdepartmental working group to undertake a detailed examination of the issues and consider the possible regulation of adventure activities. It was, therefore, agreed in the House that the Private Member's Bill would stand in abeyance until the results of the interdepartmental working group examination were known. I compliment Deputy Finucane who spent a lot of time working on and researching this issue. He, more than most, was responsible for bringing the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>The working group was representative of Departments and Government agencies and charged with making recommendations aimed at enhancing safety in adventure centres. The group consulted widely and received submissions from a number of interested persons and organisations with an interest in adventure activities. It employed a consultancy company to ascertain the size of the sector in Ireland and the possible impact any safety legislation would have on it. It also investigated the safety systems governing adventure activities in operation in other countries.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental working group completed its examination and published its report in June 1999. It found that there was little risk to participants from the adventure activities themselves due to the generally high safety standards in operation in the sector in Ireland. The evidence collected suggested that a safe environment for those availing of their services was provided by a combination of highly professional and safety conscious operators. The group, however, found that there was a case for the statutory regulation of adventure centre activities in the country. It recommended that a statutory authority should be established to oversee the regulation of the sector and advise the appropriate Minister on all aspects of its set up and operation.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that the encouragement of high safety standards should be the aim of the regulatory regime. It felt this was particularly true in respect of that part of the sector which had not participated in the existing voluntary inspection and approval scheme for providers of adventure activities established by the Association for Adventure Activities, AFAS, the co-ordinating body for most of the national governing bodies for adventure sports. This scheme, with the Irish Sailing Association's independent scheme for recognised teaching establishments, has been the primary mechanism for establishing standards of safety at adventure centres and is mainly based on the qualifications of the staff working at the centres.</P>
    <P>However, the scheme is voluntary and there are no sanctions available to force the inclusion of adventure centres in it. This has led to a sizeable part of the sector opting to remain outside it. The working group was unable to draw conclusions on the danger to participants of this part <Col N="1143" /> of the sector, but it is to be expected that greater dangers to public health and safety occur in sectors or parts of sectors not subject to some form of external scrutiny or monitoring, either through statutory control or voluntary safety standards schemes.</P>
    <P>The working group recommended that regulation should take the form of compulsory adherence to a set of safety codes in centres, which would be required to notify or register with the statutory authority as providers of certain specified adventure activities. The statutory authority should, in turn, oversee an inspectorate which would visit and inspect all notified or registered centres, initially focusing on those that did not participate in the voluntary scheme and those that cater for children and young people. Significantly, the group proposed that the inspectorate would be entitled to direct centres which do not demonstrate adherence to the safety codes to cease providing activities. If common sense was applied, there would not be any necessity for legislation. By introducing this Bill, we do not wish to be spoilsports, but we must take account of the fact that the regulations for activity centres, whether land based or water based, must be tightened up.</P>
    <P>The group concluded that the sector encompassed by the current voluntary approval schemes probably does not require regulation as standards and internal safety ethos are high and likely to remain so in the future through the current approach of standards setting, implementation and monitoring through the joint involvement of the national governing bodies and providers. However, the group pointed out that centres and providers outside the current voluntary schemes might operate at less than adequate safety standards ,thereby exposing participants to unacceptable risk. It was for these reasons that the working group recommended that a statutory authority with responsibility for drawing up safety guidelines or codes for prescribed providers of adventure activities and enforcing these guidelines should be established.</P>
    <P>In July 1999 the Government accepted in principle that there was a need for a statutory regime to regulate safety in adventure centres. The Association for Adventure Sports was in August 1999 tasked by the Department of Marine and Natural Resources with undertaking a wide-ranging consultation process among adventure activity centres and providers to assist in formulating the relevant legislation. The blueprint document was presented by AFAS in July 2000. Many of both the blueprint recommendations and those of the interdepartmental working group have been taken into account in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The function of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority will be to promote, encourage, foster, facilitate and regulate the safe operation of adventure activities. To this end, it will be empowered to administer schemes and grants, procure or provide educational, training or advis<Col N="1144" /> ory services and carry out research. It will also advise me on matters relating to adventure activities. I will be able to confer additional functions on the authority, by way of order, after consultation with the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a definition of adventure activities and 13 activities are covered by this definition. These are hill-walking in areas more than 300 metres above sea level; orienteering in areas more than 300 metres above sea level; caving; dinghy sailing; kayaking; canoeing; surfing with a surf board; wind-surfing; scuba-diving; snorkelling; abseiling; archery and rock climbing.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage a number of Deputies referred to the definitions of adventure activities included in the Bill and questioned the absence of certain other activities from these definitions. In response on Committee Stage, I provided clarification that the definitions in the Bill reflect only those activities which are widely provided in activity centres and for which approved standards have been established. I accept the point made by many Deputies, however, that there are other activities which could be covered by this legislation and I have noted, in particular, their suggestions for the inclusion of certain types of activities such as raft building, mountain biking, gorge walking and equine-related pursuits.</P>
    <P>As I have said, activities are being provided which can reasonably be described as adventure activities and which could, in time, be included under this legislation. The current difficulty, however, is that many of these activities do not have recognised standards and it is my intention to ask the authority immediately on its establishment to review the range of adventure activities, current or in prospect, in adventure centres and to carry out appropriate professional risk analysis and assessment, following which it might recommend the addition of the relevant activity to the definition.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that where further activities are proposed, following thorough and professional assessment by the authority, I will act immediately to have such activities included. It is for this reason that a provision has been included in the Bill to cater for the amendment to the definition of adventure activities, in consultation with the authority, by adding or deleting items from this list by order.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a definition of an adventure activities operator as meaning a person who provides to members of the public for payment or reward training, instruction, supervision or leadership in an adventure activity or facilities, including equipment for hire at a specified location, for the carrying on of an adventure activity. Provision has been included to cater for an amendment to this definition, if necessary.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the definition of a provider in the Bill covers only those who provide adventure activities on a commercial basis. It does not cover schools or other educational establishments, which is a complex area. In some instances, schools engage in adventure activities, <Col N="1145" /> but on an individual, local or preparatory level rather than a commercial basis. In my area of south Wexford, many schools have visited the outdoor activity centre in Ramsgrange. It has been agreed with the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children that at this stage the direct provision of adventure activities in schools to school children should not be included in the definition. This matter will require further detailed investigation, however, and it is proposed to leave this to the authority to examine after it has been established. New regulations would perhaps make schools, particularly those less well off, unwilling to undertake adventure activities. However, even though they are not covered by the Bill, it is anticipated that such institutions may wish to adhere voluntarily to the codes of practice the new authority will develop.</P>
    <P>The focus of the interdepartmental working group was to examine the safety of adventure activity provision where facilities are provided for younger people in particular. It noted that the conduct of adventure activities is complex and wide-ranging in terms of participation, activities and mixes of activities, locations, objectives, formats and contexts. It ranges from limited solo excursions on land or at sea by individuals to fully developed, highly structured participation on a commercial basis in which the activity is overseen by instructors and an adventure centre management. In its report, the group recommended that the definition of providers in the legislation should primarily include those providing activities on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, however, that the protection of young people has been a priority of mine in promoting this legislation. It was the loss of two young canoeists which, tragically, prompted the preparation of a statutory framework for safety in adventure centres. Living on the Hook peninsula, I had a very personal interest in the tragedy that brought about this Bill because when the canoe overturned, the people involved swam towards the shore just below my house. While the instructor made it to the shore, tragically one of the young boys was about 100 yards offshore when he felt he could do no more. The tragedy happened in the dark of night. They could not see where they were going and this boy just gave up. It was with great sadness that I had to report that accident. I have a very personal interest in that incident. Had this legislation been in place at the time, the lives of those two boys, and indeed many others, would have been saved. This Bill will be regarded as one of the best Bills to come before these Houses in the lifetime of this Dáil, and perhaps others.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns expressed by several Deputies on Second Stage that school children should have access to the best possible safety practices where they engage in adventure activities. The House will be aware that where a school contacts an adventure centre to provide adventure activities to its pupils, the provision of such <Col N="1146" /> activities will be covered by the statutory safeguards in the Bill. I accept some situations will arise where school staff will provide adventure training or instructions to pupils directly and that currently this provision is outside legislation. However, where a commercial transaction is involved, that is, where the pupils pay the school, an individual teacher or other staff member directly, or through the school management, such provision comes within the scope of the Bill. In effect, the school or staff member becomes an adventure activity operator for the purposes of the law. I assure the House that I will ask the authority, which will include a representative of the Department of Education and Science, to consider as a matter of priority the way to ensure that school children have access to the highest safety standards either through this legislation or other statutory provision.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, it will be mandatory for adventure activity operators to register with the authority in respect of specified adventure activities. The authority will develop codes of practice for specified adventure activities and it will be mandatory for adventure activity operators to abide by these codes. It will also introduce a regulatory scheme for specified adventure activities. This scheme will include the carrying out of inspections of operators by inspectors authorised by the authority. In certain circumstances, including non-compliance with a code of practice, the authority will have the power to direct an operator to suspend or cease the provision of specified adventure activities. It will also have the power to remove an adventure activity operator from the register of operators.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State with responsibility for this matter, I am concerned that every feasible measure is introduced to ensure the safety of all persons who engage in adventure activities. I am confident the provisions of this Bill and the establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority will enhance safety standards throughout the sector.</P>
    <P>The voluntary inspection schemes operated by the central standards board of the Association for Adventure Sports and the Irish Sailing Association have served the participating section of the adventure activities sector well. It is clear, however, that a sizeable part of the sector has opted to remain outside the schemes and is not subject to any form of outside scrutiny. It is to be expected that this part of the sector is of greater danger to public health and safety. There is, therefore, a need to establish a legal framework to place the entire sector on an equal footing and to provide for the safety requirements a modern society demands.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority is a key and innovative step, designed to lead to the desired safer environment for all involved in adventure activities. I am confident the mandatory registration of adventure activity operators and the mandatory requirement that operators abide by any codes of prac<Col N="1147" /> tice developed by the authority, along with the regulatory scheme for specified activities and the inspection scheme, will meet the required need for giving safety top priority.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all involved in adventure activities to ensure that common-sense is applied at every opportunity. When people visit the seaside during the summer, they may be tempted to put to sea in calm and serene surroundings. Unfortunately, one does not need a certificate of competence to hire a boat. All too often, a day of fun ends as a day of tragedy. Anyone engaging in such activities, at sea or on land, should apply common-sense and ask questions which may seem embarrassing of those who know better. This Bill resulted from a tragedy at sea, but tragedies also occur during land-based activities. People should ask questions &ndash; many an embarrassing question saved a life.</P>
    <P>I thank all involved in search and rescue on land and at sea. A former member of the coastguard centre at Kilmore Quay is in the House. I thank the RNLI, the volunteers, the Garda and all involved in life saving and search and rescue. There is great appreciation for the work of these people, even if it involves finding a body rather than rescuing an individual. I thank these people for the selfless, wonderful work they do, have done, and will continue to do. I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend him for introducing this legislation. In particular, I welcome his focus on safety which should be a priority in all spheres of activity on land, at sea or in the air. We cannot over-emphasise safety in all aspects of life, particularly in leisure activities.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill has missed an opportunity to encompass all adventure activities within the proposed legislative framework. The Minister of State referred to the provision whereby the authority will examine areas excluded from the ambit of the legislation and which may, or may not, be brought within the safeguards provided by the statutory framework at some point in the future. I am referring to schools, educational establishments, including third level institutions, societies and amateurs. Many of the aforementioned are well meaning, but indulge in high-risk adventure activities. Such organisations and individuals will be outside the statutory safeguards provided by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis of the Bill is rightly on commercial operations. There are some tremendous such operations, the largest of which is the Delphi Adventure Centre on the Galway/Mayo border. This centre employs 100 people at peak periods and contributes substantially to the local economy and to tourism in the region. The managing director of the centre has no quibble with this legislation, which is welcomed by most commercial operators. Commercial activities must have standards if they are to survive in the business <Col N="1148" /> world. Such operations cannot apply sub-standard or doubtful practices.</P>
    <P>Commercial operators are not concerned about the implications of this Bill in so far as it does, or does not, effect them. However, my concern is that too much activity will take place outside the statutory safeguards provided by the Bill. If a hill-walking club decides to go out on a Sunday, it will not be concerned whether a peak is 300 or 350 metres above sea level and will climb it in any event. Such clubs are not covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case in which a member of cycling club was thrown from his bicycle due to an accident and was paralysed for life. Accidents do not happen; they are caused. In this case the accident was due to an insufficient emphasis on safety. This incident could have been worse as the man could have been killed, but such accidents will continue to happen. It is unfortunate the enforcement provisions in the Bill will not provide for such occurrences.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Department of Education and Science played a major role in framing this legislation and the cost implications were a significant factor in excluding schools from its ambit. Where public safety is at issue, cost should not come into the equation. Voluntary and amateur organisations should be funded to meet whatever costs are involved in meeting the criteria outlined by the legislation. It is not valid to say that less well off schools may be deterred from participating because of the cost. If we are trying to bring schools in disadvantaged areas up to a standard that is acceptable, we cannot have such schools placed in a position where they will continue to be disadvantaged. It was a mistake not to include schools and institutions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the many vocational education committees operating PLC courses that have neither the equipment nor staff to meet the criteria involved. They should have been supported financially within the terms of this Bill to enable them to get on an equal footing with the commercial operations. The cost would not be prohibitive and would be insignificant when compared to Exchequer surpluses of £2 billion or higher every year.</P>
    <P>These are fringe activity events, not spectator sports and there are relatively few of them. People are only involved because they have a passionate interest in them. We have serious problems in the west with jet skiing. The county council seemed to have a function in controlling it, but it is beyond the capability of local authorities to enforce any kind of restriction on jet skiers. It is an issue that should have been looked at.</P>
    <P>There are well meaning amateurs involved in fishing on lakes and rivers who have insufficient regard for safety regulations. About two years ago there was a serious accident on one of our major fishing lakes, Lough Conn, involving two men who were eel fishing. Seemingly for the purpose of eel fishing, a tank of water is required on <Col N="1149" /> board. This tank upset the balance of the boat and it overturned at midnight and both fishermen were lost. These are areas that are not covered in the legislation and these tragedies unfortunately will continue.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in relation to the Department of Education and Science, schools and institutions. I know of a canoeing club run by a third level institution with 100 members and no qualified instructor. That is not catered for under the statutory safeguards of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the other House considerable attention was devoted to sections of the Bill dealing with the Minister's capacity to dismiss a director or a chairman of the authority. I am not unduly concerned about that aspect of the Bill. If a director or chairman deserves to be dismissed, he will be dismissed. The media and natural justice come into play and should ensure that no Minister would dismiss any chairman or director without due cause.</P>
    <P>If I am reading it right, Oireachtas Members and MEPs quite properly are excluded from membership of the authority. I welcome the fact that for once local authority members are not excluded. Some local authority members have considerable knowledge of seafaring and adventure activities because the nature of politics at local level is an adventure activity in any event.</P>
    <P>By and large I welcome the thrust of the Bill even though I was disappointed that it does not encompass the areas I have mentioned. When the new authority is established I am sure that it will take a while to come to grips with this very complex area involving 13 or 14 adventure activities.</P>
    <P>Within rock climbing and hill climbing, the technology is evolving constantly and new techniques are coming into use. An instructor who qualified a year ago may not be qualified in a year's time because of the nature of developments. The Delphi Centre in County Mayo, which is up to date in most of its training techniques and has qualified instructors, nevertheless has to keep abreast with developments abroad in hill climbing and rock climbing. These commercial operations will have to keep up with the times if they are not to fall foul of the new authority.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the authority is to promote and foster public safety in all areas of adventure activities. I hope it will bring about a new ethos and culture and influence people who may be lax about rules and regulations in this area. As the Minister said at the end of his speech, it is not possible to enforce the law in every aspect of life.</P>
    <P>We have an example of it in the carnage that takes place on the roads. I urge the Government to show same sense of urgency in bringing legislation forward on road accidents as they have shown with this legislation. That is not to downplay the trauma caused by the tragedy the Minister referred to which prompted this legislation in the first place. Road safety is a major issue. I do not want to link it with this legislation but it has <Col N="1150" /> an impact in so far as the public perception of safety is concerned. The public is clamouring for new legislation in all areas of safety and that is why this Bill is timely.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to see the Bill encompass the whole spectrum of leisure activity rather than have a two-tier statutory system governing the commercial sector. It does not govern the well-meaning amateur, voluntary organisations or whatever co-operative or society wishes to form a group for the promotion of these activities, which are all high risk. I look forward to the authority developing a culture of safety in all these areas. I hope that culture permeates the whole sector and we reduce the incidence of tragic accidents that continue to take place as a result of carelessness and laxity. I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes but I would prefer it to go further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, to the House. I pay particular attention to his warning that we are now coming into the summer season and all sorts of activities, particularly water sports, and many of the sports referred to in this Bill will be taking place. People can become a little careless and I ask the public to pay attention to the Minister of State's words.</P>
      <P>This Bill establishes an independent standards authority to regulate the safety of adventure activity centres and providers and to promote and enhance the safety of those who engage in adventure activities at these centres. I particularly welcome the provision in the Bill for mandatory registration of such centres and of those who own them. I also welcome the implementation of a regulatory scheme of inspection of the centres for adherence to safety codes and the power of the authority to order the closure of any centre not observing the safety standards required.</P>
      <P>The background to this Bill was an unfortunate accident in the Minister of State's area in which two young men lost their lives. I praise the father of one of the boys for his tenacity and insistence in pushing for this Bill which, though deficient in many ways, is at least a start. There was an earlier attempt at such a Bill by the Opposition in the other House but that did not proceed as Members felt that, while regulation was certainly necessary, any legislation should extend to all adventure sports, not just to water sports as was recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, as and from last Sunday, of two new sets of regulations to govern the safety of personal water craft &ndash; commonly known as jet skis &ndash; fast power craft and other mechanically propelled water craft. Previous legislation in this House paved the way for these regulations. While the regulations are now in place, many local authorities are having difficulties with water sports coming into the summer season, particularly in the areas of blue flag beaches. I trust and hope <Col N="1151" /> that these authorities will have the power to implement the regulations and ensure that those who act in a careless and inconsiderate manner will be brought to task.</P>
    <P>This is only the initial phase of regulations to be developed by the Department based on the report of the ministerial action group on small, powered, recreational craft. These regulations are a top priority, as is this Bill, particularly as more and more young people are involved in water-based activities. The new regulations implement the recommendations which have been made in relation to the wearing of life jackets. This seems to be a chore for many people and many craft do not have life jackets on board. While the Department has provided funding for safety on fishing boats, many young fishermen feel that they are so used to the sea and have so many years experience of it that they do not need to use these jackets. We all know the power of the sea and the unfortunate accidents that can happen.</P>
    <P>The regulations also state the minimum age at which people are allowed to use jet skis and other power craft and provide for prosecution and on the spot fines for who operate them in a dangerous and careless manner. The regulations set a minimum age of 16 for operating jet skis, though had I been dealing with it I would have raised it to 18 years of age. It is 12 years of age for other power craft. Other recommendations on insurance, training and recreational craft registration and use will be addressed by the Department at a later date.</P>
    <P>While the operation of personal motorised craft and power craft is generally carried out by individuals on the sea, they must be encouraged to look to their own safety and be respectful of the safety of others. I was in Bordeaux last week at a meeting of the committee for peripheral maritime regions. Proposals were put forward to Commissioner Fischler by the peripheral maritime regions and the islands in relation the Green Paper on the review of the Common Fisheries Policy. While there, the organising region used the opportunity to show those in attendance the aquacultural development at the mouth of the Garonne river. They showed us how aquaculture, leisure craft and ordinary leisure facilities can all use the one bay. The Minister is aware from his Department of the many objections there are to these aquacultural licences. Those who object should visit this bay and see how things work. What is happening in some of our aquacultural developments is minor visual obstruction when compared to what I saw there, yet they have no difficulty in operating.</P>
    <P>The bay was also used by sunbathers, on golden sandy beaches, and there was a designated section on its outer part for use by power craft. It was cordoned off approximately 50 metres from the beaches by a system of buoys. It was a very simple system to ensure power craft were kept separate. We need to do the same here, particularly at blue flag beach areas, to provide safety <Col N="1152" /> for the general public and those who wishing to use such craft.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, set up an inter-departmental working group which presented its report in June 1999 on the safety standards in adventure activities and the regulation of such activities and centres. The Association for Adventure Sports undertook to consult and establish a framework for the relevant legislation. Many of the recommendations of the group are included in this Bill. Part of the remit of the inter-departmental working group was to examine models in other countries, particularly the recent UK legislation. It also looked at the likely impact of similar legislation in this country and recommended that regulations be introduced. Such regulations should take the form of compulsory adherence to a set of safety codes and provide that centres be required to register with the statutory authority as providers of specific adventure activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the standards authority with 15 members and an independent chairman. I welcome the composition of the board. It includes the providers and members of national organisations for the different sports as well as one person with expertise in the sector. I also welcome the fact that an inspectorate will be established to ensure these centres, when registered, are operating to proper standards.</P>
    <P>While the authority will have nominees from the Departments of Education and Science, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Marine and Natural Resources and from the Health and Safety Authority, it will also include representatives of the providers, the people on which the Minister is relying to co-operate and ensure the standards are being adhered to by their colleagues. The idea is to promote and encourage facilities and regulate the safe operation of all adventure activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill defines an activity centre and the operators of these centres. The activities mentioned include certain types of hill walking, orienteering, caving, dinghy sailing, canoeing, windsurfing, scuba diving, snorkelling and rock climbing. All these sports are routine for experienced practitioners but can lead to life and death situations when risks are taken and the participants are only beginners.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that for registration purposes a provider is somebody who provides adventure activities on a commercial basis. The Minister and Senator Caffrey pointed out that schools will not come under the remit of the Bill. I initially thought that was a bad idea but most of the activities in schools are basically physical education and sports. As these activity sports are not generally carried out within the school perimeters but at these activity centres, most of the activities provided by schools will be covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> Senator Caffrey referred to vocational education committees. Many of the vocational education committees provide adventure activities. The VEC in County Donegal does and one of the most famous is Gartan. I hope these will come within the ambit of the legislation. There have been many incidents in which children suffered only minor arm breaks and so forth but some incidents can be more serious. Last year, for example, a young boy in a school in Donegal swung from the steel goalposts which came down on top of him and hit his head. He died some time later from damage to his brain caused by the goalposts. Institutions or schools may voluntarily register; the Bill does not oblige them to do so.</P>
    <P>Enactment of the legislation is necessary to provide the regulatory framework to encourage safety in adventure sports. However, ensuring safe practices cannot be left solely to the Minister or the operators. The individuals who participate must take a responsible attitude to what they are doing. Many of these activities are dangerous and participants need to be experienced.</P>
    <P>The report of the interdepartmental group referred to the excellent safety record of adventure centres in general. I am glad that the initial concentration will be on centres that did not self-regulate, particularly those dealing with young people. Many risks can be taken when participating in the activities covered by the Bill. It is the nature of the participants to take risks; they like to defy the odds and take on nature.</P>
    <P>The activity centres can contribute a great deal to tourism development in counties such as my own and Senator Caffrey's. I am forever preaching that the way forward for some counties is more tourism product. I hope when the Structural Funds and operational programmes are introduced there will be grants, tax breaks and tax reliefs available for counties where little employment is produced from any other source but which have natural beauty in their landscapes, beaches and hills.</P>
    <P>County Donegal has developed hill walking activities in recent years but many other activities could be developed. Unfortunately, however, funding is required to get them off the ground. Despite the bad weather we experience for most of the year, there is great potential for marine sport and activity centres to attract tourists and give them something to do when they cannot see the scenery with the mist and the rain. Our own population is also becoming more health conscious and people are participating in adventure activities and sports for fitness purposes. This is particularly the case for those whose football days are over. The easy option is to go on the golf course but others progress, for health and fitness purposes, to adventure activities.</P>
    <P>What is the situation with insurance cover under the regulations? Senator Moylan asked me about an activity that might be started on somebody's land. Caves, for example, might be found on somebody's land and people might come on to it to explore and use them. As the farmer is <Col N="1154" /> not operating an activity, where does he stand? Does he need to have insurance? Will the Department and the inspectors pursue him in this regard? The people concerned are going on the land on their own initiative and not being encouraged by the farmer.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of the sports which have been omitted. I consider many of them to be dangerous. They include horse riding, pony trekking, showjumping, parachuting, gliding and hang gliding, even sea angling. There are regulations which apply to those who operate sea angling craft. They must have licences and so forth and when they seek grants for the boats they must adhere to certain standards. However, many people operating these boats are not being monitored. Bungee jumping is another dangerous activity. I cannot understand the reason anybody would wish to do it but the operators &ndash; I will not call them fly by night &ndash; only come to an area with the apparatus for a few days, after which they are gone. There are no controls on them. It is one of the most dangerous activities I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to boats being used on lakes. Many of our lakes are being developed for trout and salmon fishing and people tend to simply hire a boat and go out on the lake fishing but accidents happen in calm conditions on lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>If an inspector visits an activity centre and judges it not to be up to standard, is there an appeals system? Will the operator be able to put his case or will the centre be closed down? There is another aspect to the appointment of inspectors. Thirty odd years ago we did not have physical education instructors in our secondary schools. The system only developed during the years. Are there criteria or standards which the inspectors should have achieved in training in relation to these adventure activities? The Minister said further measures can be introduced. It is the type of legislation that can be added to from time to time as different matters arise.</P>
    <P>People do not realise the power of the sea, which is probably the greatest power in nature. It is necessary always to be wary of it. What can appear to be calm and docile water can turn into a ravaging force, destroying families and claiming the lives of many. Hill climbing, too, is a dangerous activity and I urge people to be careful.</P>
    <P>When the Minister spoke on this Bill in the Dáil, he referred to the unveiling of a monument in Kilmore Quay commemorating those who lost their lives in many tragedies. Some of those lives were lost at sports, but most who died were fishermen. When the Minister was in Donegal at the launch of a boat, a gentleman from Inver asked him if he would look at the possibility of providing such a monument in Inver Bay. That is the home town of the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, in case the Minister had forgotten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister of this because each time I go to a fishery and coastal meeting of Donegal County Council, that same gentleman, who is on the committee, keeps asking me whether there is progress on this issue. I ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the legislation. Other Senators have rehearsed the functions and purpose of the Bill so I do not intend to go into that in great detail. It will suffice to say that the legislation is desirable in that it provides the statutory umbrella under which certain commercial adventure activities will be covered. We hope to ensure the statutory registration of those bodies and functions listed in the legislation and to establish a code of practice for them. The legislation will also establish an inspection process to ensure that proper safety regulations are in operation and that properly trained people conduct courses and activities. That is desirable.</P>
      <P>The background to this legislation emanates from a canoeing tragedy in Dunmore East where certain shortcomings existed in the monitoring and conduct of activities. It is appropriate that we have followed up on that, conducted a departmental examination and looked to regulations that cover this area in our neighbouring jurisdiction before coming up with legislation ourselves. The Minister has gone about this the right way and we have come up with reasonable legislation.</P>
      <P>Questions exist in relation to the functions of the new independent standards authority and how it will operate. The areas that are excluded is one question. There seem to be as many areas excluded as included. A number of those areas excluded merit inclusion. Some are dangerous, and jet skiing is probably the most dangerous of all. We have heard of a number of accidents that have taken place in other countries. Jet skiing is very much a commercial operation but there seems to be little regulation of it. I do not know if a code of practice has been brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A code of practice has been brought in very recently &ndash; last Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good but it should be included in this legislation as part of the overall code of practice. There should be mandatory registration in that area because it is purely commercial and conducted in what can be a dangerous manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas mentioned, including biking and equestrian sports, could be included. It is best for me to begin with a list and the Minister will then be able to expand on those matters and include other areas as he wishes. My other concern is that this legislation deals purely with commercial activity. It refers to standards. The authority will inspect the operation of standards only where there is the passage of money between those providing the service and the client. While it is good and necessary that this is the case, it leaves out <Col N="1156" /> the area of community and educational activities which are not covered by any statutory standards.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of adventure activities do not take place on a commercial but on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. They are organised by community groups which may be in receipt of an occasional grant. They undertake many activities, be it trekking, angling, canoeing etc. This is done on a community basis and mostly in deprived areas where there are no facilities for parents to pay for commercial activities. Nothing in this legislation covers that area. The Minister should look at groups in receipt of grants that should also be subject to regulatory inspection. Whether this tight regime can be extended is a moot point. However, if it is not, a huge area will not be covered. There will be accidents, fatalities and injuries.</P>
    <P>Another major area is that of education, which the Minister dwelt on in some detail in his address. From the tenor of his remarks, it seems the Minister regrets exempting this area. I find it difficult to take that new regulations would make schools unwilling to undertake adventure activities. It is disappointing to see that point made in the Minister's speech. The context is similar to that for the community groups operating in deprived areas where there is less funding to attract recognised commercial ventures. This is particularly true of the vocational education committees which operate mainly in deprived areas. They provide far more activities than other secondary schools, including adventure activities. They do this to ensure that young people who are not keen on academic subjects will remain at school longer.</P>
    <P>We should look at this in another way. We should provide the regulations and the standards but also the resources to ensure that these educational establishments are able to provide the service. They will then become the deliverers of the service. There is hardly a VEC school that does not provide an adventure sports activity programme. Under this legislation, they will be able to operate without the stringent regulations which we are imposing in this Bill. We must remember that the greatest number of activities are operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by teachers and schools outside normal school hours to give extra occupation and enjoyment to the children. They would not have this activity in the rather boring, urban ethos in which a lot of their lives are spent. It is not right to exempt that sector.</P>
    <P>One set of safety standards cannot be applied to the same type of activity simply because the resources and training facilities are not available. How will training facilities, supports and resources be put in place unless we insist that proper safety standards are introduced? To do so, we must ensure that the Minister for Education and Science, who will be one of the nominees to the new authority, takes action in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations in respect of this area. I accept what the Minister is doing with regard to commercial centres, but the area that is not included should be included. For the reasons I <Col N="1157" /> have outlined, those involved in the area to which I refer will find themselves falling short in terms of the skills, training and protective measures that will be required. Commercial centres will be in a better position to supply these by using the profits they garner from charging people large sums of money to engage in activities.</P>
    <P>I accept that in certain instances schools use some of these commercial centres. However, many of them are not in a position to do so because they lack the necessary funding. It is, therefore, usually left to a good-hearted teacher to obtain a van and transport a number of children to a mountainous, seaside or lakeside setting to allow them to go canoeing, hill climbing, orienteering etc. I accept that these people offer their services in this regard on a voluntary basis, but the legislation does not provide any effective standards or codes of practice in respect of how they should behave and, under its provisions, they are not required to be mandatorily registered. Perhaps the Minister of State will address that matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the question of grants. The section which deals with grants is merely referred to and appears to have almost been slipped into the legislation without discussion. It is stated in the legislation that the second function of the authority shall be to administer such schemes, grants and other financial facilities for the promotion, encouragement, fostering, facilitation and regulation of the safe operation of adventure activities etc. Will these grants be given out purely in respect of the commercial activities covered by the legislation or will they be extended to the entire gamut of adventure sports activities, irrespective of whether they come under the umbrella of a commercial operation? From where will these grants come? Will they emanate from the existing grants that are being administered by the vocational education committees and the Sports Council or will they be provided in the form of lottery funding allocated by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation? The position is not clear in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the section that these grants shall be for the promotion, encouragement, fostering and regulation of the safe operation of adventure activities. Are they purely intended to be spent on the safe operation of such activities or are they also meant to be spent on the promotion, encouragement and fostering of those activities? If they are intended for the latter purpose, the funding will then be provided to commercial adventure activity centres. Will the Minister clarify the position because I am concerned that the emphasis will be placed purely on commercial adventure activities and that the voluntary, community or educational activities which are provided on shoestring budgets will, once again, lose out in terms of the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Members of Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament. I do not know why Members of the Oireachtas should be excluded from membership <Col N="1158" /> of a body of this nature, particularly in view of the fact that there are many other individuals who might be appointed whose jobs keep them extremely busy. If we are discussing the operation of commercial adventure sports organisations and the body that is to regulate the standards relevant thereto, is there really a need to state that public representatives may not, under any circumstances, serve on that body? I presume local representatives may serve. Why make a distinction between them and national representatives? It is invidious and somewhat insidious that Members of Parliament always appear to be affected by exclusion orders of this kind. The only other people to whom such orders apply are debtors and criminals. It, therefore, appears that we are being treated in the same way as these noxious categories of persons who are not fit or entitled to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the three groups could be lumped together. It has become the norm in legislation to exclude Members of the Oireachtas from serving on bodies of the sort to which the Bill refers and I do not believe we are in a position to argue against this. Is this healthy behaviour, however? In my opinion it would be better not to exclude any category.</P>
      <P>The manner in which people will be selected to serve on the authority is clearly outlined in the legislation. The Ministers for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Education and Science and the Marine and Natural Resources will make appointments and people from the various interested bodies will be nominated thereafter. Those who are nominated should be persons of good character and that should be all that is required. There should be no need to specify that certain individuals may not serve.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this timely legislation. I would like its provisions to be extended to the categories to which I referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, the Minister of State is responsible for the introduction of an item of good and proper legislation. I congratulate him on bringing the Bill before the House. He referred to a terrible tragedy that occurred <Col N="1159" /> near his home last year and stated that it might never have happened if rules and regulations such as those outlined in the Bill had been in place at that stage. However, such tragedies happen and the Minister of State is making the effort to ensure that safety will become a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on a matter not directly relevant to the Bill. During the past four years, the need for safety on fishing boats has become major priority for the Department. In that context, regulations and safety measures have come into force and the Minister of State has provided generous grants to allow the owners of fishing vessels to comply with these. I am always generous in terms of the praise I give to Opposition Members. In that regard, I commend Deputy Finucane on introducing a Private Members' Bill in the Lower House and, equally, the Minister of State and his Department for taking that Bill on board and ensuring its quick passage through the Houses.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello remarked on the exclusion of Members of Parliament from serving on the authority. I have been the chairman of the Dingle Harbour Board for ten years. I hope that no legislation will say that I should not be. I tried to resign on four occasions but remained because everyone, including people from Senator Costello's and Senator Caffrey's parties, requested me to stay so that the board would have an avenue of communication to Government, or, as they put it, someone to speak for them &ldquo;up there.&rdquo; It is valid for Members of the Oireachtas, holding such a position, to voice concerns that otherwise might not be heard.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers much but Senators Caffrey, Bonner and Costello highlighted aspects that are missing, such as water and jet skiing. I am familiar with the problems in my harbour and the Minister's Department should not be able to overrule the board. Two years ago the Department granted a licence to a group from Dublin to conduct adventure activities at the mouth of Dingle harbour. I considered these dangerous and the harbour board objected initially but withdrew because of the perception that it wanted to keep all the activities and business for locals. It was dangerous because&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What about swimming with dolphins in the harbour? Should that not be included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It had nothing to do with swimming with dolphins. It was a new sport called thrill seeking. Ten people are towed on a large rubber craft, whatever the weather, at speeds of up to 35 knots, hopping and bouncing off the waves. It occurs outside the harbour at a place which strangers know little about. It is dangerous because lobster pot ropes and material from different fishing activities are there. We objected in writing to the Department's granting a licence but were overruled. This should not have been so <Col N="1160" /> because the board was in charge of the harbour and, if something went wrong, would be blamed as the statutory body charged with regulating it. We pay a premium of approximately £20,000 a year for an indemnity of £2 million to insure what the Minister owns.</P>
      <P>We have a better relationship with the Department over other activities for which we make the rules. We challenged it to overrule us on matters such as our decision to allow a maximum of 12 hire boats to observe the dolphin. Recently I went on radio to respond when Dingle got bad publicity from a person claiming to be an expert on dolphins and whales who said that there are always at least 20 boats at the harbour mouth annoying the dolphin. I refute that because I live overlooking the harbour and have never seen 20 boats.</P>
      <P>Dingle harbour is in a bay, two miles long and a mile wide, in which the Department could grant a licence for activities. The board agreed with the local sailing club that boats would keep west of a line separating them from fishing boats entering and leaving the harbour. The Department should not grant a licence to anyone wishing to set up an adventure activity without consulting the harbour commissioners, as should be the case in many similar places. Jet skis, for example, constitute a problem although legislation will be introduced to deal with them. Young people, once they are a hundred yards from the pier, go at full speed on jet skis and the harbourmaster must chase them to enforce the regulations. We attempted to ban a couple of them from Dingle for this.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not mention the person in charge of the activity. That person should provide proof of his or her qualifications to the Minister or the body to be established. As was mentioned by other Senators, I am concerned about the protection of the landowner involved. A person receiving a licence for rock climbing or potholing, for example, ought to produce a document confirming the landowner's permission to cross his land. If everyone who is qualified is granted a licence then they will ride roughshod over landowners by producing it.</P>
      <P>I will not refer to what is not in the Bill since enabling provisions mean that sports can be added or deleted. Senator Costello argues every morning that we accept motions without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the <Col N="1161" /> debate. I know their hearts are in the right place and none of them is trying to stop, block or hinder the passage of this Bill. I compliment them on the work they have done.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to put safety first. I hope as a consequence there will be greater awareness of the necessity for safety measures in all the activities mentioned. The Bill came about as a result of an accident at sea. Accidents at sea seem more tragic than others and there are more of them at sea than elsewhere. The secretary of the Rosslare Lifeboat Association asks at the beginning of every year that it be the year that no one is lost at sea. If only that were the case. The creation of awareness is very important.</P>
      <P>Adventure sports, by their nature, involve risk and that risk is the attraction. The Bill does not intend to become a spoilsport. We encourage people to get out and exercise. As Senators said, we are all becoming more health conscious and want to engage in these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying he has no objection to our going bungee jumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was confined to the Labour Party. I recommend that we engage in such activities. I speak for the Minister for Health and Children when I say that all these adventure sports can be great fun in which nowadays we have more time to engage. We do not want to be spoilsports. While we want to encourage such activity, we also want to regulate it. All too often when people leave home in the morning to set out on a day of fun it ends as a day of tragedy. We want to prevent this, if possible, but at the same time allow the balance of good fun.</P>
      <P>I will say this as often as it takes to get the message home. When people engage in adventure sports, whether land or water based, they should take advice from those with experience. I refer particularly to those going to sea. Beautiful serene calm waters must tempt people to engage in adventure sports at sea, whether boating, swimming or whatever. If it is boating and one is leaving the harbour, there is always an old sailor or fisherman around who will be delighted to talk and give advice. We may think a question is embarrassing but it could save a life. We must get that message across. A little common sense and courage to ask for advice could save lives.</P>
      <P>In thanking all those involved in life-saving and search and rescue I forgot to mention the Air Corps which has been fantastic, as has the RAF when we sought its help. I am saddened when I think of the four young men involved in the saving of lives and who then lost their own in County Waterford. People putting to sea should not just consider their own safety but also the safety of those who may have to rescue them. I want to emphasise the importance of common sense and the seeking of advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opened a memorial garden and trail at Kilmore Quay recently where there is a monument <Col N="1162" /> with a list of names of those lost at sea, in the area known as the graveyard of a thousand ships, from Hook Head to Kilmore Quay. There must be 1,000 names on the monument. Had this legislation been in place, how many of those lives would have been saved? It is a credit to the people of Kilmore Quay that they built the memorial trail to commemorate those lost. Many of the bodies would not have been found and now the grieving process can be completed in the memorial garden. People can go and read the names of their loved ones and kneel and pray. It was a community based project that cost about £100,000. I gave some grant aid and pay tribute to the community because had it been commissioned and built by a contractor without local voluntary input, it would have cost in the region of £1 million. If there are communities which wish to replicate it, I assure them, living where I do and feeling as I do about those who use the sea and those who have lost their lives at sea, that I will consider giving grant aid.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Costello that no activity has been excluded. While some may not be included, they are not excluded. I will ask the new authority I propose to establish following the passage of the Bill to look at all the activities mentioned. I thank Senators for mentioning them because although we have been fairly fantastic in government we do not have a monopoly of knowledge, a matter on which I am delighted Senator Costello agrees with me.</P>
    <P>A question was raised concerning schools. Having been a schoolteacher and being heavily involved in the outdoor pursuits centre at Ramsgrange we ensure every school in the county and beyond is well looked after as regards charges. No charge will be such that schoolchildren will be discouraged from engaging in activities. It has been mentioned that many fishermen do not even wear life-belts. I want to create safety awareness among young people and every schoolchild to be able to swim. I assure the House that charges by any company, whether voluntary or commercial, will not prohibit any young person from learning skills. We will ask the authority to ensure children will be encouraged to involve themselves rather than discouraged by prohibitive charges.</P>
    <P>The use of jet skis has been quite topical for some years. We all assume that they are dangerous but that may be age talking. A colleague, whose name I do not want to mention, was once an Ulster champion windsurfer, although I do not know how he accomplished this feat as he is not from Ulster. This may be a question on &ldquo;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&rdquo; in days to come, although I do not know if it will be put to Shane O'Doherty.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for saving me from this savage heckling. The colleague to whom I referred, who is not of my generation, told me he is keen on jet skiing We do not want to be spoilsports, but many people use the sea and they are equally entitled to enjoy the safety that would exist if jet skis were not there. Regulations came into force last Sunday to deal with the problem, including age restrictions, the compulsory wearing of lifejackets, penalties for dangerous driving or driving without due care and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs, which should be totally banned in any event. We intend to make further regulations following discussions with local authorities.</P>
      <P>As Senators Costello, Caffrey, Tom Fitzgerald and Bonner have said, an area at sea should be provided where activities other than jet skiing will not take place. Those who wish to engage in jet skiing should be able to enjoy themselves in a specified area. We want to ensure that ordinary folk using the beach, such as mothers whose children swim while they sunbathe, read or rest, can feel confident that jet skis will not hit them. I do not wish to be a spoilsport, but I hope we are not going too far by adopting an attitude of &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the membership of the board, I know there are several people who would like to see Senator Tom Fitzgerald retire from the Dingle Harbour Commissioners as his ability to lobby has taken moneys from New Ross, Waterford, Kilmore Quay and Rosslare.</P>

If I tried to leave the trust, I would suffer the fate mentioned earlier, as people want me to be involved. I accept the argument made by Senators Costello and Caffrey, but I do not think we are making lesser people of ourselves by being on boards. Various boards are provided for in legislation, although that does not make it right. The initial reason for the measure in this Bill was it was felt that if we were on many boards and authorities we would have a significant advantage. I take on board the arguments that have been made and we can discuss it further at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>n</i>) parachuting;</P>
      <P>(<i>o</i>) raft building;</P>
      <P>(<i>p</i>) bungee jumping.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage speech, I referred to the fact that certain high-risk adventure activities are not included in the Bill, despite the fact that there is no reason for this. The Minister of State said there are no acknowledged standards for the &ldquo;sports&rdquo; in my amendment, but they are high-risk activities. A Senator pointed out the possibility of someone coming here, setting up a bungee jumping operation which results in serious injury or death and then moving away without being held responsible under the provisions and safeguards of this Bill. The Minister of State said that the authority, when set up, will look at these sports, but years may pass before that happens. I would like to see parachuting, raft building and bungee jumping included in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey's comments. There are many other sports that could be included, however, such as jet skiing, to which many people have referred. On a lighter note, when listening to the radio this morning I learned that swimming with dolphins can be a dangerous activity. It happens that the dolphin in Dingle is friendly, but this is not always the case as some dolphins have been known to kill or maim. Per<Col N="1165" /> haps, for the benefit of Senator Tom Fitzgerald, we might include swimming with dolphins as an activity that needs to be regulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have mentioned some of the activities in the amendment, I appreciate there is provision in the legislation to add to the list of activities, so I would not add three activities to the Bill at this point. I was shocked when Senator Tom Fitzgerald explained to me earlier the new sport of thrill seeking, as I briefly thought he was going to refer to something else. There are so many possible activities that it would be unwise to add three more to the list without having an overall look at the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello understands that Kerry dolphins are different from other dolphins. I thank Senators for their interest in extending the list already in place, a matter which was also raised in the Dáil. I ask Senators to acknowledge that wherever a line is drawn, someone will be anxious to move things to the other side of the line. I accept Senator Caffrey's argument and I assure him that as soon as the authority is set up, I will ask it to have a look at each of the activities that have been mentioned, although I am not sure about including swimming with dolphins. I assure the Senator of my commitment in the legislation to provide the best safety practices for the greatest number of activities. I do not want to exclude any activity but I want to ensure the authority has a say.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group, which I established to examine this issue, produced the list of activities covered by the legislation. It dealt with the other activities but it was not ready to recommend their inclusion. We decided to proceed with the legislation because it is necessary to enact it for the summer. People are also safety conscious and commonsense will apply without the necessary legislation. I hope the Senator's concerns will be examined in the near future. Consequently, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 29, to delete &ldquo;for payment or reward&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;for payment or reward&rdquo;, which provide the fundamental linchpin of the legislation. Their removal will mean the legislation will cover vocational education committees, schools, amateur groups, societies and so on, which would be obliged to observe the legal safeguards in it. This would allow the Minister of State to cater for the entire spectrum of adventure activities, whether <Col N="1166" /> they are for commercial or recreational purposes. I presume he will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Caffrey is right that this is a fundamental amendment. We all agree with the principle of the legislation, which is to provide a safe context in which adventure sports can take place. If such a context is to be provided for commercial activities, it should also be provided for non-commercial activities. Safety is an all-inclusive concept and should be addressed by all activity operators. The integrity of the legislation is considerably undermined if it only covers adventure activities that operate on the basis of payment or reward.</P>
      <P>Many activities are not covered by the legislation. The Minister of State's argument was that some schools or communities might be discouraged from engaging in such activities if a tight safety regime was in place. I do not accept that as a principle on which any heath or safety legislation should operate.</P>
      <P>Is there any difficulty in registering all bodies whether they participate in adventure activities for payment or reward? It is proper that they should be registered anyway as it would be useful. It is desirable that all groups should observe a code of practice, whether they are voluntary or community groups, or schools. With regard to the inspectorate, why should an inspector not call to an educational establishment or a community adventure operation and so on from time to time?</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulation make many changes under the legislation but many adventure activities are being exempted from its powers. This fine legislation is limited as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of the interdepartmental working group was to examine how safe adventure activities provision is in Ireland. Where facilities are provided for young people in particular, it noted that the conduct of adventure activities is complex and wide-ranging in terms of participation, activities and mixes of activities, locations, objectives, formats and contexts. Activities range from limited solo excursions on land or at sea by individuals to fully developed, highly structured participation on a commercial basis in which the activity is overseen by instructors and an adventure centre management.</P>
      <P>The group recommended in its report that the definition of &ldquo;providers&rdquo; in the legislation should primarily include those providing activities on a commercial basis. If the Senator's amendment were accepted the definition would be widened to such an extent that even informal, unled family groups, such as those which head off on various adventure trails, not to mention voluntary groups such as the boy scouts, would be obliged to meet the requirements of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House the protection of young people has been a priority of mine in promoting this legislation and it was the loss of a young canoeist close to my home that prompted the preparation of a statutory framework for safety in adventure centres. I share the House's con<Col N="1167" /> cerns that school children should have access to the best safety practices where they engage in adventure activities.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that where a school contacts an adventure centre to provide adventure activities to its pupils, the provision of such activities will be covered by the statutory safeguards in the Bill. I accept there will be scenarios where school staff will provide adventure training or instruction to pupils directly and that currently such provision is outside the legislation. Where, however, a commercial transaction is involved, that is, where the pupils pay the school or an indi<Col N="1168" /> vidual teacher or other staff members directly or through the school management, such provision comes within the scope of the legislation. The school or staff member becomes an adventure activity operator for the purposes of the law.</P>
    <P>I will ask the authority, which will include a representative of the Department of Education and Science, to consider as a matter of the utmost priority how to ensure school children have access to the highest safety standards through this legislation or any other provision. I do not accept the amendment for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>During my Second Stage contribution I raised the question of section 14(2)(<i>b</i>) which states that one of the functions of the new authority will be to administer schemes, grants and other financial facilities for the promotion, encouragement, fostering, facilitation and regulation of the safe promotion of adventure activities. I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on this. Are we talking about grants for purely commercial operations? Will the new authority also have functions to administer grants in relation to non-commercial operations involving schools, the community or voluntary adventure activities? It would seem strange if one of its functions was to promote a commercial venture, over which there is a question mark. What finances would be available for that purpose? The body should be tasked with the outlay for promoting its own activities. I seek clarification of that subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I have been insistent on safety standards, particularly at sea, but in this instance it applies to all activities. Any grants that may be available will go solely towards safety measures and be paid either to community groups establishing a non-profit making operation or a commercial group. However, the grant will only be for the purpose of putting safety standards in place.</P>

      <P>May I seek further clarification? We are talking about adventure activities. If it is pertinent for community groups to apply for grants, surely there should be some registration of those groups. They should also be subject to some standards of operation if they are to obtain grants from the State. We are establishing an authority to deal with standards for safety regulations and also provide funding which will be open to both the commercial and community sector, yet only one sector will be subject to an inspectorate and the standards as laid out in the Bill. The other sector is not subject to those standards. One sector has to be registered while the other does not. It seems strange that the authority would operate only in this area regarding the non-commercial as well as the commercial sector.</P>

      <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the Bill concerns safety. Any grants which have to be paid will be examined by departmental officials and by the Minister. We will be careful as to how such moneys are disbursed. Moneys will only be disbursed to help provide greater safety for all engaged in adventure activities.</P>

      <P>What, if any, additional functions has the Minister of State in mind regarding this section which confers additional functions and responsibilities on the authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the Minister may confer additional functions on the authority by way of order after consultation with it. In other words, if some unforeseen circumstances arise, as is likely to happen, and the authority advises the Minister that it requires new functions, the section will enable such functions to be provided. This is a good provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have serious reservations about this section which concerns charges. Opposition to charges has been expressed in both Houses. Such charges are at the root of the problem with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the amount of money concerned is negligible, the Exchequer should fund the services which the operators require. These charges will help create the two-tier system which will result from this legislation whereby one group of <Col N="1170" /> operators will be outside the ambit of the Bill while another set of commercial operators will be inside its ambit. I am fundamentally opposed to the idea of charges. The Government should provide funding for this legislation and the activities involved.</P>
    <P>The activities involved are fringe pursuits and do not have significant resources. If my approach is accepted, schools and vocational education committees which operate on a shoestring regarding outdoor and adventure activities would also be funded by the Government. That is what the Government should have done regarding this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason the Senator opposes this section. I also note the concerns expressed by Senator Costello and other Senators regarding the fact that the proposed authority will be allowed to make charges for the provision of its services. However, the provisions of the Bill in this regard are similar to those contained in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which allow the Health and Safety Authority to make such charges as it considers appropriate or necessary.</P>
      <P>By including such a provision in this Bill, the intention is that any charges to be made by the new authority will be designed to offset administration costs and will not be so prohibitive as to discourage operators from registering with it and, thereby, providing services, possibly to young people, outside the safeguards of the law.</P>
      <P>However, I accept the argument that the Health and Safety Authority does not charge for its services. I assure Senators that this principle, and their views on the matter, will be considered when the new authority is established and the issue of invoking such charges is being addressed in consultation with the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 20, lines 27 to 32, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) A draft scheme under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the scheme shall not come into effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Both Houses should have an input before the Minister makes regulations regarding the Bill. The amendment seeks to ensure that the issue would come before both Houses before the Minister would act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 35(5) is a standard provision used in similar legislation. Good legislation stands the test of time. At present, most statutory <Col N="1171" /> regulations, including those which introduce statutory schemes, are laid before the House in accordance with the procedures provided in this section as originally drafted. These procedures allow any Senator who wishes to oppose the regulations to table a resolution to that effect within 21 days and the House will then consider the matter.</P>
      <P>If the amendment is accepted in this case, the Minister would be obliged to table a motion seeking Dáil approval for the regulations. This would mean that every statutory regulation being introduced would have to go through this procedure. Such a procedure would be unnecessary and cumbersome and, for that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not go into the various personnel who will be appointed to the authority. Paragraph 8(<i>i</i>) states, &ldquo;not less than six shall be women and not less than six shall be men&rdquo;. This provision is at variance with almost all legislation which has come before the House since 1997. This is the first instance in which we have a clear statement of gender equity, on which I compliment the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill before us and the other Members present for passing it. This legislation is necessary and while there may possibly be minor deficiencies or oversights, I am sure they will be attended to. Safety is most important and I know that since the Minister of State came to the Department it has been at the top of his priorities, particularly in relation to the fishing indus<Col N="1172" /> try. I compliment him on such extensive legislation. In years to come, I hope many lives will be saved because of it.</P>

      <P>I associate myself with Senator Bonner's complimentary remarks to the Minister of State and his staff. This is good legislation and the Minister of State has handled its passage very generously and courteously. We had a good debate and the amendments were treated openly. The Bill is important in terms of safety regulations. This is an area that will grow enormously in this country and elsewhere and it is important that we provide for standards. We would like to see them extended, particularly into the arena of educational establishments, a matter at which the Minister of State has indicated he intends to look. We are pleased that good legislation has been put in place.</P>

      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister of State on the forthright way in which he dealt with everything here today and the discussion dealt fairly comprehensively with all aspects of the Bill. This is a new area for legislation and like all new areas, there are no ground rules or blueprint and we have to proceed cautiously. Nevertheless, despite some of the deficiencies that have been pointed out in the Bill, I am sure that when the new authority finds its feet, it will rectify anything that we may have overlooked. This legislation is a good attempt to improve public safety in all areas of adventure activity and if the hours we have spent debating it today result in the saving of even one life in any adventure activity referred to today, it will be well justified.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíoch a ghabháil leatsa, to the Seanad staff and the Senators from all sides who spoke. I also thank my own officials for keeping me on the right road. We have done a very good day's work. I especially thank the two Senators on the Opposition side for accommodating the passage of the Bill today. It is very important that we get it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I keep saying that it is a great pity that we have to have legislation in this area. I use this opportunity to ask anyone responsible for activity centres to apply common sense and ensure the greatest precautions necessary are taken. As Senator Caffrey said, if this legislation saves one life &ndash; I have no doubt that it will save many &ndash; then a great day's work will have been done and generations will remember this day for years to come.</P>
