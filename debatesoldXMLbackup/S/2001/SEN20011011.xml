      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise urgently to intervene with the management of Aer Lingus in relation to its proposal to reduce the number of Aer Lingus flights through Shannon by 68 flights per week.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed, but I wonder why the Leader sets time limits on such Bills because very few Members will exceed the time provided. Yesterday I pointed out to him that ten Bills dealing with terrorism would be taken shortly. He indicated he would inform the House about the Bills and when we might expect them. If he does not have the information, perhaps he could circulate it after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The Shannon issue will be raised on the Adjournment later, but there is a general desire that the entire Aer Lingus and Shannon issue should be debated fully next week if the Leader can organise it. Will he come back to me regarding a debate on Northern Ireland, which was requested yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Health and Children on the initiative and campaign he has <Col N="242" /> launched against binge drinking and excessive drinking, especially among third level students. This problem is growing ever more serious and I am appalled at the extent to which the drinks companies have targeted students at third level institutions. Hard liquor as well as beer is being thrown at students. There is scarcely a student event currently that is not sponsored in some form or another by a drinks company. This is an entirely cynical, almost criminal, move by the drinks companies, which are targeting people who are vulnerable. They are, in part at least, contributing to what is a major problem and it will be an enormous problem in years to come. I ask for a debate on this subject, but the message should also go out loud and clear to the major drinks companies that they have significant responsibilities and profit must not be the only motive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the need to have a discussion on what is happening in Aer Lingus, which I also raised yesterday. The reason I again ask the Leader to consider this is that there are seriously important strategic, industrial and social reasons for the House to express its view on the issue. I am being careful not to go into the issues of the day, but it is a function of the House in a representative capacity to focus on issues of national importance. We should, as a House, discuss this issue today to ensure our views are clearly understood outside the House and outside the country. That can only happen if we articulate our views in the House.</P>
      <P>Workers and industrialists in various other sectors are waiting to hear from the political leadership of all parties. It is not an issue on which we will divide along party lines, although there are people with different views within parties. However, everybody recognises this is a serious crisis and in the context of the European Union's influence on Ireland, the need for flexibility in European regulation and other matters come to the fore and it is crucially important that we address them. For that reason I ask the Leader to make a commitment that the issue will be discussed later. We should not wait until next week. People will have adopted positions over the weekend and we will have lost the opportunity to influence policy and decision making. I ask the Leader to bring forward the debate on this urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senators O'Toole and Manning for a debate on Aer Lingus at the earliest opportunity, which is today. I know Senator Taylor-Quinn has tabled a motion on the Adjournment in regard to Shannon Airport, but the situation at Aer Lingus has deteriorated rapidly with the proposed loss of 2,500 permanent jobs and 700 temporary jobs, which equates to 40% of the workforce, in an accounting exercise <Col N="243" /> as a result of the projected downturn in passenger numbers. This seems to be an upward curve which is associated with the new policies that have been put in place. There are questions to be answered about how the Government is dealing with management and without consultation with the unions. The last thing we hope it does is hide behind European Union regulations. We need a full discussion to bring this matter into the open. Given that the legislation we are discussing today is not of monumental consequence and could be done relatively rapidly, we should spend the afternoon discussing this issue which is of concern to everyone.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on an issue which has been raised by other people on a number of occasions and which is also in the daily news, namely, the banking service. I introduced legislation in the House earlier this year to try to establish some criteria which the banks would have to meet before they could close branches. However, the situation seems to have deteriorated since then. We are not only talking about the closure of branches but about the withdrawal of services. There is a need for a full discussion on this issue, particularly given that the post office network is also at risk in terms of the provision of financial and other services to the community. I ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the supply of drink in schools and colleges. It is a big problem and it is the gateway to other drugs. It is causing untold hardship for people. We have had many debates on this issue but we should have another one. We should make schools aware that they have a responsibility and they should not allow the drinks business to give free drinks in schools and colleges. Those who do that are no better than the drug pushers who give free drugs to people until they get them hooked on them. They must act responsibly. They can sell drink in the open market but they should not do so in schools and colleges. The Government should pass a Bill prohibiting drink in any school or university.</P>
      <P>As regards Aer Lingus, a man put forward a good proposal on the radio this morning that it should sell shares because many people would put £1,000 or £2,000 into it. This would arouse our patriotism. Many people, including myself, would be delighted to put £2,000 into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader will tell me when we can expect to see the disability legislation which has been promised for a long time. He undertook to inform me about the timescale but, unfortunately, I have not received a response. This is becoming more urgent every day. I would appreciate if legislation could be introduced in this Chamber as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Members who called for a discussion on the drinks problem and anti-social behaviour. I have experience of dealing with young people who are preparing for the transition from second to third level education and I know how vulnerable they can be. Sponsorships and attractive social outings lure them into a false sense of confidence. There is a huge responsibility on the drinks companies to take this into account. A debate in this House would create awareness of the issue.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the banks and the fact that they have reduced their services, particularly to senior citizens. I listened to the radio this morning and the replies given by the spokesperson for the banks were not satisfactory. I call for a discussion on this issue to make the banks aware that they may need to review their new policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the impact of the drinks industry, particularly on young people. It is a finite market, yet it continues to want to expand it. That can only mean they must push the customer to higher levels of drinking, which are dangerous. The targeting of young people, particularly young women, is outrageous. One has only to look around the streets of this city and many provincial cities and towns any weekend and also in the middle of the week to see the type of scandalous behaviour which is encouraged cynically by the drinks business through advertising, sponsorship and deliberately targeting vulnerable people. It is completely wrong. It is not like people pushing drugs, as Senator Farrell said, because alcohol is a dangerous drug. The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has known that for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also strongly support the calls for a debate on Aer Lingus. It is our national carrier which gives a service that the other yellow pack airlines do not provide. It is an important element of our tourism industry as it is an ambassador for the <Col N="245" /> country. It has had rotten management for a long time and the workers should not be penalised for this. A woman from the catering section was on the radio this morning and she said Aer Lingus is outsourcing catering, although it has the staff to do it. Aer Lingus meals are often bought in from Germany while our workers are left idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the banks. I also heard the radio programme and I laughed like a drain when I heard David Holden say there was general customer satisfaction. I do not know what type of customers he meets, but I have not bumped into him recently and I doubt if he has met too many other customers. We are furious with the lack of service we get from all the banks. They do not want flesh and blood customers cluttering up their nice little banks. They just want machines. They are driving the customers out. We are asylum seekers in our own banks. We are driven out, like asylum seekers, to queue in the rain where we are exposed to danger and to being mugged while, as taxpayers, we are paying to safeguard their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the withdrawal of banking services to the public. I also raised this issue last week. It is time for the Government to deal with this issue, particularly as it affects rural towns with populations of 600 and 700. It is time for the Government to take a lead and decide how services, including post office services, will be provided in the future to sustain our young and old population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader in his capacity as a member of the Oireachtas joint committee on broadcasting to inquire about the television coverage of this House. It is often the next day before the nation hears anything that is debated in this House. We had an important debate yesterday on a national issue which will have an impact on the nation, namely, the commissioning of a new facility at Sellafield, yet it did not get any television coverage last night. It is a contemptible way to treat this House. The Leader should buy curtains for the cameras here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Aer Lingus. I appreciate the difficulties we are facing in terms of the deepening crisis in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus is our national flag carrier in the skies. It is not essential that the debate takes place today, but it should take place as soon as possible. This crisis has deepened rapidly in recent weeks and it will not be resolved within days. It is of such national significance that the debate should take place as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="246" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order to take statements on Aer Lingus today, as No. 1. This issue has been debated in the Dáil and is being debated nationally. The only place where it is not being debated is in this House. I am glad to see that Senator Liam Fitzgerald will obviously support this motion. We are debating the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill which, quite honestly, is not a matter of enormous urgency. I do not hear a great deal about pirates doing damage out in Dublin Bay, whereas the Aer Lingus situation is an emergency.</P>
      <P>I also wish to add my voice to those who have so eloquently called for a debate on the banks. It is an issue of huge public concern. Silver-tongued spin doctors from the Bank of Ireland were on RTE Radio today, apparently to explain things which they really did not explain at all. It would be useful to have an all-party inquiry in order that bankers could answer questions here. If we are serious about it, let them come in here and sit in the Minister's chair to answer questions from Members of the House about what they are doing and why they are bullying the public because that is what is happening. They are also taking money from them under false pretences. We should seriously consider this. I am fed up with making constructive suggestions about bringing people in here, while the Leader says it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where the matter is discussed in secret, behind closed doors, and we never hear any more about it. We should see action in this House and a more transparent response on issues of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Ross's call for a debate on Aer Lingus today. As almost every Member of the House has called for a debate on it, we all recognise the urgency of the situation. I am a great supporter of Aer Lingus because at least when things go wrong the company apologises, which I find somewhat comforting.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning was right to send congratulations to the Minister for Health and Children on the initiative he has taken regarding the appalling amount of drinking which is promoted in third level institutions at this time of year. It is a serious issue and the Minister has made a definite effort this year to ensure something is done about it. Senator Ormonde says, rightly, that she knows very well how serious the issue is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning inquired about the ten proposed pieces of legislation which are at an advanced stage in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope I will have this information for the House next Wednesday. I made an inquiry about the matter earlier this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Farrell, Norris, Ross, Liam Fitzgerald and Henry all <Col N="247" /> called for a debate on Aer Lingus. Prior to the Order of Business this morning I was in touch with the office of the Minister for Public Enterprise. The Minister is attending the Dáil this morning and will be at Dublin Airport later to meet various groups from 1 p.m. onwards. It is of the utmost importance to have the Minister present for such a debate, and I can give an assurance that this matter will be debated in the House next week. The longest possible time will be afforded to all Members to make their contributions. I would like to have arranged the debate for today, but it is of the utmost importance to have the Minister present. The Minister is anxious to attend the House to participate in the debate and inform and update us on the position. For that very reason I ask Senators Ross and Henry who have proposed the amendment to the Order of Business to accept my undertaking that this matter will be debated in an open-ended manner next week.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning, Farrell, Ormonde, Norris and Henry offered their congratulations to the Minister for Health and Children regarding the problem of binge drinking that is now common practice in third level institutions. We should give a good example in this regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might consider an amendment to the relevant Act in relation to the abuses taking place in these institutions. During the years I was always taught and was of the opinion that a fit body meant a fit brain which gave one confidence. As a nation, we have been very successful in the sporting world, but fitness has no place where drink is involved. I accept Senator Manning's proposal for an all day debate on the current massive abuse of drink. Among younger workers up to 40% of disposable income is now being spent on alcohol, which can only lead to major problems in the not too distant future if something is not done about it.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Ross, Ormonde, Norris and Chambers called for a debate on banking services &ndash; or, as one Senator said, the lack of them &ndash; post office networking and related problems. I have already given a commitment to make time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh raised the Disability Bill. I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is on record as having said that the Bill will be published in December. As soon as that legislation is published, I will seek to have it initiated here, if possible. That is the up-to-date position.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey mentioned the broadcasting committee. It is my clear understanding that Seanad Éireann is afforded 25% of all broadcasting time on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, although I know this has not been the case in recent weeks. There is an unwritten precedent that the Dáil gets the major share, followed by the day's work in <Col N="248" /> the Seanad. No committee of the House is to be taken before the business of the Seanad. I will certainly be in touch with the relevant authorities and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, about this matter after the Order of Business this morning. I take Senator Caffrey's point concerning the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill that was initiated here, and yesterday's statements on the MOX plant at Sellafield. I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant authorities to have it corrected in order that the Seanad will be properly covered as the second parliamentary chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House addresses the need for a legal framework to deal with cases of alleged harassment of Irish fishing vessels at sea, incidents which amount to piracy as defined under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has been prepared in response to concerns about the harassment and intimidation of fishermen going about their business. The law regarding intervention, investigation and prosecution where incidents of harassment and intimidation are alleged to occur is uncertain. <Col N="249" /> This Bill seeks to remove this uncertainty. The Bill will also act as a deterrent and facilitate legal action in certain cases.</P>
    <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are to provide for the repression of acts of piracy committed by the crew or passengers on board ships within the territorial seas and internal waters of the State and, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, on the high seas; to define acts of piracy; to make it an offence to commit an act of piracy, as defined; to give authorised officers comprehensive powers to enable them take appropriate action; and to provide for the investigation and punishment of such acts of piracy and of infringements of the collision regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.</P>
    <P>We require this legislation to protect the lives and livelihoods of all fishermen and any other persons pursuing legitimate interests in our offshore area. It is unacceptable that fishermen are unlawfully impeded or have their safety put at risk by harassment and intimidation. Between 1994 and 1999 more than 50 such incidents were reported to my Department. A detailed review of these incidents showed that while there were some genuine cases of accidental collisions, the majority of incidents were not accidental. It has also been established that the majority of cases occurred outside our territorial waters where the jurisdiction of our laws has, to date, been uncertain.</P>
    <P>To provide a legislative basis for intervention, investigation and prosecution in respect of incidents outside our territorial waters, my Department undertook an intensive legal and technical analysis of the likely basis for any such legislation over the past two years. This analysis included the commissioning of an independent report from a major authority in this field, detailed consideration by the Attorney General's office, the preparation of a technical report by my Department working with BIM and the Naval Service and consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The issues involved were found to be extremely complex. Following detailed analysis, the legal advice to me clearly indicated that to provide an effective legislative regime outside our territorial waters, the way to proceed was to give effect to the piracy provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. At present, the State only has jurisdiction inside the 12 mile limit. Outside this area the provisions of UNCLOS apply, including the rights of free passage, with the exception of alleged fisheries offences as defined by EU law and concerned with the conservation of fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill I intend to extend the very limited legal powers available to the Minister and to make it a domestic offence to commit an act of piracy on the high seas as well as on the territorial seas and internal waters of the State. In light of this fact, I have provided that the Bill, once enacted, should apply generally at sea, except <Col N="250" /> within the territorial seas of another state, and in so far as acts of piracy involving incidents between sea-fishing boats are concerned, it should not apply within the exclusive fishery limits of another state.</P>
    <P>In effect, the proposed legislation seeks to carry into domestic law the provisions of UNCLOS which apply to incidents of piracy between ships occurring on the high seas, with the exception of incidents between sea-fishing boats within the exclusive fishery waters or limits of another state. It would not be appropriate for this State to seek to enforce such legislation within the exclusive fishery waters or limits of another state, EU or otherwise. Where incidents involving Irish vessels occur within such areas they will fall to be addressed under the law of that state, where such laws exist.</P>
    <P>The House will understand that the approach taken in drafting this legislation is the result of a detailed and searching analysis by the legal advisers to the State in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office. The House will also appreciate that there has been a long-standing need to put in place an appropriate framework to safeguard all fishermen on the high seas. In light of this need and the close scrutiny and thought which has been put into it, I am satisfied that the legislation, as drafted is the best and most appropriate way to proceed on this issue.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will apply to all types of ships, commercial, fishing, merchant marine and pleasure. Acts of piracy are defined in the Bill in accordance with Article 101 of UNCLOS and certain examples of piracy are specified in the Bill, including the intentional ramming of another ship and the deliberate towing away of fishing gear belonging, and attached to, another ship.</P>
    <P>Penalties under the Bill for piracy offences are, on summary conviction, a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 &ndash; £2,362.69 &ndash; and/or up to six months imprisonment and, on conviction on indictment, an unlimited maximum fine and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 20 years. Penalties for obstruction, failure to comply with a reasonable requirement of, or giving false information to, an authorised officer are, on summary conviction, a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 &ndash; £2,362.69 &ndash; and/or up to three months imprisonment and, on conviction on indictment, a maximum fine of &euro;6,000 &ndash; £4,725.38 &ndash; and/or up to two years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill gives extensive powers of enforcement to authorised officers appointed by the Minister, including powers to board ships suspected of engaging in piracy or ships which are in contravention of the collision regulations, and powers of seizure and detention of the ship or anything on it. It also provides for the reasonable use of force by authorised officers.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses the lack of powers to enforce the collision regulations within territorial waters under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Section 419 of this Act provides that all owners <Col N="251" /> and masters of ships shall obey the collision regulations made under section 418 of the Act and creates an offence of infringement of these regulations. However, until now the Naval Service or other authorised officers did not have the power to arrest or detain any vessel suspected of an offence under section 419 of the 1894 Act. The Bill before the Seanad will provide, within the territorial waters of the State, for the boarding by authorised officers of ships on which offences against the collision regulations have been committed and the seizure and detention of such ships and anything on them as evidence. This will normally be undertaken by Naval Service personnel.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give the authorities the necessary powers to deal with acts of piracy generally in accordance with the UN Law of the Sea Convention. There has been an increase in the number of acts of piracy being committed worldwide. The Government shares the concerns expressed at the meeting of the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organisation held last June regarding this increase in piracy. A total of 471 acts of piracy had been reported to the IMO during 2000, representing an increase of 162 acts over the 1999 figure. Even worse was the finding that during the period under review, 72 crew members of the ships involved had been killed, 129 had been injured and five missing.</P>
    <P>I advise the House that I propose to table three amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. These amendments are mainly intended to tighten up on the wording of the text to ensure that it accords with the provisions of UNCLOS. Specifically, they propose to insert in page 7, subsection (6), line 38, a provision that it is the flag state to which the Minister would be liable for any loss or damage caused by seizure and detention of a ship on the high seas without adequate grounds for doing so &ndash; this is in accordance with Article 106 of UNCLOS; insert in page 7, between lines 39 and 40, a provision that it is only a State ship as defined in the Defence Act, 1954, which may carry out seizure and detention of a pirate ship on the high seas &ndash; this is in accordance with Article 107 of UNCLOS; and, for the avoidance of doubt, insert in page 7, subsection (7), line 43, a provision that it is only members of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána who are empowered to carry firearms or other weapons while exercising the powers of authorised officers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very important legislative tool to enable us to deal effectively with acts of harassment and intimidation in our territorial waters and on the high seas. I am sure Senators from all parties share the view that such a framework is in the interest of all concerned and I look forward to hearing their comments. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important legislation. Recent events have demonstrated what can happen in <Col N="252" /> relation to piracy and hijacking. I intend to go through the important elements of this Bill, whether it takes me five, ten or 15 minutes. There are some matters the Minister needs to clarify. The Convention of the Law of the Sea states:</P>
      <P>Piracy consists of any of the following acts:</P>
      <P>(a)&nbsp;any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;</P>
      <P>(b)&nbsp;an act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;</P>
      <P>(c)&nbsp;any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>).</P>
      <P>It goes on about warships and Government aircraft and crew, etc.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister has not mentioned the word &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo;. Would it be advisable to incorporate it into the legislation at this juncture given the importance aircraft play in modern piracy and hijacking? There is some ambiguity in relation to that aspect. I have not heard of an aircraft being at sea, unless it was ditched. I presume it is a conventional aircraft on land that the convention refers to, it did not say flying boat or any other type of marine aircraft. There is no mention of aircraft in the Bill or whether piracy on an aircraft is an offence. Maybe it should be included. Piracy is another word for hijacking and one cannot be half a hijacker or half a pirate no more than one can be half pregnant. The summary conviction should be eliminated and piracy should be deemed an indictable offence. We have shown too much tolerance for this type of offence in the past. That is evidenced by the Minister's speech where he quotes some alarming statistics. He stated:</P>
      <P>A total of 471 acts of piracy had been reported to the IMO during 2000, representing an increase of 162 acts over the 1999 figure. Even worse was the finding that during the period under review, 72 crew members of the ships involved had been killed, 129 had been injured and five missing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are alarming statistics and those types of offences should not be dealt with under summary conviction. I recommend that we delete summary conviction from the Bill and include indictable offence. We have been far too lenient and this type of leniency sends out the wrong signals to these people. It is time they were brought to heel <Col N="253" /> and that enforcement was matched by proper levels of fines and imprisonment. Until we do that we will not stop piracy on the high seas.</P>
    <P>I know that there are cases of small time harassment and of fishing boats at loggerheads with one another in a seaborne turf war. Summary convictions may be needed in that area but I certainly want to see more stringent enforcement and higher fines to provide a greater deterrent for this type of operation. In light of what happened on 11 September, we cannot have any more tolerance for pirates, half pirates, hijackers or whatever one wants to call them.</P>
    <P>During the debate in this House yesterday on Sellafield and the MOX reprocessing facility there were many valuable contributions. I regret that during the Order of Business I had to raise the fact that it got no coverage whatsoever. There were many erudite contributions &ndash; in particular Senator Liam Fitzgerald produced a well researched document and it deserved more coverage than it got. In the course of the debate it became obvious that radiological weapons can now be transported by sea. It does not need to be a nuclear weapon. Sufficient radioactive material can shroud other material and be detonated. The high seas will now become an area which terrorists will highlight and watch more carefully. With more restrictions being put in place, use of the air seems to be cut off from them at present but despite all the restrictions it may be impossible to fully prevent acts of terrorism and hijacking of aircraft.</P>
    <P>We are dealing primarily with the sea. In view of the capacity of ships nowadays for transporting dangerous material which, if released at sea, could have disastrous effects on the country and, in particular, its marine life, we need to look seriously at this legislation to ensure its provisions are capable of meeting the intelligence of these hijackers, pirates and terrorists. It is now a war of intelligence in which the best intelligence and the best preventive provisions will win.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address several issues, one of which, summary convictions, should be phased out or, perhaps, eliminated from the Bill. We cannot be serious enough about hijackings, piracy and harassment at sea. Sometimes a minor dispute among fishermen develops into a major one. These statistics on acts of piracy, deaths and injuries possibly reflect the escalation of minor disputes into major confrontations leading to death and injury. The Bill attempts to legislate for this type of activity at sea.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain the position of aircraft in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Are they in conflict? Why is the word &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; not in the Bill? We have busy airports in which the possibility of hijacking is ever present. We have no mechanism for preventing hijackings except the normal airport security systems which seem to be breached periodically. We certainly have no national defence mechanism and need one. The Government should be actively investigating some form <Col N="254" /> of defence mechanism at this juncture. We are at the mercy of many people. When something happens we will have to look to outsiders for help because we do not have the resources to deal with a major hijacking or major event at sea.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome at this time. It was obviously drafted before the events of 11 September which have changed our views on everything and radically altered our perception of this type of legislation. We have to look at it now from a wider perspective realising that anything is possible both on the high seas and in the air. We must look at enforcement procedures and examine more critically fines and imprisonment with a view to creating indictable offences. There are no half measures in these circumstances. There is no such thing as a half pirate or half hijacker. If one has criminal intent, one must be dealt with using the full rigours of the law. This legislation goes some way towards that. I hope it goes all the way once it has been amended in both Houses.</P>
    <P>I know at heart the Minister is also anxious to ensure piracy at sea and the minor harassment that leads to these major confrontations and conflicts with resulting loss of life and limb are curtailed and eliminated. Clarification is needed on the relationship between the Convention on the Law of the Sea and this legislation. I ask the Minister to explain the fact that there is no reference &ndash; unless I missed it &ndash; to aircraft in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is technical legislation with comprehensive provisions. It is welcome at this juncture. I hope we can improve it through debate in both Houses and I am sure the Minister will not be slow to accept improvements. We will deal with aspects of it which were possibly overlooked today on Committee Stage. I look forward to the other contributions to find out which other areas of the legislation have been identified for improvements in the light of everything that has happened and is likely to happen in the foreseeable future, both on the high seas and in the air. It is not possible to legislate for everything. We will scrutinise this Bill and give it every chance of meeting the requirements the Minister envisages. It will go a long way towards preventing the type of harassment, piracy and hijacking about which we all read too frequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. As somebody who spent a term in this House, he is welcome back, not as a Senator, but as a Minister. It is nice to see so many Senators progressing up the line and returning as Ministers. That applies across the board, to all parties. I also welcome the fact that this is yet another Bill initiated in this House. It provides further recognition of the qualities of the Upper House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey made a very serious contribution on this Bill. Like Senator Ross, I only gave it a cursory glance. On seeing the title, Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill, I formed the impression that Bluebeard was still at large and was reminded of Long John Silver and <i>Treasure <Col N="255" />Island.</i><i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i> comes to mind as a true and realistic takeover of a ship. However, this is far more serious than all the stories we heard growing up. This legislation may not have been so necessary in the past, but it is now. All of us, including the Minister and everyone connected with the fishing business, will know that until about ten years ago we only had an inshore fleet of boats which were no bigger than 50 feet in length and very rarely ventured outside the 12 mile limit. Boats now go tuna fishing 200 or 300 miles away from their home ports. They go from Killybegs, Dingle, Dunmore East and Castletownbere down to the Azores.</P>
    <P>I saw a satellite image print recently of the number of boats fishing within our 200 mile limit. Each little dot on the image represented a boat; a red dot denoted a Spanish vessel and a blue dot a French boat. There was not much room for all the dots &ndash; there were about 300 or 400 boats fishing in that territory. These boats need about 20 or 30 miles space in which to trawl the seabed and they use up to five kilometres of nets for drift netting. Inevitably they will encroach on their neighbour's territory. We aim to protect the best fishing grounds but everybody wants to fish where the stocks are plentiful.</P>
    <P>The activities of the foreign fleets have shown our fishermen how much fish there is in our 200 mile area. Young fishermen are acquiring bigger and better boats funded by the State. An unprecedented number of large new fishing vessels have been introduced into the national fleet in the past five years. I am often accused of being parochial but I must mention that just a year and a half ago, the Minister launched a £3 million boat for the Flannery family in Dingle. That boat is fishing successfully. Two months after that another new boat costing £1.25 million was launched.</P>
    <P>There is a need for this legislation. Before the last decade the number of Irish fishing boats fishing outside the 12 mile limit was very small, only a handful. The opportunity for better fishing within the 200 mile limit has attracted perhaps up to 50 or 60 Irish boats currently fishing in that area. It is a reasonably lucrative business and legislation is now required to protect our fleet.</P>
    <P>The Minister has instanced at 50 the number of complaints to his Department between 1994 and 1999. That figure could probably be doubled because many incidents go unreported, involving foreign vessels sailing through the fishing nets of others, of boats being threatened. I do not know of any very serious offence but there has been intimidation. This information was given to me by fishermen from Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere and Dunmore East. They all complain of intimidation happening in our own fishing area. I am aware that it is a shared EU area but we still regard it as our own. I doubt if the sort of blackguardism that is happening in our territorial waters would be tolerated in the territorial waters of Great Britain, Spain or any other country. My <Col N="256" /> only regret is that this legislation was not in place earlier. I am sure it will be welcomed by all in the fishing community. They must be protected.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some of our fishermen commit offences. When they are arrested, it is not uncommon for a bond of £40,000 to be demanded until the next court sitting. The next court will often confiscate their catch and fishing gear. The fines will often amount to £80,000 or £100,000. I disagree on this point with the Minister. The financial fines in this Bill are ludicrous. If a person damages a boat or injures or threatens someone, they should be fined. I cannot see the relationship between &euro;3,000 and six months in prison. The fine should be in the region of &euro;100,000 if the prison sentence is for six months. I presume I am correct in saying that the fine is &euro;3,000, and that I did not misread it. The Minister should increase that fine.</P>
    <P>The legislation deals with our territorial waters up to the 200 mile limit. International waters are beyond that 200 mile limit and are not in the ownership of any country in particular. What powers does the Naval Service have over any act committed in international waters? Tuna fishing is in international waters and there is a lot of intimidation involved. Drift netting for tuna finished last year, unless there is some change of mind on the part of the EU. No matter what net is used, tuna fishing has become established. What protection will our fleet have outside the 200 mile limit? This legislation deals with the issue of intimidation and offences committed against fishing vessels within our waters.</P>
    <P>We should also keep in mind what Senator Caffrey has said. Despite the horrific tragedies in America recently and how they were committed, suggestions we might make about events which could happen here could be ridiculed. We do not know what the future holds. We hope that nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a great advocate of and has made progress in the development of marina facilities around our coast. With these new marinas come more yachts. On the Continent, piracy occurs when fast boats pull up to yachts and simply commandeer them. A friend of mine took his boat to the Mediterranean, left it there for a few months because weather conditions were not suitable for bringing it back and on returning he found it had been stolen. We could flippantly say that an act of piracy would never happen here, but there is a large number of pleasure boats on our coast and they must be protected.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole will discuss inland waterways. I do not know if the Minister knows that Senator O'Toole is the proud owner of a boat and now thinks he knows everything about boats and fishing.</P>

      <P>I forgive him for that, at least he started in the right place. I welcome this Bill and we will look at it again as it goes through the <Col N="257" /> House. The only fault I find is that the fines are too low and are disproportionate to the prison sentences. They should be increased and, in the case of offences by fishing vessels, the confiscation of gear, catch and in serious cases the vessel itself should be considered. The law must be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation and we should be supportive of it. Any difficulties we have can be dealt with during the Bill's passage. As Senator Fitzgerald has done, it is useful to discuss general maritime issues. I ask the Minister to take responsibility for creating a better understanding of maritime culture which is being widely ignored. In any other country, people are proud of their maritime history but this is not the case in Ireland. There are some lighthouses such as the Hook which have been converted as showpieces, but by their nature they are remote and therefore often forgotten.</P>
      <P>This is no time to discuss Aer Lingus but that issue has reminded me of the loss of Irish Shipping. It was a bad strategic decision for Ireland to allow that company to close. We have been lucky that, as exports have grown at an extraordinary rate, we have been able to sustain that growth without our own merchant navy. Part of the problem is that there is a lack of understanding of maritime issues by people who live more than 30 miles inland. This is perceived as an issue for those who live around the coastline but it should concern the nation as a whole. In other island nations there is an engagement with the sea, shipping and boats. Those of us who grew up in fishing towns remember long nights during storms, long before today's improved communications, wondering if a ship would come back. Senator Fitzgerald and I would remember those black mornings when fishing boats did not come back and lives had been lost. I recognise the contribution that these mariners have made.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, when the <i>LE Deirdre</i> was being de-commissioned, I raised the point in this House that it was a serious error for the State not to maintain the ship as a museum for the benefit of tourists and schools. I know of no port of significant size in Europe where one cannot visit a museum ship. They are even present in smaller towns. There are museums in Southampton and on the south coast of England as well as in London. It is appalling that we recently sold the <i>LE Deirdre</i> for £200,000 when the scrap metal of the top deck would be worth that on its own. It is also a poor way to honour those people who served on that ship, turning it into a pleasure boat rather than utilising it for tourism and for education in order to reflect our maritime culture. I regret the fact that no local authority attempted to raise the £200,000, in order to buy the ship for those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the drafters of this Bill on their extraordinarily detailed definition of piracy in section 3 which includes a deliberate attempt by the crew or passengers of a private ship to disable <Col N="258" /> another ship, the use of firearms by such members or passengers, the intentional ramming of another ship, and the deliberate towing away of fishing gear belonging to and attached to another ship which is a sea-fishing boat. However, I do not understand why, in section 2, the Bill omits to cover acts of piracy &ldquo;in so far as the acts involve incidents between sea-fishing boats within Community fishing waters. . .  being waters which are recognised by the State as being under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of another Member State&rdquo;. I do not understand the language here. Surely acts of piracy committed anywhere in the waters of the Community can be dealt with by us as members of the Community and, if not, by countries which are party to the many agreements, including that from which this Bill derives, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea done at Montego Bay. I ask the Minister to clarify this. I also do not understand why the Act would not apply to a ship owned or operated by another state and used only on the non-commercial service of its government. Members of the crew of such a ship could have mutinied and taken control but would not be deemed to have committed an act of piracy. I am sure there is an explanation for that in international terms but it leaves gaps in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not clear whether outside EU waters, on the high seas, authorised officers can, in hot pursuit of alleged offenders, engage in the enforcement of the Act. Does this mean that a boat may go outside the appropriate territorial limit with its occupants secure in the knowledge that they are untouchable? The only reference to this in the Bill is that where a ship has been seized and detained other than in the territorial seas of the State, without adequate grounds for doing so, the Minister shall be liable. That is important but it does not deal with the possibility of, for example, one of our naval boats attempting to prevent or to respond to an act of piracy, which may require it to go beyond the territorial limits of the State. Where does that leave the authority of this legislation? An amendment should be added to allow the Act to apply outside territorial waters. On the high seas, no writ of any state runs, but the law of the sea is in effect.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House will accept the low fines. The idea that a person who has committed an act of piracy &ndash; which includes the use of firearms or weapons, the intentional ramming of another ship, the deliberate towing away of gear, unlawful acts of violence or detention or a deliberate attempt to take over or disable another ship &ndash; even on summary conviction, could be fined an amount not exceeding £2,300 is not acceptable. This would not pay for the radar arch or the aerials on a boat. Section 5(10) contains references to fines of up to £4,700 on summary conviction. Considering the cost of the equipment, these fines are laughable. They should be removed from the Bill, leaving the judge to decide the amount of the fine. There should be an entitlement for the authorised officers of the State to confiscate the <Col N="259" /> equipment or the boat of persons guilty of piracy or of the other named offences in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Piracy is not a crime that is widely understood on the mainland, but it is an appalling act, similar to stealing, setting fire to or driving a bulldozer through somebody's house, except that a boat or a ship is involved. The fine should reflect the severity of the incident. The figures quoted for summary conviction or indictment are not enough. Section 4(2)(<i>b</i>) provides that on conviction or indictment, a person may be liable to a fine, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 20 years, or both. That is the only section where the Bill is silent concerning the amount of the fine. I would prefer to have it silent in all sections rather than to have a figure as low as £2,300. The Minister welcomed a large new fishing vessel to Ireland's territorial waters some months ago. I cannot remember how many million pounds that ship cost, but the idea that somebody could ram it, take it over, mutiny, or damage or steal it and be fined such small amounts on summary conviction is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am sure that I reflect the Minister's own view on this. It would be preferable to declare these acts crimes, to retain the periods of imprisonment, six months for summary conviction and 20 years for indictment, but to increase the fines substantially or to remove them altogether. These figures bring the Bill into disrepute, and people may point to them as a weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from these issues, I welcome this legislation and ask the Minister to bear in mind the matters I have raised. I will be listening to his reply at the end of the Second Stage. It is good to see us meeting our international requirements under the conventions of the laws of the sea, in this case the Montego Bay Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is something of a mishmash, neither fish nor fowl. The preamble is concerned with old-style repression of acts of piracy. It refers to our implementation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea done at Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1982. We have waited almost 20 years for its implementation. That convention is concerned with repression of acts of piracy committed by the crew or passengers on board ships within the territorial seas and internal waters of the State. However, the Minister in his introductory speech states, &ldquo;The Bill before the House today addresses the need for a legal framework to deal with cases of alleged harassment of Irish fishing vessels at sea, incidents which amount to piracy as defined under international law.&rdquo;  This is a bad way to introduce legislation &ndash; to graft something which is relevant to this country to an international law of the sea, under the Montego Bay Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definitions of piracy are the weirdest that I have ever come across. The first half relates to the Montego Bay Convention, which is concerned with mutiny of crew members. This is not piracy &ndash; it is acts of depredation, unlawful acts using <Col N="260" /> firearms or other means of taking control of the ship. The second half also has nothing to do with piracy, rather protection of the fishing fleet. My definition of piracy is concerned with people from a pirate ship boarding and taking possession of another ship. It is a hijacking. There is no reference here to this crucial issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have listened to last night's numerous contributions concerning the threat of the new mixed oxide fuel plant at Sellafield. The plutonium and uranium that will be stockpiled there will be transported around the world, via the Irish Sea. If the Minister has chosen to present a mishmash Bill, dealing on the one hand with the Montego Bay international United Nations covenant in relation to the high seas &ldquo;mutiny on the bounty&rdquo; type of situation and on the other hand he wishes to graft on what he regards as appropriate in terms of our fishing fleet, why will he not look at the most pressing need in the context of piracy which is currently facing us?</P>
    <P>It has taken successive Governments 20 years to deal with the first part of this Bill, having found that our legislation in relation to protection from intimidation and harassment of our fishing fleet is obscure and unclear. Now is the time to look at the real threat in relation to piracy in terms of attempts to board ships carrying nuclear part-fuels from which nuclear weapons could be created. This Bill is totally silent on anything of that nature and anything other than mutiny or harassment. What provision is there in relation to boarding or hijacking of a ship by pirates coming on board, as distinct from the crew mutinying, or as distinct from an Irish ship being rammed or having its fishing gear cut by a ship from a Spanish, Russian or other large fleet? I put it to the Minister that this is not a satisfactory Bill. It should deal with all major acts of piracy, otherwise the Minister should have presented it as the Law of the Sea (Protection of the Irish Fishing Fleet) Bill. I suggest the Minister take back this Bill and take a fresh look at it in light of the potential terrorist threats now facing this country.</P>
    <P>The Government has said it will produce 11 Bills between now and Christmas to deal with terrorism on an international footing. The most likely area of terrorist threat to Ireland is in the context of Sellafield and the potential nuclear weapons which will be sailing past our shores once that plant is up and running, with materials being transported, largely by sea, to Germany, Japan and elsewhere. Will the Minister say if there is a single word in this Bill to protect a vessel in Irish territorial seas from hijacking by pirates boarding and taking possession of the ship and stealing from it? There is nothing in the Bill about the potential threat of a ship being seized and having plutonium or other nuclear materials removed from it by pirates. This is flawed legislation which does not respond to the particular needs of the time. The Minister should accept that the Bill requires too many changes. He <Col N="261" /> should take it away, reflect on it and come back with a Bill which we can discuss in the context of very recent threats from sea piracy which was not in contemplation when this Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the penalties provided for in the Bill, which are unbelievable. The figure is not even £3,000, but &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000. That is ridiculous. There is no reference to substantial fines or confiscation of fishing gear, or vessels involved in this form of piracy. The penalties provided for in the Bill, albeit in a summary fashion initially, are not a deterrent but rather a laughable effort at dealing with the repression of piracy within our territorial waters or on the high seas.</P>
    <P>Our fishing fleet deserves protection, but it should be provided in a separate Bill not related to piracy, which is an entirely different concept from what the Minister is mainly trying to deal with in this Bill. This approach, in many ways, reflects the manner in which we have dealt with our fishing industry &ndash; it has never been taken seriously. Would our agriculture industry get a mishmash Bill like this, with something grafted on to deal with a totally extraneous matter? That just would not happen because agriculture is taken seriously. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources should ensure that the legislation which he brings forward will properly respect our fishing heritage.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that industry has not been developed sufficiently. We sold off much of our birthright in that respect when Ireland joined the European Union. Nevertheless, substantial gains have been made in recent years in relation to the strength of our fishing industry and its ability to operate beyond a 12 mile limit and beyond our own territorial waters. As a smaller country with a smaller fleet, we have been bullied by the big boys, particularly the Russian and Spanish fleets which have caused substantial acts of vandalism against our fleet, such as cutting fishing gear and ramming our ships. That should be dealt with in the context of protection of the fishing fleet, with appropriate penalties.</P>
    <P>We also need appropriate resources, but the Bill is very silent on providing the means, mechanisms and policing to make it effective. There is not a word about how this is to happen in general terms other than that the authorities to deal with it will be the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. How are the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána to find the culprits? That will require considerable expenditure, but the Bill is silent on that.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Bill if I thought it would do any good or that it was pertinent to the problem which faces us. Our problems relate to our fishing fleet and the likely or possible boarding of vessels within our territorial waters. The Bill addresses one aspect in a very inadequate fashion but is totally silent on the other aspect.</P>

      <P>If this was such a major point in the Bill, the Minister should have referred to it in his opening contribution. It is not usual for a Minister to hide his light under a bushel, so to speak, with regard to the strength and richness of his contribution. I have not seen the matter in the Bill and the Minister has not referred to it in his speech. Unless he makes it clear how the matter will be dealt with, I would find little satisfaction in supporting this legislation. I advise the Minister to go back to the drawing board and come up with a substantial contribution in relation to the definition. Can the Minister show me where the definition of piracy refers to anything other than mutiny on a ship or ramming of a ship, or to the fishing fleet as such? I would like to see that definition, which is not now in the Bill. There is no emphasis on it in the Bill and no reference to relevant penalties. Until that is presented, I cannot give anything other than a very lukewarm welcome to this legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The Bill is very appropriate and timely and I congratulate the Minister on being one of the most hands on Ministers we have had in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for a long time. He has done much good work. From talking to fishermen and people in the business, I assure him that he is held in very high esteem.</P>
      <P>What I like about this Bill is that it will protect what I refer to as sea tourism. Yachting is big business today. We have seen yachts being hijacked and this Bill will protect them and yacht racing enthusiasts who are bringing more tourism to our country.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on making available to the north Sligo area, to Rosses Point, £1 million towards a marina. It is important there is a necklace of marinas around the country because this type of tourism can be very profitable, particularly at present when we must encourage sea tourism. I welcome the Bill and the fact that the Minister has taken into account the protection of those tourists and their yachts as well as other ships. He is doing a very good job and I congratulate him again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The niceties of the Bill are beyond me, not being a great expert in either fishing or maritime matters. There is one area about which I am concerned. The word &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; has to be used and it is not in the Bill. This is a serious problem nowadays. The problem of ships being boarded on the high seas will not be as great as the hijacking of near in vessels for use as goodness knows what against other vessels which may be transporting nuclear weapons or nuclear waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the definition of piracy in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) is rather narrow &ndash;&ldquo;the use of firearms or other weapons by such members or passengers&rdquo; as described. With the recent hijacking of airplanes, we have seen that people do not <Col N="263" /> use guns to disable the crew and passengers. Much more basic instruments are used such as box cutters and quite small knives, as in the case of the hijacking of the planes which were eventually flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Washington and, sadly, into the ground in Pennsylvania. We should include agents which can disable because we might find that these are not always included under chemical weapons. The inclusion of this would be useful, given that chemical and biological weapons will become far more useful to terrorists hijacking boats, airplanes or whatever, and particularly agents which are not described as weapons that can disable a crew.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that we include this given that section 3(3) covers members of the crew of a ship referred to in section 2(3), that is, a warship of another state or a ship owned or operated by another state and used only on a non-commercial service of its government. If they mutiny and take control of such a ship, they will be deemed to have committed an act of piracy. They are in a very suitable position to use a disabling agent, such as I have suggested, to overpower those in control of the ship at a specific time. I suggest to the Minister that we should consider including this in that section. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to this effect and I hope he will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. Their comments demonstrate a recognition of the urgent need to put in place the necessary legislative framework to equip us to deal with harassment and intimidation of our fishermen. As I said in my opening speech, there is a need to protect the lives and livelihoods of Irish fishermen pursuing their legitimate interests in our off shore area. There is a need as well to deal with the other threats which may arise and which have been mentioned in the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey referred to the exclusion of aircraft from the Bill. Aircraft are included in the convention but it is outside the remit of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to legislate for acts of piracy on or against aircraft. The Senator also mentioned terrorism. If the conduct involved comes within the definition of &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; as set out under the UN law of the sea in the Bill, it would be covered by the provisions in this legislation. It would be a matter for the Attorney General as the prosecuting authority to decide whether to pursue a prosecution under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey and other Senators referred to the question of summary conviction. A number of Senators said it was not sufficient and that all should be indictable offences. There is a range of incidents and some would not justify prosecution as an indictable offence. For this reason, there is <Col N="264" /> a need to leave open the avenue of summary conviction. It will be a matter for the Attorney General's office as the prosecuting authority to decide whether a case is dealt with on a summary basis or on indictment. The existence of this legislation and the fact there is a summary offence will, in itself, be a very strong protection, particularly for our fishermen, against acts of piracy.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald referred to the fines being low &ndash;&euro;3,000 on summary conviction. This was also mentioned by Senator O'Toole. As regards the penalties under the Bill versus those under the fishery Acts, it should be noted that this Bill is providing for custodial sentences both on summary conviction and on indictment, for offences including those relating to obstruction and failing to comply with the requirement of or giving false information to an authorised officer. Senator Tom Fitzgerald also inquired as to the jurisdiction outside the 200 mile limit. The Bill applies, as I already said, to the territorial seas, that is, to the 12 mile limit and inland waters and the high seas, including Ireland's fishery zone up to the jurisdictional areas of other states. The high seas is covered in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the exclusion of war ships and government ships under section 2(3) except in the case of mutinies in accordance with Articles 95 and 96 of the convention. He also made the point that the Bill does not apply beyond the territorial seas. As I said in response to Senator Fitzgerald's contribution, the convention applies to the high seas only, that is, beyond the territorial seas. The Bill proposes to include the Irish territorial seas.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also asked the reason we exclude the fishery limits of other states. The Naval Service, as part of its fisheries protection function under the Common Fisheries Policy, confines its patrols to the Irish fisheries zone and does not have jurisdiction in the fisheries zones of other states. As I said, it would not be appropriate to enforce the provisions of this Bill in the waters of another state; where incidents involving Irish vessels occur within such areas they will fall to be addressed under the law of that state where such laws exist. I repeat that the approach taken in the drafting of this legislation is the result of very detailed and searching analysis by the legal advisers of the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello stated it is not appropriate to use the Convention on the Law of the Sea for fishery incidents, but the legal advice to me is that carrying into domestic law the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea is the most appropriate mechanism under international law. As I said, the piracy provisions of UNCLOS allow Ireland and other states to exercise jurisdiction over such offences on the high seas. We are now availing of that right under international law and I reiterate that the framework was drafted after intensive analysis by the State's legal advisers.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised the inadequacy of the definition of &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; in section 3, but that is not <Col N="265" /> true. Section 3 refers to acts by one ship against another, which covers all the incidents he described. It is clearly set out in section 3.</P>

However, I would be happy to look at this in the Dáil debate and discuss it with the Senator. If necessary, I am open to making the change suggested by her in the Dáil, but I am advised at this point that the term &ldquo;other weapons&rdquo; includes all kinds of pencils and box cutters as well as chemical or biological agents that could be used as weapons. If we were to start being definitive, we could cause problems, but I am happy to look at this with a view to introducing an amendment in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 19, after &ldquo;weapons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other disabling agents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the definition of weapons in this section will not cover other agents which could be used to disable the crew or passengers of another ship, a warship of another state or a ship owned or operated by another state and used only on non-commercial service by its Government on which a mutiny takes place. Chemical agents which could be inhaled, ingested or given by injection could be used in such circumstances and they would not be covered by the legislation. We must take account of the fact that this method of hijacking may become much more common than that involving the use of guns, knives or box cutters. I accept the Minister's statement on Second Stage that he is advised that such agents would be covered under the legislation and that they would be considered to be weapons. However, I am always anxious that legislation should be as obvious as possible so that it does not take too erudite a person to realise that these agents are also covered.</P>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 6 in respect of section 5(7) because the term &ldquo;or other disabling agents&rdquo; might be sufficient in aiding those trying to subdue those involved in an act of piracy. People committing these crimes might not need to take guns, box cutters and knives with them. In that context, what is the position with regard to tear gas? Is it considered a weapon? I thought the section should be usable by those boarding a ship. Perhaps the Minister believes the amendments are unnecessary but they may prove useful in terms of providing clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of section 1(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), I am prepared to accept an amendment which uses a term such as &ldquo;or anything capable of being used as a weapon&rdquo;. The parliamentary counsel is preparing an accurate wording, which I propose to include on Report Stage. I accept the thrust of the Senator's amendment and will define a weapon as &ldquo;anything capable of being used as a weapon&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;other disabling agents.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to be more specific in section 3(7) because whatever force is required by the authorised officer is covered and I am satisfied that would include tear gas or any other weapons to assist the officers in the exercise of their pow<Col N="267" /> ers. I do not accept there is a need to amend this subsection, but I am happy to table an amendment to section 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) to cover the point made by Senator Henry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3(5) is satisfactory because the authorised officers will be able to use everything. Sometimes the more minimal the weapon the better because fire is returned by fire generally. I am anxious to agree with the Minister regarding amendment No. 1, but I am concerned about the word &ldquo;weapon&rdquo;. Can something which disables a person always be described as a weapon? If one uses something which cannot be described as a weapon, would it be covered by the legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason we are prepared to insert wording such as &ldquo;anything capable of being used as a weapon&rdquo;. If any other agent, such as those described by the Senator, is used aggressively, it can be described as a weapon because it is capable of being used as a weapon. We do not want to go into detail on this for that reason. If one is more specific, anything could be described as a weapon, including a chair.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry referred to the use of wording where everything would not simply be described as a weapon. Wording such as &ldquo;any disabling agent capable of being used as a weapon&rdquo; could be used. The use of the word &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; might not be broad enough to cover the mechanism used. It may not be a weapon, but it could have the effect of disabling somebody. Perhaps some time needs to be spent deliberating on this.</P>

      <P>This is a nice semantic argument. There is no difference between what the Minister and the Senators wish to achieve. It is a matter of taking more time, as Senator Costello said. Perhaps it would be useful to get away from <Col N="268" /> the concept of a weapon <i>per se</i> and think instead of the condition one wants to avoid, which is where somebody is overcome by force or being terrorised into doing something. The Minister might wish to try to concentrate on that aspect of the definition.</P>
      <P>There is a concern that people think of a weapon as an artefact or physical object. People can use mock weapons and impose their will through terror or threat. The Minister could import that notion into the definition by using wording such as &ldquo;any other object which could be used for the purpose of securing control&rdquo;. I do not have a handy form of words and the Minister will have to consult a legal lexicon, but I am encouraged that he is prepared to re-examine the definition and with a little goodwill an omnibus phrase could be found to address the issue. There is a danger in stepping outside the frame of defining a &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; that one could extend the definition endlessly because, as the Minister said, almost anything can be weapon. We must think in terms of what we are trying to prevent, which is people taking control through violence, threat or otherwise.</P>

      <P>It is important that Senator Henry has raised these issues, but the Minister has met her concerns. I agree with him that we should not go into too much detail because when one goes into more detail, things are excluded. The word &ldquo;weapon,&rdquo; as Senator Hayes said, does not refer exclusively to a military object. Courts have ruled, for instance, that the arms of a karate expert could be viewed as weapons. Weapons are used widely and the definition of &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; in Collins Dictionary must take up pages. Parts of the body, including male genitalia, have regularly been referred to as weapons. The issue is best dealt with through the Minister's proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still unhappy with the definition of &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; and how it would relate to the concerns raised about the transport of nuclear fuel or reprocessed fuel such as the mixed oxide fuel that has been commissioned at Sellafield. There is no reference to hijacking or the boarding of another vessel. Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;any unlawful act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends [whatever that means] by members of the crew or passengers on board a private ship and directed <Col N="269" /> against another ship, or against persons or property&rdquo;. The section is loosely worded. If we accept that it means a hijacking by those on board a ship going on to another ship, what do we mean by &ldquo;private ship&rdquo;? How wide is the definition? A ship is defined as including &ldquo;any description of vessel used in navigation . . . . . (other than a boat propelled by oars)&rdquo;. It could not be an airplane, a glider, a dinghy, a canoe or a raft. A hijacking can happen with all the other navigable vessels, but it is not an act of piracy.</P>
      <P>Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) does not cover many of the concerns we expressed about the new acts of terrorism which may be committed in the Irish Sea. This legislation is a mishmash which deals with piracy on the high seas on the one hand, but on the other hand, the Minister has grafted on protection for the Irish fishing fleet. If we want to do that, we should graft on protection for the people to deal with the danger of piracy in the Irish Sea, particularly in relation to reprocessed fuel which would be suitable for nuclear weapons.</P>

I could have said I did not want to take all Stages of this Bill today, but I have reluctantly agreed to do so. I would come up with a formula if I had time. There are inadequacies in the Minister's definition and he should respond to the concerns expressed here. I am not asking him to do that today because we will not have the opportunity to tease out the legislation properly. The concerns expressed should be incorporated before the legislation is taken in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello's criticism of the Bill was trenchant, unfair and unreasonable. As I said in my opening speech, considerable effort was put into the preparation of this Bill. The definition in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) is the UNCLOS definition. The Senator's definition of piracy is based on the experience we all had of pirates on television when we were young. The section states: &ldquo;any unlawful act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by members of the crew or passengers on board a private ship and directed against another ship&rdquo;. That will cover any type of terrorism on any ship directed against another ship. It cannot be more clear than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the points raised by Senator Costello which the Minister might address. I am trying to consider a situation where a ship is moored at a pier or jetty and where the act is committed by someone who is not a passenger or a member of another crew. I am seeking the Minister's guidance on this issue. Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;any unlawful act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, <Col N="270" /> committed for private ends by members of the crew or passengers&rdquo;. They could be trespassers. It may not be passengers of the private ship or the crew of another ship who assault the ship from a dock, jetty or wharf. I am trying to envisage the type of situation mentioned by Senator Costello. If people who were not the crew of another ship or passengers on the ship tried to make a point about the nuclear issue, for example, and rather than take the ship while it was afloat at sea they came on board before it left the port, that would clearly be an act of piracy. I do not see how that is covered in the interpretation in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is misunderstanding the definition of piracy, which is one ship against another. It does not apply to an attack on a ship which is moored in a dock or harbour. We are talking about the law of the sea. That point has been misinterpreted by the Senators. The definition of piracy, as I stated, is clear. It is the UNCLOS definition under which we are operating. That is why the Senators are misunderstanding what we are trying to achieve. We are not dealing with terrorism. As Senators are aware, we have a considerable amount of legislation to introduce before Christmas to deal with acts of terrorism at sea, in the air and on land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's advisers pointed out the problem which Senator O'Toole raised. It is important to tease out legislation. I am not relying on stories such as <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i> or on Bluebeard and the bottle of rum. I want to know how the Minister's definition covers all eventualities, which are not remote in terms of piracy and what might happen if reprocessed fuel gets into the wrong hands because most of the transportation will take place by sea, whether it is to Germany or Japan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is dealing with an area which is not within the Bill's remit. That issue must be dealt with in the terrorism legislation, which is the subject of a special new division in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that must deal with all acts of international terrorism. That is not the issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that is probably the way out of the matter, but I pointed out that this Bill is not a satisfactory way to deal with the repression of piracy and the protection of our fishing fleet. The protection of our fishing fleet could have been dealt with in a separate Bill. The Government may introduce ten or 11 Bills to deal with terrorism and they might cover all these issues, but why is there a definition of a ship if the definition of piracy is that it must be an illegal act by one ship against another, such as an attack, an assault or a hijacking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is a boat propelled by oars excluded from the definition of a ship? If we are talking about a ship being a vessel which can be used for navigation, then it covers a boat that uses oars, such <Col N="271" /> as a canoe, dinghy or raft. Surely a ship can be boarded from any of these and hijacked. All the depredations can equally take place from a boat, whether it is propelled by an outboard motor or oars. Within the narrow confines of what we are dealing with here, would it not be better to omit the portion that is excluded, in page 4, line 11, which states: &ldquo;other than a boat propelled by oars&rdquo;? In that way, the section would extend to all boats, whether they are motorised vessels or manually propelled.</P>

      <P>We are not only dealing with the high seas, we are dealing with territorial waters. It could, therefore, be very close to the shore. The Irish Sea is not exactly the high seas. The legislation is broader than that. Under the cover of darkness people can row a considerable distance out to a ship to board it. I do not know what the <Col N="272" /> situation is relating to a submarine either; a dinghy could be taken off such a vessel. Is that covered in the definition? We are not able to come to grips with this adequately. The definition is extremely important, but it does not seem to be terribly well worded. Even though the Minister says most of it has been taken from the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, some of it obviously has not been because the reference to aircraft has been deleted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 1 to 3, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with what I said on Second Stage, any attempt to interfere with people or ships on the high seas, or in territorial waters for that matter, is always fraught with danger. Serious injury or death can result from the actions of those who <Col N="273" /> go out with intent to commit such crimes. In that context the option of summary conviction should not be available. Traditionally, legislation has allowed for minor incidents, thus leaving a loophole by which a summary conviction can be made. I note that Senator O'Toole has tabled a related amendment, whereby the penalty would be entirely removed. If we leave that option open, I can envisage the possibility of a criminal, with a good solicitor, ending up with a £10 fine from some district justice. My proposal is to remove the option of summary conviction and deal with this particular crime as a serious issue often resulting in injury or death. The penalty should be commensurate with the intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much that Senator Caffrey had to say. On Second Stage I stated that I would prefer to delete section 4(2)(<i>a</i>) entirely. However, my amendment proposes that a person guilty of the offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. This proposal relates to the definition of piracy in section 3(1). Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(iv) states that an act of piracy would include, &ldquo;intentionally proceeding at excessive speed in close proximity to another ship in a manner calculated to endanger or cause an emergency on board that other ship,&rdquo;. However, such an act could be carried out in a fit of steam where someone would use the wash from his or her boat to create a minor emergency for someone else, but there would be no loss of life. Such an incident could happen quickly and might be best dealt with on summary conviction.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Caffrey's comments on major incidents such as those involving firearms and so on. However, acts such as those defined in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(iv) and (v), the latter of which refers to the deliberate towing away of fishing gear &ndash; it could be a small amount of gear &ndash; could be minor incidents. That is why I propose leaving an option to pursue such incidents by way of summary conviction which would allow for the imposition of a fine.</P>
      <P>By not specifying the amount of the fine it would be open to the judge to go up to the allowed limit. As I understand it, a summary conviction would be dealt with in the District Court which can impose a maximum fine of, I think, about £15,000 or perhaps it is up to £30,000. My proposal would allow for such an option. That is not to disagree with Senator Caffrey with whom I agree in general terms. However, the types of acts defined in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(iv) and (v) happen regularly. One often hears of complaints about ships passing too closely, a practice about which there are rules and regulations. One also hears about the deliberate towing away of fishing gear. Such incidents could arise due to an argument and should not be construed in the same context as more serious incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined I am of the view that the level of the fine in the legislation, as drafted, is too low. My amendment proposes <Col N="274" /> to delete the maximum fine as it restricts judges. Removing the level of the fine would remove such restrictions. No one will get away with a £10 fine no matter what lawyer he or she has. However, inserting the &euro;3,000 fine will constrain judges and that was never the intention of the Bill. I listened to the Minister's reply, but he gave no significant reason we should restrict the fine to that amount.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of retaining the option of a summary conviction. The fine on summary conviction should not be lower than that allowed in the District Court. I am also in favour of the option of summary conviction because it allows for a term of imprisonment. On the basis of how these matters operate, it will be for the Attorney General to decide whether a case will be processed in a higher court or on summary conviction. That is why my amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;not exceeding &euro;3,000&rdquo;. If accepted, section 4(2)(<i>b</i>) would provide that a person would be liable &ldquo;on summary conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree with the objective of Senator Caffrey's amendment because of the substantial criminal activities which could be involved in various acts of piracy defined in the Bill. However, Senator O'Toole made a persuasive argument that some of these incidents may be of a minor nature and that it would be a mistake to delete the reference to a summary conviction as cases would then have to be dealt with on conviction on indictment which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. I agree with Senator O'Toole that the best course of action is not to cap the fine at &euro;3,000 as that is a small sum of money given some of the offences which could take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment which proposes to delete any reference to the level of the fine. However, the Minister should go further and consider the six months term of imprisonment. Summary conviction refers to a conviction in the District Court. The Minister will be aware that the maximum sentence which can be imposed by the District Court is two years. One could deal with a number of offences in the District Court. However, limiting the prison sentence to six months will constrain the number of offences outlined in section 3(1). There is no reason to do so because a case can be dealt with promptly in the District Court as it does not require the elaborate process involved in processing an indictable offence in the higher courts. The Minister should consider this issue before the Bill proceeds to the Dáil with a view to doubling the sentence to one year or, preferably, increasing it to the maximum allowed in the District Court. This would provide greater flexibility to the courts, the Garda, the Defence Forces and others who are given powers of arrest under the Bill when dealing with these matters. I suggest that the term of imprisonment should be the <Col N="275" /> maximum allowed in the District Court and the cap on fines should be eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should return to the main objective of the Bill. The legislation was prepared in response to concerns about the harassment and intimidation of fishermen going about their business. On Second Stage I pointed out that between 1994 and 1999, 50 such incidents were reported to my Department. The main reason for this legislation is the growing number of incidents of intimidation of the Irish fishing fleet at sea, particularly outside our territorial waters where the law is inadequate to deal with these indiscretions.</P>
      <P>It is often the case that these incidents involve larger European fishing fleets intimidating smaller Irish fleets because of the need to exploit good fishing grounds. This may involve the destruction of nets, more serious incidents such as the ramming of a ship or general intimidation. That is why it is necessary to allow for summary offences as well as more serious offences. It is often the case that the intimidation may involve no more than trying to drive a fishing vessel away from a fishing ground. I hope Senator Caffrey will accept that such offences occur and that we do not have the ability to deal with them. Consequently, there is a need to deal with the range of incidents from less serious offences to more serious offences which will be dealt with on indictable conviction.</P>
      <P>It will be for the Attorney General's office as the prosecuting authority to decide whether an offence is a summary or indictable offence. Senator O'Toole has pointed out that it would be incorrect to remove from the legislation reference to a summary offence. I asked the same question as Senator O'Toole in terms of the fine not exceeding &euro;3,000. It did seem to be a very low level of fine. It is at that level because a summary conviction has to have a fine specified and the fine specified for summary offences by the Attorney General is &euro;3,000. In fact, it was only increased this year from £1,500. That is the reason we are governed by the specified amount that applies to summary offences generally. I agree with Senator O'Toole. It would perhaps be the Government's desire to have a much higher level of fine, but we are governed by this general principle regarding fines for summary convictions. It is set generally by the Attorney General at &euro;3,000. With the double edged sword of a summary conviction or indictment on conviction, we have the whole range of incidents covered, whether those are minor or serious. The Attorney General's office has the discretion to decide on the level at which the offence will be charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was critical of the size of fines. Am I correct in saying that fishery offences are dealt with exclusively by the Attorney General's office and that it has nothing to do, in any shape or form, with the DPP? In <Col N="276" /> this case, the legislation was obviously drawn up under the aegis of the Attorney General who looked at it in a very strong way. The Attorney General is probably the person who knows more about fishery offences than any legal or professional person on this island. I accept what the Minister said on the reasons for the fines as laid down, but it is a matter for the House keeping in mind that the Attorney General is the person with responsibility, not the DPP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am flabbergasted, to tell the truth. Our job is to legislate and that is what we are doing. A fine of &euro;3,000 is too low, as all of us, including the Minister, agree. I know what the Attorney General said. What is the impact if we say on summary conviction of a crime without specifying a fine? Suppose my amendment is accepted, what is the impact on the operation of the law when it comes to court? That is really what I want to know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will, no doubt, clarify it for us. I am in total agreement with Senator O'Toole. The Attorney General has decided that it should be pitched as low as &euro;3,000, which is £2,362.69. The Minister said it was £1,500 before this. It is not even double what it was and I do not know how long it has been like that. The responsibility of the Attorney General is not to legislate, but to advise the Minister. It is probably not desirable to have it pitched that low because it could limit dealing with the range of offences that could be dealt with in this summary fashion in the District Court. In the same way, if the figure of six months imprisonment had been pitched at a higher level, a greater range of offences could have been dealt with, including those of a serious nature, in the District Court without considering the expense to the State and a lot of time being wasted. If we are not happy with this, it does not matter what the Attorney General thinks. It is our responsibility to let the Minister know in no <Col N="277" /> uncertain terms that there should be a change in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to the Attorney General to decide whether it is a summary offence or an indictment. In the case of an indictment, if it is serious enough, he can decide on an unlimited fine and a prison term of up to 20 years. The Attorney General has full discretion. Summary offences are minor offences for which he would seek a summary conviction. He would seek a conviction on indictment if it was a more serious offence, presenting the possibility of an unlimited fine and prison term of up to 20 years. I really do not understand where the problem is.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would address the questions that I raised. This amount of money would not pay for the batteries on a boat or the boys holding up the fishing gear. If my amendment is accepted and simply writes the words without declaring the fine to be &ldquo;not exceeding. . . ,&rdquo; what is the impact in court? Does it have an impact in court? I really think we will be bringing ourselves into disrepute by including that fine, we would just be laughed at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is definitely not correct. If it is dealt with as a summary conviction in the District Court, then it is a summary conviction. That is the reality. That is not the question. If we do not restrict the district justice, does that impact on the law? I think I know the answer anyway, that does not seem to weaken the law or make it in any way unconstitutional, inoperable or <i>ultra vires</i> to the normal rules of court procedure. In other words, if we simply take away the level of the fine, we have stronger legislation that does not create any difficulty and which reflects the Minister's own intuitive response, and the response of every Member here. I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment. We can then move on.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification before we complete Report Stage. The Minister should remember that in recent years, when dealing with legislation concerning the courts, we have been expanding the function of the court of first instance, the District Court, to allow it to deal with as many cases as possible. There are many reasons for this, in particular, because they can deal with summary offences promptly and inexpensively. If we cap both the fine and the sentence, we limit the number of cases the Attorney General can refer to the District Court. Why should the Attorney General want to tie his hands in that fashion? If we set the sentence at two years or raise the level of the fine, obviously a greater number of the more serious of these offences can be brought before the District Court. Given the cap on the length of sentence in the District Court is two years, why did the Attorney General opt for six months in this case when it ties his hands?</P>

      <P>The courts have ground rules on fines. I do not know what the position is in the High Court, but the District Court and the Circuit Court have them. One cannot bring a claim, for example, a personal injuries claim, exceeding £30,000 before the Circuit Court. My reason for trying to remove this summary conviction was to circumvent that position. Having regard to some mechanism to deal with minor offences in relation to transgressions outlined in the Bill, I will have to accept the need for summary conviction. For that reason, I will not press the amendment. On reflection, especially after listening to Senator O'Toole, I accept the need for dealing with minor offences. However, we should reflect our anxiety about the nature of these offences and the Judiciary should take that anxiety on board when dealing with them.</P>

He should not come to this House and accuse us of a lack of understanding. We have a clear understanding of where we are. We have accepted we may be factually incorrect on this matter, but we would expect the Minister to put us right on it, not lecture us about wasting his time. My time is also being wasted. I would prefer to be eating in the restaurant. I will not be lectured by the Minister. We are serious about our business. The Minister may never have seen this attitude before, but I wish he knew his brief and could answer our questions clearly. I do not accept this information as correct. The problem is either at the Attorney General's office or the Minister's office. I do not know which, but it is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and have twice explained it since. On the Senator's specific point that he cannot understand the reason a fine for a summary offence cannot be higher than &euro;3,000, I have explained on a number of occasions that the Attorney General has the option of making it an indictable offence and has unlimited fines avail<Col N="280" /> able to him, which he can and does apply every day in the fishing industry. Consequently, as I am trying to explain, there is no need to worry that the fine for a summary offence is confined to &euro;3,000. Every day in this jurisdiction, under fishery offences, the Attorney General brings fishing boats into harbour. They are indictable offences brought to the Circuit Court. The Senator obviously has a major misunderstanding of that fact&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of my brief. It is quite clear from the tenor of this debate so far that the Senator is mixing up legislation designed to do a particular job for the fishing industry with some other issue which has nothing to do with today's debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, asked that question and still have not received an answer. Senator Costello explained earlier the reason we felt this area was important. Regardless of the number of cases dealt with by the court of first instance, the District Court is of great importance to the State. I am dismayed that the Attorney General always take cases to the Circuit Court which costs much more than taking them to the District Court. We are anxious to know if the removal of references to the level of fine from the legislation would encourage the Attorney General to go before the District Court or if he would continue to take the more expensive route and go to the Circuit Court. This is important. It would be helpful to know if there is a rule which states that one must fix the level of the fine in the legislation because if there is no such rule, I see no reason to reject Senator O'Toole's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>I wish to confirm what I said earlier, that is, all fishery offences, regardless of their nature, are the direct responsibility of the Attorney General while all other offences are the <Col N="281" /> responsibility of the DPP. Perhaps I should not say this, but I attended a court recently, which was held at night, at which an error was made by local gardaí. Because they had brought down the DPP, the fishermen involved could have walked out the door. It was an incorrect summons. The case had nothing to do with the DPP, but was a matter for the Attorney General. I know as well as any adviser here that every single fishery offence has to be dealt with by the Attorney General. It is the only area dealt with specifically by the Attorney General. Four Dingle fishermen were up for offences. The judge said that in accordance with the plea made by the State solicitor, these offences were too grave and would be referred to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed to find that it is solely the Attorney General who deals with fishery offences. I always thought that the role of the DPP was to deal with all criminal offences. What we are dealing with here is a separate matter entirely. The Attorney General has given his advice as to what the fines and prison sentences should be. We are telling the Minister what we believe they should be pitched at, and that differs from the Attorney General's advice. The Minister <Col N="282" /> has clarified the matter as to whether a specific fine has to be mentioned at the summary court &ndash; a fine must be mentioned. However the Minister has not clarified how that fine was pitched at &euro;3,000. Surely we could raise the threshold to the level that we think is appropriate as long as it is a reasonable amount in terms of a summary offence.</P>
      <P>We can do exactly the same in relation to the prison sentence, we can raise it to the level of the jurisdiction of the District Court. If we feel that is appropriate, considering the seriousness of many of the offences listed here, that is our function and it does not matter what the Attorney General thinks is appropriate. We must do our best to ensure that the Attorney General does not go to the Circuit Court and spend the State's money on expensive briefs dealing with matters which can be dealt with in the District Court. That is our function and we are not time wasting when we ensure that it is dealt with in a manner that we think is appropriate.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Aer Lingus Restructuring.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter. I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the <Col N="284" /> staff of the House and the Minister of State for waiting until I was able to be present in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of national public interest. However, it is also of specific interest to Shannon because the brunt of the proposals in relation to flight reductions apply to the airport there. These proposals are extreme and dramatic and must be addressed directly by the Government. Aer Lingus proposes to reduce the number of flights going through Shannon each week by a total of 72. That is an enormous reduction and, not to mention the impact it will have on the region in general, it will render the airport non-viable.</P>
      <P>These reductions include the cancellation of the Baltimore/Washington flight, the Newark flight, the Belfast-Shannon flight and the Paris-Shannon flight, a reduction in the number of flights from Dublin to Shannon &ndash; there will be no flights from the capital to the airport after 3.30 p.m. or 4 p.m. each day &ndash; and the cancellation until March 2002 of flights to JFK Airport in New York. This is unprecedented. Such a development never occurred during the worst economic period in our history. During the last recession, nothing of this nature took place at Shannon Airport. It is unacceptable that such a draconian proposal should be put forward by the management and the executive of Aer Lingus. There is an onus on the Government to deal with this matter directly and ensure it is addressed.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter and its initial effects will be felt by workers at Shannon Airport. I refer here to those who work for Aer Lingus, maintenance workers and all others employed there. The knock-on effects throughout the region in general will be dramatic. There are over 168 factories from Sligo down through Galway, Mayo, Clare, Tipperary, Kerry, Cork and Waterford which export their goods through Shannon Airport. The level of goods exported through the airport is substantial. In fact, the majority of the goods exported by Aer Lingus go through Shannon and a high percentage of these are produced by multinationals, including Waterford Crystal, in the counties to which I refer and sent for sale in the United States. Cargo exports are carried on passenger flights leaving Shannon Airport and it is vital for the continuing viability of industry in the region that such flights continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that companies considering locating their operations in the region in the future will see it as non-viable in light of the level of reduction in flights. This could prove hugely detrimental and it will make the job of IDA Ireland and SFADCo extremely difficult. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that this matter is dealt with. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently published a document on spatial strategy in which 16 regions were identified. The Shannon and wider Limerick area is ideal for development. <Col N="285" /> However, a blow to Shannon Airport such as that to which I refer would lead to a downward trend in development in the region. The Government has a responsibility to address this problem.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been put forward to the effect that people are not travelling. People can be encouraged to travel. The major tragedy of the twin towers is being used as an excuse by Aer Lingus at this stage. It is remarkable that the brunt of the company's proposals impact on Shannon Airport. Those proposals cannot be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>The proposals also have a dramatic significance for the tourism industry. I accept that responsibility in this area rests with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. However, if there are no flights into an airport people cannot enter a region. The late night flight from Dublin to Shannon was particularly useful, not least for business people and tourists wanting to enter the region from mainland Europe. That flight must remain in place. Under the new flight proposals for the airport, people will not be able to fly out of Shannon in the morning and carry out their day's business in London, Paris or other cities in mainland Europe because there will no longer be a late night connection from Dublin to Shannon. That is unacceptable. If business people are obliged to stay overnight elsewhere, the prospect of travelling becomes increasingly unattractive to them. I urge the Minister to address these issues directly.</P>
    <P>We cannot always seek permission to act from Europe or look to it for funding. There are times when Government must take responsibility for its actions and make its own decisions. In this instance, the Government must see the critical importance of maintaining flights operated through Shannon Airport by the national airline. The Government owns 95% of Aer Lingus and, therefore, responsibility for the company rests with the Government. It was grand to hear the Taoiseach state earlier today that the Government will oppose any call from Europe to end the stopover at Shannon Airport for transatlantic flights. However, he should cop on to himself and look at what is being done by his company, Aer Lingus, in respect of Shannon. He should not utter pious aspirations about what might emanate from Europe in the future. That is another day's work which should only be dealt with when the need arises. The Taoiseach must deal now with the proposals put forward by the State-owned airline in relation to Shannon Airport. Pious platitudes in respect of another matter are, quite frankly, poor consolation to the people in Shannon.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would be present to take this matter. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has a specific responsibility for and an interest in this area. Given that he was born in Kilrush and lived there until the age of <Col N="286" /> eight, he will fully appreciate the impact these flight reductions will have on Shannon Airport. I am sure he will convey my comments to the Minister, who also has connections with Clare. She must use her position to protect jobs throughout the west. We are not merely discussing the jobs of Aer Lingus staff working at Shannon, we are concerned with the jobs of those employed by Aer Rianta, those working in the maintenance, catering and tourism sectors &ndash; both at the airport and throughout the region &ndash; and the employees of the 168 factories to which I referred earlier who export goods through the airport. That is the issue the Government must address in a serious manner.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take this matter on board immediately. It is vital that she should meet the management, board and executive of Aer Lingus, talk sense to them and arrive at some innovative ideas in relation to redressing the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Taylor-Quinn on raising this issue which is of huge importance on a constituency, regional and national level. As the Minister said in the Dáil yesterday, Aer Lingus is facing a very grave situation. The company is losing £2 million per day and haemorrhaging cash. Without action, it will run out of cash early next year, incur a loss of £74 million in 2001 and losses of between £120 million and £130 million in 2002. In summary, without urgent action, Aer Lingus will be insolvent within a short time. While it is accepted that a number of internal and external factors had already begun to impact on Aer Lingus's profits, the events of 11 September turned the company's difficulties into a crisis. As a result, Aer Lingus announced a range of cutbacks to address the dire situation. These measures resulted in the scale of the company being reduced by 25%. The cutbacks resulted in reductions in services across the network, including termination of services to Newark, Baltimore and Stockholm and reductions in services to Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Amsterdam and Paris.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the current crisis is no respecter of regions and all must share in the pain of the cutbacks. I regret that, in addition to the Aer Lingus measures, BA has also cancelled its Shannon-Gatwick services in addition to its Cork and Belfast service. I also regret the loss of the Delta Dublin-Shannon-JFK service, at least for the winter. I hope the recently announced Aer Rianta extension of its extensive discount scheme for airlines flying into the three State airports will assist in the development of new services. The company is also providing marketing support for start-up promotions on these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach and the Minister said in the Dáil yesterday, Government policy on Shannon transatlantic services remains unchanged. The <Col N="287" /> Government is committed to maintaining a viable Shannon Airport as well as a viable Aer Lingus. We have much work to do in regard to the latter and I ask for the support of all parties in all regions in that effort. I call on all tourism and business interests in the Shannon area to intensify their marketing and promotional efforts to sustain the airport in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>I will strongly convey the matters raised by the Senator to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>The Minister of State <Col N="288" /> called on &ldquo;tourism and business interests in the Shannon area to intensify their marketing and promotional efforts to sustain the airport in these difficult times&rdquo;. They are doing so, but flights to Shannon Airport are needed, otherwise they are promoting nothing. Bodies will not fill aeroplanes if scheduled flights are not available. That is a vital issue.</P>
