    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Irish Pound Notes and Coins (Cessation of Legal Tender Status) Order, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 2, the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with Second Stage contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes and Senators may share time; and No. 3, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, not to be taken earlier than 4.30 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes and Senators may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. We agreed to take Report Stage of the Bill on this occasion, but that may not always be the case. I understand there is a possibility that the Leader may introduce Report Stage of a Bill tomorrow and I wish to put him on notice that our generosity today may not extend to tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, following his meetings with EU leaders and Ministers, has said that there will be no change in the wording of <Col N="2" /> the recent amendment. If that is the case, will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House and explain how he intends to get the public to change its mind on this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that No. 1 was to be taken without debate. There may be a reason for that and perhaps the Leader could explain it.</P>
      <P>Regarding No. 2, the Independents would not object to taking further Stages of the Bill. However, we will expect flexibility later in the week, particularly in relation to the Mental Health Bill, 1999, and ensuring that the Bill on Thursday does not conclude on Report Stage because many amendments have also been tabled to that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the visit of the American President to Europe this week, is it the Government's intention to raise with him his attitude to the death penalty? It would be a very appropriate inquiry and would be very much in line with the views of this House over many years. The Government should ask him to reconsider the position. The use of the death penalty is a global issue. I ask for reassurance from the Minister for <Col N="3" /> Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach that the question of the Kyoto Protocol and the American attitude towards it will be raised with the President, either formally at the Gothenburg meeting this weekend or in some other direct approach.</P>
    <P>In terms of the way some senior members of the Government party conducted themselves with regard to the referendum on the Nice treaty, I will hold my comments until the debate on the Euro Changeover Bill later this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a full debate in the House on the Nice treaty and the entire mismanagement of the referendum. There was no information, explanation or campaign, and what can be expected but a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in those circumstances. We as a country had been held up as a model for the applicant countries and we are now regarded as an obstacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello should not pre-empt the debate which he is seeking. The matter cannot be debated on the Order of Business. I have no objection to a debate once the House agrees, but not on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely outlining very briefly a couple of reasons the House should have a full debate on the subject. What seems to be emanating from the Government is that there will be no change, no renegotiation. The Government must ask the people why they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Some form of consultation needs to be established before the Government once again goes back to the people. I ask the Leader to allow a full debate on the Nice treaty while it is still a live issue.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's views on the death penalty. Our concerns about the use of the death penalty should be brought to the attention of the American President. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should be asked to put it on the agenda for this the first visit of President Bush to the European Union. In the recent referendum, the death penalty was deleted from our Constitution and this is the norm in the European Union. If the United States was ever to apply for membership of the European Union, it would be refused because of its breach of fundamental human rights through cruel and inhuman treatment of offenders. The United States should realise that killing its own citizens is not the way to deter others from committing offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible on the National Roads Authority and its dealings with members of the farming community whose lands have been acquired by it. I have been informed that the situation as it obtains is far from satisfactory. Given the difficulties that have obtained in the past couple of years with BSE, foot and mouth disease and other difficulties pertaining to the farming sector, it is important to have this debate <Col N="4" /> as soon as possible and perhaps some positive suggestions could be made in taking corrective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Costello in calling for a debate on the Nice treaty and I would extend the terms of reference to include a debate on the role of the Referendum Commission. As a consequence of the farcical result from the commission's activities during the referendum campaign, it is time to take a fresh look at the Referendum Commission. Two weeks ago in this House I said that this treaty could be defeated. I said that at best it would be a huge embarrassment and that is how it has turned out. The time has come for a full debate in the House on the Referendum Commission and on the treaty itself, if that is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with just about everything that has been said so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Surprise, surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe the words I am hearing on the Order of Business. Senator Costello wants a consultation with the Irish people on the Nice treaty. That is exactly what we had last week and they gave us a verdict. Apparently I am the only person in the House who likes it. What does that tell us? That tells us we should be looking not at the Nice treaty again but at ourselves. It is quite extraordinary. Every political party said we should vote for the Nice treaty, it is a good thing. The wretched social partners told us to vote for the Nice treaty. The Catholic Church told us to vote for the Nice treaty. The people said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. What is the reaction? Everybody in the House says &ldquo;shock, horror&rdquo;, let us go back and ask the people what they think. We know what they think. They think we were wrong.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no point in having another debate in the House on the issue. We had the debate three weeks ago. Now we say we do not like the result, let us have another debate and get another result. It is ludicrous. We have had the referendum. We have had the debate. Let us not have a post mortem, let us forget about it. That is what the referendum was about.</P>

      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other issue. I agree very much with what Senators O'Toole, Costello and others have said about the death penalty. It would be appropriate if, when George Bush is in Europe, the strongest possible representations were made by the Irish Government on the death penalty. We in this House who led the fight against the death penalty have a special role to play. Because of the referendum last week &ndash; I agree with Senator Costello about this &ndash; it would be appropriate if we took some courage and said <Col N="5" />&lsquo;boo' to the Americans and that we absolutely abhor what they are doing on the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has taken the wind out of my sails to a degree because I was rising on the assumption that there was widespread consensus on all sides in the aftermath of the treaty. There appear to have been many allegations of arrogance on the part of the political establishment about the result. I say &ndash; and I hope I speak for all politicians &ndash; that the people are never wrong. We might fundamentally disagree with their decisions but they are never wrong. That is what the consultation referred to by Senator Costello was about.</P>
      <P>As politicians in the second House of the Oireachtas we have an obligation to look at the aftermath. There are serious legal and moral implications which this country must address over the next 18 months. That is the timeframe set by our European partners for the treaty to be either ratified or goodness knows what. I have no answer. Last evening the Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear he too had no answer. If there are accusations of arrogance, may I be the first to be as humble as I can to the Irish people and say there was no arrogance but there was complacency. All of us accept the result that has come to us. We now have to deal with the aftermath. It is incumbent on this House to act responsibly. Therefore, I ask the Leader not just for a debate on the Treaty of Nice or the aftermath of it or the Referendum Commission, to which Senator Caffrey referred &ndash; I believe it should be abolished and let the Government give the money to both sides&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate I have been allowed some latitude. Given that it is such a difficult issue I ask the Leader and you, a Chathaoirligh, in your capacity as chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to debate the aftermath of the treaty and to consider putting in place some structure where this House could have a rolling debate over the next 18 months on the implications rather than a one off debate. All of us agree there was a lack of information and clarity, and that was reflected in the vote last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot think of anything worse than a rolling debate. I disagree with Senator Ross on the suggestion of a post mortem because the body politic would need its brain examined to see how it arrived at this conclusion.</P>
      <P>I am very worried about the status of Luas and the national stadium, which according to the papers today are at risk because of the decision. I dread the thought of a debate on it, but we are entitled to real answers to our questions. Are these projects in danger or is this just a headline in a newspaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> Apropos of newspapers and the further conquest of industry by Tony O'Reilly, as a republican in the very true sense of liberty, equality and fraternity, I do not want to address anyone as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;. Are we now required to do so? </P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see what this has to do with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>This House works on the basis of calling people by their elected or nominated titles. Is it incumbent on newspapers and the media generally to report this man as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;? I am sorry if this is the wrong time to raise this matter, but I want to get clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time since we had a debate on foot and mouth disease. I will preface my comment by saying thanks be to God the good times have come again &ndash; almost. Northern Ireland has opened up and that is good news. Rural Ireland is still fairly well closed down, particularly the public cattle marts. I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate and have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development here so that we can discuss how we can reopen markets, sales and cattle marts in an orderly, professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to discuss the aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum and the wording that he intends to bring to the people. I do not agree with Senator Ross that the people have spoken. The reaction has been that they are not against enlargement, which is the issue we need to discuss in that debate. There are many mixed messages from the public as to why people voted no. Many did so because they did not understand the issues. I would not like to wait 18 months before the issue is raised again. We need the time to debate and discuss it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Leader will honour the commitment he gave me before Christmas to have a debate on appropriate education for children suffering from autism. This should be linked to the need for speech therapists of which there are few.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Glynn's call for the NRA to come in and discuss how it intends compensating farmers adequately for tearing through their land to build huge motorways or bypasses, without consultation with the farmers or the farming bodies. This has been going on for some time and a debate is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on foot and mouth disease and the agriculture industry. It is now over 80 days since we had an outbreak here and farmers have suffered greatly. I compliment all those who helped to keep the disease out of the country, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his officials. It is appropriate and timely to have <Col N="7" /> such a debate, bring the farming industry back to normality and try to restore farm incomes.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the National Roads Authority. There is now a virtual stand-off between the farming community and the NRA and this is gaining momentum right through the midland counties. The farming organisations are establishing committees in each county to prohibit NRA personnel from going on to their lands. Unless this issue is addressed, the national roads programme, which is part of the national development plan, will not meet its targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the National Roads Authority. There is great confusion and anxiety among people who are affected by this issue and there is also great anxiety in local authorities.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on insurance for young drivers, on which a report has recently been published. A further report is awaited from Macra na Feirme. The issue should be debated in this House. The level of premiums paid by young drivers is a national scandal. I put it to the Leader of the House that a debate on this issue would be very timely since it is causing great hardship to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the request for a debate on the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty, the people have spoken and have made their sovereign decision. As democrats, we have to accept that decision and there is no dispute about that. However, in the light of some of the comments which have been made, there appears to be a degree of confusion. That could best be cleared up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs coming to the House, when he returns, and reporting on what took place today and yesterday in the discussions which he and the Taoiseach had with their EU counterparts.</P>
      <P>I suggest that criticisms of the Referendum Commission are misdirected. The commission is bound by the Constitution and by the McKenna judgment. One might say that the prose used in its material is rather turgid, but it is bound by obligation to conduct itself as it has done. Perhaps the debate should be about the McKenna judgment and other aspects, rather than on the Referendum Commission itself.</P>
      <P>The President of the Council of Europe was very forthright in his comments on the execution in America yesterday and on the death penalty. The European voice was present, but one would hope that that would extend into the European Union itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed, every time I use the toll bridges in Dublin, with their efficiency and the benefit we get from them. The latest news that six to eight bypass roads are likely to be tolled supports the call for a debate on the National Roads Authority. This may well <Col N="8" /> be the most efficient way to proceed and, if so, let us make sure that it has support, but it should not go ahead without a debate. That debate, for which other Senators have called, should take place very promptly, with particular reference to farmland.</P>
      <P>I support calls for an opportunity to discuss the Referendum Commission. I agree with Senator Dardis's comments. The commission acted properly on the basis of the McKenna judgment, but we do need to discuss whether that is the best way to do the job, or whether we should have a different system.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Leader that now is the time for a debate on Northern Ireland. News coming from Northern Ireland suggests that the voice of moderation needs to be heard. This House can provide such an opportunity and this may well be the right time to do it. I suggest that we should have that debate in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat much of what has been said but I support the call for a stand alone debate on the Referendum Commission arising from the McKenna judgment. It is said that the people are never wrong but it is imperative that a democracy is based on a well informed people. I am unsure if the information transmitted by the commission was the best, either in methodology or content. The commission, like every other institution, is there to serve the best interests of the people. It is interpreting a court judgment but there are other interpretations and the issue may be revisited.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to hand over our country or the euro to a tiny minority who can bring cases to the Supreme Court and get the decisions that serve them. Some of them seem to have the brains of a peahen, judging from last night's television programme. Those of us who take our country and our European status seriously must examine the commission carefully to decide if it is the best vehicle to disseminate the information necessary for the citizenry to make an informed judgment on referendum questions. That is central to the country's and Europe's future. I seek a debate next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased that the people approved a referendum to abolish the death penalty. I was always opposed to it. We are selective in this House in pointing the finger at the United States over this issue as two weeks ago a woman in Iran was put to death by stoning. No one here, or in the media, raised a voice against this barbaric practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the call for a debate on the NRA and its activities. It is reprehensible that it sets community against community, farmer against farmer and town against town by proposing four or five possible routes. The NRA <Col N="9" /> knows where the road will go but they get all the farmers, business people and householders along each proposed route fighting to move it elsewhere so that it does not go through their land or community. The NRA should honestly say which route it prefers and then debate that.</P>
      <P>No one mentioned today that 20% of the cost of a national primary road goes to consultants. On compensation&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that when we consider the NRA we take into account capital gains tax. It is peculiar that farmers must pay this for compulsory take over of their land. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>The people spoke on the Nice treaty. Anyone who thinks that this is not a vote against enlargement is going against the wind. We have voted against enlargement. The Nice treaty is gone and we must discuss the Treaty of Amsterdam. All we can do under that is give a maximum of five extra places to applicant countries. Who is going to select&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Without anticipating the debate, I join with my colleagues in calling for a debate on the McKenna judgment as distinct from the Referendum Commission which has taken some undue criticism over the last number of days in particular. It is most unjustified as it was merely implementing what to me is political correctness gone mad in the form of the McKenna judgment. Our debate in the aftermath of the referendum result should focus entirely on the McKenna judgment and I urge the Leader to do what he can to arrange for the Minister to attend.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Glynn's call for a debate on the National Roads Authority and the mechanism of compulsory acquisition of land around the country. Serious difficulties are emerging on both sides of the land acquisition debate, not just in rural areas but throughout the country where we have the boom in the construction of various infrastructural projects. The machinery in place has become rather archaic and does not appear to meet the needs of vendor and purchaser. It is time we had a full debate on that.</P>

      <P>Senators Coogan, O'Toole, Costello, Caffrey, Dardis, Ross, Mooney, Jackman, Quinn, Quill and Glennon expressed their views on the outcome of the referendum. Two referenda were accepted by the people, the third one was not. We owe a debt of gratitude to those people who exercised their franchise and voted in the referenda. I have all the time in the world for those who participate and vote in a democratic way on what is laid before them. I congratulate everyone who went to the polls and made a choice. As has been said by the Deputy Leader, we should have a debate on the McKenna judgment. I can also arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present to hear the views of Senators on the Nice referendum. We have to tease out and debate the McKenna judgment and see to where we are going in relation to this judgment. I will certainly ask the Minister when he comes back from Europe early next week or maybe early the following.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked why No. 1 was being taken without debate. The reason is that it would be repetitious to debate it given the item which will follow it. Senators O'Toole, Costello, Ross and Joe Doyle asked that our views on the death penalty be passed on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach, particularly given that the President of the United States, George Bush, is in Europe this week. Senator Joe Doyle expressed his horror at the death of the woman in Iran who was stoned to death two weeks ago. I will certainly pass on the Senator's views to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Senators Glynn, Jackman, Finneran, Quinn, Lanigan and Glennon once again called for a debate on the National Roads Authority. A massive amount of money is allocated under the national development plan. Because of the motorways and dual carriageways from Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Galway, in particular, an enormous amount of land &ndash;  I think it is 20,000 acres &ndash; has to be acquired. Naturally, many people in the farming community will have to hand over their lands which they may or may not want to do. In most cases, they do not want this to happen.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable given the total cost of the motorways and dual carriageways that the amount of money being offered to these farmers in compensation is often less than 5% of the total cost. I have no difficulty in setting aside time to debate this matter. Legislation must take account of the order of this House which it always has. In that event, the House can take it for definite that we will have an all day debate on this topic, possibly by the end of this month but certainly before the summer recess. Some Senators pointed out the capital gains aspect. I understand that if the money acquired is reinvested and rolled over, as it is known in the industry, no capital gains tax will apply to the moneys acquired from this type of land purchase.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge called for a debate on progress on the Luas and I can allow time for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> Senators Callanan and Finneran called for a debate on the reopening of the cattle marts. It is terrific that this will happen. Many farmers have been hard pressed for cash flow over the past number of months. It is a long time since last January for them to have been without a cash flow. I hope and look forward to the marts reopening next week. I will set aside time at the earliest possible date to update the House on this matter. I thank the Whips and Leaders for their co-operation during the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this Bill to the House. Its main purpose is, in necessary cases, to replace Irish pound amounts in law with convenient amounts in euro, to operate from 1 January 2002. The Bill also amends our law to take account of the fact that Greece has adopted the euro, and to cater for the closure of the TARGET settlement system on 31 December this year, and on 1 May each year from now on.</P>
      <P>The background is as follows. Under Regulation (EC) No. 974/98, Irish pound amounts in law at end 2001 are from then on to be read as amounts in euro, converted at the fixed conversion rate of 1 = £0.787564 and rounded to the nearest cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> As a result, convenient Irish pound amounts will convert to non-convenient amounts in euro, for instance, £10 converts to 12.70. Action is, therefore, being taken to provide, in necessary cases, for example, where amounts are usually paid in cash, for convenient amounts in euro to replace existingIrish pound amounts from the start of next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill complements the work done on this issue, for instance, in this year's Finance Act and Social Welfare Act. It is aimed essentially at dealing with places elsewhere in law where Departments have identified a need for convenient amounts in euro. I stress that the principle on which the move to convenient amounts, where necessary, has been made is that in all such cases we should favour the citizen.</P>
    <P>By way of background to the Bill, I propose to give the House a brief description of the current state of changeover preparations. Euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation on 1 January 2002. There will then be a period of approximately six weeks while the use of euro cash will be increasing and the use of Irish cash will be decreasing. Under our cash changeover plan, published last year, legal tender status is to be withdrawn from Irish notes and coins at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002. This six week period strikes an appropriate balance between enabling people to familiarise themselves with the new currency and ensuring that the changeover is carried out quickly. In March I laid a draft order before both Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for the withdrawal of legal tender status at midnight on 9 February 2002. Senators will be aware that a resolution approving the order is being taken together with the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are essentially six elements to the preparations for the changeover to the euro. These are legislation, the production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector, preparations by the private sector, consumer matters and the provision of public information. I have dealt with recent legislation in this area. Cash production will involve over 200 million euro notes and over 1,000 million euro coins, and I am assured by the Central Bank that production is on target.</P>
    <P>Each Department and body is responsible for the changeover of its own operations, but they must report regularly to my Department. These reports continue to confirm that progress on implementation of the departmental changeover plans and those of the bodies under their aegis is on target. To give a single example of the work in hand, the child benefit books now being issued by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs include payment orders denominated in euro in respect of months from January next onwards.</P>
    <P>As regards preparations by the private sector, the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign was established in 1996 to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for the changeover. The campaign has distributed <Col N="13" /> very large quantities of information to Irish businesses. Forfás has also involved business extensively in its campaign by means of its consultative committee, which includes a wide range of business organisations, and its retail group, which includes a wide range of retail organisations. The Forfás Loughrea Euro Town Project, under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, provided excellent case studies of the practical experience of businesses making changeover preparations. The task of preparing businesses for the changeover is, of course, one for businesses themselves. The Forfás survey published in February clearly indicated that some businesses had not yet set about their changeover preparations. If there are still companies in that position, the message for them is clear. You must prepare now &ndash; by 1 January 2002, less than seven months away, your business must be able to operate in euro.</P>
    <P>Within the business sector retailers have a particular role to play in the cash changeover. The House will be aware that under the cash changeover plan, retailers will give change only in euro from 1 January 2002 and that Irish notes and coins being received inwards will be retained and not issued outwards again. The purpose of these arrangements is obvious, to make sure the changeover to euro cash is carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is particularly in the interests of retailers.</P>
    <P>A number of measures are being taken to help retailers in their preparations for the changeover. The Euro Changeover Board has produced a computer programme that will help retailers to calculate their euro cash requirements for the first week of 2002. This programme is available as a compact disc or can be downloaded from the board's website at www.euro.ie. In addition, the board and the Central Bank have reached an agreement with the banks whereby, in return for a lodgement fee paid by the Central Bank, banks will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002 or on Irish notes and coins lodged by retailers during the dual circulation period and for a short time afterwards. The banks are currently communicating with their retailer customers about their arrangements in relation to this agreement and in that context are giving details of the date next January on which they will debit retailer customers for the euro cash provided to them in advance of 1 January.</P>
    <P>As regards retailers' internal preparations, Forfás has produced a document, Getting your retail businesses ready for the euro, of which over 170,000 copies of it have been issued, including one to every retailer in the country. Forfás is currently developing a training pack for retailers, and a copy of this also will be issued to every retailer in the country.</P>
    <P>The consumer aspects of the changeover are being addressed by my colleague Deputy Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with <Col N="14" /> responsibility for consumer affairs, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs. They relaunched the national code of practice on the euro changeover last December along with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover. A key aspect of the code is that subscribers to it commit themselves to carrying out the changeover fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has sent the national code to over 200 organisations along with a sample letter for issue to their members and a form of undertaking, inviting them and their members to subscribe to that code or to draw up a suitable sectoral code for approval under the national code. Any approved code would have to contain the same commitment about carrying out the changeover fairly. Retailers who sign up to the code or to an approved sectoral code will be entitled to display a euro logo and the Director of Consumer Affairs will be advising consumers to shop where they see the logo.</P>
    <P>The final element in the changeover preparations is the provision of public information. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has responsibility in this area and it has been carrying out very extensive public information activities since its establishment in a programme that is part funded by the EU. Among many other items, the board has sent a leaflet about the euro to every household, every year since its establishment. It has organised widespread circulation of leaflets, posters, booklets and other information materials, including educational material for schools and materials for every teacher. It has run several advertising campaigns on television and radio and in the press. It has set up a lo-call helpline and a website, the latter with a special section for schools, and it has made a train-the-trainers pack widely available for general use in both the public and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>The needs of low awareness and special needs groups are catered for through the board's consultative panel. This panel includes organisations representing groups likely to have low awareness of the euro, essentially older people, people on low incomes, people based in the home and organisations representing people likely to have special needs in the changeover to the euro, for example, people with visual or hearing impairment.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the board runs a programme of part funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities and many of the projects funded under the programme related to these groups. This programme has been operated by the board since 1998. Its most recent round of funding, which closed in early April, attracted over 150 applications. The board issues very large quantities of information. In the month of April alone, it issued over half a million items of information about the euro. Public information activities will of course intensify greatly in the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> This is a short and technical Bill. It has been the subject of widespread consultation among interested parties, including those represented on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. Most of the money amounts covered in the Bill are routine fees and charges in respect of licences, permits, etc., which are or may be paid in cash. These are being reduced to the nearest convenient amount below the exact euro equivalent so as to favour the citizen. To take one example, Senators may be familiar with the deposit for candidates at elections to county councils. This currently stands at £50, which would convert to 63.49 at the conversion rate. However, in the Bill I provide for the more convenient, and easier to remember, amount of 60.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of thresholds, and these are being increased to the nearest convenient, and memorable, euro amounts, again so as to favour the citizen. An example here is the £500 threshold for disclosure of gifts under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, which would convert to 634.87. The Bill provides for a convenient amount of 650.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the replacement of Irish pound amounts, at specific references in Acts and statutory instruments, with convenient euro amounts to apply from 1 January 2002. It does so by means of general provisions which refer to the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Schedule 1 lists the Irish pound amounts being replaced, and the euro amounts to replace them, in respect of fees and charges and Schedule 2 lists the statutory references at which the replacement will take place. Similarly, Schedule 3 lists the Irish pound amounts being replaced, and the euro amounts to replace them, in respect of thresholds and Schedule 4 lists the statutory references at which the replacement will take place.</P>
    <P>In all cases only the specific amount appearing at the exact statutory reference will be replaced. Other amounts appearing elsewhere in those Acts will not be affected, but will convert to euro at the conversion rate, under an EU regulation. Sections 2 and 3 provide respectively for dispensing with consents and for the continuation of existing powers to set amounts. They are included for the avoidance of doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for two amendments to the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998. The first updates the definition of &ldquo;participating member state&rdquo; in the 1998 Act to include Greece, which adopted the euro on 1 January last, and caters for the fact that other member states may do so. The second amendment enables the alignment of the withdrawal time of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins, intended for midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002, with the repeal of earlier law under which Irish pound notes and coins are issued and under which limits are placed on the number of coins that may be tendered. The wording of the 1998 Act means repeals would come into effect from the start of the day for withdrawal of legal tender status from <Col N="16" /> Irish notes and coins, whereas legal tender status would continue until the end of the day. The amendment will eliminate this gap. The draft order before the House on withdrawal of legal tender status has been drawn up on the assumption that the 1998 Act will be amended as provided for in this section. The order will not be made until this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends section 135 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to defer until the next working day the giving of value by banks in respect of transactions due for processing by them on a day when the TARGET interbank settlement system is closed by decision of the European Central Bank. This already happens in respect of public holidays as most days on which TARGET is closed correspond with our public holidays. Exceptions are Labour Day on 1 May as our public holiday is on the first Monday in May, and 31 December this year as the ECB has decided that TARGET should be closed to safeguard the smooth conversion of retail payment systems and internal bank systems to the euro. The ECB has welcomed our intention to introduce this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the Credit Union Act, 1997, in a number of ways with effect from 1 January 2002. It redefines a share in a credit union as one euro, instead of one pound, standing to the credit of a member in a share account. It makes a number of consequential changes to amounts dependent on the definition of a share and substitutes convenient amounts in euro for certain minimum and maximum amounts in the Act. Section 7 amends the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, with effect from 1 January 2002. It replaces five references to &ldquo;pound in the pound&rdquo; and &ldquo;50 pence in the pound&rdquo; with appropriate references to euro amounts. These amounts represent thresholds or targets in relation to the settlement of the debts of a bankrupt and govern matters like the discharge of the bankruptcy and the return of property when all debts and costs are settled.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the threshold for declaration of interest by staff of the Heritage Council. The Irish pound and euro amounts are included in Schedule 3, but 1,300 in figures is being substituted for the present &ldquo;one thousand pounds&rdquo; in words in the Heritage Act, 1995, in line with general drafting practice. Section 9 contains the usual citation provisions.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the Bill is to provide, where necessary, for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in law with convenient amounts in euro to apply from 1 January 2002. Taken together with similar measures in finance and social welfare Acts, the Bill should broadly complete what might be called the euro pricelist for the more common transactions between the citizen and the State. Although the Bill is short and technical, it incorporates an important principle. The changeover should favour the citizen where convenience demands there must be a departure from neutral conversion. The Bill is also a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to <Col N="17" /> making timely preparations for the changeover to the euro. I thank Senators for considering this Bill and for agreeing to take all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is a very technical Bill. Its purpose is to replace Irish pound amounts and to set down in law convenient amounts in euros, with effect from 1 January 2002. Fees and charges controlled by Government Departments or bodies, where amounts are paid in cash and need to be easily remembered, are being replaced. The fees and charges are set out in Schedule 4 of the Bill and are well explained in two tables attached to the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will begin to be put into circulation and the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins will begin. There will be a dual circulation period, during which the use of euro notes and coins will be increased and the use of Irish notes and coins will be decreased. It is proposed that the dual circulation period should end at midnight on 9 February 2002. That is a very short period, less than six weeks. I am conscious of the work undertaken by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and Forfás in providing information for the business sector of our community, especially retailers. However, despite their best efforts &ndash; and the Minister referred to it this afternoon &ndash; I was disappointed to read in a recent report that, of all the countries joining the euro in 2002, Ireland is well behind other countries from a business point of view in preparing for the changeover.</P>
      <P>Let me make a passing reference to the referendum on the Nice treaty. If we have learned anything from the outcome of that referendum, it is that many people did not vote because they were confused about the issues. The same confusion will arise in relation to the euro changeover, and that must be addressed. The lesson we must learn from the Nice treaty referendum is that we have to make clear to the public the issues involved.</P>
      <P>My real concern is for the general public. Retailers have had a fair crack of the whip from the changeover board and Forfás. They have received all the information they want and should have their businesses in order for the changeover. However, this changeover will come as a great cultural shock to the people. We have redesigned Irish notes in recent years, but one rural retailer told me that people still come to his business with the old pound notes. This change will therefore be a tremendous shock to the system and will take some getting used to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I visited a school catering for children with intellectual disability where the pupils were participating in a project on the euro and, in order to facilitate the teachers, the changeover board had issued them with new notes. The notes had, of course been cancelled, but that was the first time I had handled these new notes. They are very colourful and very well designed and I think Irish people will like them. However, we <Col N="18" /> need to make the public aware of these notes by issuing them in a sample form.</P>
    <P>Young people will grasp this changeover very easily. The problem will be with our elderly population. They will find this currency change a great shock. I suggest that sample notes should be given to them one week in advance when they are collecting their old age pension so that they will be able to familiarise themselves with the new notes. A public information programme should also be put in place between now and 1 January 2002 to allow members of the public to familiarise themselves with the notes. Information leaflets and booklets are all very well, but it is very important that people see the notes.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister with responsibility for consumer protection intends to act as a watchdog for the general public to ensure that no one gains and that this conversion will favour the individual, as provided for in the Bill. It should be the principal role of the Minister and the Director of Consumer Affairs to act as watchdog on behalf of the public and make sure no one takes advantage of this conversion. People will still have old notes after 9 February. They will no longer be legal tender, but it is my understanding that the Central Bank will continue to take Irish notes and convert them. I understand there is no time limit for that, but I would like the Minister to confirm it.</P>
    <P>In a single market it is very important to have a single currency. I therefore welcome the changeover to the euro. I hope it will improve the economy in respect of both trade and tourism. For that reason I am happy to support this measure with the caveats I have raised today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This legislation is welcome. It takes us one step further towards the introduction of a single currency on 1 January 2001. This legislation is mainly technical, involving the rounding off of figures. The figures will be rounded down in most cases but up in some situations in the conversion to the euro.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of the few nations in Europe with experience of a currency changeover and we found it easy to handle. The change to decimalisation in 1971 was very smooth. We have also, to a great extent, had to deal with two currencies since 1979 &ndash; the pound sterling in the North and the punt here.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the findings of a recent survey showed that certain businesses, in particular small retailers, have not geared themselves up to where they feel capable of dealing with the changeover from the punt to the euro. Perhaps that is the area on which the Minister should focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other matters arise in relation to the changeover. One relates to the existence of trade with the farming community in Northern Ireland which has been part and parcel of farming here over the years. Coming from a farming background, I have always been aware of the import<Col N="19" /> ance of exports and purchases to and from the Northern Ireland farming community particularly by farmers in the west and midlands. We may experience difficulty in that area given that the UK will not be joining the euro on 1 January, although there are indications that this policy may change following the general election in Great Britain and that there may be a momentum towards embracing the euro down the road. I would like the Minister to deal in particular with the question of the acceptance of sterling and the amounts to be given in lieu, and also the carrying of currencies across the Border, given that we will have the euro which is a single currency and that the pound sterling will continue to be used in the North. These are some of the teething problems we will face in that area. The Minister might address that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Much debate has taken place about people capitalising on the changeover. At the time of decimalisation retailers and others capitalised by rounding up in their favour. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Director of Consumer Affairs must ensure there is an alert watchdog system in place to prevent a recurrence of that practice. If there is any adverse comment on the changeover it will centre on those who seize the opportunity to line their pockets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be a good development before a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. However, when old age pensioners get their pensions in euros next February or March, which will have been increased again in the next budget, they will be very pleased with the result of five years of good governance, including the provision of major and unprecedented increases in pensions and social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intends that there should be a watchdog to ensure that people do not abuse their position during the changeover. What penalties will apply to those found guilty of attempting to fleece the public? At the time of decimalisation in 1971 there was a general consensus that sections of the community who were in a position to round off prices did so in their favour. The public is concerned that the same does not happen at the start of next year. The Minister said that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Director of Consumer Affairs will comprise the watchdog in this area. Will there be sufficiently severe penalties to inhibit retailers or others from attempting to fleece the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is necessary technical legislation to give effect to the areas outlined by the Minister. I <Col N="20" /> commend it to the House and I compliment the other side of the House for accommodating all Stages of the Bill today. The debate gives us the opportunity to obtain information from the Minister on the implementation of the changeover. The public experienced decimalisation in 1971 and the break with sterling in 1979, and more than in any other EU member state they are better equipped to deal with what is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this positive and progressive Bill. It is important that successive Governments have taken appropriate measures to ensure that we have become part of the wider Europe. We should be careful not to be side-tracked by non-debates about what happened in 1971. I recall at that time teaching in the classroom the changeover to decimalisation. Stories about people being ripped off do not stand up to scrutiny. Every newspaper journalist who is too lazy to undertake research produces them. That did not happen to a significant extent.</P>
      <P>On issues like this it is time we stopped enabling people. If they are foolish enough not to check prices at the time of the changeover to the euro they should be told <i>caveat emptor,</i> buyer beware. Every retailer is required to produce a price list indicating comparative prices. However, Irish consumers are not as price conscious as politicians seem to think. On any 20 mile stretch of roadway today there are huge variations in fuel prices, as much as 10p per litre. If consumers were as conscious about prices as politicians are prepared to believe, those selling fuel at more expensive prices would not be in business. It must be recognised that consumers will have loyalties to retail outlets in which they can trust and have confidence, which is much more important than pointing out variations in prices of 1p or 2p. Consumers must be careful, the consumer interest must be properly represented and we must ensure the changeover to the euro is positive and progressive.</P>
      <P>There was a debate on the Order of Business about whether people made the right or wrong decision in the recent Nice treaty referendum. It does not matter if they were right or wrong. They made a decision which must be respected but because they took a decision does not mean they were right or wrong. It was democracy at work and we as legislators and political representatives must respect it.</P>
      <P>As the leader of political life the Taoiseach must, by virtue of his office rather than his personal decision, take responsibility for the outcome. However, all parties to the debate must acknowledge that not enough was done. The issue has not gone away because the impact of our decision is to stop the enlargement planned for the EU. It does not matter whether people intended that to be the outcome or whether they are for or against enlargement. The decision returns the EU to the context of the Amsterdam treaty, which restricts enlargement to not more than five or six new member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> It is fair to say that because we have gained so much from the EU does not mean we should submerge our sovereignty in the wider interests of Europe. However, the problem with last week's decision is that we did not approach it properly. As I understand democracy, the people elect a leadership through democratic participation, which implements proposals, some of which must be returned to the people but with the support and advice of the leadership. That is why I have always believed the McKenna judgment to be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and democracy. It was ultra democratic, above the level of democracy. It does not fit. Nevertheless, given that it was a decision of the Supreme Court we need to look at how we do our business on that basis in the future.</P>
    <P>The euro has been threatened by the decision of last week's referendum. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is indicating that I may be straying from the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so. However, in this sense, one will have noticed that the market makers in the money markets of the world have reacted disastrously against the euro. They have recognised the Irish decision as more problems regarding the euro zone, macro-European policy and an enlarged market. They are now marking down the euro in the same week that sterling hit its lowest point in years against the dollar. Market makers globally have accepted that sterling will be part of the euro within three or four years at the outside and they are beginning to discount sterling by reference to the level at which it will join the euro.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the euro is protected and there is a changeover to a strong currency, it is important to revisit the decision made last week. This means there should be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign that is both structured and strategic. It should be based on the way forward and involve the identification of issues and responses to them. It should involve the preparation of arguments on each issue which should be presented. There should be engagement with the issues and the electorate and this should be organised and supported. Chiefs and not only Indians should be involved because what happened last week in terms of our future in the euro zone and our role in protecting the euro was a disaster.</P>
      <P>In terms of the leadership shown by different groups &ndash; I include my role in the trade union movement &ndash; we did not reach the grass roots and make it happen. There was only one organised campaign which was against the Nice treaty. On the other side, there was a huge amalgam of disparate groups which held another point of view. There was no co-ordination or focus. This is why the euro is worth less this week.</P>

      <P>In transferring to the euro we must ensure that it is a strong currency. To do this, we must ensure that it is seen as the largest market in the globe. An increased market must be shown to be part of the attraction for Ireland. It is clear that our economic future will depend on the export of intellectual add-on capacity to electronic services and materials in one form or another. This is the reality and there is no point talking in a vacuum about changing over to the euro if we do not also ensure there is a strong foundation for a strong currency in which people can have trust and confidence. This will be built on revisiting the decision made last week and ensuring it is changed on the next occasion. That decision should be in the best interests of our future as a nation in Europe and the future of the European currency.</P>
      <P>There should be a detailed discussion on the McKenna judgment. I do not want the Referendum Commission to issue a series of boring advertisements next week stating in the context of the arguments for and against the euro what it is worth, but also stating that some people say it should be worth less. I do not want it to again succeed in confusing people because confusion is the enemy of progress. That is what happened last week. People did not understand the Nice treaty and the same problem could arise in relation to the changeover to the euro. The importance of this legislation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to the euro changeover amounts. If one did not read the Bill carefully, one might get the impression that IR£1 was the same as 1.25. That is not contained in the legislation, but it states that one is being replaced by the other. If people did not understand that it rounds off sums to the most reasonable amount, confusion might be created. It is an example of why the matter needs to be clarified for people. This is the reason there should be engagement with the electorate in ensuring that they understand what is happening. It is also the reason the Bill is important. This issue should be addressed as quickly as possible and I commend the Bill to the House. I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his tolerance in allowing me to engage in a more wide-ranging debate.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to believe that it is three years since the House discussed Ireland's entry to the euro zone. At that time, we thought <Col N="23" /> we would never reach the deadline of 1 January 2002, but it is almost upon us. Senator O'Toole may have confused the public more than enlightened them while Senator Doyle was very harsh on the public. My belief is that the public will take to the new currency with great ease. When people go on holidays and change money into different currencies they do not have much difficulty. Most people convert the local currency to IR£. I have every confidence that the public will take to the euro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not everybody has the opportunity to go on holiday and change money. I was referring to the many people who just draw their old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I only gave an example; I did not refer to everybody going on holidays. However, small traders may have some difficulties and I will refer to that aspect later.</P>
      <P>The euro will become the ordinary currency from 1 January 2002 and the Bill replaces, where necessary, IR£ amounts set down in law with convenient or rounded euro amounts &ndash; down in the case of charges and fees and up in the case of threshold amounts. The amounts relate to certain fees and charges levied by Government Departments and bodies. The purpose of the Bill is to adjust to easily remembered euro amounts from IR£ values that exist at present where the amounts will be rounded up or down. The set amounts will make it more convenient for ordinary punters because some people may find it difficult to convert the exact amount of 0.787564 and 1.25 in relation to the IR£.</P>
      <P>Easily remembered amounts in the euro are needed in certain cases, especially for cash transactions. The Bill only deals with cases where a convenient euro amount has been deemed necessary. It does not deal with money amounts for tax or social welfare or road tax. The Finance Act and the Social Welfare Acts have already provided for this in the taxation and social welfare codes. Recent Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' payment booklets show the designated euro amounts that will apply from 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for an amendment to the Economic and Monetary Act, 1998, the Credit Union Act, 1997, and the Heritage Act, 1995. Section 4 of the Bill refers to the 11 countries that originally joined the euro zone on 1 January 1999 and the entry of Greece from 1 January 2001. However, there is no mention of Britain. Following the general election there last week, it may not be too long before it joins the euro. In Britain there appears to be a move away from the Conservative and Thatcherite days of being against Europe towards a situation where new Labour is more involved in Europe. It may be some time before sterling becomes part of the euro zone <Col N="24" /> because the British always liked to hold on to everything they owned.</P>
    <P>There could be difficulties for Irish exporters, particularly should sterling drop in relation to the dollar. Many Irish exporters, even with the onset of the euro changeover, still export in the currencies of their markets and sterling is still an important factor for them. The high rate of sterling was of great benefit to exporters but in the future changes may make life more difficult.</P>
    <P>I wonder if some aspect of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Nice treaty referendum was a rejection of the idea of the euro. I heard comments last week that surprised me. West Donegal relies entirely on the fishing industry and while there will be a review of the Common Fisheries Policy, I was surprised to hear people talking about voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of how the fishing industry has been treated by Europe.</P>
    <P>The euro notes and coins will be introduced on 1 January 2002 and there will be a six-week dual currency period during which it is envisaged that the euro will be used more than the Irish pound. This period will last until Saturday, 9 February 2002, after which the pound will no longer be legal tender. It has been suggested that this is a long enough time to familiarise the public with the new currency and short enough to ensure that the changeover happens quickly and smoothly. I have a fear that in those first six weeks the banking system may not be able to cope with the amount of euro tender needed. I am confident this issue will be addressed but it is very important to ensure that the proper supply of currency is available.</P>
    <P>Public information has been provided but apart from the public sector and some of the larger firms, the consumer has not yet realised what will happen. I am an accountant dealing with small businesses and I find that there is very little talk or planning for the changeover in the small firms sector. I am aware of only one firm which has been producing its accounts in euro for the past two years. All the others seem to be putting off the evil day. Most small businesses get excited when they look at their bank statements and mistake the euro amount for Irish pounds. There will be great difficulties with many small businesses. Pricing on cash tills and petrol price readings at small garages may not be ready for the changeover. There may be difficulties for the consumer. I remember that in the case of the changeover to decimalisation, consumers were done by unscrupulous shopkeepers &ndash; I do not mean by big supermarkets like Senator Quinn's shops, but the small rural corner shop.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that 150,000 copies of euro changeover guidelines were issued to retailers by Forfás, but I believe that many of these are still sitting on shelves, like many of the reports we receive which lie in offices and are not read. We have six months to prepare and small retailers and businesses should take the time to prepare for this changeover.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> I see a number of advantages in the changeover to the euro. I know that Senator Joe Doyle does not go on foreign holidays but he probably has taken trips with Oireachtas committees. Three years ago we all believed that there would be an end to the banks' exploitation of currency exchange transactions and now we find that it has got worse instead of better. I hope from 1 January the banks will no longer be able to exploit us because we will be able to use euro currency both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has changed the financial year to bring it into line with the calendar year. This may cause difficulties for firms which do not close their accounts on 31 December because in the first year six or seven months' accounts will be shown in Irish pounds and the other five months in euro. I believe that we will become accustomed to the euro just as we did with decimalisation. The most important point is that there should be no exploitation and that the changeover is fair to all. When the Minister for Finance reduced the VAT rate by 1%, I wonder how much of that 1% filtered through to the customer. It did not always happen in smaller and some larger businesses. I believe that the customer suffered. Unscrupulous traders will treat customers unfairly and we do not need mere lip service from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as regards control and regulation &ndash; we will want action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. The Minister will be pleased to know that I am a fan of the euro but I am also a fan of the metric system and I am concerned about what Senator Joe Doyle said about there being perhaps too short a changeover period. I have converted to metric and it has made me much taller. The Minister will be pleased to know that I am now 166 centimetres tall &ndash; I used to be much smaller in the old days &ndash; and I am now also lighter in weight. The Minister is a golfing man and he will understand that when I had a five metre putt the other day I felt everyone should know that it was a 16 foot putt.</P>
      <P>I am enthusiastic for the speedy changeover to the euro and I do not favour a prolonged timescale. I do not think we are ready. I ask the Minister if the FÁS training packs are yet available to employees. I do not believe they are &ndash; if they are, I have not yet seen them. I have been using euro cheque books for the past two years and when I sent a £10 cheque to my daughter in Paris, she was charged £10 by the bank for the transfer of the euro cheque. I am not sure if this happens in the reverse situation because my daughter never sends me £10, but she was charged when I sent her the cheque. I think £10 might be an acceptable charge for a higher amount of money but certainly not for such a small amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if we are aware of the huge costs which will be incurred by retailers. The banks will have to distribute the currency ahead of the changeover day but how will retailers safely store the <Col N="26" /> money? My company officials have been informed by the banks that the currency will be delivered months in advance and this will create security problems. EuroCommerce is a Brussels-based representative group for retailers. In a standard letter to members it notes that businesses generally get much of the small change from over the counter payments. If bakers, taxi drivers, railway ticket offices or supermarkets must give change only in euro and their customers are paying in national currency units, they will need to have up to 20 times as much cash as normal in the till. In these circumstances, there will be a much greater risk of robberies. These difficulties will be exacerbated if there are not enough five and ten euro notes in circulation.</P>
    <P>The whole question of front-loading the public is very important. This will be much more important for the small shops than for the big shops. Most customers coming into a large supermarket spend, say, £40 or £50. If they give in a £50 note or a 50 note the change will be comparatively small. If most people going into a small shop in those first few days and first few hours of 1 January next to buy a newspaper or a bar of chocolate have only a large unit of currency, either of traditional Irish money or the euro, the change could be gone from those small shops by 11 a.m. That is my concern. Are we sure we are able to cover that problem? To do that it will be necessary to have front-loading.</P>
    <P>Front-loading means we will have to get money into the hands of the public ahead of 1 January. Let me take the example of going to Spain &ndash; I know Senator Doyle never goes to Spain on holidays &ndash; and let us think of Spain as euroland on 1 January. A week or so ahead of time one goes to the bank for currency and one has it ready to use on arrival in Spain. I want the public to be able to say they can get money ahead of time when going to euroland on 1 January and that they will have the currency for that country on their arrival. The Minister has taken a step in that direction. He is giving a £5 pack to be distributed by post offices from 17 December. Page 2 of the EuroCommerce document suggests that consumers arm themselves with the average amount of cash they currently spend per week. In Belgian francs that is about £40. A sum of £5 from the post office in a pack is not nearly enough. The Minister should endeavour to get more of new euro money into the hands of the public before 1 January. I know there are difficulties, one of which is the actual date of change, but we have lost that particular one. We have to find a way to get euro money into the hands of the public before 1 January, otherwise the system might begin to break down by 11 a.m. I urge the Minister to find a way to front-load not only the coins but the notes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other recommendation, the EuroCommerce document insists that ATMs are converted to euro notes overnight on 31 December 2000, that refill capacity will exist on 1 January 2002 and that non-converted ATMs do <Col N="27" /> not distribute national currency. We must ensure that happens. The document recommends that 5 and 10 notes are initially available through ATM and encourages consumers to exchange the national currency for euros before going to the shops in early 2002. It recommends that one stops distributing large denominational national currency notes in late 2001 and encourages banks in every country to open a significant number of their branches on 1 January 2002. I realise that not all of that is in the hands of the Minister and that all he can do in some cases is encourage the banks. We have to take such steps to ensure it survives. Unless we grab hold of the opportunities we could have a huge problem. I cannot envisage a situation where people will pay in both currencies. They have to pay and get the change in one currency. As soon as the new currency is in their hands the changeover period will be as short as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is part of the essential housekeeping necessary in the changeover to the euro. I am sure I am not alone in wishing that the rest of the changeover process will be as simple. Regrettably, that is not the case. At this stage we are forced into the position of hoping things will go right on the night. It is a measure of the recent decline of Irish influence across the EU that our European partners did not choose to learn from the unique experience that Ireland has in making such a currency changeover, as Senator Finneran said. When Ireland went decimal in the 1970s we took great care in choosing the date. We did not win that one. If I remember correctly the date was 15 February 1971. We chose a date that was not in the middle of the Christmas rush or the sales and for that reason we lost out. I cannot help thinking that perhaps there was a lack of zeal by the Government in putting forward Ireland's experience as a guide.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of the euro process I have got the impression that the Government has chosen to take orders from the European Central Bank rather than to seek to influence the policy that it adopted. It is true that some changes for the better have been made. I congratulate the Minister on the first tentative steps he has made in regard to front-loading, but we will have to go much further if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>In the beginning everyone was talking about a period of six months for the changeover but it is now down to six weeks. I welcome that. I forecast that most of the conversion to the new currency will take place during the first ten days of 2002, with little more than minor mopping up taking place until 9 February. It is only when one thinks of a massive conversion taking place in such a short time that one begins to get the feel of the logistical difficulties involved. The logistics of actually getting the new currency where it is needed is where the problems will arise. I have already mentioned the difficulty of the cash in transit companies. Given that there are not enough of them it will take much longer. I see <Col N="28" /> no difficulty in people getting to know the new currency and becoming comfortable with it. Once the euro is a reality in their pockets they will readily adapt to it, just as most of us have adapted to the metric system. They will rapidly become sensitive to the new price points that will emerge in the new economy. I must admit I was confused when I read the changeover in the Bill today. I understand it makes sense not to convert exactly to the same amount. The danger of people being confused is high and so they will be at risk from profiteering. This is being grossly overstated.</P>
    <P>There are two points I wish to make on the question of prices and the changeover. I warn the Government against making changes in VAT rates that would coincide with the changeover. If there are to be VAT changes in the new budget, their implementation date should be deferred until the changeover has taken place and things have settled down. Were there to be a general increase in VAT that coincided with the changeover this would cause a great deal of confusion among the public and the two charges would get mixed up in the public's mind. Inevitably, as Senators Finneran and Bonner have said, the cost of the changeover process will have to be passed on to the public in some way. All retailers will have a huge increase in costs whether it is insurance to mind the extra cash or whatever. Let us see how they will handle it.</P>
    <P>As we get nearer to E day and the sheer logistics become clearer with every passing week, it is obvious that businesses in the money-handling chain will have considerable once-off expenses arising from that changeover. For example, consider the vital necessity of having enough euro notes and coins at every retail outlet from the morning of the first day. That is vital if the system is not to break down at the start. These notes and coins will have to be got from the Central Bank which produces them and they will have to be got to the retail banks and then to the individual retail outlets. That cannot be done overnight, especially over the Christmas-new year period. That means that these outlets will have to be front-loaded with euro currency. Retail outlets which in the ordinary way work hard to get rid of any cash they hold as soon as possible will have to hold large amounts of euro currency for what could be a period of weeks. That will create a totally new security aspect which will cost a great deal of money. Given the narrow profit margins on which large retailers and many others work, it is inevitable that that extra cost will be passed on to the public in some form.</P>
    <P>While we are right not to expect prices to be increased due to the conversion from pounds to euro &ndash; customers must be vigilant against any such increases &ndash; at the same time we have to be realistic. If we are realistic we must admit that the changeover process has a once-off cost and that this cost is likely to be paid for by somebody.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I have touched on a number of what might seem minor points but they are important. I know the Minister is anxious to <Col N="29" /> make sure that the changeover from 1 January until 9 February takes place but to do so we must get currency into the hands of the public before they enter euroland on 1 January. We have to find a way to get coins and smaller notes in particular. A £5 pack in the post offices is not going to be nearly enough; we need to do much more. Let us make sure that steps are taken to give the public whatever it requires ahead of time and let us make sure that the banks and others are available to do that in the few days coming up to the euro changeover. I welcome the Bill; I welcome the Minister's views and his explanation today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about the euro changeover. We have faced many challenges in recent years, most importantly the Y2K issue. Without the careful planning that went into the management of that project, we would not have had a successful rollover on 1 January 2000. This changeover probably presents us with even greater challenges because it affects every individual here and careful planning is vital.</P>
      <P>Understanding the issue is essential and the hardest thing to do is to take time out to manage the transition from the punt to the euro. It has not dawned on people, including me, what we will be facing on 1 January. I find it hard to believe that we will be looking at what might be called foreign money. It will take some time to get used to the idea of the euro. I was quite young when decimalisation occurred and I do not remember pounds, shillings and pence. However years later I still hear people talking about working for ten bob a week. I remember the changeover to metric and even though I was taught in kilogrammes and grammes, I still refer to pounds and ounces. We are slow to change in our minds, but the speed of this change will focus our minds all the more. I have no doubt we will successfully change over despite a few headaches in the meantime.</P>
      <P>On 1 January the euro coins and notes will come into effect and the Irish pound coins and notes will be withdrawn. By midnight on 9 February this change will be complete. Some people I have spoken to think that the transition is very quick and it is not giving people enough time to adjust. However, regardless of how long people are given, it is only when they are handling the notes that they learn how to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent survey showed 77% of the general public is aware of the euro changeover, which is much more than other changeovers. However, I am concerned about the depth of that knowledge. I do not mean that in a patronising way. At a superficial level, we all know that the notes and coins will be changed but we have not realised the effect it will have on our daily lives. The general perception is that the changeover will mainly affect retail businesses, manufacturing and service industries. The big challenge for most people will be in the everyday aspects of living such as doing the shopping, eating out, paying bills, etc. Over the next six months we have plenty of time <Col N="30" /> but we need a concentrated effort to raise public awareness and to deal with the changeover. People are travelling much more now than when decimalisation occurred and are more used to changing currencies, but this change will affect them at home.</P>
    <P>When I look at my bank statement and see how much I have, I think that it is great until I realise that I am looking at the euro figure rather than the punts one. Over the next few months, we need to make the adjustment from punts to euro in our own heads. For businesses, the challenges are greater including the processing of payments to suppliers, salaries and wages to employees, charging customers, etc. The most important aspect for businesses will be in the training of staff not only in their dealing with other businesses but more importantly with the general public. We will have a few rocky months during the transition from the punt to the euro, but good staff training can help make it smoother.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that training packs will be available for people with disabilities and the elderly. It is important that these are available for the visually impaired and people who are deaf or hard of hearing as well as the intellectually disabled. The European Commission will be introducing numerous training tools including dummy bank notes to help in the recognition of the euro and they need to be made widely available to all sectors of the community that require it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the European Commission is producing training tools including brochures and games under the euro made easy programme, which was developed by citizens for citizens using everyday language. As in other areas, children can teach us much and the education of children at an early stage will be vital in changing all of us. There is much information available to teachers which they will pass on to their pupils including quizzes, primary school work sheets, guidelines for teachers, etc., and I am sure these will be extremely effective.</P>
    <P>Some of my constituents are fearful that individuals in business will use the cost of the changeover as an excuse to place a levy on the general public by increasing prices. It will be difficult for everyone, but we have to be careful that people do not use the opportunity to simply increase their own profits.</P>
    <P>On a lighter note, we all have jars of coins that we have built up over the years and it is important that we get value for money over the coming months and get rid of them so that we do not have to go to the banks on the deadline to have them changed. There are older people who still keep a few pounds under the mattress and expect that their nest egg will be safe, secure and worth money whenever they need it, but that may not be the case. During the awareness campaign for the public, we need to emphasise that the money, hoarded under beds and in coffee jars, should be brought to the banks and changed so that people get their value for it in plenty of time. While there is a responsibility on Government to <Col N="31" /> make sure that people are made well aware of it, everybody must take responsibility for themselves over the coming months. Public awareness is the most important key, but each individual must take responsibility for his or her own aspect of the changeover and must ensure that they are adequately informed in good time. I welcome this Bill and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>About one year ago, almost to the day, we had a debate in this House on the euro. It was a less detailed and less technical debate than this one. We were assured then that although the euro was very low, all would be well as it was rallying on the markets, oil prices were falling, inflation in Ireland had peaked and we would never see such lows again. One year later, the euro, having rallied a little, is back near the bottom at an all-time low. I wonder why that is so. Those who have apologised for the euro since it came into existence have been wrong in virtually every statement they made. Their most fundamental error was in joining the euro in the first place. We are talking about a failed project. I remember very clearly &ndash; the Minister was not guilty of this &ndash; Government and Opposition spokesmen declaring that the euro would be a strong currency which would rival the dollar and sterling. It was a failure.</P>
      <P>One of the weakest excuses I heard in this House was from a Minister of State who, in apologising for the euro, said that it would be okay when people got the coins and notes in their hands. Apparently, when that happens, the euro is set to rise. Of course that is nonsense. Having the coins in our hands will make no difference. It will give the euro a certain degree of credibility, but probably less than was imagined by the Minister of State who made that statement in this House. The euro will buy much less in the shops when it comes into circulation at the end of this year than it would have done originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this Bill without pressing it to a vote because it is part of the European process which I dislike and which has gone too far. We have to ask what are the reasons for this situation and whether it benefits Ireland to be in the euro. It does not. We simply got the euro wrong and we have had, perhaps, two years of it. It was meant to be a strong currency which would curb inflation. It has been a weak currency which has fuelled inflation. Low interest rates, as a result of the euro, have fuelled the housing boom, which in turn has fuelled inflation. We prayed for oil prices to fall and our prayers were met for a very short time, but prices are now going up again. The reality is that we are now voluntary prisoners of the euro and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. We are now suffering possibly the worst of all worlds. Of course, we have gained exports, but we do not really need that kind of <Col N="32" /> fuel on the fire at present. This Bill is simply more of the same project.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few comments on this Bill and on the European process. In the context of the Nice treaty, Senator O'Toole mentioned the need to protect the euro. Many of us who voted against that treaty last week did so for very good reasons, one of which was the euro. I believe this European project has gone much too far and is no longer in the interests of Ireland. That is not to say that one does not wish to be a member of the European Union &ndash; far from it &ndash; but the way we are approaching this Bill today, with exactly the same unanimous, gregarious, sheep-like support which we offered last week to the Nice treaty, shows how incredibly far we are out of touch with the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary, as was said on the Order of Business, that virtually every powerful pressure group in the country was against that referendum last week, yet the Houses of the Oireachtas are almost unanimously in favour of it. How on earth can that happen? Does it mean, as I suggest, that there are people in these Houses who do not believe in it for one moment, but are voting it through because we are now subject to pressures from Europe which we cannot and do not wish to resist? I heard a commentator say on an RTÉ radio programme this week &ndash; of course no commentator has a monopoly on the truth &ndash; that, in his opinion, if a referendum on the Nice treaty was held in France and Germany, the people of those countries would vote against it. In Germany, that was attributed to the loss of the mark and consequent inflationary expectations, based on good historical reasons. If that is the case, why on earth are we continuing to promote that particular project today? Is it because politicians like swanning around Europe, with its attendant power, prestige and photo opportunities? They have been swallowed into the system and they neglect the wishes of their constituents.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is guilty of that. One of my reasons for voting against the Nice treaty &ndash; I do not wish to embarrass the Minister &ndash; was the appalling way he was treated when he was running the economy on the best possible lines. I do not see why this country should put up with that sort of interfering arrogance from countries which do not know how to run their own affairs properly, while we are running the most prosperous and successful economy, courtesy of the Minister. That undeserved and unwarranted reprimand was humiliating to a country which is doing extremely well without, and despite, Europe. That was one of my reasons and I do not wish to say anything else to embarrass the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the context of the euro and this Bill, we are not just attaching ourselves to a weak currency, we are attaching ourselves to weak economies. In some extraordinary way, Europe has managed to be inflationary and, at the same time, to stagnate. <Col N="33" /> That is quite an achievement. Bad inflation figures came through from Germany today. At the same time the German economy is sluggish. The European economy is in a state of stagflation. Whatever gloss one puts on it, the European economy is languishing at the same time as the currency is languishing. That is difficult to achieve. Usually, when currencies are weak, the economies are export led in terms of a boom, but not this one, for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Ireland, perhaps for reasons to do with brainwashing rather than commercial reality, has attached itself to this Berlin type mentality. I say straightforwardly and clearly that, in the economic battle and in terms of allegiance as between Boston and Berlin, some of us unapologetically say that we believe in Boston. Commercial reality demands that. We feel closer to the commercial and financial world of Boston than to the economic structure and model of Berlin and Brussels. Time and again, the American economy outperforms the European. This Bill is part of the process which the people rejected decisively last week yet we go ahead without question. I oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>They are nice countries to go to. Saying that one cannot afford to go is a good excuse for not visiting America or Britain. Senator Quinn mentioned earlier, and I welcome it, that the period for the changeover is shorter. However, more money in small notes and coins must be released coming up to Christmas and into the new year, otherwise old money will circulate for longer. That should be easy to do. Is it not possible to introduce more euros for the retail trade in the last two weeks of the year? The £5 packs available in post offices would barely pay the parking for a day's shopping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions which covered the debate over the euro project and the European economy and the practicalities of this Bill. Senator Doyle and others referred to euro notes and coins. Pictures of them are widely available and will be in the booklet being sent to every home in the autumn and they will be publicised in other ways. He also raised a question about the Central Bank. It will continue to give value indefinitely for Irish notes and coins. If the Senator has a stock of them in three or four years' time, the bank will give him the value. Perhaps in ten years or less, a Minister may bring this to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Finneran and Doyle referred to the length of the changeover period. All states are <Col N="34" /> committed to a changeover period of two months or less. When we introduced the Central Bank Bill there was a six month period. I stated then that we would avail of the shortest time. We are almost the shortest. Our period strikes a fair balance between giving people time to adapt to the new money and getting the changeover done quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle is concerned at the preparedness and general awareness of the changeover among businesses and the public. Companies must accelerate their preparations. Public information will be intensified in the run up to January. I urge those businesses, who have not done so, to avail of the information and services available. They should start their preparations now. The larger retail organisations are applying their minds to it, as evidenced by Senator Quinn's contribution. He mentioned some of the difficulties and I will return to these. Smaller operations have not spent much time on it.</P>
    <P>We have measures planned for the autumn to inform the public. At the end of August, the European Central Bank will unveil the bank notes' security features. The national central banks will begin advertising campaigns on what the new currency looks like. Also in the autumn, the Euro Changeover Board will increase its advertising and circulate a booklet to every household. On 1 October, dual pricing, already visible at outlets, will increase considerably. From Monday, 17 December, starter packs of 6.35 in coins, costing £5 each, will go on sale mainly in post offices. On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be circulated.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to consumer and pricing issues. The consumer aspect of the changeover is addressed by the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs and the Director of Consumer Affairs. They relaunched last December the national code of practice on the changeover and an action plan for consumer protection. The code's key aspect is that subscribers commit themselves to carrying out the changeover fairly and do not seek an advantage from the conversion. The director sent the code to over 200 organisations with a sample letter for issue to their members and a form of undertaking inviting them to subscribe to it or draw up a suitable sectoral code for approval under the national code. Any such code must still contain the commitment to carry out the changeover fairly. The director's office has applications from 100 potential individual subscribers.</P>
    <P>The national code is signed by ten trade associations &ndash; the Irish Sports Association, the Retail Jewellers of Ireland, the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management (Ireland) Limited, the Association of Optometrists (Ireland), the Association of the Irish Dental Industry Limited, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants <Col N="35" /> of Ireland, the Car Rental Council of Ireland and the Association of Building Engineers. Sectoral codes approved by the director came from IBEC, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association and the Irish branch of the Booksellers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Further sectoral codes are being examined by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Retailers signed up to a code are entitled to display the euro logo to demonstrate this. The director advises consumers to shop where they see the logo. Consumers can feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where it is displayed.</P>
    <P>Before the euro comes in, customers will have had ample opportunity to inform themselves of the changeover and build up a scale of values in that currency. They can contact the office of consumer affairs with queries or complaints. The Minister and the Director of Consumers Affairs will monitor developments to determine if further initiatives are required. Retailers and their organisations are anxious to demonstrate that they will conduct the changeover fairly. Competition and market forces should deter attempts to cheat. The director will withdraw the logo from any retailer abusing the changeover, which will help consumers. Senator O'Toole is correct in saying that consumers should pay attention to prices and take their custom elsewhere if they believe they are not being treated fairly.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised other issues. People doing cross-Border business are used to dealing in a euro currency, the Irish pound, and sterling. They should be able to get used to dealing in the euro and sterling quickly. Senator Bonner made points with which I agree. Forfás is distributing 200,000 copies of a guide for small and medium enterprises. I have not yet checked in my own small to medium sized accountancy practice, but if I did it would produce similar results to the Senator's survey. Not many have taken all the steps.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a number of interesting points based on his experience in business. It is correct to state that the difficulty was when this date should be. For two reasons the most unsuitable date from an Irish viewpoint is 1 January. First, we have developed a uniquely Irish way of celebrating Christmas. No country in Europe, or anywhere in the world, has as long a celebration of Christmas. When I was growing up, we celebrated Christmas very well over a few days, but now people celebrate Christmas for the best part of two and a half weeks. The rest of Europe and the world might take example from us in this regard. It is the break-off period and we celebrate it for a long time, whereas the rest of Europe seems to have more public holidays and longer weekends than we do and I think that is more disruptive to business. The French have a great system and start a lot of holidays on a Thursday or Friday which stretch out to the following Tues<Col N="36" /> day. We make a big event of Christmas and work very hard the rest of the year until our summer holidays. That is why it is an unsuitable period for us.</P>
    <P>Second, we have a tradition of sales, as do many other countries. An enormous amount of cash is in circulation in that period and an enormous amount of selling goes on at Christmas and in its aftermath. I accept that 1 January is not a suitable date for us.</P>
    <P>Various dates were proposed over a number a years. The date of 1 October was suggested, as was later in the year. It is not as simple having the euro notes and coins &ndash; many other considerations had to be taken into account. We had to set the timetable some years ago. This is the third year of the euro and 31 December is the most obvious date for most countries, but it has some practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>I remember quite well the decimalisation changeover on 15 February 1971, and I think Senator Bonner would recall it too. I was not long an articled clerk in an accountancy practice. A bank strike started in or around the end of June 1970 which went on for months. I think the bank officials went back to work in early January but did not open their doors for a long time. Some time in March, one got a whole lot of bank statements and there was only one date on which they were all put through. One then had this changeover as well. I knew very little about accounting at that stage and was totally confused about the bank statements. I had only been in the practice for a few months as a trainee accountant. I remember 15 February made things even worse. I have reason to remember 15 February 1971.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and others raised the question of starter packs. There has been a debate at ECOFIN and with the ECB about notes and coins being put into circulation. We eventually went along with putting starter packs of coins in circulation. Every Minister at ECOFIN said that no notes and coins should be put into circulation before 1 January 2002 in any country. Of course, pressure built up in some countries and one by one they all said we would have to have starter packs of coins. We have gone along with that and people can buy them. I think there might be one country which will not have starter packs of coins.</P>
    <P>The Minister representing one country has raised the question of whether we should have the notes. Let us think about it for a while. If one picks a date some time December to give out notes, they will not have legal tender status until 1 January 2002. That applies no matter what date one chooses. My view for what it is worth &ndash; I am not claiming it is the correct one &ndash; is that it is better to have the big bang approach and say that no notes will be in circulation before 31 December because I think there would be too much confusion.</P>
    <P>In terms of the logistics in an operation such as the organisation of which Senator Quinn is chair<Col N="37" /> man and chief executive, I do not underestimate the difficulties. The Central Bank and the Euro Changeover Board have spent a lot of time trying to plan the logistics of all this. The Central Bank has been planning it with the banks, which have been planning it with their customers. One thinks of getting the money out, but it will be as big an operation to get the money back in. In the early days of January, there will be millions of notes and coins that will have to be taken from the centres and brought somewhere. This will be a major operation which I do not underestimate, and there are some costs. We have worked out agreement between the Central Bank and the retail banks about the debiting of customers and that, I think, is reasonably satisfactory. There will be other costs which will have to be borne by the particular industries.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank which has the authority in this matter regarding notes has already ruled that euro notes should not be made available to the public in advance of 1 January 2002. That was repeated recently at ECOFIN and I support that position. More recently, the ECB president, Wim Duisenberg, strongly reiterated the ECB position. The key to a speedy changeover as regards notes is to convert all, or most, ATMs to the euro on the first day and to make sure that they mainly issue low value euro notes &ndash; fives and tens &ndash; and to frontload retailers with low value euro notes. That is what is intended. We are doing these things in Ireland. About 80% of the ATMs will be converted to the euro on 1 January 2002 and, initially, they will probably issue ten and 20 euro notes. Initially, retailers will be frontloaded with low value euro notes.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments will be in euro from 1 January 2002. The bulk of these are still paid in cash at post offices and in the first week of the changeover they will generally contain at least four five euro notes. Banks, building societies and post offices will exchange Irish cash for euro and, where feasible, credit unions will do the same for their members.</P>
    <P>From the start of the changeover, there will be a strong flow of low value euro notes in the hands of the public. It is very unlikely that people will bring large notes into shops on 1 January 2002 and that they will buy a less value item. Senator Quinn has more retail experience than I but I do not think people will turn up at their corner shop with a 50 note looking for a packet of cigarettes. If they do, we will have the problem to which the Senator refers. I do not think that will happen. The Government and shopkeepers will ask people to try to give exact change or close to it, especially in the early days of January.</P>
    <P>Much as I would like to engage in debate with Senator Ross regarding the euro and last week, I will do something unusual and refrain from so doing. Over the past couple of years, I would have given vent to some expressions about Europe and Europeanisation. There is a lot of <Col N="38" /> validity in some of the things he has said. However, I will confine my remarks to the euro and to its success or otherwise. For many years in Opposition and before I was Minister for Finance, I said that people should not give the markets anything at which to pitch, that they should be very responsible and should not say anything because the currency marketeers like to speculate. I have my own views on why the euro has gone in a particular direction and the dollar has gone in another, but I will keep them to myself because I am sure if I said too much it would be on the Reuters screens in ten minutes and that would cause another furore on the markets.</P>
    <P>This is a major undertaking. The enormity of what will take place on 1 January 2002 is only beginning to dawn on people. Next Easter, for example, Senator Bonner, instead of going for a rest to Cheltenham, may head off to Spain or Portugal for a few days. One weekend he will be in Letterkenny looking at the price of shirts and a pint of beer and the following weekend he will be in Spain looking at the same items. He will be able to compare prices in euros. I think that will have an effect on the value of the euro <i>vis-à-vis </i>other currencies. I will not say anything more than that. That has been my contention for some time. The fact that people will have it in their pocket will have an effect. People are only coming to terms with the fact that 12 European countries will have the same currency. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

That implies that if a person wanted to join a club after the founding members have done all the ground work, he or she would have to pay something extra. Would <Col N="39" /> it be acceptable for the European Central Bank to adopt a policy towards a member state wanting to join the single currency at a later date &ndash; I am thinking particularly of the UK &ndash; of letting it know it would be very welcome but that it would have to pay extra fees at that stage?</P>

      <P>With regard to what will happen when another country wants to join, rules on that are set down in the Maastricht criteria, one of which is that a member state must be a member of the European monetary system for at least two years. When a club is up and running for some time, its members, as in the case of a golf club, will rightly say that they were there from the start and abided by all the rules so new members will also have to abide by them. The rules are clearly drawn and defined. It is repeated <i>ad infinitum </i>by people as to what will apply to any country that wants to join. To put it another way, I am very interested in football, as Senator Quinn and others know. Special rules are often made for great footballers that do not apply to ordinary footballers. It will be interesting to see what will happen if a major player wishes to join the European currency in future years. I will not speculate any more widely than that.</P>

    <Title>Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend and extend the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which provides the legislative basis for the regulation of the voluntary private health insurance market. It also makes certain provision, consistent with the existing VHI Acts, with respect to the powers of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of a new health strategy which will be published later this year. Notwithstanding the renewed focus which the strategy will bring to public health services, at present private health insurance plays an important role in the provision of hospital services for a large proportion of our population. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a framework which maintains the established common good principles of our system and supports the further development of a competitive private health insurance market. The Bill implements improvements and innovations in the general regulatory framework outlined in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance published by the Government in September 1999. It has been framed so as to provide enhanced scope for competition in the market while at the same time strengthening the basis on which solidarity between generations operates through community rating. It is my belief that the provisions of the Bill we are now considering will facilitate achievement of these two goals which, it has to be acknowledged, are not easily reconciled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our private health insurance system was originally established to provide cover for a por<Col N="41" /> tion of the population then without an entitlement to hospital services, it must be remembered that private health insurance here is availed of on a voluntary basis. The voluntary private health insurance system here has developed and thrived on the basis of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, which provide extensive safeguards for individuals in the operation of health insurance. An estimated 45% of the population currently have private health insurance cover. By contrast, the risk-rated and generally unregulated system in the United Kingdom has been relatively static with only about 12% of the population currently covered.</P>
    <P>The health insurance market was opened to competition through the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which was enacted in the interests of the common good. The Act provided significant safeguards for insured persons in the context of the opening of our health insurance market to competition in accordance with our European Union obligations for the completion of the Single Market. The 1994 Act requires health insurance undertakings to operate in accordance with community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. It also provides for minimum benefit for risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for the registration of insurance undertakings which either made cover available to the public or on a basis restricted to a particular vocational or occupational group, referred to as &ldquo;restricted membership undertakings&rdquo;. It also provided for the establishment of an independent regulatory body, the Health Insurance Authority, which I established on 1 February this year. The programme for Government specifically referred to the health insurance framework and led to the preparation of the first ever policy statement on private health insurance, the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in September 1999.</P>
    <P>The White Paper described how the private health insurance system played a complementary role to the arrangements for the provision of health services to the public generally. In that context, it referred to advantages resulting from the mix of public-private practice established in the hospital system. Notwithstanding this, as stated in the White Paper, the Government's primary concern is to ensure equitable access to health services. This imperative is central to considerations in the preparation of the forthcoming health strategy and will be the primary determinant in all policies and actions arising from its implementation going forward.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the principal provisions contained in the Bill. A key change provided for in the Bill relates to the definition of a health insurance contract. The principal changes from the existing definition are clarifications of the insurance cover comprehended by the definition, including employer arrangements and the removal from its scope of insurance plans which are solely con<Col N="42" /> cerned with services such as dental and optician services which have not featured to a significant extent in insurers' products.</P>
    <P>There is provision to support the financial stability of community rating by allowing insurers discretion to apply late entry premium loadings in specified circumstances where cover is being availed of for the first time at an older age or where there has been a significant break in cover. This is known as a &ldquo;lifetime community rating&rdquo;. As a corollary to this measure, open enrolment provisions of the 1994 Act, which provide individuals with an entitlement to purchase health insurance, will be extended to persons of, or over, the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes revised arrangements in relation to risk equalisation, aimed at facilitating competition while providing a necessary safeguard for community rating against the threat of instability which would arise from the development of risk selection in the market. Under the proposed arrangements, the Health Insurance Authority will be given a significant role in relation to the commencement of risk equalisation and the level of transfer which would arise following any commencement. A special measure in the area of risk equalisation, aimed at supporting entry to the market, will give insurers coming in an option not to participate in risk equalisation arrangements for a period immediately following the commencement of health insurance business in this country.</P>
    <P>A number of sections provide for the making of regulations by the Minister in relation to the detailed arrangements for implementation of the provisions concerned. The Bill provides that such regulations, other than a limited number of primarily routine measures, shall be submitted to the Oireachtas in draft form and will require approval by each House before they can be made. Regulations subject to this process will include those relating to risk equalisation. The Bill, therefore, provides for the Houses of the Oireachtas to have further, more detailed oversight of the measures to be taken in the regulation of the private health insurance market.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard provision which defines the principal Act as being the Health Insurance Act, 1994. Section 2 substitutes the key definition of &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; contained in section 2(1) of the principal Act. The amended definition provides that the focus of the legislation shall be on health insurance contracts which have, to any extent, the purpose of providing indemnity against the cost of hospital in-patient, day-patient services and relevant health services which are defined in section 3.</P>
    <P>To reflect the actual market situation and basic differences required in product financing and structure, the definition provides that the term &lsquo;health insurance contract' does not apply to arrangements which provide cover against the cost of long-term nursing care. Similarly, certain <Col N="43" /> contracts currently offered in respect of health episodes, which provide cash benefits rather than indemnity cover, are exempted from the definition. There is also an exemption in respect of international health insurance plans written in this country where the vast majority of the persons being covered under each policy are residing in other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for a number of limited changes to definitions contained in the principal Act. These are mainly of a technical nature. There is, however, a new definition of &lsquo;day patient service' which takes account of the large extent of procedures which are performed in hospitals on a daily basis and in respect of which health insurers pay benefits. The section also contains a definition of &lsquo;relevant health services' which provides that out-patient services, general medical practitioner services and services consisting of the supply of drugs or medical preparations are comprehended by the definition of a health insurance contract.</P>
    <P>If self-insurance on the part of employers was to develop, it would have the effect of damaging community rating by removing a predominantly young and healthy population from the general risk pool. This would threaten the solidarity between generations which underpins community rating. In this connection section 4 inserts a new provision which elaborates the type of arrangements which are deemed to constitute health insurance contracts. It provides that an employer who pays, or undertakes to pay, the fees or charges incurred by employees in respect of hospital in-patient services will be defined as a provider of health insurance and will be subject to the legislation. Self-insurance by large employers is a significant feature of arrangements in the United States.</P>
    <P>Recognising the existence of a limited number of long-standing public service employment-related arrangements, an exemption to this provision will apply in the case of specific arrangements entered into by a Minister of the Government. Such established arrangements relate, for example, to some Defence Forces personnel. The effect of the exemption will be to enable these arrangements to continue as before outside the ambit of the health insurance legislation. A further exemption is provided for in respect of &lsquo;excess' amounts, which are part of contracts currently offered in the market, where employers may meet such excesses incurred by their employees in connection with an episode of care or treatment. This amount is being limited to £100. It would not be my intention to facilitate any significant expansion of this exemption going forward as it could have the potential to impact negatively on the solidarity between generations which underpins community rating.</P>
    <P>Section 5 substitutes section 7 of the 1994 Act which provides for the community rating of <Col N="44" /> health insurance premiums. It maintains all the essentials of community rating provided for under the 1994 Act. In addition to maintaining the existing protections for consumers in relation to the setting of premiums on a community-rated basis, it prohibits the varying on the grounds of age, sex or sexual orientation of amounts payable by insurers in respect of the treatment and care of insured persons. The consumers' interests are thereby safeguarded both at the premium and benefits end of the insurance transaction. The section retains the provision requiring insurers to operate significantly reduced premium costs in respect of children. It provides for the scope of discretion by insurers to reduce premiums for dependent persons who are receiving full-time education to be increased from under the age of 21 to under the age of 23.</P>
    <P>Section 6 inserts a new section which supports community rating by giving an incentive for individuals to take out health insurance at a young age and by ensuring that those who join late also contribute appropriately to community rating. It does so in the context of strengthening and making more robust the system of community rating. I believe this is a fairer system of community rating than the current one because it will reward those who take out private health insurance when young, it will provide for an appropriate contribution by those who enter health insurance later in life when the prospect of claiming benefits is higher and it is consistent with the general principle of community rating because a 70 year old person who originally joined the system at age 25 will pay the same premium as a new entrant aged 25. Under the section, insurers will have the power to apply late entry premium loadings only in the circumstances specified and subject to arrangements which the Minister will provide for in regulations. This form of premium regime is known as &lsquo;lifetime community rating'. Persons already insured will not be liable to late entry loadings when renewing their cover.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1), on foot of actuarial advice, clarifies that the measure applies to those aged 35 and over. The actuarial advice which I received is that people who join the system before their mid-30s already make a significant contribution to the solidarity of the system.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that the circumstances in which a premium loading may be applied include the case where a person was not previously insured by a registered undertaking, had a lapse in cover of greater than 12 months duration or was availing of a higher level of cover. Another circumstance set out in the subsection relates to members of restricted membership undertakings who decide to remain outside the wider community-rated pool by choosing not to participate in risk equalisation arrangements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that the amount of the premium loading shall be determined in accordance with the regulations. In framing and <Col N="45" /> implementing these regulations, careful regard will be had to ensuring that the maximum permitted loadings are appropriate and do not represent an unfair burden on late entrants. Subsection (7) provides that the regulations may specify different methods or percentages in determining premium loadings, depending on the circumstances set out in subsection (4). It also provides that credit be given for previous periods of community-rated insurance cover held.</P>
    <P>Section 7 arises from section 6 of the Bill. Given the intention to enable insurers to apply late entry loadings, the section provides for the disclosure of information relevant to the operation of such loadings between insurers. The information concerned will relate to the extent and duration of an individual's insurance cover and can only be sought for the purpose of operating late entry premium loadings. The provision of information will not extend to claims or medical records. The section provides for the Minister to prescribe the arrangements for such disclosure between insurers.</P>
    <P>Section 8 substitutes section 8 of the 1994 Act which concerns access to health insurance cover on an open enrolment basis. A significant change is provided for in relation to facilitating the provision of cover to persons aged 65 and over who had not previously taken out community-rated insurance. Heretofore, insurers were not obliged to sell cover to persons aged 65 and over who were not already enrolled with another insurer. The section maintains the original provisions relating to the capacity of insurers to impose waiting periods, the operation of which is subject to regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the Minister to prescribe waiting periods for eligibility for cover under a health insurance contract. Open enrolment regulations were made pursuant to the 1994 Act, and these prescribe maximum permitted waiting periods for payment of benefits in certain circumstances, including where a person joins for the first time and where a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Subsection (5) maintains the existing statutory arrangements which protect individuals from having to re-serve waiting periods on changing insurers, where no significant lapse in cover has occurred.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that the protection for individuals against re-serving waiting periods on transferring between insurers shall not apply in the case of members of restricted membership undertakings which have decided not to participate in risk equalisation. An exception to this measure will apply where the person transferring is under 23 years of age. This will safeguard the position of dependants of members of such restricted membership undertakings, who, under their rules, can no longer be covered on attaining a certain age.</P>
    <P>Section 9 substitutes section 12 of the 1994 Act which provides for risk equalisation arrangements <Col N="46" /> between insurers. The main changes from the provisions made under the 1994 Act are as follows; restricted membership undertakings to have an option in regard to participation in risk equalisation; the Health Insurance Authority to have a key role in determining the timing of the commencement of risk equalisation in the overall best interests of consumers; arrangements for the making of representations to the authority or the Minister in relation to the commencement of risk equalisation; and new entrants to the market to have the option of availing of a three year exemption from risk equalisation transfers between insurance undertakings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides for the Minister to prescribe a scheme of risk equalisation, which will set out the details relating to the conditions for its commencement and the terms of its operation. Subsection (2) addresses the undertakings to which any risk equalisation scheme will apply. It also provides for the established restricted membership undertakings to exercise a &ldquo;once off&rdquo; choice to be permanently excluded from risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) maintains original provisions relating to arrangements for the making of statutory returns by insurers to the authority. It is the data contained in these returns which will be among the elements central to consideration of the commencement of risk equalisation, on the basis of which the magnitude of any transfers will be determined.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for arrangements relating to the making of payments to the authority by insurance undertakings and the making of payments by the authority to undertakings, by reference to matters to be specified in the scheme. It also provides that the Minister shall determine the day when such arrangements are to have effect. In this regard, the scheme shall require the authority to evaluate and analyse the returns made to it, prepare and furnish reports to the Minister and recommend, where conditions specified in the scheme are fulfilled, whether the Minister ought, or ought not, exercise the power to determine that risk equalisation payments should commence.</P>
    <P>The subsection will enable the statutory scheme to provide that, up to a certain specified level of material instability in the risk profiles of insurers, the Minister may only authorise the commencement of risk equalisation transfers between insurers on foot of a recommendation to that effect from the authority. Beyond the specified level, the Minister shall authorise such commencement unless there are good reasons for not doing so. The subsection provides that the authority and the Minister are obliged to have regard to the best overall interests of health insurance consumers in the exercise of their respective duties.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (5) the authority, in making a recommendation on whether or not risk equal<Col N="47" /> isation ought to be commenced, shall inform each undertaking of its proposed recommendation. Each undertaking will be entitled to make representations concerning the recommendation, and the authority must take account of such representations before deciding the recommendation to be included in its report to the Minister under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) a scheme shall require the Minister to inform registered undertakings of a proposed determination to commence risk equalisation arrangements. Undertakings will be entitled to make representations in relation to why such a determination ought not be made by the Minister and he/she shall take such representations into account before finally deciding whether to make the determination which would commence the process of risk equalisation payments between insurers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) requires registered undertakings, when requested, to provide information or details to the authority relating to returns they have made. It also provides that the Minister is entitled to specify the form of, and particulars to be included in, reports being made by the authority concerning its periodic evaluation and analysis of returns from insurers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) provides that registered undertakings which have made representations, to the authority or the Minister, relating to commencement of risk equalisation shall, when requested, provide information or documentation in support of their representations within a specified time. Subsection (9) maintains the provision relating to the establishment and maintenance of a risk equalisation fund into which insurers would make payments to the authority and from which the authority would make payments to insurers. It also maintains provisions concerning the keeping of accounts relating to this fund by the authority.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) defines a health insurance consumer and insured risks as referred to in the section. It specifies that the best overall interests of consumers includes the need to maintain the application of community rating across the market, as opposed to within the risk pool of individual insurers. It provides that conditions to be set out under a scheme requiring the authority to make a recommendation in relation to commencement of risk equalisation can differ from conditions under which the Minister shall commence risk equalisation. It also provides that these conditions can be expressed by reference to the amounts which would arise for payment, in accordance with the terms of a scheme, on account of the nature and distribution of insured risks among the undertakings. The effect of this subsection is to allow for a scheme to specify different trigger points based on the level of market instability evident from the differing risk profiles of competing insurers, as derived from the <Col N="48" /> analysis of their respective returns to the authority.</P>
    <P>The capacity to set different triggers will enable a scheme to contain a significant degree of discretion within which the commencement of risk equalisation can only occur on foot of a recommendation to that effect from the authority. In the absence of any recommendation from the authority to commence risk equalisation, the development of a higher level of instability will require the Minister to authorise the commencement of risk equalisation unless it appears to him or her that good reasons exist for not doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also inserts a new section 12A in the 1994 Act. This new section enables the authority to disclose aggregate information derived from statutory returns made to it by insurers, but provides that such data related to individual insurers may be disclosed only where necessary for the functions of the authority or the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the need for risk equalisation in a health insurance system such as that which operates in this country and the arrangements envisaged. Our private health insurance system operates under the widely accepted principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. Generally, this means that insurers must accept all comers, irrespective of their age or health status, and charge them a standard premium for a given level of cover. The system is built on the trust and confidence of consumers in the effective operation of community rating going forward. This is manifested in their willingness to pay into community rating when younger and healthier on the basis that when they are older and ill they will be supported by the same cross-community solidarity on the part of all subscribers.</P>
    <P>Under this system, there is a serious danger that the market could be destabilised if significant variations emerge in risk profiles of competing insurers. For example, if some insurers, by accident of design, end up with a younger/healthier population they will be able to charge a lower premium or take a higher profit. The other side of the coin is that premiums will rise inevitably for those consumers who happen to be with an insurer which covers a higher proportion of less healthy individuals.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation is the mechanism which will counteract the very real potential for destabilisation to occur in a competitive insurance system operating to the principles of community rating and open enrolment. Risk equalisation simply aims to equalise differences in health insurers costs that arise due to significant variations in their risk profiles. The need for risk equalisation in a private health insurance system such as ours is supported by a wide range of national and international expert opinion and experience.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 9 of the Bill is to enable implementation of significant changes in the arrangements for risk equalisation as originally <Col N="49" /> envisaged under the 1994 Act with a view to addressing concerns about its commencement and impact. The characteristics of the arrangements relating to the commencement of risk equalisation will involve major discretion on the part of the independent Health Insurance Authority. Risk equalisation will commence only where material distortion has emerged in the risk profiles of insurers. The authority is required to be satisfied to recommend commencement of risk equalisation in the best interests of health insurance consumers and it must facilitate competition. There will be no recourse to an unnecessary commencement of risk equalisation. Furthermore, there is no question of full equalisation of claims experience as the authority will have significant scope in determining the basis for the calculation of any transfers under a scheme and insurers will retain their own unit claims cost efficiency.</P>
    <P>Under successive Ministers, my Department has liaised with the relevant EU Commission services regarding plans to regulate private health insurance. The Department widely publicised and explained its plans to regulate and protect community rating in the competitive market. Whether health systems are voluntary or compulsory, the incentives for and consequences of risk selection are significant and need to be addressed. This may be represented as an imagined rather than a real threat. Risk selection in the absence of effective risk equalisation has contributed to instability in other systems, most recently in the case of a German insurer.</P>
    <P>Arguments about the inequity of one insurer paying funds to another are not valid as payments under risk equalisation constitute transfers from young and healthy to the old and unhealthy who are part of the same community of risk under our system. Such payments represent a redistribution of excess profits arising from better risks and they support the normal operation of community rating. The sole purpose of risk equalisation transfers is the maintenance of effective community rating across the insured population as a whole.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows insurers entering the market to avail of an exemption from risk equalisation, lasting three years from the date of the commencement of health insurance business. The entry of additional insurers to the market has the potential to yield benefits to consumers in terms of competition, insured benefits available and price. To achieve such enhanced competition, it is necessary to give practical recognition to the fact that a new entrant to the health insurance sector faces initial marketing, development and operational costs if it is to compete with the two major insurers and establish itself with a reasonable prospect of sustainability.</P>
    <P>Section 11 obliges the Health Insurance Authority to make specific annual reports in the event of risk equalisation being commenced. The envisaged reports would evaluate the operation of the <Col N="50" /> risk equalisation scheme with respect to its effects on the interests of health insurance consumers. The section provides that reports are to be laid before the Oireachtas. The authority is required under the principal Act to produce annual reports in relation to its activities.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority to treat health insurance undertakings equally in similar circumstances. The section is formulated to ensure the Minister or authority may discharge their respective responsibilities to deal with differences between the circumstances of undertakings which require different treatment under the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with a number of miscellaneous consequential amendments. It also provides that the Minister, before making regulations, must present them in draft form to the Oireachtas to obtain the approval of each House. Pending the introduction of legislation changing the status of VHI, section 14 will allow VHI to engage in new areas of business as a principal or agent. Given VHI's current status, it is appropriate that new schemes should be subject to ministerial approval and to regulatory or other conditions as the Minister deems appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to changing the corporate status of VHI to that of a State-owned limited company, as set out in the White Paper. Preparatory work in that regard includes obtaining corporate finance and legal advice, which is currently in hand.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a standard provision which gives the short title and collective citation and provides for the commencement date or dates to be appointed by ministerial order as considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>As I noted at the outset, reconciling the protection of common good elements of the voluntary private health insurance system with giving full rein to the forces of competition is a challenge. I am satisfied the provisions in this Bill represent a balanced, transparent and fair approach towards achieving that objective. I thank the House for its tolerance of a lengthy and comprehensive account of this complex Bill. I felt it was important to make a thorough statement on this Stage and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is an extremely important and complex Bill, as has been said. It proposes key amendments to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which is obviously a timely move. The changes, however, should be put in the context of our health service and the Government's lack of a major coherent strategy. It is disappointing that the Bill fails to tackle a large number of issues which, if addressed, would contribute to a fair and equitable health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our health system is a two-tier one as those who can afford to pay for the services they need are at the top of waiting lists, while those less for<Col N="51" /> tunate suffer. Despite huge investment in the past few years, the health service contains many injustices and inequalities. My party has put forward its major health policies through Deputy Gay Mitchell. The basis of the policy is the introduction of health insurance for everyone. Senators are aware of the necessity of health insurance and we advocate that rich and poor should have it. Unfortunately, treatment is made available to those who pay for the appropriate medical personnel. Despite the roar of the Celtic tiger, those in pain may have to wait for years to receive hospital care, a situation which should not continue.</P>
    <P>We could look at many different national health systems. In the United States there is an expensive system of voluntary contributions which is out of the reach of many sections of the population. The Minister's speech referred to company health services, but those who cannot avail of such services are isolated. The British NHS is funded from taxation. Compulsory social insurance is common in most EU countries. France is a notable example of this and patients there must be seen within 15 days. If one applies for planning permission for a house, a decision is given within two months, but one may have to wait for two years for an major operation in our health service.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with the introduction of medical cards for everyone over 70, as it highlighted massive inequality within the system. Those who retire with the fruits of huge incomes will qualify for a medical card, while a married couple earning £145 per week are not similarly qualified. Such contradictions must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Two contentious issues central to this Bill are community rating and risk equalisation. The first of these ensures that affordable health care is available to people throughout their lifetimes and that age or previous ill-health will not dictate that more money should be paid for health insurance. Risk equalisation sustains community rating by protecting the stability of the market and by discouraging insurers from cherry-picking young and healthy people. Without risk equalisation the whole community rating system would be liable to collapse and many people would be unable to afford health insurance when they got older.</P>
    <P>There is much concern among elderly people that they will not be able to afford insurance if there were no risk equalisation. If insurers could cherry-pick the market it would be to the detriment of the entire community. Risk equalisation is not an Irish phenomenon. It operates successfully in Australia where over 40 companies compete in a community rated market.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented economic growth and development when the Government is dealing with massive budget surpluses, people find it difficult to comprehend that we do not have an effective health service. The 1999 White Paper on <Col N="52" /> Private Health Insurance set out the reasons risk equalisation is required in a community rated private health insurance market. At that time the Government's view, set out in the White Paper and supported by a wide range of independent experts and interests, was that risk equalisation was essential to underpin and protect the stability of community rating. That cannot be over-emphasised. The White Paper also indicated that to further encourage competition it was proposed that an insurer entering the health insurance market would be given the choice of availing of a temporary exemption from participation in the proposed risk equalisation schemes for a maximum period of 18 months from the commencement of trading. The stated reason for this proposed exemption was the recognition of the value in terms of enhanced competition which new entrants are in a position to bring to customers and an acknowledgement of the start-up costs of new insurers and the administrative and information systems required and placed at risk by risk equalisation on a new insurer.</P>
    <P>The first risk equalisation scheme introduced by the Minister for Health and Children was revoked by him before the White Paper was published and did not provide for any opt-out period. The VHI disputes that a lead-in period of 18 months is necessary for new entrants to the market. Furthermore, it highlights the danger of allowing a longer lead-in period. The VHI submits that there are many ways in which new entrants to the market can gain a competitive advantage other than non-participation in risk equalisation. The VHI has offered its assistance to the Department in relation to other structured ways of encouraging new entrants to enter the market.</P>
    <P>Many potential sources of competitive advantage are completely and essentially unaffected by risk equalisation. These include distribution, customer responsiveness, product innovation, purchasing efficiency and administrative efficiency. It was also the VHI's view that one of the reasons there have been no new entrants to the health insurance market in recent years is the uncertainty which has surrounded the implementation of risk equalisation and that until recently the VHI operated on a break-even basis only rather than because it was proposed that risk equalisation would be introduced.</P>
    <P>I note that much of the responsibility on decisions on risk equalisation rests with the Minister. I am not sure that this is a good idea. I acknowledge the work done by BUPA since it entered the market. It introduced badly needed competition. The VHI has increased the number of people using private health insurance from 46% to 47% of the population. It is good for consumers to have an alternative which can match the products already on offer from the VHI.</P>
    <P>Although I am a member of the VHI, I have considerable knowledge of BUPA. My son <Col N="53" /> worked for BUPA for a year or two in Cork and I was familiar with the goings on in that company for a while. Its product was similar to what the VHI had on offer and the Government was determined that there would be a package of comprehensive benefits available. BUPA helped to increase the market dramatically by offering a package of comprehensive minimum benefits. Its essential contribution to the health service was that it created competition in a market which was fairly limited prior to its entry to it.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive and complex Bill. If I have a reservation it is that the Minister's decision-making powers will be too much to the fore when this legislation becomes operative. It is not good that the discretion of the Minister will be involved at every twist and turn of the operation of this legislation, which is the message coming across in at least part of this Bill. While appreciating the necessity for it, there are major issues that have to be tackled in the health care area. As a Senator from the west, I know that people are dissatisfied with the service that is available. They view the situation in the context of current Exchequer surpluses and the fact that these are not being translated into an effective health service for all our people. This is not strictly relevant to the Bill under discussion, but is uppermost in the minds of most people.</P>
    <P>With the reservations I have stated, I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill. It can do nothing but improve the situation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because private medicine and private health care, while much is said nowadays about them, play a pivotal role in the delivery of a good health service. About 45% of the population avails of private health insurance which historically has centred on the provision of cover for hospital in-patient services.</P>
      <P>The VHI was established in 1957 to provide cover for a proportion, then about 15%, of the population who had no entitlement to public health hospital services. It now provides cover for nearly 40% of the population or 1.5 million. Under the 1957 Act, the Minister had the power to license other insurers to operate in the market. Consequently the VHI operated as a statutory monopoly prior to the introduction of the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the licensing of a number of relatively small restricted membership undertakings <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Garda, prison officers and the ESB, the VHI has, since 1997, been engaged in competition with BUPA Ireland, a branch of Britain's health insurer, the British United Provident Association. BUPA Ireland is understood to cover in excess of 200,000 persons under the schemes it offers. The Health Insurance Act, 1994, enacted in the interests of the common good, provides for significant safeguards for insured persons in the context of the opening of the health insurance market to competition in <Col N="54" /> accordance with EU obligations under the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The health insurance regulatory framework comprises the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the Health Insurance Regulations, 1996. The White Paper on Health Insurance, published in September 1999, proposed significant changes to this framework aimed at enhancing competition in the market while fully preserving the common good aspects of the framework. It sets out fundamental policy objectives regarding the role of private health insurance in the overall health care system, the regulation of the private health insurance market and the corporate structure and status of the VHI board. This Bill, published in June 2000, will amend and extend the 1994 Act in addressing the regulatory issues dealt with in the White Paper. It is intended to deal with the VHI's future corporate status, which will be brought forward following full consideration of the market.</P>
    <P>My good friend and colleague, Senator Caffrey, does not agree with the introduction of medical cards for those over the age of 70 years. It is important that those who have built this State and society should be recognised. It is also important to recognise that health care is more important and pertinent to people in that age group. It is axiomatic that they should be the beneficiaries under the general medical services scheme.</P>
    <P>I also disagree with Senator Caffrey's views on cover for families on middle incomes. Medical cards are provided on the basis of income. As a member of a health board for over 20 years I can testify that in almost all cases where it can be proven there is financial hardship the appeals officers will take due cognisance and approve the provision of a medical card. A personal card can also be awarded to individuals within the family.</P>
    <P>With regard to the regulatory framework, the 1994 Act enshrines the principle of community rating whereby the same premium is charged for a specified level of cover regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation or the recurrent or prospective health status of the insured person. Open enrolment requires health insurers to accept all individuals under the age of 65 years who wish to enrol in any health insurance scheme and insurers cannot refuse to renew a contract for any member, except in certain prescribed circumstances. Under the Act, insurers offering cover for hospital in-patient services are required to provide a minimum level of cover across a range of services, including general hospitals, out-patient and maternity benefits, convalescence, psychiatric treatment, substance abuse and day care.</P>
    <P>Under the 1994 Act all insurers offering health insurance to the public must be prepared to participate in a risk equalisation scheme. This is an essential feature of a competitive market which operates under the principles of community rating and open enrolment. Risk equalisation provides for the equitable distribution of risk <Col N="55" /> between insurers. That is very important. It is a corner stone of any good private health insurance.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for risk equalisation allow each insurer to retain its own efficiencies in terms of claims, management, cost containment and so on. In a market where open enrolment operates and where premiums are community rated, insurers who are successful at gaining young lives, or who engage in cherry picking, can charge a lower community rate or keep a higher profit margin, which is what private business is all about. Younger lives would transfer to the insurer offering the lower community rate, eventually forcing the established insurer out of business. The cycle could be repeated. That would not be healthy and such developments would cause significant instability in the health insurance market.</P>
    <P>Revised risk equalisation arrangements will be introduced by regulation following the enactment of this Bill. Under the Bill the Health Insurance Authority will be given significant discretion in advising the Minister when risk equalisation transfers should commence. The exercise of this discretion will arise within a range of criteria to be specified in regulations and will give the authority a pivotal role in determining whether or not risk equalisation transfers are warranted without having regard to market circumstances. However, once a certain level of instability is reached, the regulation will specify that unless he or she has good reason for not doing so, the Minister shall determine that transfers should commence. Again I disagree with my colleague, Senator Caffrey, on this aspect. Nothing could be more open or transparent than the democratically elected Minister of any Government taking these decisions. It is consistent with democracy.</P>
    <P>The approach taken to risk equalisation is flexible and allows for it to be implemented as a reserve power, that is, where it is considered to be absolutely warranted by reference to the circumstances in the market and in the best interest of consumers in ensuring effective community rating across the market. Community rating and risk equalisation are like a horse and carriage; they go together.</P>
    <P>The Department has at all times liaised fully with the relevant EU authorities regarding its proposals. Under the proposed arrangements there is no question of full equalisation of claims experience. Insurers are to retain their own unit claim costs and will not be liable to share more than 50% of market utilisation experience.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions which will strengthen community rating by providing a framework which will encourage people to take out insurance at a younger age through allowing insurers the discretion to apply loading on people who do not do so until they are older or who have missed contributions to the market while younger <Col N="56" /> and healthier. It means that those who have not taken responsibility for their health care will be penalised. We should all be responsible for our health and for taking proactive decisions on health care. This measure will ensure that people will make contributions to their health care at an earlier age which will make for good practice.</P>
    <P>The measure will not affect persons who are currently insured other than in situations where they move to an insurance plan offering higher levels of cover. In such situations a loading is to be permitted only on the additional cover taken out. I commend the Minister on this. It is only fair and equitable to provide for those who wish to change the scope of their insurance cover. The Bill also provides for further explanation and information concerning risk equalisation and lifetime community rating measures.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Health Insurance Authority by the Minister on 1 February 2001 is another significant measure. The membership of the authority is a matter of public record. The authority will have a central and independent role to play in the operation and development of the country's private health insurance market. The Bill also provides that the Minister can give the authority significant powers regarding the operation of risk equalisation between health insurers. The Minister will be the arbiter and that is important. The assignment of further responsibility to the authority as provided for in the 1994 Act and referred to in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance will be addressed by the Minister in consultation with the authority. Under the legislation, the cost of sustaining the ongoing operation of the authority will be met from the proceeds of a levy on registered insurers.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Minister pertaining to the voluntary health insurance board and its functions are set out in the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 to 1998. The future status of the board is currently being addressed. As stated in the White Paper, the VHI will be converted to a public limited company owned by the State with provision for third party investment or a full sale if deemed desirable or necessary. As set out in the White Paper, financial and legal advisers, Davy's and William Fry, have been engaged to assist in this process.</P>
    <P>The board, in its current capacity, is exempt under the EU non-life insurance directives from the prudential and other requirements normally applicable to insurance undertakings. The board's reserves of over £100 million, although they do not exceed the EU minimum solvency levels of £72.2 million, are insufficient to meet the commercial solvency standard of 200% applied for the purpose of granting authorisation as an insurer by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment within the meaning of the European Union's non-life insurance framework regulations. In the White Paper, the Government stated it would arrange for a once off financial <Col N="57" /> injection to facilitate the restructuring of the VHI.</P>
    <P>The Bill's measures are important. The Minister said everything in his statement and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. He should not apologise for his speech because it was a model of clarity. I am delighted that executives from the VHI and BUPA are in the public gallery and heard how seriously the issue was addressed by the Department.</P>
      <P>This is a most important matter and the introduction of effective risk equalisation is the only way affordable health insurance will be possible. The community solidarity that existed in Ireland through risk equalisation between generations has been extraordinarily important. Any of us who are aware of situations in other countries, such as the United States and Germany where this did not prevail, know it was a great problem for those who were insured and who lost the ability to pay for insurance at the time they most needed it. It was also a problem for the insurance companies which did not want risk equalisation. The Minister has got it right and I welcome the Bill. The Minister will work out the details of the risk equalisation and we must trust him with that task.</P>
      <P>The Bill is fair to insurance companies by allowing a three year period before a new company can enter the market. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it removes what I describe as frills. It deals with the core of health insurance where risk equalisation applies. Dental and optical treatment or getting money if one is out of work are additional benefits and they will not be affected by the Bill. I wonder if the Minister could also include the hotel accommodation aspect. People do not appear to understand that an enormous amount of the health insurance premia for the higher categories relates to what I describe as hotel accommodation. However, the Minister has struck the right balance.</P>
      <P>People occasionally say to me that they have never claimed and they should get a rebate. However, I tell them they should be glad that it has not been necessary for them to claim. It would be terrific if one had insurance for 30 years and never had to claim. That would not be bad and I wish I could say the same. However, the Minister has made a big improvement in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could quibble about whether health insurance is now voluntary or almost obligatory. I do not blame it all on the Minister, but 30 years of neglect in terms of financing the health service has created a bad mess. This is one of the reasons there is such a high number of people in the private health insurance sector. It is extraordinary that almost 50% of the population has private insurance and this takes away from the benefits of having private health care. One was supposed to have easy and immediate access if one needed <Col N="58" /> it, but people in the public health service who complain about how long it takes to get an appointment to see a specialist at a hospital or to have an operation should check what is happening in the private health service because the queues there are also long.</P>
    <P>When I knew the Bill was coming up, I took the opportunity to find out if consultants had appointments for mythical patients that I would refer to them. However, no gynaecologist had an available appointment within two months. I said I had a patient with acute arthritis of the knee, but the earliest appointment to see an orthopaedic surgeon was four months. It was much the same story regarding ophthalmologists and if one had a rash, it would have consumed one entirely before one got to see a dermatologist. The position with regard to back pain is almost impossible in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem because, over the years, a sufficient number of consultants was not appointed to deal with a population that is now demanding first class health care. It is unfortunate but that is the position at present. Regarding the cancellation of operations, I am aware of people in the private sector who need hip and knee replacements, but their operations have been repeatedly cancelled. It is worth noting that it is not only happening in the public sector. However, one marvellous aspect &ndash; the Minister should grapple them to his heart with hoops of steel &ndash; is the availability of family doctors. Public and private patients do not have to wait very long to see them and that is extraordinarily important. The gatekeepers of the system are in a position to see patients and say that something is wrong with him or her.</P>
    <P>However, an unfortunate aspect at present is that people are being sent to accident and emergency centres to try to ensure they are referred to hospitals. From both the public and private perspectives, it would be good if family doctors had more access to X-ray facilities, physiotherapy services etc. This would cut down on the number of referrals to hospital specialists and it would be a great saving for private health insurers. They allow payments to family doctors for certain items and perhaps this could be extended to other facilities in hospitals. However, facilities are so pressurised at present that there is a tremendous reluctance among those working in hospitals to allow access to those who work outside hospitals.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to an oncologist who mentioned the length of time he must keep people in hospital to ensure they have CAT scans, given the length of the queues for such scans. This is enormously wasteful of money and an undesirable consequence for the health of the patient. We are all distraught when the treatment of people with cancer and other acute illnesses is delayed. This is the priority area that must be addressed at present. However, an improvement in the facilities available to family doctors within <Col N="59" /> hospitals would ensure a great financial saving to the public and private systems. It would also be extraordinarily important for patients.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Patrick Plunkett resigned from the board of St. James's Hospital because of the conditions in the accident and emergency department, I visited the department and it was appalling to see two or three people with cardiac failure lying on trolleys. Some had been there for hours and had blue faces, hands and legs. They were on drips and it was terrible that those patients were not transferred immediately to hospital beds. There is also the worrying sight of people waiting hours and if their family doctors had access to x-ray facilities they would not have to be there at all. I hope the Minister will regard this as one of the priorities for his Department.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the extension of hours of opening of the specialist clinics attached to hospitals. This would cost a great deal of money because the nursing staff, secretarial staff, porters and administrators, as well as the consultants, must all be paid to staff the clinics. While I am sure that to a business person it sounds like the ideal solution, the costs involved would be extraordinarily high.</P>
    <P>Competition between health insurers is a good thing because a single operator can become complacent. I am a plan A/B person myself and I am always fascinated by people who pay really high prices just to have hotel-quality accommodation. The clinical care will be the same for everyone, and that should be emphasised. A public patient in a hospital will receive the same clinical care.</P>
    <P>I am constantly told by my colleagues of the terrible delays caused by the failure to upgrade equipment, much of which dates from the early 1990s and is now obsolete or just worn out. The Minister knows only too well that replacement costs were not factored in and those costs have to be covered now. I hope that future health programmes will include the cost of replacement so that hospitals are not trying to work with bits of radiotherapy equipment which are only fit to be museum pieces and not fit to be used on patients, public or private. The upgrading of services is very important. Breakdown of equipment means that patients are waiting longer. There should be better co-ordination of tests. Private hospitals make more of an effort in this regard and that policy could be extended to the public hospital service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister's friend and perhaps co-operative colleague, introduced tax relief for the building of private hospitals in the last Finance Bill. This was very odd and shows that he has settled on the idea of the separation of the public and private hospital services. I would not be too enthusiastic about that, having seen both systems in operation. The mix ensures that the level of service is raised for all patients. For example, the consultants are then tied to the <Col N="60" /> hospitals and this is preferable to having them crossing the city to another establishment.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals for this tax relief measure was that these private hospitals should have accident and emergency departments. I wonder if the Minister is aware of the cost of setting up and staffing an accident and emergency facility. The cost is astronomic and we certainly do not want to see Mickey Mouse accident and emergency services set up. If people are not in need of proper accident and emergency facilities, then they should be seen by their family doctor. It would be better to supply facilities for family doctors to improve their establishments so that they could undertake more in the way of treatment than is possible at present.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on how children are treated. It is very important to explain to people that when it comes down to brass tacks and children are seriously ill, consultants do not have public and private lists. In the case of cochlear transplants, no child can be a private patient because all the children are assessed in terms of medical need. The same applies for paediatric cardiac cases. All the consultants weep about is that they cannot treat all those who need urgent treatment. As a result, the Minister and his Department have been involved in the transfer of children to other jurisdictions. Our main problem is not the lack of cardiac consultants to do the operations but rather the shortage of nurses for nursing care in the intensive care units. I am aware that the Minister knows this all too well.</P>
    <P>It is important in talking about private and public health care for children that we acknowledge there will be a difference in the treatment of children for problems with tonsils and adenoids. Orthodontic treatment will be totally different. As far as I can see, buck teeth will never be straightened out in the public system at the moment. Parents should be assured that when it comes down to brass tacks their children will be looked after in both systems.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of tabling an amendment to section 5 of the Bill. This is the section which obliges the insurer to offer premia on an equal basis on the grounds of age, sex and sexual orientation. I suggest a proposal for genetic profile. I know that the Cathaoirleach is aware of my requests that we do something by way of legislation regarding genetics. I may suggest that on Committee Stage. We in Ireland are in the forefront of genetics and there is no legislation on the subject.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the Bill. It is, as he said, very complex legislation. It is no small challenge to seek, on the one hand, to create the conditions where we can have good healthy competition which is essential for the well-being of the consumer and, at the same time, to sustain <Col N="61" /> the principle of community rating which is the bedrock of our policy of looking after people in need of health care. It is very challenging legislation which has been discussed at great length in the other House on Committee and Report Stages. A good deal of discussion went into its formulation before it came here. As a result, we have a Bill that is more fine-tuned to the realities of the market in which insurers operate. It is critically important that the regulations that derive from this Bill should be subject to very rigorous examination and scrutiny at regular intervals to ensure that the basic objectives of this Bill will be met and met in their entirety.</P>
      <P>The essential part of the challenge that I refer to is how well regulated competition can be entertained on the one hand and how we look after the community rating on the other hand. The great strength of this Government is the courage with which it has introduced competition into so many areas of the economy, as a result of which we have a much more vibrant and promising economy now than in the olden days. My party is very committed to the promotion of competition in every element of society, including the health insurance area. The primacy of the consumer is paramount and if this is not so when we are talking about people's health needs, then what else is more important? This issue must always be approached from the viewpoint of the primacy of the consumer. What is good for the consumer in terms of health insurance is what we should be aiming to achieve. There is no doubt that in health insurance, as in so many other areas, competition is very good.  </P>
      <P>I am one of those who was born into the VHI. I am of a VHI family. It is like being born into Fianna Fáil, one's parents were in it so the youngsters were reared on it. It is the same with the VHI. I am aware of the difficulties and challenges for a small operator in breaking into an area that is well established and has wide and deep roots. I was supportive and welcoming of the entry of BUPA to the market. That was to the benefit of the community at large. I salute the courage of BUPA in being the first to break into what was a restrictive and monopolistic culture in the area of health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More competition was needed as an essential step in addressing the rapid rise in health service costs. For example, in the public health sector the health bill has risen by more than 50% in the past three years. Given those escalating costs, it is more essential than ever to have good and healthy competition in the market. It is critically important that a modern confident Ireland would seek to reap the benefits of deregulation in the health insurance market. The greatest outcome of deregulation is that it brings with it alternatives, alternative producers and new products. As a result there are benefits all round, particularly for the existing established companies in that they are challenged to seek out new measures and to <Col N="62" /> become more consumer friendly and they are prevented from becoming stagnant. I am not saying the VHI has become stagnant but it happens to the best of us. Competition is good and anything that promotes it has to be regulated and supported. Anything that inhibits it has to be critically examined to see whether it can be removed.</P>
    <P>I seem to be the odd person out in the debate this evening but I am concerned about the risk equalisation payments as they will be applied to BUPA. The VHI has 88% of the market. BUPA broke into the market in 1996 and has 12% of the market. It seems wrong and anti-competitive that a company that is seeking to break into an established market would be required to pay the equivalent of about one third of its annual profits to the established company. That seems anti-competitive and I would welcome the Minister's response. I am slow to quote figures because BUPA has not published its figures. I wish it would do so because then we could approach this argument with definite facts and figures at our disposal. It seems wrong that a newcomer on the market is required to pay that amount to a well established company supported by a number of us who have been insured for a long time.</P>
    <P>The principle of community rating and open enrolment are established in the 1994 Act and are safeguarded within the Act. That should be taken into consideration. There is no instability in the market and I see no evidence of upcoming instability. Both companies are making profits and as a result the market is expanding. That more people are taking out private insurance is a welcome outcome. These are the factors that apply. It is important that a mechanism be in place with risk equalisation as its aim. That should only be invoked if there is evidence of instability. I do not think it should ever be used as a factor to put road blocks in the way of what is good and healthy competition. It is a mechanism that ought to be put in place but is inappropriate in current conditions. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that issue as it is not in the best interests of consumers in the long term to inhibit good regulated healthy competition. I see no evidence of instability in the market and both companies are growing and making profits. I am pleased about that because that is what keeps them. That is the oil that keeps the wheels running.</P>
    <P>A health insurance authority is being put in place as a regulatory body to regulate the scheme that will be put in place by the Government. I have no difficulty with that. However, I am concerned about the composition of that body. There is a fear that it will be top heavy with mathematicians, actuaries, statisticians and such people and that there is not a sufficiency of people who have expertise in the insurance market. Insurance has its own trade and its own culture. That is something I would like to guard against. It may be that I have a severe hangover these days from <Col N="63" /> the machinations of a certain commission that was at arm's length from active politicians who put on a campaign that was totally non-productive. I may not be in the best mood today to talk about these bodies which we set up and which are at arm's length from politicians who have to make decisions and have to be accountable for the outcome of their decisions. It is important that the people on the body understand the insurance trade.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked earlier why young people should take out insurance for illnesses which, I hope, they will not have until much later. There is the whole principle of insurance. We all take out car insurance and pay it on an annual basis. We pay it but I hope we will never have a car accident and will not have to draw it down. Nevertheless, we are prepared to take out insurance to cover for eventualities that may occur during our driving lifetime. Equally we insure our houses in case a fire breaks out, but in 99% of cases that insurance is not drawn down. That is the nature of insurance.</P>
    <P>I would like to see companies aggressively seeking new clients and the Government giving tax-based incentives to young people in particular to encourage them to take out private cover. That is important. I understand that the regulations will be subject to approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas. At least the regulations will be put in place and monitored by people who have to answer to the public.</P>
    <P>In regard to private companies, we can only advise them on what we think would be good things to do. There is a good extension of cover now. In the olden days if one wanted to get cover one had to stay overnight in a hospital. Nowadays one can get cover if one goes in as a day care patient for investigation, tests etc. That is a good idea.</P>
    <P>I ask insurance companies to consider extending insurance cover to more non-hospital medical procedures. That would be a very good input on the part of insurers towards the health service. It would strengthen the health provision in the community including GPs, public health nurses, etc. That can be put in place in the community to serve the needs of a number of people who could be kept out of hospitals if that were in place.</P>
    <P>There are other simple things also. I know somebody who had hip replacement surgery a few years ago. When they phoned the insurance company to ask about the after care provision, they were told they could go to a convalescent home for two weeks which would cost £700. The person had a preference to go home but had some basic needs such as home help. It would cost about £5 per day to have a person come in, put on the elastic stocking, give the crutch and let the patient go off for a walk. However, the insurance company could not cover that at all. <Col N="64" /> Because provisions like that were not made, people were going into convalescent homes who did not need to be there. We need to develop new products and these will come if there is significant good competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not allow people who have a very conservative view on how the health services should be delivered and how health services should be arranged to facilitate that delivery to dominate this debate. He should think about healthy competition as being good. We have the capacity to introduce regulations which will ensure that people in need, who are most vulnerable, will not suffer as a result of what is in this Bill. He must not allow excessive demands on new companies, trying to break into the market, to stifle competition because it will not be good for consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their interesting contributions. No doubt we can go into many of the issues in more detail on Committee Stage. I accept Senator Caffrey's general support for the concept of risk equalisation. He made a number of references to health policy and issues generally, which I will leave to another day. I have ably dealt with these in the other House and here and they are not the subject matter of this Bill, which deals with the regulation of the health insurance market.</P>
      <P>He is of the view that many of the decisions on the implementation of risk equalisation rest with the Minister. In fact much of the work and many of the decisions rest with the new health insurance authority that I have established under the primary Act. It will take many of the decisions on risk equalisation and will advise the Minister on triggering the risk equalisation mechanism. Having analysed the data from the insurance companies, it will have to form an opinion whether there was a significant distortion of the risk profiles that constitute a threat to the stability of the market and make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>A scheme showing how risk equalisation might work was outlined on the Committee Stage of the other House. That will form part of the draft regulations that will have to come back to this House in the autumn. I intend to have this Bill through before the summer recess and come back with draft regulations for the implementation of the Bill, which will cover a framework to facilitate the introduction of risk equalisation if that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entrants to the marketplace were clear that risk equalisation was part of the agenda. It was provided for in the 1994 Act as a clear mechanism to underpin community rating. This Bill is designed to provide for risk equalisation and also to facilitate competition. On Committee Stage I might bring examples of how authorities in other insurance markets still consider risk equalisation <Col N="65" /> an important feature of the kind of system that we have.</P>
    <P>The Bill broadens the range of products the insurance companies can provide to cover general practitioner services, etc. That is provided for in the definition of an insurance contract.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry broadly welcomed the Bill and I appreciate her support. I note her comment that the private waiting list is also growing. We have some distance to go in terms of capacity in our acute hospitals system. There is a strong connection between the public and the private systems. About 2,500 beds in our public hospitals are reserved for private patients and there are a further 1,800 beds in the private sector. That interplay is coming into focus under the health strategy. Public patients are not getting a fair deal at the moment and we are looking at the public-private mix to get a better deal for them.</P>
    <P>Overriding all that are capacity issues in terms of beds and manpower. There is an argument that we are not using all our institutions to the maximum extent. Some of the more elective hospitals have nine to five routines with nothing happening at weekends and we could make greater use of those facilities. We have commenced talking with the relevant bodies about the renegotiation of the consultant contract, which is fundamental, and about setting up the framework and mechanisms to implement the recommendations of the manpower forum. A national task force is to be established to go through all the implications, to quantify the cost and to work out the models of how it would work in different types of hospitals in rural and urban environments. Much work needs to be undertaken on that.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act introduced tax relief for private hospitals and this will help capacity somewhat. I have no difficulty with the public sector contracting in from the private sector either, especially to complete additional elective procedures. However, under the national development plan, we are committed to very significant investment in public hospital capacity. In time that will alleviate waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The classic example is the cardiac facility that we put into St. James's Hospital. Having put in a substantial investment in human resources and in facilities, we got a huge hit on the waiting list for cardiac bypasses, etc. We have halved the waiting list for cardiac bypasses in the last 15 months. This is a clear result of an investment in extra capacity in the system. When the cardiac facility in Galway comes on stream, that will have a further step change effect on waiting lists. There are also further developments in the Cork unit which will lead to a strong regionalised service, north, south and west that will take pressure of the Dublin hospitals where many of these procedures are for people from outside the region.</P>
    <P>Some 20% of the waiting list relates to ENT, many of which are very minor and none of which <Col N="66" /> is life saving. Although we have allocated increased resources to orthopaedics, waiting lists remain stubbornly high.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Glynn's endorsement of the Bill and his support for the extension of the medical card to over 70s, which is important in terms of the status we accord our elderly people. Senator Quill touched on the nub of the debate in terms of reconciling the respective agendas of competition and community rating. Parts of the Bill are very much concerned with facilitating competition, including that provision which allows for a three year &ldquo;window&rdquo; whereby a new company entering this market will have an option to stay out of risk equalisation for three years. The original provision in the White Paper was for an 18 month period. This provision may have a more telling impact on the level of competition in the market than risk equalisation. It was interesting to hear that view being articulated during some of our contacts and discussions with people who might be interested in coming into the market.</P>
    <P>Risk equalisation will only be applied when we have all the data which is not currently available but which, under the provisions of the Bill, will be compiled by the Health Insurance Authority. It will only be applied when stability is an issue. An important judgment has to be made in that regard. We cannot wait until instability has occurred because at that stage confidence would have flown out of the market and we would be in trouble. We cannot have a band-aid approach, hoping that an emergency can be dealt with. Once the public loses confidence in the system, it may be too late to enter the marketplace. This can happen very quickly if the risk profiles differ fairly dramatically over a two or three year period, resulting in a lop-sided situation if there is no corrective action.</P>
    <P>We are trying to put in place a system which is flexible enough, which is not punitive, which facilitates competition and which is in the overall interest of the consumer, this being an over-arching principle enshrined in the Bill. The system is intended to deal, in time, with any destabilising impact which cherry-picking, or different risk profiles, could have on the market. That, in essence, is what we are attempting to achieve in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I note the comments which were made about the composition of the Health Insurance Authority. That aspect has not been raised in representations which I have received. Perhaps some of the people making representations were more blunt with Members of the House than they were with me in that respect. There are some consumer representatives and some professional experts. I believe it is important that they should keep some distance from the market in such a relatively small country as this.</P>
