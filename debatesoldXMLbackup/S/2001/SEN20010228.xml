      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mary Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that a verification protocol is added to the United Nations Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, 1975, when this topic is discussed next at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Takeover Panel Act, 1997 (Relevant Company) Regulations, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the Irish language to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the founding in Mullingar of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in 1951 and its vision for the 21st century, the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time, to conclude no later than 2 p.m.; No. 3, statements on EU beef proposals and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes, to conclude at 6 p.m.; No. 4, Central Bank (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m and No. 3 to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded. Business is to be interrupted from 2 p.m. to 2.45 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the situation which arose in the House yesterday when secretarial staff were on strike. This was a cause of great inconvenience to all Members and I think most would agree that the staff have a serious grievance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised in the House and referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The committee considered it and took the action it considered appropriate. At this stage I feel it is not in the interests of Members or staff that we go into the difficulty which has arisen. I hope the Senator will accept my advice in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant to come into conflict with the Chair and I take the advice. I would welcome a statement by the Leader as it was a matter of great inconvenience.</P>
      <P>Recently in the media, particularly in RTÉ, there was a series of articles relating to people held in slavery and bondage. There is a form of slavery here too which is the domestic slavery of people who work in servitude. They work for wages well below what is provided for in our labour and employment laws. This is an issue I have raised at the Council of Europe but as it is a domestic issue it is something we ought to debate. It is something hidden that should be brought out into the open and this is the appropriate place to ventilate the issue. I ask the Leader of the House to provide time in the coming weeks for debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>An issue raised in this morning's papers which should not go unremarked is that at a time when politicians are getting seriously bad press a Minister of State returned a gift to the value of more than £1 million. It reflects well on the Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, and on politics as a whole. It is good that such positive things should be remarked on. I do not wish to go into his personal affairs.</P>
      <P>It raises the question of how we might give a better image to public representation. I have made the point many times. It is when we are not in trouble and not in the mire that we should put in place structures to deal with individuals or names before us. We should reopen that debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, for his response to the gift offered to him. I point out to Senator O'Toole that the best way to deal with any suspicion of politicians not behaving properly is under legislation and we have the Electoral Bill before us. To my mind it will be very detrimental to the good name of politicians.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the hardship being experienced by the elderly in the context of the present Arctic spell we are experiencing? The Minister has refused Dublin Corporation the £14 million necessary to provide central heating for all of its housing stock. The elderly are the people who will particularly suffer in this regard. There should be a nationwide scheme of central heating for all&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not anticipate the debate he is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely explaining that £14 million would provide central heating in the entire local authority area. I do not know what the situation is in other authorities but this has been denied by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the grounds that it is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Chair would not want us to anticipate the debate on foot and mouth disease but it is appropriate to congratulate the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union on the responsible approach they have taken to the crisis. I was very impressed by Mr. Philip Brown of the IRFU yesterday evening when he said that rugby matches were of secondary importance to the national welfare. The IRFU and the Welsh Rugby Union must be congratulated on the action they have taken. The Irish Horseracing Authority has displayed an equally responsible attitude in statements it has issued. I hope the Cheltenham festival will be able to proceed, but the authority again underlined in its statements that the national economic interest must come first.</P>
      <P>There was a further worrying development yesterday &ndash; I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has taken action in respect of it &ndash; namely, that the French, in particular, have indicated a desire to see the renationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy. That would be hugely detrimental, not only for the European Union but also for this country in particular. It would be a matter of great concern if it was decided that countries should unilaterally support their own agriculture industries because the Common Agricultural Policy has been one of the great successes of the European Union. Perhaps we can discuss these issues in more detail in this afternoon's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's comments about the IRFU, the Welsh Rugby Union and the Irish Horseracing Authority. I do not want to pre-empt today's debate but, while rugby and horseracing are perceived as sports, it should not be forgotten that the horseracing industry provides a substantial amount of employment. The authority is taking a responsible attitude and it is to be hoped that the delays to or postponement of racing fixtures will not continue for long. We must not forget that people's livelihoods may be affected to a greater or lesser extent by this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that the match at Cardiff has been postponed and that the Cheltenham festival and the match against England next month are in doubt, a common-sense approach must be taken. The Leader should convey to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and any other relevant Ministers or Ministers of State that carriers, hoteliers, travel <Col N="688" /> agents, etc. should take such an approach to dealing with customers. I am not suggesting that they should refund all moneys in full but that, perhaps, they should put in place a voucher system or some form of minimum penalty clause so that everyone can be satisfied. If fixtures are rearranged for a later date, perhaps those who were supposed to attend the original fixture could be given some form of voucher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed some latitude to our spokespersons on rugby and horseracing. I ask other Members to reserve further comments on these matters for this afternoon's debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy, particularly in terms of the debate taking place in France at present. The Common Agricultural Policy is the central reason that Ireland entered Europe. To revert to a national approach on this matter would have serious implications for this country. I would welcome a debate on this issue. I ask the Leader to convey our views to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and make time available for such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the practices of the National Roads Authority. I seem to have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the recent past. The authority was established on a statutory footing by both Houses of the Oireachtas. It has put in place a practice which has implications for contractors throughout the country and the House should call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to investigate the matter. I refer to cases where contractors who have not been involved in completing projects valued at more than £5 million are excluded from the tender process. This is a serious development because the authority is creating a cartel of large contractors who are being awarded with the contracts for every major road or bridge building project throughout the country. Such behaviour is particularly unhelpful and it will be detrimental to the livelihoods of many smaller contractors.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader communicate with the Minister in respect of this matter and ask him to call on the National Roads Authority to explain why it has put these practices in place? In my opinion county engineers, who are members of the design and project teams in most counties, should also be called on to explain the position because I understand they have played a role in this matter. This is an issue of national importance and the practices to which I refer will have implications for many contractors throughout the country in terms of the project contracts that will be awarded during the remaining five years of the national development plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debated BSE and the threat it poses to public health I pointed out that <Col N="689" /> the Blood Transfusion Service has great difficulty in obtaining supplies and that elective operations have been cancelled in hospitals throughout the country. I understand that representatives of the Blood Transfusion Service are due to come to Leinster House on 12 April. Will the Leader encourage Members and staff to give donations if at all possible? I refer to this matter at such an early date to give people ample time to eat a substantial amount of wholesome Irish beef so that their haemoglobin count will be high when they donate blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in complimenting the actions of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, because in refusing the bequest, which I understand was in the region of £1 million, he has put down a marker for everyone involved in public life. This is a good news story and one of generosity. When we seek debates in the House, they are usually in respect of bad news stories. It would be interesting if, for a change, the Leader agreed to have a debate on this good news story. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has given us the opportunity to engage in such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the local elections, local authority members were applauded by the Government and the Opposition, including the Labour Party, for the great contribution they have made over the years. It was felt that they should be reimbursed for that contribution and that local authority members should be paid a salary. That expectation was established in 1999. The local government Bill was introduced in May 2000 but, to date, in spite of promises to the contrary &ndash; even the Leader gave a commitment that the Bill would have gone through the Lower House or this House by the second week of this month &ndash; it has not been dealt with. The month of February is at an end but the Bill has not appeared. It was on the Order Paper two weeks ago but it has suddenly disappeared. Everyone knows the reason for this. We must resolve this issue and if the Bill cannot be dealt with in the Lower House it should be introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of reports in the national media today that in the order of 34,000 working days were lost yesterday as a result of the Arctic conditions to which Senator Costello referred, will the Leader bring to the attention of the relevant roads authorities, be it the National Roads Authority or local authorities, that it is unacceptable that a fraction of an inch of snow lying on the N7 can bring the entire city to a halt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, in the context of the recent publication of the first survey on the attitudes of members of the Traveller community, it might be appropriate to engage in a debate on the issue of Traveller accommodation, having particular regard to the work of the national and local Travellers' consultative accommodation committees. <Col N="690" /> Will the Leader indicate if the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be contacted in relation to the problem that exists nationally with very large convoys of traders traversing the country, parking illegally, breaking into private properties and causing mayhem in local communities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of the crisis in child care. Since then the report on Newtown House, the health board home where seriously disturbed children were placed under the protection of untrained staff who had no back-up in terms of access to psychological services etc., has been published. I accept that Newtown House has been closed down, but we do not know the extent of the services available to similar institutions in the State. I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need for adequate support services for these homes. These are the most vulnerable children in society and this is very important when one considers the number of suicides in society and in particular the tragic case highlighted in the Newtown House report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello's comments that in weather like this the elderly should have proper heating in their homes. However, this has been recognised by the Government. Last year the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, broadened the scope of the housing aid for the elderly scheme. Millions of pounds are paid to health boards under this scheme and grant aid for central heating is specifically mentioned in the scheme, so it is not fair to say that money is not available. I reiterate my comments last week when I said that hundreds of thousands of pounds paid to health boards under this scheme are not being spent. That money should be diverted to carry out the works suggested by Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's comments on the local government Bill. The Minister made a commitment to everyone who stood for election to local authorities and he has let those people and the whole local authority system down. As Senator Coogan said, if the Minister wants to bring that Bill before the Seanad we would be only too willing to take it here and he should examine that option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should bring the National Roads Authority before the Seanad and find out what its policies are regarding our national routes. Some local authorities can cope with the effect of the adverse weather conditions on the national primary and secondary routes but some cannot. Some authorities have better equipment than others but who is responsible for clearing the national primary and secondary routes? We must examine this question closely as our weather could get <Col N="691" /> worse. The Minister or the NRA should come to the Seanad and outline their policies regarding adverse weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to urge the Minister for Health and Children to amend the Nursing Home Act, 1990, and in particular to establish an independent inspectorate to investigate all matters relating to nursing homes, taking into account the fact that the present inspectorate is under-funded and, in many cases, unavailable because of the other work doctors must do. We should have an integrated plan enabling health boards to work in partnership with nursing homes to provide proper services to the elderly, including physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for this but I propose that No. 2 conclude at 1.30 p.m., when business will be interrupted until 2.15 p.m. No. 3 will be taken then until 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor called for a debate on slave labour and on other matters raised in the media. I can discuss this with the Senator after the Order of Business but there is a shortage of labour and the majority of people are now being paid over the national minimum wage. Low skilled workers were paid very poor wages until two or three years ago and the problem raised by the Senator has been practically eliminated but I will discuss this with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is not the point I was making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello, Ó Murchú and John Cregan all congratulated the Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, on returning the gift he was offered and a debate was sought on the image of public representatives. I have no difficulty allowing time for such a debate and I too wish to be associated with complimenting Deputy Ó Cuív. He started his Oireachtas career as a Senator and he is a hard working, dedicated public representative. I am not surprised by his actions as I have known him for over 30 years and he is a man of high principles. He has done a power of good for the image of Oireachtas Members and public representatives in general.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and John Cregan raised the matter of funds for heating for senior citizens, particularly in the Dublin area, but Senator Cregan pointed out that funds are available for this. I can discuss this further with Senator Costello after the Order of Business and if he still feels a debate is required I will allow time for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis and Cosgrave complimented the IRFU and the Welsh Rugby Union as well as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who has banned all horse and greyhound racing. I also congratulate the Government on appointing a special task force <Col N="692" /> which is to meet daily to ensure we can keep out the plague of foot and mouth. We all remember that in the last century there were seven occasions in 40 years when we had this dreadful plague and the country was completely closed down. The Irish farming community has suffered enough in recent years and it behoves us all to cancel trips to the UK for the next few weeks so that we can play our part. There are now many gardaí at the Border to ensure there is no movement from the North into the Republic and I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Government on their stance yesterday.</P>
    <P>Senators Finneran and Dardis also sought a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy and I will allow time for that. Senator Finneran and others also sought a debate on the National Roads Authority with particular reference to the directives being issued regarding large contracts. These directives bar contractors who have not completed a project worth over £5 million from tendering and I will allow time for a debate on this at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned the blood transfusion unit being here on 12 April and I endorse her sentiments. I hope the unit has enough staff when it visits us, unlike what happens when it visits rural areas. A radio programme highlighted the problem when people in the west were queuing for over two and a half hours because there were not enough staff to deal with them. Irish people have been very generous in donating blood over the years, so it is over to the transfusion service to ensure there are enough staff to accommodate people's generosity.</P>
    <P>Senators Coogan and Burke inquired about the local government Bill. It was published last May and it will be debated in the Dáil next week. We hope it will have passed through the Seanad by Easter, so Senators can spread the good news on the Opposition side.</P>
    <P>Senators Ó Fearghail and Burke sought to have adequate funding put in place for local authorities and mentioned the National Roads Authority. There has been climate change here and in most of Europe and the NRA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government will have to ensure local authorities have enough funding to keep roads usable following slight snowfalls.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we have been experiencing much heavier snowfalls than in Dublin city yesterday and we have to keep going morning, noon and night. When slight falls happen in the capital city, they are not aware of how to deal with them or there is not enough funding in place. I call on the relevant authorities to rectify this.</P>
    <P>Senator Helen Keogh called for a debate on child care and adequate support for children in care. I can allow time for this.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called on the Minister for Health and Children to have a debate on nursing homes and the care of the elderly. This is a very <Col N="693" /> big challenge facing us and I will leave time for a debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for State, Deputy Mary Coughlan, on her first visit to the House in her new position. I congratulate her on her appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan): Is mór an onóir é seo dom mo chéad ócáid sa Seanad. Níor toghadh mé riamh go dtí an Seanad.</P>
    <P>Is ábharach an rud é an deis a bheith againn ceist na Gaeilge a phlé inniu, seachtain i ndiaidh Lá na Máthar-theangacha le UNESCO, agus coicís i ndiaidh seoladh oifigiúil Bhliain Eorpach na dTeangacha in Éirinn. Tuigim go bhfuil an t-aisteoir clúiteach Stephen Rea agus bean ón Nigéir darb ainm Agnes Ojuolape atá ina cónaí anois in Inis, Contae an Chláir, chun tabhairt faoi an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim mar thogra do Bhliain Eorpach na dTeangacha. Molaim iad agus guím gach rath orthu.</P>
    <P>Is é seo an chéad ocáid dom ceist na Gaeilge a chíoradh go foirmiúil agus go poiblí i mo ról úr mar Aire Stáit le freagracht faoi leith don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Teastaíonn uaim ar an gcéad dul síos aitheantas poiblí a thabhairt do Éamon Ó Cuív, an t-iar-Aire Stáit. Tá cáil thuillteanach bainte amach ag Éamon mar laoch ar son na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus, dar ndóigh, na nOileán. Tá sé mar onóir domsa é a leanúint mar Aire Stáit agus geallaim go dtabharfaidh mé faoi mo dhualgais leis an bhfuinneamh céanna is a léirigh Éamon thar tréimhse trí bliana go leith.</P>
    <P>Díreach mar a thaispeántar radhairc dhifriúla den taithí daonna trí leabhair scríbhneoirí éagsúla, braitheann ár dtuiscint ar an domhan ar an teanga a úsáidimid chun rudaí a mhíniú dúinn féin. Bainfidh cainteoir Gaeilge brí éagsúil as radharc nádúrtha, mar shampla, i gcomparáid le cainteoir Rúisise agus iad beirt os comhair na radhairce céanna. Deirtear go bhfuil thart is 6,000 teanga ar domhan agus tá sainiúlacht nó tuiscint <Col N="694" /> faoi leith ag gach ceann acu. Fágtar níos boichte muid gach uair a fhaigheann teanga bás, rud a tharlaíonn i bhfad níos minicí, anois leis an mbrú ó na meáin chumarsáide agus ó chúrsaí gnó idirnáisiúnta chuig caighdeánú a dhéanamh i réimsí uilig an tsaoil. Is ionann saol na dteangacha agus an saol bitheolaíochta ar bhealach &ndash; síolraíonn láidreacht as fairsingeacht.</P>
    <P>Tá an fíric sin tuigthe anois ag an léibhéal idirnáisiúnta. I rith Bliain Eorpach na dTeangacha, mar shampla, tá Comhairle na hEorpa agus an Comhphobal Eorpach ag iarraidh daoine a mhealladh chun teanga eile seachas a máthartheanga a fhoghlaimt. Aithnítear go gcaomhnaíonn teanga cuid mhór de chultúr tíre agus nach féidir teacht ar an gcuid sin arís má chailltear an teanga.</P>
    <P>Ach an cheist atá le freagairt againne ná an aithníonn an tír seo tábhacht a teanga féin? Nó an tír gan teanga, tír gan anam muid?</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuilim dóchasach maidir le todhchaí na Gaeilge. Bheadh sé deacair dom mo dhualgais úr a chomhlíonadh mura mbeinn, dár ndóigh. Le blianta beaga anuas tá roinnt tuartha dóchais úr tagtha ar an bhfód a chuireann le féin-mhuinín lucht na Gaeilge. Cé nar chóir bheith róthógtha le staitisticí is fiú féachaint ar fhigiúirí an Daonáirimh dheireanaigh (1996) a léiríonn go bhfuil breis is 1.4 milliún duine sa tír le cumas éigin sa Ghaeilge. Ní dócha go n-úsáideann níos mó ná thart ar 10% díobh seo an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga bíodh is go ndúirt os cionn 300,000 duine sa Daonáireamh deiridh go n-úsáideann siad Gaeilge éigin gach lá. Fós féin, is pobal suntasasch é 150,000 duine.</P>
    <P>Tá borradh suntasach tagtha san éileamh ar oiliúint trí Ghaeilge agus tá líon na ngaelscoileanna agus na naíonraí ag méadú gach bliain. Tá íomhá úr cruthaithe dóibh féin ag lucht na Gaeilge, éacht atá éascaithe ag na meáin chumarsáide, an t-Idirlíon agus TG4 ach go háirithe. Tá lucht gnó na tíre ag tosnú ag tabhairt aird ar an nGaeilge mar sheirbhís dá gcustaiméirí. Tá an tacaíocht maoine ón Stát don Ghaeilge ag an leibhéal is airde ariamh, trí Fhoras na Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir a shéanadh áfach go bhfuil fadhbanna ann fosta. Tá an Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe, agus lucht na Gaeilge go ginearálta, faoi bhrú síoraí ó anáil do-éalaithe an chultúir Lár-Atlantaigh, cultúr le cos amháin i Meiriceá, cos eile i Sasana agus gan aird in aon chor ar an éagsúlacht. Is cúis bhuartha dúinn fosta easpa stádais na Gaeilge, san earnáil phoiblí agus san earnáil phríobháideach. Ó thaobh oideachais de, is léir nach bhfuil na háiseanna nó na deiseanna céanna á cur ar fáil do dhaoine atá ag foghlaim trí Ghaeilge is a fhaigheann lucht an Bhéarla. Ní foláir cinntiú go mbeidh curaclam suas chun dáta, oiriúnach, ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí agus go gcuirfear gach cúnamh ar fáil do mhúinteoirí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ach fós féin táim dóchasach go bhuil níos mó láidreachtaí ná laigeachtaí i mórleabhar cuntas na Gaeilge ag tús an 21ú Aois.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Ó thaobh an Stáit de, glacaim leis gur deis í an ócáid seo, chun cur síos a dhéanamh ar an obair atá ar bun i mo Roinnse ar mhaithe leis na Gaeilge agus ar mo thuairimí pearsanta ar an ábhar.</P>
    <P>Creidim go láidir nach féidir ceist na Gaeilge a phlé gan ceist na Gaeltachta a scrúdú fosta. Tá caite anuas ar an nGaeltacht ag leor daoine thar na blianta. Déantar imeallú, nó &ldquo;ghettoization&rdquo;, ar an nGaeilge de bharr na Gaeltachta, a deir siad. Ní sa Ghaeltacht ach sna cathracha agus sna bailte a throidfear an cath do chúis na Gaeilge, deir a thuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Nílim féin chomh diúltach sin. Gan bunú na Gaeltachta i 1956, tá gach seans nach mbeadh aon réigiún fagtha sa tír anois ina labhrann móramh na ndaoine an Ghaeilge. Feidhmníonn an Ghaeltacht mar acmhainn do lucht foghlamtha na tíre agus mar eiseamláir dóibh siúd atá ag cruthú creatlaigh chathracha de chainteoirí Gaeilge. Ba chóir dúinn féachaint ar an nGaeltacht mar áis chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn níos leithne sa tír i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Ní mór dúinn anois scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na nithe atá ag cur brú ar an teanga sa Ghaeltacht agus ar ndóigh i measc na nithe sin tá seirbhisí Stáit trí Bhéarla, easpa seirbhisí oideachais agus sláinte trí Ghaeilge, cúrsaí pleanála, éagraíochtaí pobail agus eaglasta atá easnamhach maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge, brú ó na méain chumarsáide agus easpa fostaíochta bunaithe ar an nGaeilge mar acmhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá pleananna gearrthéarmacha agus fadtéarmacha á réiteach bunaithe ar na nithe seo agus don chéad uair tá i gceist go mbeidh pleanáil eolaíoch teanga mar chuid lárnach de pholasaí na Roinne i leith na Gaeltachta. Tá obair déanta cheana féin le cinntiú nach mbeidh aisínteachtaí a dhéanann plé leis an bpobal trí Bhéarla ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht, sa gcás go bhfuil scéim cheart bhunaithe Gaeltachta ann. Samplaí de seo ná gur faoin Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta &amp; Oileán amháin a thagann cúnamh caipitil i leith saoraidí spóirt agus caitheamh aimsire sa Ghaeltacht agus ní faoin Roinn Spóirt mar a bhíodh sé. Sampla eile ná an socrú atá déanta leis an Aire Comhshaoil agus Rialtas Áitiúil gurb iad Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta a ghlacann an taoiseachas sa Ghaeltacht, agus ní na Boird Fiontair Chontae.</P>
    <P>Tá ról an-tábhachtach ag Údarás na Gaeltachta san obair seo agus ní cóir a dhearmad gurb é an bunchuspóir ata ag an Údarás ná an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht. Tá obair mhaith déanta ag an Údarás ó thaobh cruthú fostaíochta de agus anois táthar ag féachaint ar bhealaí chun caighdeán beatha na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne a fheabhsú. Ní féidir an iomarca béime a chur ar thábhacht na Gaeilge sa chomhthéacs sin.</P>
    <P>Tá bagairtí úr ar an nGaeltacht atá ag teacht ní ó easpa fostaíochta ach ón bhfás mór atá ag teacht go mór mhór i gceantair ar nós Chonamara. Bheadh súil agam fosta sna blianta <Col N="696" /> atá rómhainn go bhfeicfear dlúth chomhoibriú idir na hinstitiúidí eagsúla Gaeltachta, mar shampla Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán agus na hinstitiúidí eile idir Stáit agus deonacha (m.sh. Ráidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4) atá ag saothrú ar son na Gaeilge. Gan iarracht chuile dhuine curtha le chéile, ní éireoidh leis an Údarás an sprioc comónta atá againn uilig a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Mar Aire Stáit Gaeltachta feictear dom gurb iad seo na fadhbhanna is mó atá ag brú ar an nGaeltacht: brú mór ar an dteanga de bharr cúinsí éagsúla, an daonra a bheith ag titim sna ceantair íseal-fhorbartha agus easpa déiseanna fostaíochta ann, easpa déiseanna fostaíochta do dhaoine óga le hard-cháilaíochtaí san Ghaeltacht, easpa áiseanna ginearálta le haghaidh saol nua-aimseartha sa Ghaeltacht, easpa phleanála don Ghaeltacht mar aonad faoi leith. Tá freagrachtaí éagsúla ar dhreamanna éagsúla maidir le nithe áirithe den chlár thuas. Ba mhaith liom dearbhú mar Aire Stáit Gaeltachta go mbeidh gach tacaíocht le fáil uaimse le díriú ar na nithe seo.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol daoibh fosta bunaíodh An Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht anuraidh le moltaí a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais maidir le buanú na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail sa Ghaeltacht. Tá iarrtha ag an Rialtas ar an gCoimisiún moltaí a dhéanamh leo maidir leis an nGaeilge a láidriu mar ghnáthurlabhra phobal na Gaeltachta agus tuigtear dom go gcuirfear tuarascáil an Choimisiúin faoi bhráid an Rialtais roimh dheireadh na bliana seo. I measc na gcúramaí éagsúla atá orthu, déanfaidh an Coimisiún anailís ar an méid atá an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha sa Ghaeltacht, scrúdú ar éifeacht na bpolasuithe Stáit a phléann le buanú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, anailís ar na tosca agus ar na polasuithe atá chun leasa nó chun dochair chaomhnú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, moltaí i dtaca le plean cuimsitheach comhtháite chun seirbhísí i nGaeilge a sholáthar don Ghaeltacht agus moltaí i dtaca leis na critéir theangeolaíochta a d'úsáidfí chun limistéir Ghaeltachta a theorannú. Is obair dhúshlánach í seo agus táim ag tnúth go mór le tuarascáil agus moltaí an Choimisiúin a fheiceáil.</P>
    <P>Is eol do achan duine gurb é ceann de na clocha is mó ar phaidrín an iar-Aire Stáit ná Bille Teanga a reachtáil mar chosaint don Ghaeilge. Tá an próiseas seo i bhfad níos casta ná mar a samhlaíodh ar dtús agus toisc go bhfuil breis is dhá bhliain imithe ónar fógraíodh ar dtús é, ceapaim gur fiú an cheist a chíoradh arís: Cén fáth a bhfuil gá ann le Reachtaíocht Teanga in Éirinn?</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil stádas bunreachtúil ag an nGaeilge tá fíor-stádas na Gaeilge an-difriúil ón stádas bunreachtúil sin. Go dtí go mbeidh reachtaíocht ann chun éifeacht agus fiacail a thabhairt don stádas sa Bhunreacht ní bheifear in ann a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn. Mar gheall ar an easpa reachtaíochta is deacair a chur in a luí ar eagrais Stáit go bhfuil cearta ag pobal na hÉireann maidir le seirbhís trí <Col N="697" /> Ghaeilge a fháil &ndash; rud a chruthaíonn deacrachtaí do phobal na Gaeilge sa tír i gcoitinne agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe.</P>
    <P>Tá na deacrachtaí seo aitheanta. Mar shampla, rinne an tOmbudsman tagairt don fhadhb ina thuarscáil do 1996. Bhí an méid seo le rá aige maidir leis na fadhbanna atá ag a Oifig in éagmais reachtaíocht teanga: &ldquo;Ó tharla go mbíonn na fadhbanna .. ann arís agus arís eile, tá taca ann don argóint go bhféadfadh Acht Teanga cabhair a thabhairt i ndáil le córas scrúdaithe gearán níos éifeachtaí a bheith ann.&rdquo;  Cúis eile don ghá le reachtaíocht theanga ná míshásúlacht an chórais phleanála &ndash; nó easpa córais pleanála fiú &ndash; atá ann chun seirbhísí Stáit a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge. Rinne Foras na Gaeilge, nó Bord na Gaeilge mar a bhí, an chomhlacht tras-teorainn a bhfuil mar chúram air an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, iarracht tabhairt faoin gceist sin.</P>
    <P>Luaim ach go háirithe na treoirlínte a réitíodh i 1993 mar bhonn le haghaidh clár gníomhaíochta a bhí le hullmhú agus le cur i gcrích ag Ranna Rialtais agus ag Eagrais Stáit chun an dátheangachas a chur chun cinn san Earnáil Phoiblí agus chun feabhas a chur ar an bhfáil ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge do phobal na Gaeilge agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá feidhm leis na treoirlínte sin i gcónaí agus, cé go bhfuil dul chun cinn áirithe bainte amach acu, is léir sa gcuid is mó de go ndearnadh neamhaird orthu. Caithfear a admháil go bhfuil an iomarca eagras Stáit ann fós nach bhfuil an cúram ceart á dhéanamh acu den phleanáil is gá le haghaidh leathnú an dátheangachais. Tá go leor acu nach bhfuil cúram dá laghad á dhéanamh acu i dtaca leis an gceist.</P>
    <P>Níl cuireadh ná deis á thabhairt don phobal ag dóthain eagras Stáit a rogha teanga a úsáid. Níl eolas á thabhairt don phobal faoi na seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge atá ar fáil. Ní thógfar an Ghaeltacht san áireamh ag bunáite na n-eagras Stáit nuair a bhíonn seirbhísí á chur ar fáil acu. Ní drochsheirbhís trí Ghaeilge atá ag teastáil ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná ó phobal na Gaeilge ach seirbhís ar chomhchaighdeán leis an tseirbhís atá ar fáil trí Bhéarla. Tá seirbhís ar chomhcháighdeán ag dul do lucht na Gaeilge ó thaobh comhionannais de. Tá sé cruthaithe cheana féin go minic sa tír seo go bhfuil an earnáil phoiblí go maith chun seirbhísí de chineálacha éagsúla a chur ar fáil go héifeachtach. Táim féin ach go háirithe, agus an Rialtas i gcoitinne, aontaithe sa tuairim go bhfuil gá le hathrú ó threoirlínte neamhreachtúla go dtí córas foirmiúil reachtúil a chuirfidh de dhualgas ar an Státcóras a chearta a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeilge. Ar ndóigh tuigim go maith go mbeidh gá le hathrú mór meoin san earnáil phoiblí fosta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le stádas bunreachtúil na Gaeilge tá sé deacair a shamhlú go bhfuil foráil níos láidre maidir le cúrsaí teanga in aon Bhunreacht eile ná mar atá i mBunreacht na hÉireann. An fhadhb atá againn, ar ndóigh, ná nár fhorbraíodh an fhoráil sin riamh trí reachtaíocht. Ní minic imeachtaí dlí maidir leis an nGaeilge a bheith os <Col N="698" /> comhair na gcúirteanna ach forbraíodh prionsabail agus cearta ag na cúirteanna maidir le stádas agus le húsáid oifigiúil na Gaeilge. Cé go bhfuil na cúirteanna sásta plé le cásanna aonair a gcuirtear faoina mbráid, níl breithiúnas ginearálta tugtha acu maidir leis an dualgas atá ar an Stát faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Is cuid lárnach de shaol agus de chultúr na hÉireann í an Ghaeilge a bhí mar theanga dhúchais ag formhór a muintire anuas go dtí an naoú haois déag. Tá athréimniú na Gaeilge ina aidhm náisiúnta in Éirinn. Ar ndóigh is le toil an phobail agus go céimniúil a bhainfear amach an aidhm sin. Caithfidh gach dream sa phobal a chion féin a dhéanamh chun an aidhm sin a bhaint amach. Deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo; agus ní féidir an iomarca béime a chur ar thábhacht an teaghlaigh ó thaobh caomhnú teanga de. Mura bhfoghlaimítear an Ghaeilge ón gcliabhán, laistigh de struchtúr na clainne, ní mhairfidh sí. Ta dualgas orainn uilig, mar sin de, tacaíocht láidir a thabhairt d'fhoghlaim agus do lonnú na teanga sa bhaile, i measc an aosa óig. Ní féidir leis an Rialtas amháin na cúramaí seo a chomhlíonadh. Is den riachtanas é, áfach, go mbeadh lán-tacaíocht le fáil ón Rialtas. Agus é sin ráite is gá tógáil ar an dul chun cinn a rinneadh go dtí seo. Is chuige sin atá an Bille Teanga a n-ullmhú againn.</P>
    <P>Sula bhogaim ón gcúlra go dtí na fíricí, teastaíonn uaim a rá go bhfuilim lándáiríre faoi thábhacht an Bhille seo a fhoilsiú roimh dheireadh na bliana. Tá sé ráite go poiblí ag na páirtithe polaitiúla uilig go bhfuiltear i bhfábhar Bille den chineál seo agus táim ag súil le plé spreagúil, fuinniúil agus le hinchur agus tacaíocht tras-pháirtí don reachtaíocht seo nuair a shroichfidh sé Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <P>Is iad na bunaidhmeanna atá leis an mBille seo ná cearta teanga saoránach a shonrú i gcomhréir le stádas bunreachtúil na dteangacha oifigiúla agus dualgais Ranna Stáit agus na hEarnála Poiblí a shonrú maidir le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil do shaoránaigh sna teangacha oifigiúla. Tá sé i gceist chomh maith Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bhunú chun maoirseacht agus monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an Acht agus chun féachaint chuige go gcuirfear é i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Leagfaidh an Bille seo bonn reachtúil i dtaca leis na teangacha oifigiúla (Gaeilge agus Béarla) agus chomh maith leis sin cinnteoidh sé cearta teanga an tsaoránaigh ina c(h)aidreamh leis an Stát. Léiríonn an Bille go bhfuil Rialtas na hÉireann lán-dáiríre faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sa tír i gcoitinne agus tagann sé leis an méid atá leagtha amach i gClár Oibre Athbhreithnithe an Rialtais don Mhílaois úr i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom fosta gur lá fíor-stairiúil é do Ghaeilgeoirí na tíre faoi chéim Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta an bhliain seo caite, nuair a tugadh don chéad uair aitheantas suntasach don Ghaeilge sa Tuaisceart. Cé go bhfuil deacrachtaí polaitiúla le feidhmiú iomlán an <Col N="699" /> Chomhaontaithe, mar is eol do achan duine, tá dualgas orainn brú ar aghaidh ar mhaithe le todhchaí síochánta an oileáin agus na nglún atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Tá mar chuid lárnach de phroiséas an Comhaontaithe na Forais Trasteorann agus Comhairle na nAirí a úsáid mar ghléasanna le comhoibriú uile-Éireannach a chur ar bun. Ó tharla nár aithin an Ghaeilge aon teorainn ariamh is ceart agus is cóir go ndéanfaí plé leis an nGaeilge go hoifigiúil ar bhonn uile-Éireann agus gur roghnaíodh an Ghaeilge agus cultúr agus teanga na hUltaise le bheith mar bhonn do na chéad Fhorais Trasteorann. Ar ndóigh athróidh sé seo ní amháin saol na Gaeilge ach de réir a chéile saol na tíre ar fad. Beidh an t-athrú seo in amanntaí deacair ach ní foláir dúinn an bóthar seo a thaisteal le díogras agus le fonn.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuirtear leis an méid atá ráite thuas, an ról gníomhach atá an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta &amp; Oileán ag glacadh maraon leis an méid atá déanta ag an Aire Oideachais maidir le cúrsaí na Gaeilge i gcúrsaí oideachais agus an tacaíocht leanúnach do TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil an Rialtas seo agus mé féin mar Aire le cúrám na Gaeilge uirthi lándáiríre i dtaca le caomhnú, cosaint agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Táim ag súil go mór le hoibriú ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus gabhaim buíochas don Seanad as an gcaoinchuireadh a tugadh dom bheith libh anseo inniu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire nua  &ndash; tá Gaeilge bhinn bhlasta aici, cé nach dtuigim í i gcónaí, mar gurb as Contae Dhún na nGall di. Ach tá súil agam go ndeanfaidh sí an-obair sa phost nua atá fachta aici.</P>
      <P>Táimid ag caint faoin nGaeilge agus conas mar a bheidh sí sa saol nua atá romhainn agus roimh ár bpáistí. Caithfear i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge i measc na ngnáthdhaoine. Labhartar an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht gach lá ach níl mórán Gaeilge le clos sa Ghalltacht. Caithfimid é sin a bhriseadh. We must break down the distinction in our minds between the two different places.</P>
      <P>Labhair mise Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i gcónaí, ach nuair i imím ón nDaingean, tosaím ag caint Béarla arís. Bíonn daoine sásta an Ghaeilge a labhairt ach anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath ní gach duine atá sásta í a labhairt. We must break the barrier down. It is as natural to speak Irish here as it is in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a Gaeltacht tradition. Tháinig m'athair ó Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne agus bhí sé ina mhúinteoir Gaeilge le blianta fada. Bhí sé ina thimire Gaeilge agus théadh sé timpeall Contae Thiobrad Árainn agus Contae Ua bhFáile nuair a bhí sé óg ar a rothar. Bhí a lán daoine eile ag déanamh obair den tsórt céanna timpeall 1924 ag iarraidh Gaeilge a mhúineadh do na gnáthdhaoine. Bhí an-sprid iontu agus an-tuiscint <Col N="700" /> acu don teanga agus an-suim ag na gnáthdhaoine sa Ghaeilge. Bhíodh na mílte daoine ag freastal ar na ranganna Gaeilge a bhíodh acu in áiteanna mar An Teampall Mór agus mar sin de. Bhí suim ag na gnáthdhaoine sa teanga agus sa chultúr agus d'éirigh go mór leis.</P>
    <P>Ar mo chéad lá ar scoil, bhí na paidreacha á rá againn as Béarla agus ní raibh siad ar eolas agam mar is i nGaeilge a bhíodh na paidreacha i mo theachsa i gcónaí. Rinne m'athair a dhícheall dúinne agus táimse ag déanamh mo dhíchill do mo pháistí féin le go mbeidh suim acu sa Ghaeilge ach is tír eile ar fad í anois.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom an Language Freedom Movement mar gheall ar an nGaeilge éigeandach agus an troid a bhí ann faoi. Nuair a bhíomar inár scoláirí bhí orainn pas a fháil sa Ghaeilge chun dul go dtí an ollscoil. Tá sé sin imithe anois, agus is maith as é. Mar níl aon mhaitheas sa rud atá éigeandach. Caithfidh an tsuim a bheith ag an ngnáthdhuine sa ghnáthchultúr.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom a léamh nuair a bhí mé óg i <i>Scéala Éireann </i>&ndash; chun glóire Dé agus onóir na hÉireann. Is minic a léigh mé é sin agus a dúirt mé, nach bhfuil aon chultúr eile ann seachas <i>Scéala Éireann</i>. Sin an cultúr a bhí i mo theachsa cé nach raibh baint ag m'athair le Fianna Fáil in aon chor, ach bhí baint aige leis an gcultúr i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé sé bliana déag d'aois cheannaigh mé <i>The Irish Times </i>agus táim á cheannach ó shin. Tá an-suim ag an bpáipéar sin sa Ghaeilge agus an-bhá acu leis an gcultúr agus déanann siad iarracht a chur ina luí orainn mar rud maith. Caithfidh mé a rá go fírinneach go bhfuil an-suim ag an Irish Times freisin sa Ghaeilge agus an-bhá acu don chultúr. Deineann siad iarracht a chur ina luí orainn gur rud maith agus gur rud íontach é go mbeadh a love for, an interest in, an honour for our language, and I recognise that as well. Nuair a bhím ag éisteacht le mo pháistí agus le páistí eile tugaim faoi deara nach bhfuil mórán meas acu don Ghaeilge. They do not have a great interest in Irish but they are open and interested in Irish things. Bíonn siad ag féachaint ar TG4. Is maith leo an tseirbhís sin. Is rud iontach é don chultúr. Déarfainn go bhfuil sé ag dul i bhfeabhas agus go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag féachaint air. Is maith leis na páistí Bono agus U2 agus grúpaí eile mar sin freisin. We should be trying to promote the use of Irish through modern rock groups such as U2. It will not be difficult to get music groups to support such an idea. We should actively promote the language in the modern music of young people. We should go after the big names and ask them to put some Irish lyrics to their songs.</P>
    <P>Bono and U2 are uniquely popular, not just in Ireland but all over the world. They are winning awards for many achievements, they are a special group and tá mé cinnte nach mbeadh mórán deacracht ann if we could encourage them and groups like them who are top of the pops. It would increase the use of Irish and the awareness of the language. Bhí mé ag obair mar mhúinteoir <Col N="701" /> le blianta fada agus tháinig timpeall 40 againn le chéile as gach aird den tír tar éis 25 bliana, about 40 of us came together. Bhíomar ag caint faoin rud ba mhó go raibh cuimhneamh againn air agus bé an t-am a bhíomar sa Ghaeltacht an rud sin. Tá sin an-thábhachtach ar fad. Nuair a théann scoláirí go dtí an Ghaeltacht baineann siad an-taitneamh as an saol a bhíonn acu ann.</P>
    <P>It is a unique thing for young people to go on holiday to the Gaeltacht. I have encouraged my own children to go there and they have enjoyed the experience immensely. However, when young people go to the Gaelteacht there are scholarships. Bíonn scoláireachtaí ann ach is scoláireachtaí do bhaill an Chumann Lúthchleas Gael is mó a bhíonn ann, is dóigh liom, ach b'fhéidir nach bhfuil an ceart ar fad agam sa mhéid sin. When people go to the Gaeltacht there should be scholarships available to all students. If some people get a scholarship through the GAA specifically, then all do not get the same benefit. Senator Ó Murchú can correct me on that if I am wrong. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar aidhm ag gach meánscoil gach scoláire, every student, a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht uair amháin ar a laghad. Conas is féidir é sin a chur i bhfeidhm? You must give scholarships to everybody, there should be no distinctions and they should be available uniformly across the board for all second level students who want to go to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the support and commitment shown by families in the Gaeltacht, particularly the fear a' tí and the bean a' tí and their children, towards the visitors they receive. They make a significant contribution to the happiness and learning process of the children. However, from my experience of the Kerry Gaeltacht, we need certain criteria in terms of recreation and sports facilities. Activities such as céilis and sport are very popular. B'fhéidir go mba chóir dúinn níos mó airgid a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht ar rudaí a bhaineann le daoine óga, mar shampla, indoor sports and recreational amenities. They are quite poor and that is one criticism I have of the Gaeltacht experience. The same broken net fence has been around a rundown basketball court in the Kerry Gaeltacht for the past 20 years and this is not good enough. It echoes a view somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé uair amháin i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill agus bhí sin an-deas ar fad. Ach ní raibh mo chlann ann riamh. My family never went there but I would like them to. We should standardise the facilities we have and insist on recreational amenities which are often not present.</P>
    <P>Is as Droichead Átha domsa agus nuair a théann daoine óga ar scoil ann foghlaimíonn siad Gaeilge acu ach ní bhíonn mórán meas acu uirthi. In large urban areas on the east coast there is no great interest in Irish and although teachers do their best I know go bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge ag ísliú sna scoileanna. Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge, the speaking of Irish, the oral skills, the language skills and phonetics. That is the direction we should be <Col N="702" /> going and our primary school regime should change radically. We should have European languages other than Irish and English available. Is é mo thuairim go gcabhródh sé sin leis an Ghaeilge, that would add to rather than take from our objectives, and would also make for a broader European culture among students. Irish is necessarily an important part of this. Sa mheanscoil freisin ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó béime on the oral skills and tied into that you have Irish studies which are successful.</P>
    <P>As we look into the 21st century I wonder what future there is for the Irish language. I am confident that it will do very well, that the Gaeltacht areas will continue to be lively and radical places where people speak a different language from most of the country. They are unique, special places. The planning policies for Gaeltacht areas, and especially holiday villages within those areas, require a committment to sustainable development. In our heart of hearts, we would love to see an Ghaeilge á labhairt ag gach duine. Ní tharlóidh sé sin ach tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó suime agus níos mó confidence ag daoine sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Our cultural identity is tied up not just with our language, although that is a core part of it. Music and other activities are also culturally important. I would love my children to be part of the Irish language scene, as I think they will be, and I would like others involved as well. The encouragement of young people to go to the Gaeltacht by making access easier and improving facilities will add to that.</P>
    <P>There is a ritual about these debates. Tarlaíonn siad timpeall Lá 'le Pádraig gach bliain and this is not necessarily a good thing. Years ago everybody would take part in an Irish night and people would go to a céili on St. Patrick's Day. I am not sure if the céilis have died now but we should debate Irish language matters more often. We should set ourselves simpler challenges, although I am not suggesting that there is anything simple in what the Minister proposes. We should have achievable targets and one of them should be a quarterly debate on specific Irish language and culture issues.</P>
    <P>Gura maith agat as ucht éisteacht liom agus le mo chuid Gaeilge. Tá sí beagáinín briste ach níl sí imithe go fóill.</P>

      <P>I dtosach is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit agus tréaslú léi freisin. Go raibh rath Dé ar a saothar amach anseo. Is mian liom chomh maith fáiltiú roimh oifigigh na Roinne anseo. Is beirt iad a bhfuil an-obair déanta acu ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son an chultúir Ghaeilge le fada an lá. Molaim a ndíograis agus a n-eifeacht freisin. Mar Mhuimhneach bhain mé an-taitneamh as canúint cheolmhar Thír Chonaill a chlos. Tugann sé dúshlán dúinn gach canúint a thuiscint freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teach toisc gur shocraíodar ar maidin ceiliúradh 50 bliain Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann a cheangailt leis na <Col N="703" /> ráitis anseo ar maidin. Tá mé chun úsáid a bhaint as an dá theidil sin freisin.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé an-tógtha leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Dubhda agus molaim é mar gheall ar an dáiríreacht a léirigh sé ansin. Ní raibh fhios agam go raibh a athair ina thimire ag Conradh na Gaeilge i dTiobrad Árann ach is léir gur dhein sé an-obair ann. Nuair a tháinig na timirí ar ais sna seascaidí bhí mise mar dhuine den bheirt a ceapadh ag an am sin. Bé Máirtín Mac Cormaic, a bhí ina thuairisceoir san <i>Irish Independent </i>in a dhiaidh sin, an duine eile. Fuaireamar cuireadh ó Uachtarán na hÉireann ag an am, Éamon de Valera, dul suas go dtí an tÁras, mar dúirt seisean go raibh sé an-tógtha i gcónaí leis an timireacht a bhí déanta agus an íbirt a bhí déanta ag na timirí.</P>
    <P>Sin an stair agus an cúlra a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge. Molaim an tAire go mór mar gheall ar an óráid seo mar tá sé soiléir go bhfuil doimhneacht agus dáiríreacht ag baint leis. Is minic a tharlaíonn sé go mbíonn óráid ann agus nach mbíonn ann dáiríre ach sop, ach tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire agus an Roinn ag plé le rudaí atá thar a bheith tábhachtach ó thaobh stádas na Gaeilge de sa tír agus todhchaí na Gaeilge freisin, go mór mhór maidir le Bille na Gaeilge agus arís ní abairt nó dhó atá caite isteach san óráid. An rud is tábhachtaí im thuairimse maidir le Bille na Gaeilge ná a aithint go bhfuil an-dea-thoil ann don Ghaeilge anois. Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó dea-thola ann anois ná mar a bhí ann 30 bliana ó shin mar is cuimhin liomsa go maith nuair a bhí an feachtas ar siúl ag an Language Freedom Movement go raibh an-nimhneas ag baint leis an díospóireacht ag an am. Níor chabhraigh sé sin dáiríre leis an Ghaeilge. Chaithfeadh an dea-thoil a bheith ann i dtosach agus chaithfeadh eolas ar an Ghaeilge a bheith ann in a dhiaidh sin. Ach tá sé an-dheacair mórán a dhéanamh sa timpeallacht má bhíonn eolas ann gan dea-thoil.  I ngach suirbhé a deineadh le déanaí, i measc tuismitheoirí agus i measc an ghnáth phobail tá sé soiléir go bhfuil breis agus 70 faoin gcéad thar a bheith fábharach don Ghaeilge. Dá dtarlódh sé sin maidir le hábhar ar bith eile bheadh an tír thar a bheith sásta. Sin mar atá sé. Tháinig an Ghaeilge go mór i gcabhair orainn le déanaí freisin le suirbhé a deineadh san Eoraip maidir le teangacha agus labhairt teangacha éagsúla. Ach amháin gur admhaigh beagnach 40 faoin gcéad go raibh an Ghaeilge á úsáid acu mar theanga bheadh an tír seo ag an bun maidir le labhairt teangacha san Eoraip. Bhí an United Kingdom ag an bun ach toisc an Ghaeilge a bheith á labhairt anseo do chabhraigh sé sin linn. Is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil eolas againn ar an Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil dea-thoil ann don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Luadh Fhoras na Gaeilge anseo agus is mian liom fáiltiú roimh rúnaí Fhoras na Gaeilge Éamon Ó hArgáin atá linn anseo inniu agus molaim an obair atá ar siúl acu. Seo ceann de na rudaí is stairiúla a tharla ó thaobh ceist na Gaeilge sa chéad seo. Do chruthaigh sé dhá rud. <Col N="704" /> Do chruthaigh sé i dtosach go raibh an Ghaeilge in a beo-cheist agus in a beo-theanga. Tá sin tábhachtach chun dóchas a thabhairt do dhaoine. Chomh maith leis sin do chruthaigh sé nár bhain an Ghaeilge le h-aon aicme amháin nó le h-aon pháirtí polaitíochta amháin, nár bhain sé le h-aon eaglais amháin nó le h-aon aois-ghrúpa amháin. Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach ar fad agus is féidir leis an bhForas dóchas nua a thabhairt dúinn mar más féidir leis obair phraiticiúil a dhéanamh ar an talamh ins an tír iomlán tabharfaidh sé sin seans do dhaoine a bheith ag caidreamh le cheile i dtosach, ní h-amháin mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge ach mar gheall ar rudaí eile a bhaineann le timpeallacht na Gaeilge freisin. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí sé seo mar cheann de na chéad áisínteachtaí tras-teorann a tháinig ar an saol agus ag obair. Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon chosc nó aon stop curtha leis an obair seo de bharr na ndeacrachtaí a bhaineann le cúrsaí polaitíochta i láthair na huaire. Táim cinnte nach dtarlóidh sé sin. Bímid ag caint go minic faoi na meáin chumarsáide agus bhí an-díospóireacht againn anseo le déanaí go mór mhór maidir le cúrsaí craolacháin.</P>
    <P>Thug gach duine agus gach taobh anseo ard-mholadh do TG4 de bharr na hoibre atá ar siúl acu. Tá an tseirbhís an-óg agus ní féidir a rá go bhfuil mórán maoine acu go fóill. Tá proifisiúnachas ag baint le TG4 áfach. Ta daoine óga chun tosaigh ann agus tá cuid de na cailíní ann thar a bheith dathúil caithfidh mé a rá. Mar sin tá íomhá óg i TG4 don Ghaeilge. In an-chuid slite tá TG4 ag féachaint ar na seansanna a bhí ag RTÉ na blianta ó shin agus anois tá dea-thoil arís ann do TG4. Tá daoine ar bheagán Gaeilge ag féachaint ar TG4. Tá siad ag caint faoi na cláracha ann agus ba chóir dúinn gach cabhair gur féidir linn a thabhairt dó. Tá an chinnireacht agus na daoine atá ag obair i TG4 agus an fhealsúnacht atá acu ag tabhairt dóchais dúinn uilig mar tá sé ann. Thug Raidió na Gaeilge ard-chaighdeán don Ghaeilge le fada an lá. Do thógadar an Ghaeilge amach i measc an phobail, i lár an aonaigh, agus bhí sé sin tábhachtach mar is minic nach n-úsáidtear an Ghaeilge ach amháin nuair a bhíonn sí á plé. Ní cóir go mbeadh sé mar sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh ar ár gcumas gach rud a bhaineann le cúrsaí reatha a phlé tré Ghaeilge. Luaim freisin cláracha cosúil le Léargas agus Cúrsaí ar RTÉ. Fiú amháin caithfear smaoineamh siar ar an obair a dhein Liam Ó Murchú le Trom agus Éadrom. Do chabhraigh cláracha mar sin chun an Ghaeilge a thógaint amach as an ghetto mar a déarfá agus é a chur amach i lár an aonaigh.</P>
    <P>I was most impressed by Senator O'Dowd and his bilingualism. I am a little worried that if one speaks only in Irish on an occasion such as this, one sometimes discourages other Members of the Oireachtas who have important contributions to make. Members who might regard themselves as relatively fluent are often in a cocoon with regard to the views of the public. This would be very wrong because the language does not belong to any single organisation or group. It is a beautiful <Col N="705" /> language. It is also an expressive language, not only in a literary sense but also in a functional sense. It is a national treasure and such treasures belong to all our people. In his presentation, Senator O'Dowd indicated the manner in which we could introduce bilingualism on more frequent occasions in the Seanad. I already see this happening but I would like to see it happening more frequently.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the voluntary organisations. Tá sé tábhachtach creidiúint a thabhairt dóibh. Gan na heagrais sin a bheith ag saothrú ar son na Gaeilge, agus tá a lán díobh ann, tá gach seans ann nach mbeadh an áit chéanna ag an Ghaeilge, fiú amháin sa chóras stáit. Ach chomh maith leis sin do bhíodar in ann an Ghaeilge a thógaint amach i measc an phobail go háitiúil. Táimid go mór faoi chomaoin ag gach eagras a rinne an obair sin agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil cabhair á thabhairt ag an stát dóibh. I take this opportunity, as was agreed in the House this morning, to refer to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Since Members are obliged to declare our vested interests, I had better do so now by indicating that I hold the position of Árdstiúrthóir in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, a position of which I am particularly proud. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary. We have held some exceptionally good events. The first took place on the streets of Dublin when the Garda stopped the traffic for us for a couple of hours. Since an old building at 14 Thomas Street was the home of the old Pipers Club, which was founded in 1936 and was responsible for the founding of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in Mullingar, our first function was held there.</P>
    <P>Last weekend we went to Mullingar. Two of the founders are still alive. One is an uileann piper, Willie Reynolds from County Westmeath, and the other is Paddy McElvaney from County Monaghan. We were able to celebrate with both men and many others and it was a wonderful reception.</P>
    <P>We also went to Leeds where we had an excellent weekend which recognised the great work which people living abroad have carried out for our culture, not just for music but also for the language. In many ways they gave courage to those of us at home. When we were getting lackadaisical or afraid to put our heads above the parapet they were always doing so as it was their mark of identity and the means by which they could come together to celebrate their roots. We will travel to Toronto in April where over 2,000 people from all over the US and Canada are already registered and will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the organisation. An e-mail invitation will be issued to the Minister of State to attend the celebrations.</P>
    <P>The important thing about Comhaltas is that, together with organisations such as RTÉ, or 2RN as it was known, and people like Ciarán MacMathúna, Seán MacRéamoinn, Séamus Ennis and others, it has been able to bring music <Col N="706" /> back to centre stage so it is not elitist. The proof of their success was that the All-Ireland Fleadh Ceoil in Enniscorthy last year attracted 230,000 people, 10,000 of whom were performers, most of whom were young. This highlights the fact that the young generation has taken the culture on board.</P>
    <P>Aon áit a bhíonn an ceol bíonn an timpeallacht báúil don Ghaeilge agus tugaim faoin deara go gcuireann na daoine óga atá ag gabháil don cheol suim sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Celebrating the 50th anniversary of any organisation is not about blowing trumpets, beating drums or patting ourselves on the back but about refreshing our idealism and re-examining what we have done. One of the greatest achievements of Comhaltas was to harmonise relationships on this island. Comhaltas has 70 branches in Northern Ireland which involve both traditions. This was underlined by the fact that the DUP, the UUP, Sinn Féin and the SDLP wrote to me asking that we bring Fleadh Ceoil na hÉireann north of the Border. I have never seen those four parties agree, yet they agreed on the fact that they would like to see 200,000 people from all over the world going north of the Border to celebrate something in which we all have a common interest. It is important that we recognise that our heritage is much older and more vibrant than our more recent political divisions.</P>
    <P>Today's newspapers contain articles concerning the most recent report on the tourism industry. One of the headlines refers to the fact that, to be succcessful, hotels and guesthouses should promote Irish culture. This highlights the economic advantage to our culture. We must not only think in mercenary terms. Since Ireland joined the greater European family every Irish person travelling abroad wants to emphasise his or her Irishness. Úsáideann siad an Ghaeilge gach seans a bhíonn acu chun a thaispeáint gur Éireannaigh iad agus go bhfuil oidhreacht agus traidisiún faoi leith acu.</P>
    <P>This is big news. When Comhaltas was founded in the 1950s traditional culture was at a low ebb because of the huge exodus from the country. Employment and commercial concerns were more important then but the spirit of Ireland has been revitalised in many ways. I hope Deputy Coughlan will not mind me saying that we are lucky to have a young Minister of State to give us guidance and leadership as we need energy in this area. It is easy to become tired and weary because we only seem to discuss these issues around St. Patrick's Day. However, these issues are live among the public.</P>
    <P>A scientific survey carried out for the Arts Council some years ago by a leading market research company and Trinity College found that in all age groups, geographic locations and classes, Irish traditional music was the premier pursuit above any other living art form. This is not a boast but it places in context the fact that <Col N="707" /> the majority of people of all ages are embracing this culture.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are having this debate on the language and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann underlines the recognition being given to them by the State and the House. I hope that whatever divisions they created will be forgotten. The language belongs to the whole nation and we should all work together and enjoy it. The language should be a cause for celebration and enjoyment as it does not have to be treated in an overly-serious manner. We should not correct people if their grammar is incorrect. We could all be corrected on our English grammar yet this does not happen because it is not good manners to do so. Therefore, it should not be good manners to correct someone's Irish grammar. We should be allowed to use whatever Irish we have in an open, free and generous manner.</P>
    <P>Without the Gaeltacht most of us would never have been exposed to the language in the manner in which we were. The Gaeltacht made an impact on us but also proved that Irish was a living language which could remain so in the most progressive country in Europe. The important point was that Irish continued to be a functional and not just a literary language. We always look to the Gaeltacht in that regard.</P>
    <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus leis an Teach as ceiliúradh Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann a cheangal leis an nGaeilge. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé de mhisneach ag Seanadóirí eile amach anseo labhairt ar an ábhar seo i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé deacair orm labhairt ar an ábhar atá á phlé againn inniu. Aontaím le nócha faoin gcéad den méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú ach ní aontaím leis an bpíosa deiridh. An deacracht atá agam leis agus leis an méid a dúirt an tAire i dtosach ar maidin ná an comhthéacs as a dtagann sé. An t-aon rud diúltach a déarfaidh mé ná nuair a thosaíonn an tAire Stáit le cliché mar Tír gan Teanga, Tír gan Anam, táimid caillte agus tá an argóint caillte againn arís agus arís eile. Seo í an fhírinne. D'fhéadfadh an tír seo dul ar aghaidh leis an bhforbairt chéanna is atá ar bun anois, gan an teanga. Ach is iomaí duine a bhfuil an <Col N="708" /> dearcadh seo acu. Agus ní mór dúinn é sin a thuiscint, before we take another step. Caithfimid teagmháil a dhéanamh leis na daoine seo chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom féachaint ar cheist na nGaeltachtaí. Maidir le polasaithe an Stáit i leith na Gaoluinne ó bunaíodh an Stát, an deacracht is mó leo ná go raibh na polasaithe sin dírithe níos mó ar Ghalltachtaí ná ar Ghaeltachtaí. Nílim ag cur an milleáin ar aon Rialtas faoi leith.</P>
    <P>Ós rud é gurb iad na Gaeltachtaí foinse na teanga ba chóir dúinn gach rud a chur in ord sna Gaeltachtaí i dtosach. What does that mean? Go bhféadfadh daoine a saoil a chur isteach trí mheán na Gaoluinn, go mbeadh oideachas le fáil trí Ghaoluinn ag na trí leibhéal difriúla sa Ghaeltacht. Gan sin ní éireoidh linn.</P>
    <P>Do chaith mé inné agus arú inné ag tabhairt cuairte ar gach scoil Ghaeltachta i gCorca Dhuibhne chun ceist na Gaoluinne a phlé leo, féachaint cad iad na deacrachtaí atá acu agus cad atá ag teastáil uathu. Tá staid na Gaoluinne ag cur isteach ar na múinteoirí sna scoileanna sin. In a lán de na scoileanna Gaeltachta tá cuid mhaith de na leanaí ag teacht isteach chucu gan Gaoluinn ón gcliabhán, nó mar theanga baile. Bhí mé i scoileanna i nDún Chaoin, sa Daingean, sa Ghleann, i bhFeothanach agus i ngach aon cheann acu bhí leanaí ann gan Gaoluinn. I gcásanna eile chuaigh tuismitheoirí na leanaí thar lear fiche bliain ó shin, d'fhill siad arís, agus is i Londain nó áit mar é a rugadh na leanaí agus níl Gaoluinn acu.</P>
    <P>Bhuail mé le leanaí inné faoi aois a deich ón nGearmáin, ón Iosréil, ón Spáinn, atá ag dul ar scoil i nDún Chaoin. Is breá an rud é sin ach cén fáth nach mbeadh na hacmhainní agus an tacaíocht chéanna ag na scoileanna sin is atá ag gaelscoileanna sa Ghalltacht. It is nonsense. Na scoileanna sin ag iarraidh agus gach fadhb acu agus gan de thacaíocht acu.</P>
    <P>Ar an gcéad lá Meán Fómhair cuireadh an curaclam nua Gaoluinne do na Gaeltachtaí i bhfeidhm sna scoileanna Gaeltachta. Níl téacsleabhar ar bith foilsithe don chúrsa nua ná níor cuireadh go leor oiliúint inseirbhíse a chur ar na múinteoirí. Chaith mé cúpla uair a chloig le múinteoirí i scoil ar an mBuailtín maidin Dé Luain agus bhí teacsanna nua curtha le chéile ag múinteoirí sa scoil sin do scoileanna eile sa timpeallacht. It is not as if this was not anticipated. Chuaigh mé féin go dtí an tAire Oideachais bliain ó shin agus d'impigh mé air cúpla múinteoirí a thógáil amach as na scoileanna ar feadh sé mhí nó mar sin &ndash; níl na comhlachtaí foilsitheoireachta sásta infheistiú a dhéanamh i margadh chomh cúng &ndash; chun téacsanna a chur le chéile a d'fhéadfaí a fhoilsiú ansin le go mbeadh siad ann in am. Ach ní dhéanfadh an Roinn é sin.</P>
    <P>Is trua go bhfuil an Seanadóir O Murchú imithe mar baineann a lán de na rudaí a dúirt sé mar gheall ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann go dlúth leis an gceist seo. Bhí an ceart aige go raibh nach <Col N="709" /> mór ceathrú milliúin daoine ag an bhFleá anuraidh. Ach bhí a dhá nó a thrí oiread sin de leanaí óga ag freastal ar rock concerts i gcaitheamh na bliana chomh maith. Ach caithfidh balance a bheith ann idir an dá rud.  </P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir go mbeadh cuireadh á fáil ag an Aire dul go Toronto. Labhair mé féin le dreamanna daoine i dToronto agus bhí Comhaltas ina measc agus ní raibh siad ró-shásta leis an méid a dúirt mé. Agus mholfainn don Aire an rud céanna a rá leo. Cheap mé go raibh siad i time warp ó na caogaidí. Dúirt mé leo gur bhreá an rud cultúr na Gaoluinne a bheith ansin acu agus an-suim acu sa traidisiún ach an rud is tábhachtaí ná nach bhfuil i dtraidisiún ach cultúr agus gur thosaigh gach gné de thraidisiún agus cultúr na tíre i measc daoine a bhí ag fás agus ag forbairt agus go mbíonn sé de shíor ag dul ar aghaidh. Sin atá déanta ag Comhaltas ach ní mór go dtuigfeadh na hÉireannaigh i dToronto nach bhfuil cultúr agus traidisiún na hÉireann teoranta ag Comhaltas agus ag teanga na tíre. Tá i bhfad níos mó ann.</P>
    <P>In addition, Irish culture includes not only Riverdance and the Chieftains but also U2, Sinéad O'Connor and so on. The Minister of State must tell them that. If they cannot hack it, they should forget it. It is all part of it and that is what is important. Is féidir é sin a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn chomh maith. We should not get into the habit in Toronto of falling into the time warp where the only Irish people are those who cannot see beyond 1950. Tá spás do gach aon rud ann. Bhí mé ag caint le fear i nDún Chaoin inné, i bhfoinse na Gaoluinne. Tháinig turasóir inár dtreo. Bhí gnéithe de chultúr na Gaoluinne ar gach taobh dínn &ndash; teach mhac Pheig Sayers, Krugers, an Chultúrlann &ndash; agus an cheist a chuir an turasóir seo ná Where is the house belonging to Dolores Riordan, the lead singer with the Cranberries? There was nothing wrong with that. However, unless we accept that is where we are at agus an duine a chuir an cheist seo, bhí meas agus grá aici don teanga. She was also a rock supporter.</P>
    <P>People do not just come here for these things. Tiocfaidh siad go dtí an tír seo chun báthadh inár gcultúr agus sa chultúr tá teanga, na cultúrlann, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann a bhfuil an-jab déanta acu. They have given a new life don teanga, but as well as that we also must include U2, Sinéad O'Connor, Dolores O'Riordan and others. If we cannot have that leis an teanga then we are simply killing it. Because an deacracht atá ann, if I can murder a metaphor, ná go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh Gaeilge a bhrú siar scornaigh daoine óga inár scoileanna ach ní hiad na daoine óga atá á thachtadh againn ach an teanga féin. Sin an comhthéacs nach luaitear.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir dúinn infheistiú a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht le go mbeidh oideachas de gach leibhéal ar fáil ann agus fostaíocht chomh maith. Ansin d'fhéadfadh an Ghaeilge dul amach ó na Gaeltachtaí in ionad mar atá ar siúl faoi láthair, é á tharraingt ó na Gaeltachtaí. Tuigeann an saol <Col N="710" /> na hargóintí agus na deacrachtaí a bhíonn agamsa lá i ndiaidh lae le han-chuid de na heagrais Ghaoluinne. Tá sé mar aidhm againn go léir go mbeidh Gaoluinn ar a dtoil ag muintir na hÉireann. The problem I have with that is that dá dtarlódh sé sin tomorrow morning, how many of the eagrais Ghaoluinne would care then about those people ar imeall na tíre seo in the west of Ireland who are members of the Gaeltachtaí now? That is why we must have a commitment to them. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an chuid sin dá Dáilcheantar atá ina Ghaeltacht tábhachtach don Aire Stáit agus tá sé tábhachtach domsa freisin mar tagaim féin ó cheantar atá an-chosúil leis i gCorca Dhuibhne. An rud a chuireann sceoin i gcónaí orm ná go bhfuil níos mó measa ar an teanga ná mar atá ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí. Fiche bliain ó shin tháinig deireadh leis an ngrúpa Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta agus is mór an trua é because they were beginning to hurt and they were beginning to push. Bhí a lán idir láimhe acu agus is trua nach raibh níos mó de sheans acu.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1981 nó 1982 d'fhoilsigh John Wilson, más cuimhin liom, Páipéar Oideachais agus bhí giota ann dírithe ar an nGaoluinn agus ba mhaith an rud é a léamh anois ag an bpointe seo mar ceann de na rudaí a dúradh mar gheall ar mhúinteoirí ná &ndash; agus tá sé ráite ag cainteoir eile inniu &ndash; go raibh caighdeán Gaeilge na múinteoirí íslithe go mór. I will say it again, the standard of Irish teachers has dropped and there are many reasons for that. Teachers want me to say that. Tá meáchan Athbheochan na Gaeilge ag titim ar ghuaillí na múinteoirí le seachtó bliain anuas. It is not working agus ba chóir dúinn féachaint ar ais ar an méid sin agus ar an bpolasaí.</P>
    <P>I 1924 nuair a d'aistrigh an córas oideachais from an English-language based system to an Irish-language based system, what did we do as a country? Thugamar múinteoirí bunscoile na tíre go dtí na Gaeltachtaí ar feadh trí nó ceithre mhí. We just soaked them in the language. Agus bhí fuinneamh agus coimitmint nua iontu ag a dheireadh agus rinneadh jab an-mhaith sna fichidí, sna tríochaidí agus sna daicheadaí. Ba chóir go mbeadh an seans ann do mhúinteoirí na linne seo. Bheadh sé i bhfad níos áisiúla &ndash; I know people like my colleague, Senator Ross, would no doubt say that I am looking for a free holiday for teachers 'sna Gaeltachtaí. People with no vision may well say that. Ach is cóir rud mar sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh tuiscint ann ar an méid is féidir a dhéanamh sna bun<Col N="711" /> scoileanna agus sna meánscoileanna but we do not have to do it tríd na polasaithe teoranta atá againn faoi láthair. Ní gá an rud a bhrú ar dhaoine. Tá a háilleacht féin ag an teanga. Bhí cruinniú agam leis na múinteoirí go léir i gCorca Dhuibhne i dTeach Pháidín agus dhíríomar isteach ar an teanga agus ar na scoileanna agus ar an sórt tacaíochta a theastaíonn.</P>
      <P>Nílim chun dul tríd na moltaí anois ach cuireadh mé an méid atá ráite againn le Coimisiún na Gaeltachta chuig an Aire, which is so concerned with the Irish language that it did not bother to ask the INTO to nominate a teacher to be a member of that particular comisúin, but we are used to that. It is always easier to blame teachers than to involve them. There is always a good market for blaming teachers and always a couple of votes in it. We might just look at an sórt tacaíochta a d'fhéadfaimis a chur ar fáil dóibh agus cuirfear na moltaí chuig an Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>Tá an-jab déanta ag Comhaltas agus aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú futhu. Ach impím ar an Aire féachaint ar Chomhaltas i gcomhthéacs níos leithne. Tá spás ann don Chomhaltas ach ba cheart tacú le gnéithe eile den chultúr freisin.</P>
      <P>I do not have the motion in front of me, but it refers to an Ghaeilge in the 21st century. We have to know what the Irish for Indie music is, and rudaí mar sin, as well, agus a bheith cinnte go bhfuil sé suimiúil do dhaoine óga ionas gur féidir leo na rudaí sin go léir a bheith acu agus an teanga chomh maith. In fact, one would see many of the same people who go to the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann the following week up in the National Concert Hall listening to the National Symphony Orchestra, or at a rock concert. They are people who love music wherever they hear it.</P>
      <P>Comhaltas has given Irish music a pride of place that was not there 30 or 40 years ago. It is only in the last 30 years that it has really made an impact, putting it at a level among young people with rock and other contemporary music. One type of music should never overwhelm another; the objective should be a decent inter-action and a recognition of Irish music.</P>
      <P>I will finish as I began by congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, on her appointment. I sincerely mean what I said at the beginning, that the contribution of her family to education, and in particular primary education, over generations, on islands and on the mainland, is something to be admired. The Minister of State's father taught on Gola Island where we are trying to rebuild the old fothrach of a school house there. I am sure everybody would appreciate it if the Minister of State examined that possibility.</P>
      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire díriú isteach ar na Gaeltachtaí agus féachaint ar an méid atá le rá ag gach aon ghrúpa agus go n-éirí lei.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an Aire Stáit nua. Tugann sé dóchas domsa duine úr nua <Col N="712" /> lúfar a fheiceáil i mbun na Gaeilge. Fé mar a dúirt an cainteoir deiridh, is mór an tacaíocht atá tugtha ag clann an Aire Stáit do chúrsaí oideachais na tíre seo. Is maith an rud é an tAire Stáit a bheith i bhfeighil ar an nGaeilge ag an tráth seo agus tosach na haoise nua. Guím rath ar gach atá roimh an Aire nua as seo amach agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh sí taitneamh as a post nua chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an rún atá romhainn ar maidin agus is ciallmhar agus deas an rud an Ghaeilge a bheith á plé againn i gcomhthéacs Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Bhí an-mheas ag mo chlann ar an nGaeilge mar bhí an mhúinteoireacht mar ghairm againne. Ach nuair a bhí mé óg i gCiarraí bhí an-bhaint idir an Ghaeilge agus an bochtanas agus an scolaíocht agus ní raibh sí suite in aon chomhthéacs níos leithne ná sin.</P>
      <P>An-chuid daoine, nuair a bhí deireadh leis an scolaíocht bhí deireadh leis an nGaeilge leis agus thug siad droim láimhe leis. An-chailliúint a bhí ansin don teanga. Ach tá athrú meoin ar aos óg na linne seo i leith na Gaeilge agus ceann de na fáthanna ná go bhfuil an Ghaeilge lonnaithe i gcultúr atá níos leithne ná cultúr na scolaíochta amháin. An éacht oibre atá déanta ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann chun gach gné dár gcultúr a cheangail leis an nGaeilge, dhein sé an-difríocht do mhuintir na tíre seo. Muna mbeadh aon rud eile ach é déanta bheadh buíochas na tíre ag dul dóibh. Mar níl an Ghaeilge lonnaithe sa bhochtanas a thuilleadh. Tá spraoi agus spórt agus compánachas ag baint lei agus is de bharr an borradh faoin gceol Gaeilge, faoin rince agus faoin spórt atá sé ag tarlú.</P>
      <P>Cothaíonn ceol, rince agus scéalaíocht sprid agus má bhíonn an sprid i gceart tiocfaidh rudaí eile. Measaim gur cheart agus gur chuí go mbeadh an díospóireacht anseo inniu a cheangail leis an éacht atá déanta ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Guím rath orthu don chéad leathchéad bliain eile mar tá éacht oibre fós le déanamh.</P>
      <P>Bhí an-bheocht ann maidir le cothú na Gaeilge céad bliain ó shin. Cúrsaí staire ba chúis leis sin. Ach is maith an rud ceist na Gaeilge a iniúchadh ag tosach aoise nua. An bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul i léig nó ar aghaidh? Más i léig atá sí ag dul cad ba cheart a dhéanamh i dtreo is nach déarfar fúinne amach anseo gur sinne an ghlúin a lig don Ghaeilge idir litríocht, teanga agus cultúr sleamhnú uainn. Níor mhaith liom go ndéarfaí a leithéid fúmsa ach go háirithe.</P>
      <P>Dá mbeadh páistí agam &ndash; agus bhí an-chuid páistí agam tráth nuair a bhí mé i mo mhúinteoir scoile agus ní Gaeilge a mhúin mé ach Béarla agus ábhair eile &ndash; measaim muna mbeadh siad in ann filíocht Sheáin Uí Ríordáin agus drámaíocht agus filíocht eile na Gaeilge a léamh as Gaeilge go mbeadh feall a dhéanamh agam orthu. Caithfimid ár gcion a dhéanamh chun an teanga a choimeád beo i dtreo is go mbeidh sé ar chumas an ghlúin atá ag teacht aníos teacht ar litríocht na Gaeilge agus a háilleacht agus ar a ceol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Tá sé de dhualgas orainn ár gcion a dheanamh chun an Ghaeilge a neartú agus a chothú. Is mór an dúshlán é sin nuair atá an cultúr domhanda ag brú isteach orainn ar gach taobh ach tá áiseanna againn anois nach raibh ann caoga bliain ó shin, an teilifís agus an t-Idirlíon, mar shampla.Tá an deis ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh trí mheán na teilifíse go mór.</P>
    <P>Tá éacht oibre déanta ag TG4. Stáisiún nua é agus tá úire agus stíl agus beocht ag baint leis. Mar a dúirt mé leis an Aire de Valera an tseachtain seo caite anseo, caithfear níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt do TG4. Tá na scileanna ag na daoine óga agus d'fhéadfadh siad níos mó a dhéanamh ach an t-airgead a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Tá an teilifís an-chumhachtach. Phléamar fotheidealú leis an Aire seachtain ó shin. D'fhéadfaí i bhfad níos mó clár Gaeilge a chur amach ar RTÉ 1 ach fotheidil a bheith againn. Bhí gach duine i mo theachsa &ndash; cairde agus mé féin &ndash; ag breathnú ar Léargas aréir. Cuid de na héisteoirí is beag Gaeilge a bhí acu ach bhí siad in ann scéal an chláir a bhreith leo ó na fotheidil. Tá an teicneolaíocht againn anois chun é sin a dhéanamh agus má táimid dáiríre faoin nGaeilge ba chóir níos mó airgid a infheistiú i bhfotheidealú. Is iontach an meán é chun cultúr a chothú agus cumarsáid a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím leis <i>The Irish Times</i>, an t-aon páipéar laethúil go bhfuil Gaeilge le fáil inti. Tá An Peann Coitianta le Liam Ó Muirthile go hiontach mar phrós. Ní amháin go bhfuil stíl agus líofacht ag baint leis ach tá na smaointe atá ann go hiontach chomh maith. Bíonn sé sa pháipéar uair sa tseachtain agus bíonn colún Gaeilge eile ann laethanta eile.</P>
    <P>Is bocht an scéil nach ndéanann na nuachtáin eile morán chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh. Is í an Ghaeltacht foinse na Gaeilge ach ansin amháin ar chóir di a bheith. Ní haon mhaitheas foinse muna leathnaítear amach ón bhfoinse. Cúis buartha dom an difríocht mhór idir na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla. Is cuimhin liom dul chun na Gaeltachta nuair a bhí mé i mo mhacléinn agus an-spórt a bheith agam ann. Bhí oideachas ar fáil ann nach raibh ar fáil ó na mná rialta, agus é go léir trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Muna mbíonn déantúsaithe agus fostóirí sa Ghaeltacht ní bheidh ann ach tithe samhraidh. Caithfear é sin a sheachaint. Deir daoine anois gur ghá an congestion atá sa chathair seo a leigheas tríd an daonra a leathnú amach agus déantúsaithe a mhealladh go dtí ceantair eile. Sin fealsúnacht an Rialtais seo ach ní haon mhaitheas an fhealsúnacht gan tréaniarracht chun é a chur i gcrích. Muna mbíonn rachmas sa Ghaeltacht rachaidh sí i léig bliain i ndiaidh bliana. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit iarracht níos treise a dhéanamh chun eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta a neartú mar má dhéanfar, beidh foinse na Gaeilge slán.</P>
    <P>Rud a thugann dóchas dom ná na comharthaí ar na siopaí i gCorcaigh &ndash; tá a bhformhór sa dá theanga anois. Nuair a bhíonn daoine ag dul timpeall na cathrach feiceann siad an Ghaeilge scríofa agus téann sé sin i bhfeidhm orthu &ndash;<Col N="714" /> bíonn visual appreciation acu go bhfuil teanga eile sa tír seo. Coimeádann sé an rud scríofa beo, dúinn féin agus do na turasóirí.</P>
    <P>Muna mbíonn an rud scríofa ann, ní bheidh an teanga ann. D'fhoghlaim mo ghlúin féin Fraincis don Ardteist, agus fiche bliain i ndiaidh fágáil na scoile, níl focal Fraincise againn. Ní raibh greim daingean go leor againn ar an litríocht chun an teanga beo a thabhairt linn. Caithfear an dá rud a dhéanamh. Muna mbíonn an teanga beo ní fiú tráithnín é ach tá an litríocht tábhachtach freisin, mar underpinning don teanga.</P>
    <P>Rud a chuir an-drochmhisneach orm féin nuair a bhíomar ag caint faoin bhfilíocht a scríobhadh i nGaeilge le linn na haoise sin, daoine áirithe a bhfuil an-mheas agam ar a gcuid filíochta, níor deineadh tagairt ar bith dóibh &ndash; Máire Mhac an tSaoi, mar shampla. Nuair a bhí cnuasach filíochta á réiteach don aois, níor deineadh tagairt ar bith d'fhilíocht na mná uasail sin ná don méid a rinne sí féin agus a clann chun an fhilíocht agus an teanga a choimeád beo.</P>
    <P>Dá bhféadfadh an tAire labhairt leis na foilsitheoirí agus a rá leo go bhfuil an-chuid sárfhilíochta a cumadh san aois dheiridh nach bhfuil á foilsiú acu. Cuimhním freisin ar phrós iontach Sheáin Uí Ríordáin &ndash; bhíodh colún iontach aige san <i>Irish Times</i> tráth. Níl sé le fáil in aon leabhar go fóill. Thabharfadh sé an-phléisiúr dom an saghas sin próis a léamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí gur cheart a dhéanamh gan mhoill i dtosach na haoise seo ionas go mbeidh rudaí maithe ar fáil don chéad ghlúin eile le nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge á samhlú acu leis an scolaíocht amháin, mar ab amhlaidh dúinne. Ní ceart go dtiocfadh deireadh leis an nGaeilge tar éis na scoile agus ní chóir go dtarlódh sé sin anois le TG4 agus le Raidió na Gaeltachta. Molaim Raidió na Gaeltachta as scéalta an ghnáthdhuine a choimeád beo. Tá sé relevant agus tá éacht oibre déanta acu.</P>
    <P>Tá dúshlán an-mhór romhainn ach tá dóchas agam go bhfuil an fhís, an t-eolas agus an fuinneamh ag an Aire Stáit chun kickstart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus í a chothú ar bhealach níos láidre.</P>
    <P>Tá sé chomh ciallmhar ceangal a dhéanamh idir na rudaí as a mbainimid taitneamh &ndash; an ceol, an rince agus mar sin de &ndash; agus an nGaeilge agus ba chóir an ceangal sin a choimeád go docht. Má tharlaíonn sé go bhfuil tedium ag baint leis an nGaeilge, ní mhairfidh sí. Tá seans anois go mbeidh athbheochan nua ann agus molaim an obair atá déanta ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann leis na blianta.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-chuid ceoil dúchasach le clos sa cheantar inar fhás mé suas ach ní raibh meas ag na daoine air mar ní bheadh aon bhaint ag an Symphony Orchestra ná a leithéid leis. Cheap siad gur rud níos úrísle a bhí ina gceol féin, go dtí gur thosaigh Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus go ndeachaigh sé timpeall na tíre ag tabhairt aitheantais don cheol áitiúil ionas gur chothaigh sé meas níos mó air i measc an phobail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> I mo thaithí féin, daoine a bhfuil meas acu ar cheol de shaghas amháin, bíonn meas acu ar gach cineál ceoil. Más féidir na daoine óga a mhealladh isteach go dtí an ceol dúchasach is féidir leo aithne a chur ar dhaoncheol thíortha eile. Tá an deis acu teacht ar shaghasanna eile ceoil agus cuireann sé sin go mór le leathnú meoin agus croí daoine óga. Nach é sin an rud atá uainn mar pholaiteoirí? </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my contribution in English, not that I do not have some knowledge of Irish. When I left primary school I was more fluent in Irish than in English, but my Irish has fallen into disuse, though I understand most good speakers, such as Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú. I always say the only person I understand very well is the person who reads the news in Irish as his grammar is perfect. However, Senator Ó Murchú's broadcasting skills came across as I understood him very well when he spoke.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and most warmly congratulate her on her promotion to the office of Minister of State. I have many friends on the other side of the House, of whom she is one. She is an ideal choice as Minister and I wish her every success. I know she will bring great commitment and sincerity to the post. I wish her the very best of luck.</P>
      <P>This debate is all about the Irish language in the 21st century. The essential badge of our culture and our identity is our language. Half of the people surveyed in the last census said they had some knowledge of Irish and about 10 per cent of those use it as their everyday language. However, use of and appreciation for the language in the 20th century was not a great success story.</P>
      <P>I come as Dungar, Frenchpark, County Roscommon, and one of the figures that will always be associated with the language and its revival is Dubhglás de hÍde. He was born in Castlerea, County Roscommon, in 1860 and spent his childhood in Frenchpark. He did not come from a Gaelic background. However, being a natural linguist he was a wonderful speaker not only of Irish but of Hebrew and Greek as well. In the vicinity of Dungar, where his father was the parson of Portahard church, he learned Irish from the local people in the 1870s and 1880s. I know practically everyone in that area and it is extraordinary that today they do not even have a single phrase of Irish. In an area where this man, who made such a wonderful contribution, first learned the language listening to the local people, it has disappeared to the extent that you would not hear a single phrase of Irish used. That is what happened in the 19th century, and we are not proud of much of what happened in the 20th century either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teaching method of the 1950s and later, of which I am a product, was by no means a good way of communicating the language to young people. I am glad that a lot of the fanaticism <Col N="716" /> associated with language promotion movements has disappeared.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that one of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement relates to an all-Ireland body to promote the Irish language. I compliment Foras na Gaeilge, the successor to Bord na Gaeilge, on its work. I have been following its campaign, both on television and radio, and it is very effective. As a result of such campaigns, more and more adults who have some Irish would, like me, be interested in relearning the language. Foras na Gaeilge is quite well funded, with £13 million this year. It also runs the publishing house, An Gúm, which produces textbooks in Irish for schools. Nevertheless, its budget appears to be impressive for the work it has to do. Everything possible should be done to promote that work.</P>
    <P>Given the findings that many adults, like me, whose Irish has lapsed since school would like to relearn the language, it is a pity we do not have an awards system in place. At a certain point of achievement one could be given a certificate and then move on three, four or five stages towards fluency. That is one practical approach. We need an encouragement system to help promote the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister had to say in regard to the long-promised language Bill. I am delighted it is hoped to introduce it in the Houses before the end of the year. It is important that it redefines the role and usage of the language, especially in the public service, and I hope it addresses issues such as that.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Good Friday Agreement is that TG4 will broadcast to Northern Ireland. As far as I am aware, there are many parts of Northern Ireland and Ulster where TG4 is not yet received. It is very important that issue is addressed. Naturally money is needed for that, but since it is an important medium there should be no part of Northern Ireland that does not have the facility of receiving the channel. I like watching it and its approach is excellent.</P>
    <P>The Agreement also provides for the availability of funding to programme makers. There is an industry that makes entertainment programmes and sells them to various channels. It is very important that there is funding and every possible encouragement to make programmes in the Irish language to be shown on TG4 and other channels. Professionals in that business often have very good and innovative ideas and funding from the Department is important as TG4 may not be able to afford to make and promote the programmes alone.</P>
    <P>One criticism is the low level of advertising by Departments on TG4 and in newspapers such as <i>Foinse. </i>Every Department has a huge advertising budget each year to publish its activities or orders. My impression, though I may be wrong, is that 98% of that money goes to English language publications and television. It is something that needs to be considered closely.</P>
    <P>I am delighted discussion of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has added interest to our debate. It <Col N="717" /> is 50 years since it was set up. Its Ardstiúrthóir is a distinguished Member of this House. As someone interested in traditional Irish music, I congratulate Comhaltas for what it has done in the past 50 years in the promotion of Irish music. It has given it an entirely new place in Irish life. Fifty years ago traditional music was disparate. There were thousands of musicians and composers but there was not a single body to bring all their work together. Comhaltas brought those people together. It collected pieces of music which otherwise would have been lost. I understand that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has an archive of such material.</P>
    <P>One of the radio programmes I never miss is that presented by Ciarán MacMathúna on Sunday mornings. Mr. MacMathúna has made, with the co-operation of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, new tapes of old recordings by artists such as Mrs. Crotty from Clare playing her concertina, etc. It is delightful to listen to these recordings. We owe a debt of gratitude to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for collecting the music of Mrs. Crotty and hundreds of other musicians like her and old dance tunes, melodies, etc. Many of these would have long since been lost if it had not been for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>The music of Turlough O'Carolan would almost certainly have been lost had it not been for the work of Seán Ó Riada in reintroducing it into Irish culture in the 1960s and 1970s. O'Carolan was associated with the part of the country in which I live, but I knew almost nothing about him until I heard a wonderful recording of one of his compositions which mixed traditional Irish and classical music. Anyone with an ear for music could not fail to be impressed by his talent.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is to be congratulated for the fact that Irish traditional music is no longer played solely on fiddles, melodeons, accordions or tin whistles. It is now played by a generation of young musicians who use instruments such as the clarinet, which are associated with orchestral music. It is wonderful that traditional music sounds so good when played on instruments one would not normally associate with it or on which it was never originally intended to be played. If one walks down Grafton Street one will see a young person playing a traditional tune on a clarinet or bassoon. That is a new development which must be encouraged. To the purist, traditional music will only sound right when it is played on instruments such as the bodhrán, the fiddle, the melodeon, the concertina, the harp, etc. In my opinion, however, it lends itself very well to being played on other musical instruments with which it was never before associated.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well in her new portfolio. She will be responsible for directing the course taken by the Irish language at the beginning of the 21st century. It is important that we get off to a good start in terms of the way we promote the language. I am always fascinated when I visit Wales that in towns such as Caernarvon people speak nothing but Welsh. We have <Col N="718" /> not yet achieved a similar position here. I would like it if everyone in my home town of Roscommon spoke Irish.</P>
    <P>Approximately 4% of children now attend gaelscoileanna, which are promoted and financially supported by the Government, but one hopes that everything possible will be done to encourage communities to establish them and ensure more children attend. As the Acting Chairman is aware, a new gaelscoil was opened in Roscommon on Monday last. To my knowledge, this is the first gaelscoil to be established in the county and we wish it well. It is important to encourage the proliferation of gaelscoileanna because this will assist in the broad spread of the culture of the Irish language throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas agus bród orm fáilte a chur roimh mo chomhleacaí as Dáilcheantar Dhún na nGall Thiar Theas as ucht a toghadh mar Aire Stáit. Taobh amuigh den phost atá ag an Teachta Ó Maoildhia, tá an dara post is tábhachtaí ag an Aire Stáit nua mar tá seans aici tionchar millteanach a bheith aici ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar na daoine sin sa Ghalltacht a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Tá a fhios agam go n-éireoidh go geal lei mar tá aithne agam uirthi le ceithre bliana déag agus bhí aithne agam ar a hathair agus ar a huncail roimhe sin. Rinne siad obair bhreá i gcúrsaí oideachais. An chéad phost a bhí ag an hathair ná mar oide scoile ar oileán Gola. Beidh mé ag cur brú millteanach uirthi an t-airgead a scaipeadh ar an nGaeltacht atá ar mo thaobhse tíre.</P>
      <P>Tréaslaím leis an iar-Aire as an obair a rinne sé fad a bhí sé sa Roinn. Rinne sé a lán athruithe le linn a sheal ann go háirithe maidir le cuid mhaith de na deontais a thabhairt ar ais, deontais atá iontach tábhachtach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Ba é an bochtanas an chéad rud a samhlaíodh i gcónaí leis an nGaeilge agus go fóill i Litir Ceanainn deir siad liom go dtagaim as áit iargúlta mar go dtagaim ó cheantar Gaeltachta, ceantar na Rossan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinne Éamon Ó Cuív sár-obair go háirithe nuair a ghlac sé na hoileáin isteach sa Roinn. Tá <Col N="719" /> na hoileáin go léir i dTír Chonaill sa Ghaeltacht agus tá trí cheathrú de na daoine atá ina gcónaí ar oileáin amach ó chósta na hÉireann i gceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé feabhsúcháin ar scéim labhairt na Gaeilge agus tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh an tAire Stáit ar an scéim seo mar tá deacrachtaí againn le leanaí atá ag teacht ar ais le tuismitheoirí chun cur futhu ann. Nuair a rugadh duine de na tuismitheoirí lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, tá deacrachtaí acu le deontais tithíochta agus Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé a dhícheall ar son na coláistí samhraidh freisin agus cé go ndeir na mná tí nach bhfuil siad ag fáil a dhóthain go fóill rinne sé an-fheabhsúchán air agus thug sé isteach deontas eile fá choinne feabhsúcháin tithe.</P>
    <P>Ní chuirfidh mé aon rud eile ar an liosta ach beidh mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit.</P>
    <P>Tá an bhliain 2001 ceaptha mar Bhliain Eorpach na dTeanga chun daoine a spreagadh chun teanga eile seachas a máthairtheanga a fhoghlaim. Is maith go bhfuilimid ag plé ceist na Gaeilge anseo inniu. Cé gur Béarla an príomhtheanga atá ag formhór na tíre seo is féidir an bhliain seo a úsáid chun spreagadh a thabhairt do dhaoine Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an bhfuilimid ag tabhairt lip service amháin don teanga anseo inniu mar seo an chéad uair riamh a raibh mise in ann labhairt ar an nGaeilge ó tháinig mé isteach anseo mar ní raibh dóthain ama ann roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Seo an tríú huair a raibh díospóireacht faoin Ghaeilge anseo ach seo an chéad uair a bhi mise in ann labhairt faoin teanga ó tháinig mé go dtí an tSeanad. Ní raibh mórán ama tugtha don ábhar agus bhí barraíocht cainteoirí ann, ach tá seans agam inniu. Thógamar é ar dtús i mí Márta 1999. Thánamar ar ais ar an ábhar i Márta 2000 agus an lá deireanach dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Murchú go raibh daoine eile ag fanacht le labhairt ach dúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív nach mbeadh orainn fanacht bliain eile go dti go mbeadh seans eile againn ach faraor, ghlac sé bliain.</P>
    <P>Is ceart go mbeadh seans againn labhairt faoi theanga na Gaeilge agus faoin Ghaeltacht anseo agus is ceart go n-úsáidfeadh daoine an dá theanga, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Connor. Sílim gurb é an fáth go bhfuil barraíocht ama idir díospóireacht amháin agus díospóireacht eile, mar tá faitíos orainn nach bhfuil go leor daoine ábalta labhairt i nGaeilge. Ach is féidir an dá theanga a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Connor, bhí Gaeilge aige ar scoil agus tharla an rud céanna dom féin. Bhí Gaeilge agam sa bhaile agus ar an mbunscoil ach nuair a chuaigh mé go dtí an mheánscoil d'fhág mé mo bhaile ar feadh 35 bliain. Ní raibh seans agam ansin Gaeilge a úsáid mar ní raibh mé i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht a thuilleadh agus ní raibh mé ag bualadh le daoine ón Ghaeltacht san obair a bhí agam. Nuair a thosaigh mé sa pholaitíocht trí nó ceithre bliain ó shin thosaigh <Col N="720" /> mé ag teagmháil le daoine arís ón Ghaeltacht agus ag déanamh agallamh ar Raidio na Gaeltachta. Tagann an Ghaeilge ar ais le húsáid agus ní ceart faitíos a bheith ar éinne an Ghaeilge a úsáid cé nach mbeadh sé go maith aige; tagann sé ar ais le húsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú milteanach tagtha ar an saol anseo le 30 nó 40 bliain anuas a chuir isteach ar an Ghaeilge. Cé go ndúirt an Seanadóir O'Toole go raibh an Ghaeilge curtha síos sna scórnaigh againn nuair a bhíomar ar scoil, sílim go bhfuil athrú tagtha ar sin anois. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul i laige sa Ghaeltacht mar dar le staidéar atá deanta ar sin níl ach ceathrú de na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ag úsáid na teanga gach lá. Dúirt an tAire Stáit &ndash; agus an Teachta Ó Cuív roimhe sin &ndash; go bhfuil ar a laghad 150,000 daoine ag úsáid na teanga gach lá agus tá suas le 500,000 ag úsáid í b'fhéidir gach seachtain nó gach mí. Tá &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; ansin.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú tagtha. Tá gaelscoileanna ann anois agus tá a lán Gaeilge á labhairt anois sa Ghaeltacht, rud nach raibh ann 30 nó 40 bliain ó shin. Cuirim fáilte roimh an cuidiú agus roimh an t-airgead atá curtha ar fáil do na gaelscoileanna a scaipeann an Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre. Fiú amháin anois tá scoileanna dara leibhéal oscailte, ceann amhain i Leitir Cheanainn i mo cheantar fein ina bhfuil múineadh á dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge agus tá scoil lán-Ghaeilge i mBallinamore atá íontach tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil níos mó aird á thabhairt do na scoileanna seo ná mar atá á thabhairt do scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht. Ba cheart an cuidiú céanna a thabhairt do na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht mar, faoi mar a dúirt mé cheana, níl ach 25% de na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ag úsáid na teanga gach lá ach tá daoine óga ag teacht suas tríd na scoileanna sin. Tá deacrachtaí ag an scoil i mBallinamore leis an gcóras taistil agus ba cheart gach seans a thabhairt dóibh a bpáistí a chur go dtí scoil lán-Ghaeilge mar tá cuid de na teaghlaigh ansin ag cur a bpáistí go Ballybofey agus an scoil Béarla mar tá an bus ag tógaint na bpáistí ann. Níl mise ag déanamh gearán faoi na gaelscoileanna ach ba cheart an tacaíocht chéanna a thabhairt do na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Seanadóir O'Toole ag caint faoi mhúinteoirí agus nílim chun drochmheas a chur ar mhúinteoir ar bith ach nuair a bhí mé ag fás suas agus ag dul ar scoil bhí duine éigin as gach dara theach i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill ag dul ar aghaidh don mhúinteoireacht agus bhi coláistí ullmhúcháin ann. Cuireadh an-bhéim ar an Ghaeilge sna coláistí sin. Fiú amháin taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht tháining daoine ó Chiarraí, ó Ghaillimh agus ó Thír Chonaill ag múineadh i scoileanna ar fud na tíre agus bhí Gaeilge den chéad scoth acu. Tá na múinteoirí uilig anois i gcoláiste amháin agus níl an béim céanna ar an Ghaeilge. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh athrú ar sin.</P>
    <P>Sa chlann agus sa scoil a fhoghlaimíonn an páiste an teanga. Tá áiteanna cosúil le Oideas <Col N="721" /> Gael i nGleann Cholm Chille faoi Liam Ó Cuinneagáin. Ta seisean ag múineadh Gaeilge mar rud pléisiúrtha gan brú ar bith. Tagann daoine ó Mheiriceá ar feadh coicíse agus tagann siad ar ais ar feadh coicíse eile chun Gaeilge a labhairt. Bhí Uachtarán na hÉireann féin, Mary McAleese, ann agus molaim an t-Uachtarán as ucht an t-am a ghlac sí chun iarracht a dhéanamh feabhas a chur ar a cuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl na téacleabhair sna scoileanna chun Gaeilge a mhúineadh agus ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do Ghael Uladh i mo chontae féin atá ag cur na leabhar sin ar fáil. Bheadh deich nó 15 nóiméad eile ag teastáil uaim chun rudaí eile a rá ach ba mhaith liom an-mholadh agus buíochas a thabhairt do Raidio na Gaeltachta agus TG4. Nuair atáim sa bhaile ní éistim ach le Raidio na Gaeltachta nó Highland Radio ach nílim ábalta Highland Radio a fháil nuair atáim amach as an contae. Tugann sin an-chuidiú chun mo Ghaeilge a chleachtadh. Mhol daoine eile TG4. Tá obair íontach tábhachtach á dhéanamh ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ach ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfaidís leathnú ar an Ghaeltacht. Tá dhá pharóiste inár gceantar, Ard a' Ratha agus na Gleannta ach níl ach píosa beag sa Ghaeltacht. Ta neart Gaeilge ag daoine eile sa cheantar sin atá suite idir Gleann Cholm Cille agus ceantar na Rossa. Ni ceart áit a tharraingt amach as an Ghaeltacht ach áiteanna mar sin a chur isteach ann.</P>
    <P>Guím gach dea-rath ar an Aire Stáit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an fáilte atá curtha roimh an iar-Sheanadóir Dé Brún agus roimh na daoine ó Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Cuirim fáilte croíúil rompu uile. Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire Stáit ar ócáid a céad óráid sa tSeanad mar Aire Stáit. Guím gach rath uirthi ina post nua. Guím buíochas leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Ó Cuív, agus ba mhaith liom gach rath a ghuí air ina dhualgais nua.</P>
      <P>Tá bunshraith maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge i ngach gné den saol anois. Tá Raidio na Gaeltachta agus TG4 ag cur go mór leis an mbunadh seo. Tá cláracha tarraingteacha ann don lucht éisteachta agus féachana ar na stáisiúin sin. Admhaím nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go flúirseach agam ach is féidir le gach duine, óg is aosta, saibhir nó daibhir, tacaíocht a thabhairt do atbheochaint na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the comments of previous speakers about what can be done for the language. We talk about the renaissance of Irish and fostering the language but much more can be done. The Minister of State is fortunate to have Gaeltacht Gaoth Dobhair i gcontae Dún na nGall. Unfortunately, in my native county, Westmeath, we do not have a Gaeltacht but I am pleased that my neighbouring county, Meath, does. The presence of the Gaeltacht in county Meath has had a ripple effect in fostering the language in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much could be done by various organisations to improve the usage of the language. The <Col N="722" /> Minister for State might consider having discussions with the Vintners Federation of Ireland. Most people, drinkers and non-drinkers, go into a pub. It would be useful if she had discussions with them and restaurant owners. In Mullingar, there is one fast-food outlet, which has a bi-lingual menu. The owner is originally from Italy. Is fíor sin.</P>
    <P>In my local authority, Westmeath County Council, we have a few items as Gaeilge &ndash; na miontuairiscí, comhfhreagras. However, I believe we could do much more. About three of us out of the 23 members sign our names as Gaelige. People will say that is a very small thing. A small beginning is very important. The most important step in a million mile journey is the first one. All those steps, of themselves, are important.</P>
    <P>Many of the old place names here have been pushed to one side and replaced by new buzz names. We should, where possible, revert to the old place names. It is very important when going through a town or village to read the Irish version of the name, because the English one is purely an Anglicisation of the Irish version and means absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that we have a flourishing gaelscoil in Mullingar &ndash; Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn &ndash; agus tá mé fíorbhuíoch don Aire Oideachais go bhfuil scoil nua á bhunú sa Mhuileann Cearra agus go bhfuil suíomh ann chun an scoil a bhunú air.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by Senator O'Toole. Everybody has a role and can contribute to the renaissance of the language, including the young and old, the rich and poor. The poorest man or woman would make a great contribution to society if they, in their own small way, could contribute to the renaissance of the language.</P>
    <P>When I was in college, it was regrettable that there was a degree of elitism associated with the language. That elitism almost killed the language. Madraí ina gcodladh, fág ina luí iad. We will leave that where it is. I am glad that people now have a pride in the language, including those of us who do not have a natural talent for speaking it. I am very proud to appear on national radio and television in this House and utter my few words as Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the VFI, the GAA is another organisation that has done much work but I believe it could do more. The Christian Brothers have made a great contribution to the fostering of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As someone living in Mullingar, it would be very remiss of me not to mention that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded in the town 50 years ago. I am delighted that, as a member of Westmeath County Council, I submitted a notice of motion, which was unanimously accepted by the council, to accord an address of recognition to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. I am delighted that the Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú was there to receive that along with other members, including the president, An tUasal Ó Suibhne.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> When Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded, some 50 years ago, it was almost an act of shame to play traditional Irish music. I am delighted that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has now found its way into every country throughout the world. While he was not an Irishman, the passing of the late Jimmy Shand just before Christmas will be bemoaned by many an Irishman who spent time in Scotland.</P>
    <P>The language can only be restored through the co-operation of everyone and it is true to say: &ldquo;You can lead a Celt, you'll never drag him&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus tá an post tuillte aici. Agus í ina bean óg nuair ba chóir di a bheith ag déanamh rudaí a bhfuil níos mó spóirt ag baint leo ná a bheith ag dul timpeall na háite seo le seandaoine, cuirim fáilte roimh an dul chun cinn atá déanta aici.</P>
      <P>Léigh mé an méid a dúirt an tAire Stáit agus ní fhéadfaí cur ina choinne. Táimid ar aon aigne faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge agus tá dea-thoil don Ghaeilge ann go forleathan. Is cuimhin liom go raibh daoine áirithe ag iarraidh feachtas a eagrú i gcoinne Theilifís na Gaeilge ach ní fhéadfadh siad teacht ar pholaiteoir ar bith a bhí sásta aon rud a rá i gcoinne an phrionsabal go mba chóir go mbeadh córas teilifíse againn a bheadh dírithe ar an nGaoluinn a chur ar fáil. Is iontach an rud é.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an tAire Stáit figiúr agus glacaim leis ach níor luaigh sí go bhfuil thart ar 6,000 teanga ar domhan. Den 6,000 sin gheobhaidh leath díobh bás taobh istigh d'achar gearr. Níl ach 3,000 teanga ann gur féidir a bheith dóchasach go mairfidh siad. Agus den 3,000 sin níl ach 300 díobh gur féidir glacadh leis go mairfidh siad. Agus tá an Ghaoluinn san áireamh sa 300 siúd. Sin an brú atá ar theangacha beaga ar fud an domhain. Tá suas le 95% díobh faoi bhrú agus d'fhéadfadh sé tarlúint taobh istigh de chaoga bliain nach mbeadh níos mó ná 300 in ionad 6,000 teangacha ann. Sin cultural diversity nó biodiversity agus mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit ina hóráid sin cailliúint mór é sin don domhan uilig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht agus is iontach an rud go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine ag iarraidh labhairt nach bhfuil dóthain ama againn. An taobh eile den argóint sin ná go bhfuilimid sásta caint a dhéanamh faoi staid na Gaeilge agus a deacrachtaí as seo go deireadh an chéid ach is i <Col N="724" /> réimse na gníomhaíochta is ea a theipeann orainn. An rud a tharla blianta ó shin nuair a bhí mé féin gníomhach i ngluaiseacht na Gaeilge, pé ábhar a bhí le plé ag cruinniú, b'í an Ghaeilge féin a bheadh á plé faoi dheireadh an chruinnithe, in ionad an ábhair.</P>
    <P>Mar atá ráite go dtí seo, is féidir a bheith dóchasach faoi thodhchaí na Gaoluinne &ndash; ní gheobhaidh sí bás sa chéad seo mar tá Gaoluinn cumasach ag an oiread sin daoine. Ach ní fhéadfaí a bheith chomh dóchasach faoin nGaeilge mar theanga pobail sna Gaeltachtaí agus tá rudaí i bhfad níos measa sa Ghaeltacht ná mar a dúirt an tAire. Ba bhreá liom aontú lei go bhfuil 150,000 daoine sa tír seo ag caint Gaoluinn gach lá mar ghnáththeanga pobail. Ní aontaím lei. Déarfainn má tá trian den uimhir sin ag labhairt Gaoluinne chuile lá gurb é sin a mhéid. Déarfainn go gceapann 5,000 daoine sa tír seo a cheapann go bhfuil cónaí orthu i bpobal Gaoluinne.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann sin is a rá go bhfuilim éadóchasach faoi na Gaeltachtaí. Tá an teanga ag dul i léig agus tá an pobal ag dul i nirt mar tá forbairt eacnamaíochta tar éis titim amach iontu cé nach bhfuil sé chomh maith is atá sé i mBaile Átha Cliath. Tá níos mó daoine idir óg agus sean ina gcónaí sna limistéir Ghaeltachta agus tá athrú bunúsach tagtha ar phobal Chorca Dhuibhne, an Ghaeltacht is mó atá ar aithne agamsa. Tá gnáthphobal ann arís &ndash; daoine óga, daoine ag pósadh, leanaí &ndash; ach ní hionann sin is a rá gurb í an Ghaoluinn atá á labhairt acu. Sin í an fhadhb go gcaithfimid tabhairt fuithi.</P>
    <P>Níl aon réiteach simplí ar an gceist ach ba chóir cúpla rud a dhéanamh. Ba chóir go mbeadh duine ar bith arbh ón nGaeltacht di nó dó in ann teach a thógáil chun clann a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht. Sin rud nach féidir le daoine a dhéanamh anois. Na daoine sin a bhfuil cúlra feirmeoireachta acu tig leo suíomh a fháil ag an mbaile ach don chéad ghlúin eile nach mbeidh baint acu leis an talamh, má tá siad ag iarraidh suíomh a cheannach do theach sna cuid is mó de na Gaeltachtaí, ní bheidh siad in ann íoc as.</P>
    <P>Sin an fáth gur chóir féachaint faoin gcóras tithíochta sna Gaeltachtaí ar dhá chúis &ndash; le go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta in ann fanúint sa Ghaeltacht más mian leo agus gan forbairt tithíochta míoiriúnach a chur ar fáil ann a tharraingeodh daoine gan Gaeilge isteach sa Ghaeltacht. Fadhb an-deacair í.</P>
    <P>Is ar phobal na Gaeltachta atáimid ag brath chun an Ghaoluinn a choimeád beo. Cuireann Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4 tacaíocht ar fáil dóibh ach is é an easpa is mó ar TG4 ná easpa airgid agus ba chóir don Rialtas i bhfad níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil dóibh. Sin a deir TG4 i gcónaí agus ní féidir leo airgead a fháil ach ón Rialtas. Ní féidir leo a thuilleadh a dhéanamh gan méadú ar an airgead atá ag dul dóibh.</P>
    <P>Braithim go bhfuil athrú le brath sa Ghaeilge sa chóras tráchtála sa Ghaeltacht &ndash; sna siopaí, sna pubs agus mar sin de. Tá daoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a fheiceann gur féidir airgead a dhéanamh trí pub nó siopa a cheannach sa Ghael<Col N="725" /> tacht agus is trí Bhéarla a dhéantar an gnó iontu. Caithfimid féachaint chuige gur féidir gach gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn ach nílim ag caint faoin gcóras Stáit mar d'fhéadfaí é a dhéanamh ansin, ach ceist níos deacra maidir le siopadóireacht agus gach rud eile a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn ann. Tá trí siopa caifé i bhfoisceacht na háite seo gur féidir a bheith cinnte futhu gur féidir gnó a dhéanamh iontu trí Ghaoluinn. Tá siopa caifé i gCorca Dhuibhne agus ní fhéadfaí a bheith cinnte go mbeadh an freastalaí in ann freagra a thabhairt duit as Gaoluinn.</P>
    <P>Bíonn coimhlint idir mé féin agus an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail i gcónaí faoi chúrsaí oideachais. Níl a fhios agam an fáth go ndeir sé nach ceart gur ar na múinteoirí atá an dualgas múinte teanga. Cé eile a mbeadh an dualgas sin orthu? Caithfimid dea-thoil a chothú ach taispeánann gach pobalbhreith sa tír seo go bhfuil daoine an-dáiríre faoin nGaoluinn agus an-dearfach fuithi. Ná cuirtear an milleán ar ghnáthdhaoine na tíre seo má tá ag teip ar an gcóras oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist agamsa ar an Seanadóir Ó Tuathail. An féidir leis a rá go bhfuil sé cinnte gur féidir le gach múinteoir atá ag múineadh Gaoluinn sna bunscoileanna ábalta comhrá leanúnach a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn. An anecdotal evidence atá agam féin ná cuid mhaith de na bunmhúinteoirí sin, ní fhéadfadh siad leanúint leo ag caint Gaoluinne. Ní orthusan atáim ag cur an locht ach ar an gcóras múinte a chuireann dualgas ar dhaoine nach bhfuil ábalta comhrá a choimeád ar siúl Gaoluinn a mhúineadh do leanaí óga. Ní féidir le daoine mar sin Gaoluinn labhartha a mhúineadh, ach is í an Ghaoluinn labhartha an rud is tábhachtaí atá le múineadh.</P>
    <P>D'fheadfaimis leanúint ar aghaidh ag caint faoin gcóras oideachais agus faoi chórais eile nach iad ach tá sé in am againn caint faoi Ghaoluinn sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil. Tá mé bréan de bheith a rá má táimid ag moladh don phobal gach seans a ghlacadh chun a gcuid Gaoluinne a úsáid ba chóir dúinn córas a chur ar fáil anseo a mheallann daoine chun Gaoluinn a úsáid. Na moltaí a chuir mé os comhair an Tí seo na mílte uair ná ábhar sa bhreis a chur ar an athló gach lá agus é a bheith as Gaoluinn &ndash; ní faoin nGaoluinn ach as Gaoluinn &ndash; le go mbeadh seans eile ag baill an Tí seo rud éigin a ardú ar an Athló agus go mbeadh an t-ábhar agus an freagra i nGaoluinn. Agus an rud céanna sa Teach eile.</P>
    <P>Freisin, ba cheart go mbeadh ag Teachtaí Dála ceisteanna a chur ar Airí Rialtais ach iad a bheith as Gaoluinn. Ba cheart spreagadh agus cúis a thabhairt do mhuintir an dá Thí chun an Ghaoluinn a úsáid. Dá ndéanfaí sin, bheadh dea-chomhartha á tabhairt againn don phobal gur tír dhátheangach í Éire agus gur Oireachtas dátheangach atá againn anseo. D'fhéadfaimis a rá go raibh rud beag déanta againn ar son na Gaoluinne agus go raibh sé faoi dhaoine eile rud beag eile a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le hÉamon Ó Cuív as ucht an méid a rinne sé ar son na Gaoluinne agus na Gaeltachta. Agus ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine atá sa ghailearaí inniu &ndash; an t-iarSheanadóir, Séamus de Brún, a rinne sárobair ar son na Gaeilge i rith a shaoil agus don chultúr. Leis tá Ciarraíoch eile, Éamon Ó hAragáin, Rúnaí Bhord na Gaeilge. Tá fáilte rompu uilig.</P>
      <P>Tá deacracht agam le cuid den méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Riain mar gheall ar na daoine óga sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá an-deacrachtaí iontu, ní leis an teanga agus sna ceantair féin. Tá daoine ag teastáil le go mbeadh teanga ann agus chuige sin tá slí bheatha ag teastáil do na daoine sin. Níl slí bheatha acu faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>An talamh atá i ngach Gaeltacht beagnach is é an talamh is measa sa tír é. Níl faic ag fás ann agus is léir anois nach mbeidh rud ar bith sna Gaeltachtaí i gceann tamaill ach seandaoine agus neantóga. Sin é a dúirt an fear sna Blascaoidí. Dúirt sé go dtiocfadh an lá nuair nach mbeadh san oileán sin ach neantóga. Agus bhí an ceart aige.</P>
      <P>Caithfimid slí bheatha a thabhairt do na daoine ann chun an Ghaoluinn a choimeád beo. Tá sárobair déanta agus á déanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann &ndash; déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Seanadóir Ó Murchú toisc go bhfuil caoga bliain á chomóradh ag Comhaltas. Tá TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta againn ach níl an tÚdarás ag déanamh an obair chun jabanna a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht do na daoine óga. Tá triúr clainne agam féin agus ba mhaith leo slí bheatha a bheith acu i gCorca Dhuibhne. Tá beirt ag obair anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus duine i nGaillimh.

      <P>Ní leor scoileanna lánGhaelacha agus mar sin de a bhunú. Caithfimid poist a chur ar fáil freisin. Tabharfadh an tAire Stáit slí bheatha do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus níl aon dabht ann ansin ach go mairfidh an Ghaoluinn.</P>

      <P>Tréaslaím leis an Aire Stáit nua agus tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sí jab maith. Bhí an post tuillte aici ní amháin ar son na hoibre atá déanta aici féin agus ar son an méid a rinne a hathair, Cathal, agus a huncail, Clement, Teachtaí Dála do Thír Chonaill. They were two of the greatest men I have ever met, two of the greatest Teachtaí Dála, two incredibly hard workers and very true friends. The Minister has taken up the baton and proved herself in her own right, and her commitment and hard work has been rightly recognised by the Taoiseach. I wish her every success in her new post.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go leanfaidh an tAire Stáit leis an gcumann fial atá á thabhairt do Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann ag a Roinn. Tá obair iontach ar bun acu le fada, ní amháin leis an gceol, ach ag tabhairt grá don chultúr Gaelach go ginearálta.</P>

      <Col N="727" /> Comhaltas is a unique organisation which, from humble beginnings, sends the masters of Irish culture to the four corners of the earth. Irish music, dancing and the Irish language are evident in vibrant pockets all over the world, even in countries as far away as Taiwan and Korea. Much of its success must be due to the sterling work of its guiding light, Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú. It is an organisation that cannot get enough help from the Minister's Department, if there is any to give. I am sure the Minister recognises the potential it has for spreading Irish culture throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister's predecessor, now Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, who did sterling work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl a lán Gaeilge agamsa ach is féidir liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit nua. I would also like to speak in English because I think it is important to have a balance in this debate and that the impression is not given in the record that it is confined to Irish speakers. I know that the Minister will take into account in her brief those of us who do not speak as much Irish as we would like.</P>
      <P>I endorse what has been said, especially by my friend and long-standing colleague, Senator Ó Murchú. My family's association with the Senator goes back a long way. I do not wish to age the Senator as he looks far younger than he actually is, as is the case for myself. I also endorse the welcome that has been extended to our former colleague Seamus de Brún, to the Bord na Gaeilge members present and to Bean Uí Murchú. She is an active member of the Arts Council and in her time there has ensured that balance has been injected into that organisation, especially where Irish culture is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take a proactive stance in furthering the bilingualism that is evident in this country. There is no doubt that a great love of the language exists which is a total contrast to the motivation of the so called Language Freedom Movement of 30 years ago. The movement got a lot of publicity but it would look stupid if it were to unfurl its banners in the current environment where there is a pro-active and sympathetic view of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>More people are speaking the language and TG4 has made a major contribution. I hope the Minister will bring her unique approach to ensuring that more of us get the opportunity to speak the language by using the media and TG4 more. I compliment Bord na Gaeilge on its excellent television advertisement depicting a young man entering a restaurant and upsetting the conversation of two young ladies who think he cannot speak Irish. That is the way things are going and long may it continue.</P>

      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch do achan duine a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht seo. Tá sár-obair déanta ag an Seanadóir Ó Murchú agus ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Bhí siad caoga bliain ag fás, tá siad faoi bhláth anois agus go n-éirí leis an obair. Tá a fhios agam faoin obair mhór atá déanta acu anseo agus thar lear agus faoin tsuim atá ag achan duine sna fleánna. Baineann an-chuid daoine sult mór as an sprid agus an traidisiún atá ceangailte le Comhaltas.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor leor moltaí os ár gcomhair inniu agus déarfaidh mé cúpla rud futhu. Ní as an Ghaeltacht domsa, ach ón nGalltacht ach sílim nach bhfuil Galltacht ar bith ann. Cosúil le daoine eile anseo, d'fhoghlaim mé í ar scoil. Bhí suim mhór ag mo chlann sa Ghaeilge  &ndash; bhí m'athair ag teagasc ar oileán Gola agus is Gaeilge ar fad a bhí ansin. Taobh amuigh de sin is beag nár chaill mé mo shuim sa teanga mar ní dheachaigh mé ar scoil sa Ghaeltacht agus nuair a tháinig mé anseo go dtí an ollscoil is beag nár chaill mé an giota beag atá agam. Ach nuair a toghadh mé bhí a fhios agam go raibh sé an-tábhachtach an Ghaeilge a bheith agam mar Theachta Dála agus chun cabhair a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i mo Dháilcheantar féin. Tá a fhios agam go ndéanaim go leor botúin ach leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh agus dá mbeadh cleachtadh ag achan duine bheadh daoine níos compordaí faoi Ghaeilge a úsáid sa Dáil agus sa Seanad agus sa chomhairle contae.</P>
      <P>Nílimid ag cur brú ar dhaoine agus táimid ag caint faoin dátheangachas taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus faoi Ghaeilge amháin sa Ghaeltacht. Tá saibhreas ann agus sin an difear idir muid inne agus na Sasanaigh agus daoine eile  &ndash; tá Gaeilge againn agus tá go leor leor buntáistí ag gabháil lei.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó díospóireachtaí againn ar an nGaeilge. Beidh Bille úr againn anseo i gceann cúpla mí &ndash; Bille Tithíochta &ndash; agus beidh Gaeilge le clos sa Seanad ansin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bille Teanga againn go luath fosta.</P>
      <P>Nuair a amharcaim ar an teilifís anseo sa Teach feicim go bhfuil an clár i mBéarla. Is mór an trua é. B'fhéidir go mbeidh córas dátheangach againn do gach óráid sa Dáil agus sa Seanad amach anseo &ndash; rud beag é na fógraí, na logainmneacha agus tá siad tábhachtach ag an am céanna.</P>
      <P>D'éist mé leis an gcaint faoi chúrsaí oideachais &ndash; faoin difear idir an chabhair a fhaigheann an gaelscoileanna agus an chabhair a fhaigheann scoileanna Gaeltachta &ndash; agus molaim iad uilig. Tá súil agam go mbeidh mé in ann é sin a phlé leis an Aire Oideachais agus is botún é nach raibh na téacsleabhair ann nuair a bhí an curaclam nua á thabhairt isteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aontaím go bhfuil sárobair déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus tá athrú mór anois ar an mbéim ar fhostaíocht do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá daoine ar ardchaighdeán ag teacht amach as scoileanna na Gaeltachta agus téann an chuid is mó acu chuig na hollscoileanna agus na hinstitiúidí agus ní ghlacfaidh siad le poist gan airgead. <Col N="729" /> Mar sin tá sé ríthábhachtach go mbeadh poist sa teicneolaíocht nua agus mar sin de le fáil sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá seans an-mhaith againn é sin a dhéanamh anois agus t súil agam go leanfaidh mo Roinn ar aghaidh ag tabhairt seirbhíse don Ghaeltacht go háirithe maidir leis an Idirlíon agus ISDN agus mar sin de chun fostaíocht úr a chur ar fáil iontu. Teastaíonn uainn go mbeadh daoine sásta obair sa Ghaeltacht agus cur futhu ann agus ní sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra.</P>
    <P>Go raibh maith agaibh as na moltaí agus rachaidh mé tríothu nuair a bheidh am agam. Tá súil agam go mbeidh mé ar ais i gceann cúpla mí. Is iomaí uair a chloisim Gaeilge á labhairt anseo ach is faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta nó an teanga atá siad ag labhairt agus caithfimid rud a dhéanamh faoi sin. Roimhe seo ba ghnách cuid d'óráid a thabhairt i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá mé óg ach tá súil agam go leanfaidh mé leis an obair a thosaigh an t-iarAire Ó Cuív ach go mbeidh difear ann mar go bhfuilim óg agus go bhfuil suim mhór ag an aos óg sa cheol agus sa Ghaeilge. Tá suim ag an aos óg i dteangacha eile mar feiceann siad gur Eorpaigh iad. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh liom rud éigin a dhéanamh le go mbeidh níos mó suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh sí le cloisteáil achan áit.</P>
    <P>Go raibh maith agaibh as an gcuireadh agus déanaim comhghairdeas le Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus tá súil agam go leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis an obair go dtí an chéad toghchán eile.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="EU Beef Proposals and Foot and" RHead="Mouth Outbreak: Statements">
    <Title>EU Beef Proposals and Foot and Mouth Outbreak: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern): I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the EU Commission's proposals for reform of the beef regime and also to deal with the foot and mouth disease issue.</P>
    <P>I will first deal with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The situation in Great Britain is deteriorating on a daily basis and is posing a growing threat to Ireland. The House will recall that the first outbreak of this disease was con<Col N="730" /> firmed in Essex in south-east England on 20 February last. Since then, cases have been confirmed at 21 other locations throughout Great Britain, including one in Anglesey yesterday. I understand that other suspect cases are under investigation in Great Britain as we speak.</P>
    <P>More seriously, I can inform the House that a suspect case is being investigated in Moy, County Down. I must stress that this case has not been confirmed but I am extremely concerned at this development and I am taking appropriate action. The Northern Ireland authorities have restricted the suspect premises. An eight kilometre exclusion zone has been established around the premises within which animal movements are being prohibited. The Border bisects the exclusion zone and it is therefore necessary that my Department takes appropriate precautionary measures with immediate effect to restrict all animal movements within, into and out of an area immediately south of the Border in north County Louth. Arrangements are being made to give effect to this measure.</P>
    <P>This development brings into clear focus the potential risks to Irish agriculture and the economy generally from this disease, and the need for strict enforcement of the controls my Department quickly put in place over the past week. I stress the enormous complexity of putting controls of this nature in place so quickly. Measures have been introduced in such a way as to address the areas of greatest potential risk and have been enhanced as the situation evolves. It has been necessary to engage the assistance of a number of Departments and services, farming organisations, dealers, marts, transport companies and all others involved in any way in the agri-food industry.</P>
    <P>A high level interdepartmental group has been established to co-ordinate efforts which will meet each morning to assess new developments and develop strategies to address new issues as they arise. Representatives of my Department, the Department of Public Enterprise, the Department of Finance, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and others are involved and the first meeting was held this morning at 8.15 a.m. The assistance of others will be sought as required. I assure the House that with the support of this group, the situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis and whatever further actions may be required will be taken.</P>
    <P>In the past 24 hours a number of additional steps have been taken. The importation of horses from Great Britain has been banned. The IRFU, on strong advice from my Department, cancelled the Wales <i>v.</i> Ireland rugby match scheduled for this Saturday. I thank the IRFU for its decision and its concern which predates the cancellation of the match. The Irish Kennel Club has cancelled working farm dog classes at the forthcoming St. Patrick's Day dog show. The Office of Public Works has suspended all work on arterial drainage and is closing Dublin Zoo. It has also been requested that all horseracing, including point to <Col N="731" /> point meetings, and all greyhound events be cancelled until further notice.</P>
    <P>It has also been advised that Irish horses and their connections do not travel to the forthcoming Cheltenham festival of racing and that Irish racing followers do not attend the festival. I was disappointed this morning to hear people say they would go to Cheltenham irrespective of the situation. I do not believe the festival will be held as that would be totally irresponsible.</P>
    <P>These measures are in addition to those already taken, which include a temporary ban on imports of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and on a range of animal products from such animals from 21 February. In addition, staff of my Department throughout the country were put on alert on Wednesday last, four or five hours before the EU Commission took action, while arrangements were made with the Garda and Army authorities for appropriate resources to be sent to the Border area immediately. Advice notices were issued to the industry on the implications of the ban last Thursday. A voluntary ban was imposed on livestock marts in Border counties and on hunting last Friday. Advice to the public on the disease and its implications was included in extensive advertisements in the weekend papers and staff of my Department were on duty over the weekend to assist the public.</P>
    <P>Live sheep imported from Great Britain since 1 February have been monitored and these animals will now be slaughtered. Arrangements were put in place from the outset to ensure that the disinfection of vehicles and people took place at entry points. These arrangements were enhanced over the week and significant resources have been diverted to ensure that disinfection arrangements are fully enforced. This is now the position at all relevant entry points.</P>
    <P>Advice has been given to the public by various means on the measures required to minimise risks of introducing the disease to specific areas. Yesterday we announced a temporary nationwide ban on sales at livestock marts and controls on the importation of used farm machinery from Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is a very high level of awareness among the public on the dangers posed by foot and mouth disease to the economy. This is partly attributable to the campaign launched by my Department since the first confirmation of the disease in Great Britain, but also to the near blanket coverage this topic has received in the media. This level of coverage is to be welcomed because it is clear that the effectiveness of the comprehensive range of measures put in place by my Department will depend to some extent on the behaviour by individuals travelling to and from the UK. Therefore, anything which raises public awareness is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am extremely concerned at reports on &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; and elsewhere concerning the quality of controls at <Col N="732" /> Dún Laoghaire port. Ferries from the UK have not arrived in Dún Laoghaire since Sunday. It was clearly implied by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House this morning that this happened yesterday. Any incident of the type referred to could not have happened since then. Nevertheless, I am having the matter fully investigated. In the meantime, I am making immediate arrangements to redeploy staff from other areas in my Department to Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire port to ensure that the measures in place are being effectively implemented.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many of these measures will cause inconvenience and regret, but they must all be taken as part of the major effort in which we are engaged. With all that is at stake, I am fully confident that the co-operation of all will continue to be forthcoming in giving immediate effect to these and whatever other measures may be required. We will not succeed without such co-operation and commitment. Regardless of the efforts of civil servants, the Garda Síochána and the Army, we need the co-operation of all the people, both North and South. We have the proud status of being a disease free island and we want that to continue. However, we must alert every person on the island about this problem because their future is at stake.</P>
    <P>We also need the co-operation of people from England. I heard someone saying this morning that someone had come from a farming school in England &ndash; I presume it is Cirencester. That person, who is returning to a farm, should not have returned home. It is the moral duty of people not to come home now. No one should be more aware of that than someone involved in farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate any reports of these matters and we will check to ensure the orders we have given are being implemented. In 1967 we asked people not to come home from England for Christmas and they did not do so. Perhaps they had greater discipline then than they have now. We asked people, particularly those involved in farming or animal livestock, not to travel unless it was essential. Whatever chance we have of keeping the disease from coming here on the wind, as the wind direction seems to be in <Col N="733" /> our favour, we must ensure that the people are disciplined and that they co-operate with us, particularly when Anglesey is only 60 miles from here. We must tell those who wish to travel that they are not welcome here at this time because our national interest is at stake.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposals for reform of the EU beef sector, the proposals were adopted by the Commission on 13 February and were discussed in the Agriculture Council for the first time on Monday last, 26 February. The background to the proposals is the outbreak of the BSE crisis which erupted in a number of member states last November and which has led to a substantial reduction in beef consumption within the Union and the loss of major third country markets. The current estimates are that beef consumption in the EU has fallen by 30% and up to 50% of third country markets have been lost to European tenders. These developments pose serious difficulties for the beef sector and the Commission's proposals are designed to enable the industry to cope with the crisis both in the short term and in the longer term.</P>
      <P>Before I comment on the proposals, it would be useful to outline them in general terms. As far as short-term measures are concerned, the ceiling of 350,000 tonnes on sales into intervention will be abolished for 2001 and 2002 to avoid recourse to safety net intervention. In addition, the Commission intends to replace the purchase for destruction scheme with a special purchase scheme which will run until the end of the year. The main difference between the new scheme and the purchase for destruction scheme is that member states would have the option of storing the beef for eventual distribution as food aid or free food to the poorer sections of the community or to destroy the beef if there is no market outlet. In addition, steers would no longer be eligible for the scheme. The rationale behind this proposal is to attempt to circumvent the &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; problems which a large number of member states have with destroying healthy beef.</P>
      <P>The longer-term proposals provide in the main for changes to the premium system. It is proposed that the special beef premium quota be converted into an individual producer quota subject to regional limits based on payments made in one of the years 1997 to 2000, whichever is the highest, plus 3%. The option currently available to member states to waive the 90 head limit is to be removed. The 20% heifer facility in the suckler cow premium is to be amended to require producers to submit heifers for at least 20% of their suckler cow quota. In addition, the option would be increased to 40%. It is also proposed that unused suckler premium rights be frozen in the period 2002 to 2004. The stocking density limit for the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium is to be reduced from 2.0 lu/ha to 1.8 lu/ha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have major difficulties with the Commission's proposals, it cannot be denied that the situation facing the beef industry is extremely <Col N="734" /> serious and that effective measures are needed at EU level to rebalance the beef market. We are in the middle of a crisis which is unprecedented in its scale in any sector, let alone the beef sector. This crisis has led to a major reduction in beef consumption in some European markets. In the case of Germany, consumption has dropped by 80% and prices have fallen by approximately 40%. Given the dependence of the Irish beef industry on export markets both within and outside the European Union, it is in the interests of Irish beef producers that effective measures are taken to restore balance in the beef market. Otherwise, the current market difficulties will continue indefinitely and Irish producers will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <P>That is not to say we are prepared to accept the Commission's proposals as they are currently presented. I have considerable difficulties with these proposals, particularly as they do not include effective supply control measures and, to the extent that supply control measures are being proposed, they are targeted at the suckler herd. This would have a disproportionate impact on Ireland. In addition, I have strong objections to the individualisation of the special beef premium quota because it would give rise to additional bureaucracy and impose severe impediments on inter-farm trade. The proposed reduction in the special beef premium quota is also unacceptable. However, I welcome the proposal to remove the intervention ceiling for 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, the scale of the problem facing the beef sector in the European Union is such that it is likely it will be necessary to purchase substantial quantities of beef into intervention over the next two years. The abolition of the ceiling is designed to prevent prices from falling and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The proposed replacement of the purchase for destruction scheme is designed to ensure that the burden of this scheme is spread more evenly across the member states. At present, only a small number of member states are implementing this scheme which means it is less effective than it should be in removing the surplus and the burden of adjustment is being borne by a small number of member states. That is unfair and I welcome the efforts of the Commission to ensure that all member states become involved in the scheme. However, we have made it clear to Commissioner Fischler, both in the Council and in bilateral discussions, that we are extremely concerned at the proposal to exclude steers from the new scheme at least until the backlog of steers has been removed from the system. I am extremely conscious of the importance for winter finishers of retaining steers in the purchase for destruction scheme and I made this point strongly to Commissioner Fischler. The Commissioner has a good understanding of the significance of this measure for Irish producers.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, effective measures are needed to rebalance the market. The calf processing scheme proved to be a most effective measure <Col N="735" /> and I will be seeking to have it reintroduced. Many member states are opposed to it on animal welfare and ethical grounds but it has proven its worth in the past. Additionally, it is a mechanism to ensure that member states where beef comes predominantly from the dairy herd make a reasonable contribution to the supply control effort.</P>
    <P>While the Commission's most recent proposals concentrate on eliminating the new beef surplus through supply control and intervention type measures, I emphasise that the best long-term solution is to restore consumer confidence in beef and secure the re-opening of those third country markets which have been closed.</P>
    <P>The measures which have been taken at EU level in relation to the ban on meat and bonemeal, the extension of the SRM list and the introduction of rapid BSE testing, are all designed to restore and achieve these objectives. In addition, I have been pressing the Commissioner for an increase in export refunds which would facilitate exports to third countries.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to contemplate the danger posed by the possibility that there may be foot and mouth disease within the island of Ireland. If this occurred, the damage would destroy our beef industry &ndash; and I use the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; in the sense of its financial value &ndash; in addition to social and cultural values inherent in entire communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important debate the House has had recently concerning the agriculture industry. We cannot understate how critically important the situation is for the nation. As the Minister rightly said, this will have a huge effect on many aspects of agriculture and life in general. While I do not wish to criticise for the sake of doing so, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the Minister, were quite lax in reacting to the emergency at an early stage. There was no realisation of the difficult and critical situation the country is facing, and in recent days we have heard stories which illustrate this fact. On Sunday evening, I spoke to a person who arrived in Dublin Airport from England. They may have been on a farm but no questions were asked and no signs were displayed at the airport concerning foot and mouth disease. The point has been made vociferously that the necessary action was not taken. Television advertisements were not used, even though television is the best way of getting a message across. We did not strike a blow which reflected the emergency. While I want to be constructive about the matter, we were not proactive at an early stage in dealing with this problem. Many people have spoken about their personal experiences. We have heard stories about people arriving in the country who were not required to walk across disinfectant mats. I agree with the Minister who said that anyone travelling from an agricultural college to a farm must be responsible in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Not enough notice was given about the foot and mouth emergency, particularly at our ports and airports. The fact that 21 cases of foot and mouth disease have been discovered in Britain brings home the seriousness involved. There is now a real worry that the disease may be north of the Border. The crisis is not only becoming worse by the day but also by the hour. The effect of this situation on the country cannot be underestimated. It will affect people in every walk of life and is not confined to those involved in agriculture. Huge numbers of people are involved in the agricultural sector and the economy depends upon that industry. Towns and cities are dependent on agriculture. We must all be concerned about this national crisis and no one should take the opportunity to have a swipe at others over how the problem is being handled. We must be constructive in handling the matter.</P>
    <P>There will be much hardship as a result of the problem. Farmers are probably at their most vulnerable at this time of year when much expense is incurred due to the use of animal feed and fertilisers. Farm incomes are reduced at this period because not much milk is produced and few cattle are sold. People need to come to the aid of the agricultural industry at this time in order to rescue it. Co-ops and banks should not force farmers to sell stock. Now that the marts are closed I have heard reports that farmers will sell animals privately. The Department must address that situation and not encourage people to sell calves from farm to farm. Something should be done to curb that activity so that people are not forced to sell animals because of hardship. Co-ops and banks should be interested in helping farmers and the country in general. This is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted, and work together. No animal should have to be sold until this crisis is over.</P>
    <P>Other sectors of the economy will be affected if the crisis becomes prolonged, including tourism. I was speaking recently to someone in the tourism industry who was concerned that everything possible should be done to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. People in the tourism sector believe that if this crisis drags on into the summer it will have a detrimental effect on them.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made by those involved in the sporting world. The gentleman from the rugby football union must be commended for the way he spoke on television yesterday. He put the nation's business before sporting interests in calling off a major sporting event. That was a positive response to the crisis, even though many people will be disappointed by the cancellation of the Ireland-Wales rugby game.</P>
    <P>This morning, my own party decided to call off its Ard-Fheis. I would encourage other bodies and organisations to follow that lead. Fine Gael was on a roll and things were going well for us in recent weeks, so it was a big decision but we took it in the national interest. I am delighted to have been a part of taking that decision and I am sure <Col N="737" /> people will appreciate and understand why we took it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Right. I welcome what the Minister has said about dealers and I hope there will not be any sales.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State review the farm assist scheme because some farmers are experiencing hardship? They must buy groceries and other essentials to sustain their families. Perhaps the scheme could be extended on a short-term basis to help such farmers. We are experiencing a crisis about which everyone is concerned and I hope no stone will be left unturned. Young people who did not live through the previous crisis in 1967 do not understand the broader implications of foot and mouth disease and the restrictions that must be put in place to curtail it. They do not realise the effect it could have. A constructive debate and a good advertising campaign are needed. That is why I welcome the debate and much of the Minister of State's contribution. We on this side of the House will do everything to be constructive and helpful.</P>
      <P>I refer to the new EU proposals to address the BSE crisis. I believe Ireland has not yet explained to the EU its heavy dependence on agriculture. We have failed to point out how dependent our economy is on the industry. The new proposals from Brussels are another indication of the need to explain our dependence on agriculture. Ireland is not given credit for the grass-based beef it produces. Ireland produces the best beef in Europe. We have failed to sell that point in Brussels and the proposals will create further hardship for the farming community. The Government must stand firm and promote our case which is unique in terms of the dependence of smaller beef producers. We are not feeding out of feed lots. Most of our beef is produced on grass-based farms and that point must be pushed home.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to stand up to the proposals and fight for what is good for small and mid-size farmers. Never in the history of the State was such a determined fight required to take on the bureaucrats in Brussels and explain Ireland's dependence on agriculture. I wish the Department well in the negotiations and I hope at the end of the day there will be a good reward for the agriculture industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to debate these important and serious matters. When the first outbreak of foot and mouth dis<Col N="738" /> ease was detected in England on 20 February we hoped there would only be a few cases but the outbreak has become much more serious and 22 cases have now been confirmed. Every precaution and measure must be taken to ensure the disease does not reach Ireland. There is a suspected case in Northern Ireland which is a serious development.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes approached the debate in a sensible and co-operative manner, which is important. We must all be at one in making sure that everything is done to ensure this dreaded disease does not reach Ireland. Measures were taken quickly before the EU Commission decided to do anything. Patrols were set up along the Border and 30 points of entry have been manned. I listened to a report by Philip Boucher-Hayes on radio yesterday as I travelled to Dublin. He visited ten farmers and was surprised at the lack of concern among them. They did not appreciate the seriousness of the crisis. A number asked where was the JCB when an animal was found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an outrageous remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an outrageous remark. They displayed the wrong attitude and we should try to discourage it. That is the wrong mentality but I do not know how it can be tackled because a number of farmers think like that.</P>
      <P>Everybody concerned must display goodwill and co-operate because that is most important, especially along the Border and at other points of entry to the State. As the Minister of State said, it is deplorable that anyone connected with a farm in England should enter the State without taking the necessary precautions.</P>
      <P>I recall the previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 1967. All sporting fixtures were abandoned. I kept greyhounds at the time and was a keen coursing enthusiast. I was disappointed when all coursing fixtures were abandoned in late October 1967 for the rest of the season. People were asked not to travel home from England that Christmas and many co-operated. It is essential that people co-operate by not travelling now and that all sporting fixtures are cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first outbreak was detected last Tuesday in England and on Wednesday the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, the Minister of State and the Department moved swiftly to put in place the first wave of protective measures. They introduced an immediate ban on the importation from the UK, including Northern Ireland, of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, meat and meat products, milk and milk products. Arrangements were put in place in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enlist the assistance of the Garda in enforcing the ban. The arrangements were put in place in Border areas with effect from last Tuesday evening and were further consolidated over the past week. Major resources are being focused in this area. Defence Forces <Col N="739" /> involvement will be a feature of the next phase of the exercise.</P>
    <P>We have not had a case of foot and mouth in Ireland since 1941. I was very young at that time but I remember people talking about it and I think there was an outbreak not far from where I was living. The fact we have had no case since 1941 has been due in no small way to the manner the country responded to outbreaks elsewhere in Europe, most notably the outbreaks in the UK in 1967 and 1981. The Minister is determined that on this occasion we should respond to the situation as effectively as in the past and that every necessary measure be taken to prevent the spread of the disease from the UK to Ireland. This must be done with the co-operation of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Public information meetings for farmers on early retirement have been cancelled, including one in Sligo on 23 February, in Cork and Ennis on 26 February, in Killarney and Newbridge on 27 February, in Clonmel on 28 February and in Longford and Nenagh on 1 March. Very importantly, the Minister has imposed a temporary nationwide ban on all livestock marts in order to minimise animal movements off and between farms. As Senator Hayes said, it imposes hardship on farmers, especially dairy farmers who might have very little income and are anxious to sell. I agree there should be no pressure and financial institutions should play their part in ensuring no undue hardship is placed on farmers who cannot sell their stock. There should be no cattle movement whatsoever and I am sure this will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>With effect from midnight yesterday the importation of horses and greyhounds from Britain has been banned. Requests have also been made to the relevant authorities that all horse racing, including point to point events, and all greyhound events, including coursing, be cancelled. The Cheltenham race meeting has not been cancelled but&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go to it, though I would like to. Neither should anybody from Ireland attend it. With the number of outbreaks in England now reaching 22 I am sure the UK authorities will think further and extend the one week ban on race meetings and other events.</P>
      <P>The Department asked the IRFU to postpone the Ireland <i>v</i>. Wales match and I commend the union for being very positive in taking this advice. I heard a person on the radio today saying he was very disappointed it has been postponed, but it is essential that all movement of people, who might mix with farmers in the UK, is minimised given that this dreaded disease can be carried very easily and the danger that it could spread to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there was a suspected case in County Down but according to breaking news a farm in Armagh has been sealed off. That is bad <Col N="740" /> news. Bríd Rodgers, the Minister for Agriculture in the North, said that as a precautionary measure they have placed the holding under surveillance and a restriction zone around it. Laboratory reports will be required before it can be confirmed whether the animals have the disease. We hope the tests will prove negative.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all precautions are taken, especially at our ports. There seems to be some difficulties and mention has been made of the fact that we have insufficient disinfectant at ports. I do not know whether this is true, but everybody coming from the UK should contact the officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at the airports and ports. We are always told on coming into Dublin Airport by air hostesses to visit the officers of the Department if we have had contact with cattle or farms. It is essential this is done to help prevent the disease spreading to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers met in Brussels to discuss BSE and reform of the beef sector, where there is over-production. I am delighted the main difference between the new scheme and the purchase for destruction scheme is that members states will have the option of storing beef for eventual distribution as food or free food to the poorer sections of the community. This special purchase scheme is welcome as the processes used in the destruction scheme did not look well as portrayed in the media, with good animals being painted with green paint, something we did not appreciate.</P>

      <P>The calf slaughtering scheme should be reintroduced. It was an effective measure and would be less expensive than this destruction scheme.

Such a scheme would remove many of our problems in the beef industry and would be most welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, who has indicated that he would like three minutes, if he is able to get back in time. He is usually very accurate.</P>
      <P>I agree with what my colleagues have said. This really is a national crisis. We have to be constructive and I pledge my full support to the Minister and his officials. I would like to express my compassion for the farming community, particularly those who have been affected in Britain and those who may be affected in Northern Ireland. Please God it will not come down here. If it does, we should support the farmers in every way possible financially to get them over this intensely difficult period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down an amendment to the Order of Business yesterday and was going to call a vote on it. I was persuaded not to because of the <Col N="741" /> seriousness of the issue. For political advantage I also thought to put down a request under Standing Order 29. The Cathaoirleach would have had to rule it out of order and say it was not an emergency. That would have given me the ruling I have wanted for a while. It would have highlighted the fact that these rulings are nonsense. They do not relate to whether there is an emergency or not. This is so serious that we must not play politics with it.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister said. I won a trip to Britain on one of the scratch cards which fall out of the Sunday papers. I had arranged to go over on the tenth or eleventh. I am certainly not going now. I think people have to take certain actions. I am really sad that the people in Cheltenham have not yet made an announcement and I call on the authorities there to do so. This morning I heard their spokesperson say on the radio that they were likely to lose £700,000. So what? That is a flea bite compared to the destruction of the agricultural industry here.</P>
    <P>This crisis coupled with BSE makes it quite clear that in the longer term we have to look at intensive farming methods. We have got to examine factory farming and the role of the middleman. There was the example of the man in the north of England. He was not a farmer at all. He was not a resident. The man who owned the farm did not even live near it. He rented it to a pig dealer. This is how foot and mouth disease comes in. I heard on the BBC last night that they are travelling from the north west to the south east. Middlemen profit and do nothing in terms of animal welfare, husbandry, growing or producing. It is like the buying and selling of futures on the stock market. That has to be looked into.</P>
    <P>I absolutely support the Minister and his colleagues. It is perfectly obvious from the Minister's expression that he is concerned. This is a deeply worrying situation. I do not wish to add to it in a niggling way but I do have criticisms. I got a phone call from my brother at breakfast on Monday morning. He was in France and rang me to say that as a citizen he was extremely concerned. He drives long distance lorries. He said that he had been going out early from the North Wall. As a person of a curious nature he walked around to see what was happening with the lorries coming in. There was no disinfection going on. There were no sprays and no mats. He told me that there was an abattoir at Gaerwen on Anglesey where there was a suspected foot and mouth outbreak. The local word was that it was definite and the main transport route is within 300 yards of the abattoir's front door.</P>
    <P>I immediately rang the office of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and told them to get on to the British. They should be doing something. It has emerged yet again that the British authorities are not good neighbours. They were not good neighbours in the BSE crisis, failing to take immediate, decisive action. It is the same in this case. <Col N="742" /> However, I do not want to start attacking the English.</P>
    <P>That was what so disappointed me from the Fianna Fáil side of the House when I raised the issue yesterday. They were attacking people from the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body who had warned us that there was nothing happening at Cork Airport where they felt there should be precautions. They were right to alert us.</P>
    <P>I would like to defend the young woman who came back from England. I heard her mother speaking on this issue this morning. She was a student at an agricultural college and was instructed by the authorities to go home. All the students went home but when they got to Holyhead they were concerned that there was nothing happening there. When they got back here their bus was disinfected but nothing was done to the passengers. They were so conscientious that they actually reported themselves. That was an honourable young person and I do not think she should be subject to this criticism, particularly when there are such deficiencies in our approach.</P>
    <P>I was really taken aback to hear that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, had said on Monday night that he was considering the introduction of strict measures and controls at ports of entry. I hope it was not true because it should have been considered long before. We did not seem to have a plan ready. In the event of flood or a major outbreak of fire in the city we have an emergency plan. I do not know if we have an emergency foot and mouth plan but we certainly should have. It should have gone into action immediately. There is no doubt it did not. I do not want to excoriate people who must be exhausted and tired at this stage but we have to learn for the next time. There will be a next time.</P>
    <P>We have free movement in Europe. We have to ask questions about that and about rabies and such things. Poor old Dominic Behan used to sing, &ldquo;Thank God we're surrounded by water&rdquo;. That will not protect us because this bug can travel over 100 kms.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that Senator Rory Kiely mentioned Philip Boucher-Hayes's excellent and balanced report. I was horrified to hear people from South Armagh cracking jokes and indicating that they would drive trucks up and down across the Border if they felt like it. They mentioned the farm near Heddon and asked if the man involved did not have a JCB to shove the problem out of sight and allow it infect the whole country. What kind of attitude is that from south Armagh? I am certain that the majority of people there are very decent and responsible but they have a problem. It is time they addressed their county's cowboy element. I see their behaviour when they come down for GAA matches. It is the worst of all the counties that play in Croke Park. I have seen the horrid little sign they have up there &ldquo;Sniper at Work&rdquo;. They are great republicans. They are very patriotic, yet they are ready to spread foot and mouth disease. It would be unfair to tar all of the people but the majority have to look their <Col N="743" /> neighbours in the eye and when they know this kind of thing is going on they have to stop it. That mentality is what is going to spread the disease.</P>
    <P>It is significant that two gardaí, one female and the other male, were injured by people driving back across the Border into Northern Ireland. One of them &ndash; I do not remember which &ndash; was talking to the driver with their arm resting on the open window when the car pulled off and they were dragged along the road. What kind of behaviour is that? Are these the people who are aching to be united with their counterparts in the Republic? I would like to see a united Ireland but on this occasion I wish the Border could prevent disease penetration because of the irresponsible attitudes of some persons in the North.</P>
    <P>I salute Deputy Noonan for cancelling his party's Ard-Fheis. In my opinion he will benefit politically in the future as a result of taking such action. It was an imaginative, useful and good step to take because the last thing we want is people travelling from rural areas and converging in a single location in Dublin. It has been a good day for politics in Ireland, particularly in terms of the action taken by Deputy Noonan, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Deputy Ó Cuív, in refusing to take up a £500,000 bequest from a certain woman's will. That shows there is a very high standard in certain areas of Irish political life, across the party spectrum, and I hope the newspapers give these stories the same coverage as that given to the less respectable aspects of our profession.</P>
    <P>The tragedy for Ireland is that, as a result of this crisis, we could lose our white list status, which allows us to export to many countries throughout the world. If one case of foot and mouth disease is discovered here, we will immediately lose that status. That is the scale of the problem. We must consider this in the context of the irresponsibility of certain people in England where the disease was incubating for five or six weeks? Why did the owner of the original farm affected not notice that his animals were sick? The reason is that, as far as I understand it, he is not a farmer.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease is highly dangerous. There is an interesting article about it in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which lists it as an &ldquo;aphthovirus&rdquo; of the family &ldquo;Picorna viridae&rdquo;, and states that this is probably an outbreak of Asia 1 or O virus, the most virulent strain of the disease. The article further indicates that pasteurisation does not kill the disease but that, fortunately, weak solutions of &ldquo;citric acid solution and washing soda, sodium carbonate&rdquo; can do so. I find it difficult to believe that we do not have sufficient quantities of these materials.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for making that clear. I am glad he is volun<Col N="744" /> teering information and I wish to ask him another question. Is it correct that we are sending biological material to a laboratory in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pity. There is a virus reference laboratory in UCD which played a significant role during the hepatitis and AIDS crisis which affected humans. Why do we not have an animal virus reference laboratory? In the aftermath of the current crisis we should, perhaps, consider putting in place such a facility. There may be practical reasons for not having such a laboratory but they are not apparent to me.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers raised the question of slaughterhouses. I am glad the Minister of State indicated, during Senator Hayes's contribution, that he will restrict or completely ban all movement of animals, except direct to the slaughterhouse. We must carefully monitor the activity that goes on in slaughterhouses. I cannot comment on what has been happening here, but I recall some of the evidence given at the beef tribunal about the appalling standards which applied at that time.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, what happened in Wales was unforgivable. A deadline of midnight, by which time all traffic in and all acceptance of animals was to cease, was put in place but people did everything in their power to beat it. Animals that were accepted for slaughter were not killed. As I understand it, a similar position obtained in Northern Ireland. Animals were imported from Carlisle on the basis that they would go for instant slaughter, but instead they were redistributed to farms. That is appalling. It is the kind of behaviour which makes it clear that we are in great danger of having a major outbreak in this country.</P>
      <P>The discussion of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease is the most important part of this debate and I hope that it has been properly addressed. With regard to the other part of the debate, namely, the EU's beef proposals, the Minister of State referred to the ethical concerns of some European countries. He stated:</P>
      <P>The main difference between the new scheme and the purchase for destruction scheme is that member states would have the option of storing the beef for eventual distribution as food aid or free food to the poorer sections of the community or to destroy the beef if there is no market outlet. In addition, steers would no longer be eligible for the scheme. The rationale behind this proposal is to attempt to circumvent the &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; problems which a large number of member states have with destroying healthy beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; should not appear in quotation marks. This is an ethical problem, not an &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; problem. Does the destruction of perfectly good food for economic reasons not give rise to ethical problems? I think it does and <Col N="745" /> Ireland should insist on ethical standards. It is because we have no ethical standards in terms of our treatment of animals that we have landed ourselves in this mess.</P>
    <P>We should use this matter politically and we should be unapologetic about doing so. We should trade it off against the introduction of a proper fisheries regime. Our fish resources are being squandered and raped, particularly by the Spanish, and we should be prepared to trade off the issue of ethical standards against the introduction of a proper fisheries regime. We are over-producing but we can make some gesture towards the economy if we reap the benefits of such a regime.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct a statement I made earlier. I referred to an outbreak at Moy, County Down, whereas it actually occurred at Meigh, County Armagh, two miles from the Border. The eight mile exclusion zone includes land in both the North and the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time. I wish to make three points. For approximately eight years I have been saying that farmers needed to act in the interests of consumers. On this occasion, consumers must act in the interests of farmers, the agriculture industry and Ireland as a nation. There is much at stake here, particularly in terms of the number of jobs that will be affected by this crisis. For example, two weeks ago the United States, Canada and Mexico banned the importation of beef from Brazil, even though there has not been a problem with BSE in that country. This illustrates what happens when confidence is shaken.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments to the effect that he wants to emphasise that the best long-term solution is to restore public confidence in beef and secure the re-opening of third market countries. He was referring to BSE which affects cattle, but foot and mouth disease affects cattle, sheep and venison. This is a major crisis &ndash; indeed it is a national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have high regard for the steps which have been taken, but three weeks ago the European Commission's veterinary committee allowed Britain and Portugal to sell T-bone steak on the bone while Ireland and other countries were not allowed to do so. We have known about this problem since 26 March 1996, as did the rest of Europe, and we thought we had taken the right steps, but it looks as though those measures were not enough to convince the scientists. I said we should listen to the scientific knowledge rather than the emotional knowledge. In this case we thought we had taken the right steps but it turned out that we had not. I know we hope to get a derogation in coming weeks but we were not included when Britain and Portugal were allowed <Col N="746" /> to sell beef, which shows we did not take the right steps to convince the scientists. I congratulate the Minister of State on the steps which have been taken and on the urgency which seems to be a feature of the approach. I hope those steps are enough because the steps we thought sufficient in the past were not; let us make sure they are this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement. We face a national emergency of the first order. Past debates about BSE were very important but they pale into insignificance in comparison with the potential disaster posed by foot and mouth disease in Britain. This has the potential to take one leg off the Celtic tiger, if not bring it to its knees. That is the gravity of the situation. We have ordered a debate on reform of the EU beef sector, which is important, but it is not important relative to the foot and mouth issue, and it will not be important at all if foot and mouth disease reaches the Republic.</P>
      <P>The disease was originally detected in an abattoir in Essex but it is apparent that it was in a farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall in Tyne and Wear for some days, if not over a week, before the detection at the abattoir. I am sure the British Ministry of Agriculture is dealing with the questions this poses but it seems to be the case that someone had sick animals and knew them to be sick, even if they did not know that illness was foot and mouth, but was still prepared to send those animals around the country to abattoirs and marts in an effort to get rid of them. That may be a harsh comment but the evidence suggests it. It only takes one cowboy, whether in Britain, Northern Ireland or the Republic, to bring the whole industry crashing down around our ears and we must pay attention to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pattern of modern agriculture has been referred to &ndash; there is a concentration of farms among fewer owners with large acreages and high numbers of livestock. The need to transport livestock over long distances to marts or abattoirs has brought a contingent problem which did not exist to the same extent during the 1967 outbreak, which I remember clearly. I was an agricultural student in UCD at the time and I visited Wales in the early stages of the outbreak. The outbreak was in Oswestry in Shropshire, which is on the Welsh border, and obviously there was great concern, but there was also complacency about the disease's ability to cause damage. At that time, if one looked at the spread of the disease, it was almost all downwind of the original outbreak in Oswestry. As far as I can recall, over 90% of the cases were in Shropshire, with the minority in the surrounding area, which is interesting in view of the recent intensification of agriculture. The areas now affected are Tyne and Wear, Essex, Devon, which is hundreds of miles from Tyne and Wear, as well as Anglesey and Hereford, which is close to Cheltenham. It has spread throughout the country, which illustrates the problem of dealing <Col N="747" /> with the disease in Britain as well as our own problems.</P>
    <P>This disease is no respecter of land or sea borders. There are 3,000 animals impounded in Gaerwen in Anglesey and they will be slaughtered, which is correct, but it only takes one seagull to come across on the ferry mast to transfer the disease. That is the reality and that is why the measures must be draconian to the extent that it becomes almost impossible to move between the two islands and even between farms. Senator Rory Kiely is a farmer, as I am. He comes from Limerick and I come from Kildare, and we met in Leinster House. Would it occur to either of us coming in the gates that we might transmit the disease and carry it home? Those realities have not sunk in to the extent that they should.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the appeal made in 1967 to people not to come home to Ireland for Christmas and if they did, they were asked not to go on to farms. That was almost universally honoured even though it meant significant hardship because the degree of travel back and forth between Britain and Ireland was not nearly as great as it is now. The Christmas visit might have been a person's only trip home in a year or in two years, but people took a very responsible attitude, which brings us to the issue of individual responsibility, a point the Minister has stressed.</P>
    <P>I saw a BBC television programme recently about cattle dealers who move large numbers of animals over significant distances, and in the Devon case animals were transported to the Continent. The EU imposes many regulations on us regarding how we may farm, but those regulations must also extend to the cattle dealing and transport sectors, they cannot stop at the farm gate. Fortunately, we have made progress in terms of traceability and tracking animals' movements but even if we have that information after an outbreak it is all <i>post factum</i>. It is a help in dealing with the problem but the fact that it comes is a disaster in itself, irrespective of what we do subsequently, even though we must of course take all measures necessary. I come from near the Curragh of Kildare &ndash; think of the potential for disaster here with the sheep on the Curragh. Should people even be allowed to golf on the Curragh or drive through it? We still have not grasped how seriously we must deal with this.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister of State's decision to stop inter-farm sales and to stop cattle going to mart. However, the presumption seems to be that sending cattle to an abattoir will in itself prevent the spread of infection. In Gaerwen in Anglesey there are 3,000 animals impounded and due for slaughter. However, where are the trucks which brought those animals to Gaerwen? Where have they been since? The funeral pyre is very impressive on television but has little to do with preventing the subsequent spread of the disease and that is why disinfectant is so important. The organism is amenable to destruction by disin<Col N="748" /> fection and I am glad the Minister of State said there are adequate supplies of disinfectant available. An official of the English National Farmers Union said on television that one of the common questions farmers in his area were asking related to where they could get disinfectant, as there was a serious problem in getting it. I presume one can get disinfectant in one's local supermarket, but getting a sufficient volume of it to deal with this problem on a farm would be very expensive. Farmers need five gallon and ten gallon drums.</P>
    <P>The disease is no respecter of land borders. Am I correct in my assumption that while we made every effort to ensure that nothing came south, we were not so vigilant in ensuring that nothing went north? Pigs from the Republic were going into the North to be slaughtered. It prevents the spread of the disease from those pigs, in the unlikely event of those pigs having the disease &ndash; and I am not suggesting that they had. The fact that they were brought to an abattoir in the North exposed the vehicle bringing them to the infection and it could come back across the Border.</P>
    <P>I saw last night defects in the matting used at Larne port, or perhaps Belfast, where they had difficulty keeping it in place in the wind and it was being broken up by the large trucks coming across it. I hope people at ports or elsewhere do not think that, simply by putting some straw on the ground, they have solved the problem. It requires management of whatever precautionary measures are invoked.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to seal the island from all movement of livestock, whether horses or other animals. There is an obligation to ensure that there is no inter farm movement and that animals cannot travel from place to place. That is the only way to stop this. If and when we get it in, we are closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>I accept the reality that cattle must be allowed to be moved into slaughter facilities, otherwise it will not be possible to feed people. However there must be the most rigorous precautions at the abattoirs to ensure that when vehicles come in contact, they do not return to farms with the potential to create problems. If the measures were sufficiently draconian, it would not take more than 14 days or three weeks at most to ensure that we have passed the problem. There would still be the potential to create infection from the United Kingdom, but domestically, bearing in mind the incubation period of the disease, if after fourteen days there is no outbreak, then movements within the country can resume but nothing can come in from outside the country.</P>
    <P>This morning, on the Order of Business, I congratulated the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union for taking the action they did and I know the Minister has echoed those sentiments. I was particularly struck by the statement by Philip Browne, the chief executive of the IRFU, on television news yesterday that rugby football was secondary to the national interest. It was good to hear that because some <Col N="749" /> people in the racing profession in the previous days were not quite as vocal in their defence of the national interest as he was. I have here two tickets at £33 each for the stand in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Friends in high places. A mere £33 each is a small price to pay and in any event, I had decided not to go to the game. I was disappointed that when I phoned Stena Line to cancel the booking I was told I would have to forfeit the fare, which had been booked through a credit card. I could re-book at a later date, but I would have to use it. I notice in the paper this morning that Irish Ferries are saying they will not give a refund. They might adopt a slightly more liberal approach in this case. The Posthouse hotel in Cardiff is reported in the papers as saying that they would not issue refunds. That is very onerous on people who have paid up-front. I appreciate there is an economic consequence for the hotels as well but perhaps some common ground can be found. In 1967, the New Zealand game was cancelled. Before that, in 1963 I think, there was a smallpox outbreak in Wales and the Ireland versus Wales match was cancelled, so there are precedents.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Authority had to say yesterday evening on the news when he adopted a very similar attitude to the IRFU and that is to be applauded. Even if there were not confirmed outbreaks in Hereford and in proximity to Cheltenham, the worry is over large numbers of people congregating in one area, many of whom will then go back to farms. It is very unfortunate and I sympathise with people, including the syndicate which has a potential runner at Cheltenham.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased and reassured to hear that from the Minister and it is no more than I would expect.</P>
      <P>I have another example of minor mundane things that are significant. During the week my wife had to go to a rural funeral where the removal was from a farmhouse. There were a huge number of vehicles in the farmyard. Something as simple and mundane as that can be an agency for the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on individual responsibility. It is going to be extremely difficult to keep this disease at bay. I hope that we are successful at doing so because otherwise the consequences are catastrophic, not just for farming and agriculture but for the whole economy.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister make an order unilaterally, without legislation, stopping movement within a certain area? I do not know the answer. Maybe even the Minister for State does not know. I cannot expect him to answer it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> St. Patrick's Day is close and a large number of people will be coming into the country. There must be the most extreme vigilance in terms of the procedures when those people enter the country. Aer Lingus hostesses in the past used to inform people, who had been on a farm or in contact with farm animals or on an agricultural facility, to report to the Department officials. I spent several years farming in England and at that time it was routine to report to those officials at Dublin Airport on every occasion that we came back. I am not sure that it is as vigorous now as it was then. Even if we did not have this crisis, that obligation is still there to report to the officials if we have been on a farm or in contact with farm animals, so that they at least have the traceability and they know where we have gone to. In the old days, bearing in mind Spike Island and isolation etc., perhaps the people who had less scientific information and sophistication than we have had a lot of good common sense in putting those procedures in place and it reinforces the value of them.</P>
    <P>I know that the EU proposals are of secondary importance to the foot and mouth issue. I agree with the Minister and his sentiments. I hope the Government will be successful in achieving its objectives in the negotiations. The exclusion of steers in particular is a very serious matter. That brings me to the point I made on the Order of Business this morning. It was very worrying to hear the French yesterday mention the possibility of re-nationalising the Common Agricultural Policy. The whole European edifice has been built on the Common Agricultural Policy, on the policy of Community preference and on the policy of shared responsibility. It would be extremely damaging to us if that philosophy were to gain ground and there were a momentum in Europe that each member state should finance its own agriculture. It should not be allowed to happen and I am confident the Government would not allow it to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for State. I and all Members share his anxiety over the gravity of the problem that confronts us in relation to the foot and mouth outbreak in England and the possibility that it has spread to Northern Ireland. In human epidemiological terms it could be equated with an outbreak of virulent flu even though the economic consequences of an influ<Col N="751" /> enza outbreak would not be as grave as this is in the livestock industry. Nevertheless it goes to show how the virus can be spread. The only way you keep out of the way is by not congregating in groups. During a flu epidemic if you want to avoid the flu the ideal remedy is to stay at home. One Senator asked if we had a foot and mouth plan for the nation. We seem to have a hand to mouth plan because we seem to react to the gravity of the situation as it unfolds rather than having an overall plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the Department and the Government should look carefully at events planned for the coming weeks. Major St. Patrick's Day parades are planned. We usually have bands from England, Northern Ireland and many other places but we have no policy yet in relation to that. The Government should introduce a ban on all St. Patrick's Day parades immediately. Most of our county councils send delegates to conferences in both Northern Ireland and England. There was a major conference in County Down last week attended by many members of our local authorities. The Government may not be aware of this but all county councils should be notified immediately to suspend all conferences in Ireland and England. These issues are being disregarded at present and show we have no overall plan. There should be procedures ready to be put in place automatically so that we are fully aware of what is going on. I cannot stress enough the overwhelming gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has cancelled its Ard-Fheis for the coming weekend and the rugby match in Wales has also been cancelled. These cancellations needed to be made in the national interest. Nevertheless our whole approach needs to change from the catch up attitude we have at present. We are reacting to the gravity of the situation rather than pulling out all the stops to contain this epidemic which, if it gathers momentum, will desecrate the entire livestock industry here. Over the past few months we have discussed the horrendous consequences of BSE and it amazes me that these epidemics seem to originate in England. We need to question what type of animal disease controls they have. It is suggested that this epidemic started as a result of hotel swill imported from Asia. It is outrageous that England would allow swill be imported from Asia to a major pig fattening farm. The last outbreak of foot and mouth also occurred in England. We must insist our neighbours put the proper controls in place to prevent this happening. We have been the victims on every occasion that an outbreak of foot and mouth has occurred in England and will continue to be the victims until we bring pressure on the British Government to ensure the integrity of the food chain there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a golden opportunity for the people and administration north and south to work together to ensure we fight the spread of this disease. I welcome and support the Depart<Col N="752" /> ment of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, for the efforts made in this regard. This is a crisis of confidence in our food and a crisis of confidence in the way animal husbandry is managed in Britain. As County Louth is now included in the exclusion zone I represent a county within which there is a major alert. The importance of agriculture in the local economy there is significant. Thousands of people are employed in the industry and if this is proven to be an official outbreak of the disease it will have a major impact on the local and national economy. In consequence I support fully all the actions taken by the Irish and Northern Governments.</P>
      <P>I am not a farming expert but I recognise the significance of this outbreak and I cannot understand how the UK can import swill from Asia to feed their animals as reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>today. Mr. Donaldson was quoted as the source of that story. What is going on? The major issue here is consumer confidence in our food and agriculture. Confidence is an increasing problem as a result of BSE and other problems arising in the food chain. We need to go back to less intensive methods of rearing our animals. We must look again at the high-tech operations we have which in some cases conflict with the nature of the animal and how it is reared. That is another issue. I fully support everything that is being done. Vigilance is the only way to deal with this issue and whatever steps the Government has to take must be taken and will be supported by all sides of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a rather sad evening to be debating the subject of foot and mouth disease. It is now very close to us and part of our own Twenty-six Counties is now included in controls arising from a suspected outbreak in south Armagh.</P>
      <P>I am a farmer and farmers have a habit of saying that with God's help, things will go right. On this occasion I say that with sincerity. We almost need a miracle now to save the national economy and to save Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>What has happened in Britain has occurred through the large scale movement of animals, particularly by dealers. The movement of all animals within this State has to stop immediately. The movement of animals to processing and meat plants will have to continue, but the most rigorous and stringent controls must be implemented.</P>
      <P>When a lorry leaves a farm and travels through the countryside, it will pass through farming areas. Farms have all sorts of vehicles going through them. I must emphasise that there should be no question of cattle being returned home from any plant. They must stay once they arrive. Disinfecting of all vehicles must be carried out at all factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement of people must be controlled. The public must be asked to co-operate for the <Col N="753" /> next few weeks until it is known that the disease is under control. I acknowledge the responsible actions of the IRFU. All major sporting activities must stop and the sporting organisations should be asked for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has said that nothing has been ruled out. I say to the Minister that red alert time has arrived. Everything that needs to be done has to be done now. All the regulations must be implemented. That will be an enormous task but hopefully the result will be worth it.</P>
    <P>This is a national emergency. The importation of meat from outside the EU, from unknown sources, branded as suitable for commercial use, is not good practice. I mentioned this last week and I now repeat it. The practice of control of importation must be rigid and strict in order to protect the industry.</P>
    <P>In 1985 or 1986, I was at a meeting of one of the committees of agriculture which were in vogue at the time and we met with the Minister and his officials. I asked then why had there been an acceptance of the lowering of controls by a European directive. Part of that control was quarantine. I believe Ireland should have quarantine regulations. I do not think it was a wise decision to lower controls. No matter what Europe thinks, I think we should have quarantine regulations. We have a national obligation to protect the single biggest industry in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to the movement of people, we can ask for the public's co-operation. In 1967, there was a lot less movement of people and goods and fewer trucks travelling between Ireland and Britain. It was much easier then to successfully protect the country.</P>
    <P>The message must be loud and clear &ndash; we need the co-operation of all the population of this island. People must understand that there is a crisis and we must face this crisis together. This affects the whole Irish economy. I urge that whatever steps can be taken must be taken now. I left West Cork yesterday and travelled here through farming areas. The Minister lives on a farm; so do I. Perhaps the gates of Leinster House should have disinfectant mats. I urge that all necessary precautions be taken. I began by saying that with God's help we will keep it out and I end by saying that if God is willing we will keep it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Henry, if the House agrees. I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the efforts he is making. I know there will always be people who will be critical about whether enough is enough. The Minister and the Department seem to be doing all they feel is correct. I ask the Minister to take suggestions from the Opposition benches if that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The news is probably a lot worse. An update from <i>The Irish Times</i> website says that according to the British Ministry of Agriculture, sheep suspected of having foot and mouth disease in Northern Ireland have already moved into the <Col N="754" /> Republic. The Ministry are now trying to trace the movement of over 200 sheep bought at a market in Carlisle before the disease outbreak was confirmed, and then transferred to Northern Ireland as certified for slaughter. Senator Norris pointed out that the belief is that the animals were kept in south Armagh and a majority were then moved across the Border into the Republic.</P>
    <P>There are so many things wrong in this case. The animals were certified for slaughter, they were moved over borders and these failures get to the nub of a dangerous and difficult matter. Everyone is entitled to due process but if the suspicion that animals were moved over the Border is true, the people responsible must be jailed. Hopefully, the animals are not foot and mouth cases but I understand that people are being questioned and action should be taken whether this turns out to be a confirmed case or not.</P>
    <P>To take a longer-term view we must repeal the ridiculous Act of 1991 or 1992 relating to abbatoirs. I have been like a stuck gramophone on this matter for several years attempting to draw attention to legislation which has stopped local butchers killing their own animals off grass or off farms. There was instant and absolute local traceability before this legislation was enacted and people had confidence in the food industry. I have been appealing for years to Agriculture Ministers on the subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, and has outlined in great detail previously, the efforts that are being made at Brussels level to achieve traceability of beef in particular. There is a simple way to do that and it is for people to buy their meat in local butchers. I do not eat much red meat but I have not given it up, and I find the current meat quality very good. To buy meat from a local butcher who slaughters his own animals taken off the grass is to buy from the most secure environment imaginable.</P>
    <P>Due to the current legislation, butchers instead go to the nearest big town to buy a side of beef. Even if they bring in their own animals they are never sure that what they get back is their own meat. The main reason for not bringing these animals in for slaughter is the expense of transport. Butchers simply buy and sell and it is for that reason that it is possible that a butcher could purchase meat that has been transported over the Border. I do not want to create any scares or health difficulties, but the matter under discussion highlights the lack of traceability.</P>
    <P>Those responsible for reassigning animals which are sold for slaughter in the North are liable for intense action by the state if they are found to have acted improperly. The same should be true here and those responsible for accepting animals deserve to feel the full brunt of the laws of the State and the weight of public opinion.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time. We must get the facts to the general public. There is considerable confusion as to how foot and mouth disease relates to BSE and <Col N="755" /> whether it affects humans. When we have episodes like this it is not simply the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Department of Health and Children must help explain the matter to the public, especially as the natural history of foot and mouth is that of a very infectious disease.</P>
      <P>We do not know the natural history of BSE which makes it a greater long-term problem and its real importance is that it affects humans as well as animals. Foot and mouth does not affect humans, or at least the type we are discussing currently does not. This message must be got across by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. He needs to make a statement because many people are now under the impression that we will have to stop eating everything, and that all foods are affected. This is not so.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that foot and mouth has a short incubation period so that if we take precautions for a short time, which is surely not impossible, we should deal with the situation. Those farmers with livestock have a huge responsibility because there is a lack of confidence in the food industry. This is due to the use of meat and bonemeal as animal feed which was perhaps inadvertent at times, but at other times was to save money on fodder.</P>
      <P>Farmers must remember that they are under scrutiny at present. I was shocked to hear farmers interviewed on RTÉ yesterday saying they would not report cases and that this was the time for the JCB. That attitude must be stamped out and I see the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, nodding his agreement. If anybody knows a neighbour who is acting in that fashion they should come forward with the information in the national interest.</P>
      <P>There has never been a more obvious indication that we need a total animal health policy on an all-Ireland basis. We have done well in achieving co-operation with Northern Ireland in the area of human health and I am sure that efforts are under way to improve matters in animal health also. We now see that it is imperative that north and south work together, that we co-ordinate television campaigns, etc., and try to achieve a synergistic effect. This will make a difference to subsidies but we must try to co-ordinate matters as this is vital for the health of the whole island rather than people in one part or the other.</P>
      <P>We must look at the movement of animals. The distances that animals were shipped around Britain in particular is unbelievable. We know why they are being shipped back and forward across the Irish Border and it is not for the good of the animals' health. Unfortunately animals are more likely to be susceptible to disease after suffering the stress of these long journeys.</P>

    <P>It was very wise of the Irish Rugby Football Union to agree to postpone the match in Cardiff. I was delighted to hear that Sealink are to give refunds to ticketholders and I wish that Stena <Col N="756" /> would do the same, although I understand that Stena tickets can be used at a later date. Aer Lingus is to give refunds, as are travel agents catering for matchgoers, but according to the lunchtime radio news Ryanair has said it will not give refunds as it is a cheap airline and this is its policy. Maybe those who bought the cheap tickets are those who need the refunds most. Is Ryanair going to run these planes to Cardiff despite the match being called off? Do we run the risk of people using their tickets to travel to Cardiff anyway if they cannot get a refund? Perhaps Ryanair could be asked to make a gesture to the nation during this crisis by giving people refunds.</P>

      <P>The past four years have been difficult for the Irish agriculture industry. The beef sector, in particular, suffered greatly from the BSE crisis as a result of a sharp fall in beef consumption in the EU and the loss of major third country markets. We have suffered most unfairly because the controls put in place in Ireland have ensured the safety of Irish beef. The consumer should have complete confidence in the quality of our beef.</P>
      <P>While this has been a difficult period, farmers have survived. However, foot and mouth disease presents a disastrous threat not only to the agricultural sector but to the entire economy. Our major exports of food produce would be in ruins if foot and mouth disease were to strike this island. I compliment the Minister and all involved in the swift response to the crisis in England. As I live close to the Border, I am acutely aware of the immediate response in sealing the Border and preventing agricultural produce coming south from Northern Ireland. I also compliment the Garda Síochána, the Army, the Department's officials and all personnel working through the current difficult weather conditions to maintain this operation.</P>
      <P>I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance of keeping foot and mouth disease out of Ireland. Everybody must co-operate in combating this major threat. Unfortunately, it was announced on the one o'clock news programmes today that there is a suspected case of the disease in Armagh. The Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland should act swiftly and have all the sheep that were brought from mainland England slaughtered immediately. It is most unfortunate that these animals were in that part of Armagh for the last two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an unfortunate suspicion, which I hope is not true, that some sheep have been moved across the Border from Armagh to the Oram area in County Monaghan. I have been informed in the last few minutes that a five mile exclusion zone has been imposed in that area. The Minister, the Department and the district veterinary office in Ballybay have moved swiftly in visiting the area. I hope it comes to nothing and that the suspected case in Armagh is not con<Col N="757" /> firmed. If it is, it will be a disaster for this country. The cattle and pig industries have been in turmoil in recent years but foot and mouth disease would be the final blow. The economy would suffer greatly and the agriculture industry would disappear.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to postpone major sporting events, including the rugby match between Ireland and Wales next Saturday. It will cause great inconvenience and disruption but if it will keep this dreadful disease out of Ireland, it will be worthwhile. The last major outbreak of foot and mouth diseasein Britain in 1967 was successfully kept out of this country. However, travel between the two countries has increased greatly since then, which makes the task much greater this time.</P>
    <P>The recent EU Commission proposals on the beef industry have an unfair impact on Ireland, particularly the proposal regarding the suckler cow sector. The Commission must ensure that its proposals impact fairly on each member state. The Minister addressed these issues in his speech today and I welcome that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a time of crisis and great danger to the Irish economy. Everybody is aware of the importance of agriculture for both the direct production of agricultural produce and the spin off impact it has in terms of markets and employment. To hear about the suspected outbreak of this disease in south Armagh is a clear indication that this country is unlikely to escape it. A case in south Armagh or anywhere along the Border is extremely ominous.</P>
      <P>It is only a week since the first case of the disease was detected in Britain. There are now 21 confirmed cases and many more suspected cases. The disease has travelled to Anglesey and now, it appears, to Northern Ireland. If it is in the Border area of Northern Ireland, one can bet one's life that it is only a matter of time before it reaches this jurisdiction. That is the tragedy that is upon us.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the BSE crisis and what is being done about it in Europe. He pointed out that there has been a 30% reduction in the consumption of beef in recent times and that there has been a 50% loss of beef tenders to third countries. In Egypt the Irish component of the beef industry has been eliminated even though we had 80% of that beef market. There is, therefore, a huge crisis of confidence in relation to the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis is a health scare and now we have this crisis, which is not a health scare. However, the disease is hugely contagious and is dangerous and damaging to the industry. It will also damage consumer confidence in agricultural produce. That is extremely serious.</P>

      <P>There is no danger but, as the Minister is aware, it is extremely difficult to separate issues of that nature in the public mind. It is seen as part of the suspicious aura that hangs over the agriculture industry as a result of so many crises, diseases and dangers. This is just another extremely serious disease even though there is no direct health factor for humans involved. There is a crisis of confidence.</P>
      <P>I attended the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting in Killarney this weekend. As I mentioned on the Order of Business yesterday, the British delegates detailed the absence of precautionary measures at Irish airports. &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; highlighted the case of a young woman from an agricultural college who came into Ireland through Dún Laoghaire where the precautions seemed to be just as lax. It is important that not only do we have precautionary measures, but that all personnel charged with implementing those precautions know what to do and that there is supervision to ensure they do so. The Minister of State and his office can offer advice, introduce bans and implement exclusion zones and so on. However, if he is not satisfied that the personnel involved are taking the work seriously, we are in trouble. Movement between this island and Britain shows that the precautions have not been implemented with the necessary rigour to ensure confidence and the Minister of State must keep a close eye on this situation. Foot and mouth disease is the most easily transported virus and can be passed on by air or on clothes or animal fur. However, it can be dealt with if rigorous measures are put in place and there is necessary vigilance.</P>
      <P>Many people have congratulated various organisations which have taken responsible positions. I commend the IRFU for the manner in which it behaved and stated its responsibility in this matter. The union put the situation into context and stated that, even though sport has large numbers of enthusiastic supporters, a national crisis must take precedence.</P>
      <P>The IRFU's position contrasts starkly with the racing industry, of which the Minister of State and I are very fond. The industry does not appear to be exercising the same level of responsibility.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that. A headline in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, eight days after the outbreak, with a suspected case on the Border, reads, &ldquo;Istabraq will run despite Irish ban&rdquo;. This is the view of Istabraq's owner who does not see a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is right and I make that distinction. The article goes on to state, &ldquo;The transport of horses to the Festival would not present major problems&rdquo;. What sort of world is the author living in? It goes on to quote Willie Mullins as saying:</P>
      <P>I could see the good horses with reasonable chances travelling over... There would be less than 70 horses from Ireland anyway which would be a manageable number to look after. These horses would go from their own yard to the Cheltenham stableyard and not mix with any of the English horses when they're being stabled.</P>
      <P>The horses would not just be stabled, they would go on to the racecourse and run and mix with British horses and with people. It is naive in the extreme for people to expect that anyone would pay the slightest attention to this argument. However, it is unacceptable that such comments are being made.</P>
      <P>The problem is not so much with horses travelling to Cheltenham. If 70 Irish horses travel, or even Istabraq on its own, not to mention Arctic Copper about whom I am sure you are disappointed&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Chair's priority in that matter. The horses are only one concern, the other is the attitude of the trainers referred to in the article. However, what if these champion Irish horses travel to Cheltenham with Istabraq about to set a record? One could understand the disappointment but some Irish punters would surely also travel. It is impossible to imagine that a festival like Cheltenham would not attract large numbers of Irish people. It would be impossible to stop large numbers of people going to the festival. A large number of such punters would be from rural and family communities. Taking horses to Cheltenham would encourage large numbers of punters to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Many of our practices under EU policies have assisted the spread of the disease. Farms now operate on high animal densities, there is greater intensification and farms are larger. Such farms have holding areas for large numbers of animals which go to large abattoirs. This means that animals are being moved from all over the country to central areas so the disease is more likely to spread now than during the last outbreak. The amount of transport, the structure of the industry and other factors inevitably mean the disease will be harder to contain on this occasion so the precautions need to be greater. Other Senators mentioned that one outcome of this situation may be that we have to look at the structure of agriculture under EU policies.</P>
    <P>The UK's chief veterinary officer has been the main spokesperson on this disease. What is the situation on this island in terms of our chief veterinary officer and his counterpart in Northern Ireland? Are they operating together? Can we not have a common regime in terms of veterinary inspections whereby there is a common plan in both parts of the island? It is easier to deal with this issue as an island than on the basis of a land border which will be extremely difficult to police.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the number of personnel required to deal with small roads and cross-Border fields and activity if we find that there is a North-South threat of foot and mouth disease, now that there is a suspected case in south Armagh. The sea is the obvious boundary and we should ensure a common veterinary regime as regards livestock so that we deal with this matter on an all-island basis. Co-operation on this issue should be seriously examined in the context of cross-Border institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>There are crises such as serious explosions, bombs or floods, and the relevant Department or local authority has a plan in place to deal with it. We have set up an interdepartmental group to try to manage this crisis. However, there should be an agreed plan which involves all the relevant agencies. The Department would be responsible for it but other agencies, such as airports, ports, ferries and local authorities, would have to come on board. There must be people responsible for training the personnel to put the plan into action immediately. Is there an <i>ad hoc</i> plan? I have not heard that a plan is in place. The Minister of State announced the measures being taken by the Department but there is not an overall plan that can be put into action. People must be trained and they must know where to go. We do not want people who do not know what to do. We must learn from this issue and we must ensure that a disaster plan and the necessary personnel are in place for any future such disasters.</P>
    <P>A penalty of £5,000 will be imposed on anyone who refuses or neglects to report the disease on their farm. That is not a significant penalty for something which can maim an entire economy and ruin confidence in an industry. We must re-examine the penalties. Anyone who refuses or <Col N="761" /> neglects to report the disease must be subject to a custodial sentence. That must be included in the legislation to highlight the seriousness of this issue. As well as increasing the fine, the threat of a custodial sentence is <i>sine qua non</i>. The Minister of State should consider that. Consumer confidence both here and abroad will be another casualty. Some 90% of our agricultural produce is exported and 50% of third country markets have been lost to European tenders. That figure will probably increase as a result of this crisis.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that livelihoods are being ruined in Britain at present. The danger is that if our fears are realised, people's livelihoods here will be ruined as well. One of the fears I have is the manner in which compensation is paid out. We have not been successful in eradicating bovine TB, despite the billions of pounds spent on it. The best we can do is blame the badger for spreading it. The badger is a four legged creature but I would put my money on a two legged creature being responsible for the continuation of bovine TB. This is the only jurisdiction which seems hell bent on blaming the badger for the continuation of this disease. Many people did well in terms of compensation in the attempt to eradicate bovine TB.</P>
    <P>We have seen how herds were infected with BSE and slurry so people could get compensation for their animals. Any level of compensation should be less than the market value of an animal. Once compensation equal to or in excess of the market value of an animal is offered, it provides an incentive for abuse. As a consumer and someone who was born and raised on a farm, this type of abuse does not instil confidence in the credibility and integrity of those who produce the animals we consume. I am sure that 99% of people produce a fine product, but there is a certain level of abuse. We cannot under any circumstances provide a compensatory mechanism, as we have done for bovine TB and BSE, which is not fully sensitive to the dangers of spreading the disease rather than curtailing it.</P>
    <P>This is a potential disaster. We all hope it does not spread to this jurisdiction. We must introduce stringent measures and we must ensure that all sectors of the community, regardless of how privileged they might think they are, play their part in ensuring they are implemented as rigidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this crisis. I do not use the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; often because it is overused. Senator Costello used it when referring to many things in recent months. Yet this foot and mouth disease is a national crisis in so far as we are on the verge of identifying a case. The situation in Meigh in County Armagh is extremely worrying as is the situation in Wexford where animals, which were imported from Devon earlier in the month, are being destroyed because Devon is close to one of the sites where foot and mouth disease has been identified. We cannot overstress the seriousness <Col N="762" /> of this situation because of the effects it will have on our economy if we fail to keep it out. Unlike any other economy in Europe, our agricultural industry is totally dependent on exports, and we must maintain our disease free status if possible.</P>
      <P>Many Senators have contributed this afternoon and many sensible things have been said. While I do not wish to restate the points made, I reiterate and enforce some of what has been said. While the measures imposed by the Department after the initial outbreak of this disease in the UK were welcome, some of them should have been implemented earlier. The attitude of the Department has been positive.</P>
      <P>Congratulations must also be offered to the IRFU. I heard its president speaking last night on the television about the cancellation of the international rugby match in Wales this weekend. It was his attitude to the matter that impressed me more than the cancellation itself; he felt this was a far more important issue than a game of rugby. I know that many people, including the Irish team members, will be put out because the game is not going ahead. Other sporting events come to mind that may also be affected, including the Cheltenham race meeting. The fact that the IRFU put the emphasis on the national interest was very encouraging, however.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the public has also been extremely positive. It is the first time in many years that I have seen such a positive reaction by the public to an agricultural issue. They are supporting the national interest to ensure that we will not have any outbreak of the disease here. Senator Costello mentioned the huge movement of animals that occurs all the time now, compared to the 1967 outbreak of foot and mouth disease which was relatively easy to confine. At that stage, the UK did not have anything like the movement of animals that exists today, nor was there anything like the same amount of movement of people who can act as carriers for the disease. Therefore, the current situation is much more serious.</P>
      <P>The EU needs to rethink its entire policy concerning the location, standard and size of abattoirs if they are to function properly. In recent years, many butchers have closed down their own slaughtering facilities because of the rules and regulations laid down by Brussels, and the difficulty in attaining those standards based on the volume of animals. That situation needs to be re-examined because I am not sure that big is best in this case. In the past, butchers had excellent abattoirs. There may be more benefit from maintaining smaller abattoirs since the traceability of animals would be faster and more effective in a crisis such as we have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last week's debate on BSE I called for all producers and hauliers to be licensed. Everyone must have their cars licensed so I do not see why there should be any difficulty with this matter. I am gravely concerned that trucks used to move animals from one farm to another are not <Col N="763" /> being properly disinfected. Rules and regulations governing cleanliness are not being implemented as effectively as they should. How often have we driven along the road behind cattle trucks and seen the state of them and what comes out at the back? That should not happen but it does. We need to tighten up on that area. We have rules for everything but we are not implementing them.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Costello that a penalty of £5,000 is not enough. People need to be stung seriously. We have to inculcate a spirit of everyone being part of the one big picture, and in this case it is food production. In order to achieve that we must all work together. Rogue farmers, dealers or hauliers must be rooted out of the system as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the 99% of people who do their jobs properly are being tarred with the rogue's brush and it is not fair to them. We must ensure that does not happen because it undermines the primary industry on which we are so dependent internationally.</P>
    <P>Many mares appear to have come to Coolmore Stud in the last week or so. If that is the case, it would indicate that the stud is more interested in covering fees than in keeping the very damaging foot and mouth virus out of the country. Coolmore is spoken of, quite rightly, as one of the best studs in the world but if that is their attitude it worries me greatly.</P>
    <P>For many different reasons the foot and mouth virus is extremely difficult to contain. It is so easy to transport and, unfortunately, the weather has not been favourable for eliminating it. If we had more sunshine and heat it would be easier to eradicate. We must contain it as strenuously as we possibly can. At times, however, I wonder whether certain people are more interested in making a quick buck and penalising the agriculture industry and the entire country for the sake of an extra £5 on a sheep or £10 on a bullock.</P>
    <P>To date, the Minister's handling of the issue has been extremely good. I appeal to him, however, to ensure that the existing regulations are implemented as quickly and as strenuously as possible. We must try to generate a society that is based on the bigger picture rather than a fiver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>Foot and mouth disease is the stuff of nightmares. Two weeks ago we had a debate on BSE, yet little did we think we would be back in the House so soon debating one of the worst plagues known to agriculture. One can only imagine the damage it would do to our national herd, the value of which, including all beef and dairy animals, is between £5 billion and £6 billion. Unlike BSE, foot and mouth disease threatens the basic seed capital on which the whole industry exists. It would pose a nightmare threat to our meat exports totalling £3.5 billion, and to exports of dairy products, including processed foods, <Col N="764" /> worth almost £2 billion. Foot and mouth disease is the worst possible scenario and the nightmare is compounded by the ominous reports coming from South Armagh. The statement by Northern Ireland's Minister for Agriculture is also ominous. She has all but admitted that there may be an outbreak of foot and mouth disease there. That would be the first time the disease has been on this island since 1941. We do not know what contact there has been in trading animals to the Republic from that source in south Armagh, which adjoins County Louth and is very close to County Monaghan. We can only hope there has been none.</P>
      <P>While I know they will not thank me for saying so, I must be critical of the British authorities on this issue. I am not convinced it was noticed or handled properly in the first instance. The first outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Northumberland. The next case was reported on the west coast of Britain, followed by cases in Essex and Devon in the south east. These cases were hundreds of miles apart. A map of Great Britain, which was used to illustrate the spread of the disease, on a television programme last night contained many dots representing new cases in the middle of England. The disease is widespread on the adjoining island, with 24 or 25 cases having been confirmed and more awaited.</P>
      <P>Foot and mouth disease was confined to one or two locations in the UK in 1967. I recall the sense of siege in Ireland at that time. People could not travel home from the UK at Christmas but there was a great sense of national solidarity against the spread of the disease. The House must call for such solidarity again among all sectors of the population. I have to declare my interest in the debate as I am a beef producer. We are often not popular with certain sections of the community but the entire population must recognise Ireland is under serious threat.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister's Department has the resources to deal with the disease. The Department has little experience of the disease as it has not been witnessed on the island since 1941. That was a confined outbreak and very few people remember it. People can recall the outbreak in 1967 in the UK but it never reached our island. I hope and pray that the resources to address the disease are available should the case in Armagh be confirmed, given the inherent danger of the spread of foot and mouth disease to this part of the island. There is an enormous amount at stake. We do not fully realise the gravity of the crisis.</P>

      <P>A farmer contacted me yesterday who had a fallen animal on his farm. The animal had died as a result of pneumonia. One can no longer bury an animal on one's farm under regulations. The local DVO insists the carcase must be collected by a fellmonger and disposed of, usually at a tannery. The man who contacted me did not want the fellmonger's truck on his land because he did not have the facility to disinfect a large truck and he also had misgivings about a truck that was used to convey dead animals coming on to his farm in the current circumstances. He wanted to bury the animal on the farm using quick lime. He telephoned the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office in Roscommon town and was told that it was not possible to do that and that the animal would have to be picked up by a fellmonger. I do not know whether the animal is still on the farm, but such regulations must be examined.</P>
      <P>If animals should be buried on farms, it should be done under the supervision of officials of the Department using substances such as quick lime, if necessary, as long as the soil quality is known. There is a difficulty in regard to burying BSE-infected animals but we are all buried in the earth at the end of the day. Regulations of this nature must be examined. Farmers, such as the unfortunate man I mentioned, should not be left in limbo when they have a dead animal on their land and do not want vehicles used for the conveyance of fallen animals on their land, with good reason, yet because of the rigidity of one of the Department's regulations they do not know what to do. I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.</P>
      <P>The current strain of foot and month disease is very virulent. It has its origins in Asia and is known as the &ldquo;pan-Asian topotype&rdquo;. It was discovered in India, spread eastwards towards Mongolia and then spread westwards. It is such a virulent strain that only ten viruses are enough to infect an animal. That demonstrates the difficulty of containing the disease. It is a hardy strain since it has spread throughout parts of the world where foot and mouth disease is endemic. The grasslands of central Asia are the natural habitat of bovine animals and exotic diseases such as foot and mouth disease are endemic. Foot and mouth disease is also endemic in Latin America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of the 1967 outbreak in the UK was canned meat from Argentina. The source of the current outbreaks is thought to be swill imported <Col N="766" /> from Asia. It is extraordinary that waste food from restaurants and hotels can be imported from Asian countries to be used by the pig industry in the UK. I do not know whether Ireland imports swill, but talking about it is revolting. There is no guarantee this product has been properly pasteurised before it is fed to animals. If swill proves to be the source of the outbreak in the UK, it was not properly treated. I do not know whether Ireland imports swill, but I am glad the Minister of State is shaking his head.</P>
    <P>However, in the context of our membership of the EU and the protection of a healthy agricultural industry, we should ensure there is an EU regulation in regard to the importation of such products which can be the carriers of diseases such as foot and mouth disease. If left unchecked, in a number of weeks it could infect every cloven-footed animal in this country.</P>
    <P>That is the potential nightmare we face and we can only hope and pray that what was reported from Armagh earlier will prove to be a false alarm. If not, one hopes the disease will not spread south of the Border. I am a farmer and for that reason I might understand the situation better than others. I wish the Minister of State well and his officials, who must ensure regulations are implemented. They must be imaginative in what they do because they are dealing with new circumstances which they have not experienced in the past. It will not be easy but we can only wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank and congratulate him and his Department on the action they have taken to date in trying to ensure the country remains free of foot and mouth disease. Quite a number of important points have been made by many speakers. The problems which would result from the disease spreading from England to this country are too serious to contemplate. Unfortunately, there is a suspected case in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I clearly remember the precautions taken in the 1960s when there were real problems. However, at that time we did not have the same volume of ro-ro traffic in terms of lorries and cars coming from England to Ireland and it was easier to contain the disease. Unfortunately, given the number of people moving between the countries, it is now very difficult to contain the disease. Every person coming here, and every Irish person, should realise they have a serious responsibility to ensure they take the required precautions. If possible, those abroad should not return until the disease has been controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many organisations have taken steps to assist in controlling the disease. Teagasc has abandoned all farm visits, closed agricultural colleges and has recalled people on placements, which are steps in the right direction. The IRFU has cancelled the rugby international, for which great credit is due to the union. Soccer authorities and the GAA <Col N="767" /> have a major responsibility to immediately call off games over the next number of weeks to ensure they play their part in stopping the spread of foot and mouth disease. We know that very large crowds gather at games, with people travelling from England and further afield to participate or spectate. If this problem abates and does not come to Ireland there will be lots of time for playing games later in the year. These organisations have a responsibility to help the Minister and the Department in curtailing and stopping the spread of the disease. If it spreads here the consequences will be dire for the farming sector.</P>
    <P>I watched the destruction of infected animals on television over the past few days and saw vermin and birds &ndash; grey crows and magpies &ndash; which spread the disease. Something must be done to curtail them to ensure they do not carry or spread the disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the steps he has taken in terms of curtailing the spread of the disease and the involvement of the Garda, the Army and officials from the Department. If necessary, the FCA should be called in to back up those officials who are trying to do the best they can.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the responsibilities of those travelling to Ireland, but the country from which they travel, if it has outbreaks of the disease, must also take responsibility and ensure people are disinfected in the required manner so the full onus is not on the country of destination. At all times Aer Lingus announces that those who have any contact whatever with farming should make contact with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It saddens me to hear people saying they came through certain ports and saw no facilities for disinfecting. If those people have an interest in the country they should look for the facilities and ensure they are disinfected.</P>
    <P>Regarding BSE, the changes to the destruction scheme are important and welcome. The Minister said a special purchase scheme will run until the end of the year. It was wrong and sad that cattle over 30 months were being purchased for destruction. The change will mean meat can be used, if needed, to feed the hungry. The quota system has also changed and now will be regionally based. The period in question is 1997-2000, with a quota plus 3% being available for those years. I hope there will be flexibility as a number of herds, for one reason or another, may have been destocked. I hope officials from the Department will look favourably at such situations to ensure farmers in suckler schemes who destocked will be afforded the opportunity to return to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the destruction of calves, I very much welcome the increase from 20% to 40% in terms of the heifer facility and suckler cows, and credit is due to the Minister and his officials. This will ensure we are not destructing much stock and <Col N="768" /> that even maiden heifers will qualify under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Many other points have been made. The situation is grave in terms of Ireland. Regarding slaughter facilities, perhaps smaller abattoirs are easier to control. There are too many lorries transporting stock that do not have effluent storage facilities. There are facilities at marts to power hose out those lorries but unfortunately they are not being used. I want to compliment the Minister sincerely for making every effort. It is a very difficult time for him, for his officials and for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to the House. We are in a very serious situation. In the last week the necessary level of urgency was not instilled by the Department and by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in particular. The Minister of State in his address stated:</P>
      <P>Staff of my Department throughout the country were put on alert on Wednesday last while arrangements were made with the Garda and Army authorities for appropriate resources to be sent to the Border area immediately.</P>
      <P>That may very well be so but there was no great evidence of it on the ground. Increasingly instances are arising where people are walking through air and seaports without any restrictions or disinfecting.</P>
      <P>A quite lackadaisical approach has been adopted. Despite the situation developing in Armagh since the Minister of State commenced addressing the House we still have traffic travelling on the main Belfast-Dublin road. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development said in the Dáil that the exclusion zone is in the process of being determined. At 12 noon today it was decided that there was a serious crisis on a farm in Armagh. Five hours later we are still deciding where the exclusion zone is and no diversion of traffic has taken place. That is unacceptable. Perhaps the required sense of urgency will arise now that the crisis has come so close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incubation period for this disease varies from 14 to 20 days in sheep. A lot can have happened over the last week to ten days. In relation to that particular farm, sheep have been sold or transferred across the Border since 1 February. Can the Minister advise the House what has happened to those sheep and what monitors have been put into place? Three consignments have been imported since 1 February. Two went to Wexford and the other went to the West for slaughter. What has the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development done in relation to the consignments? What monitors have been put in place and what action has been taken to have these animals slaughtered? They <Col N="769" /> are here but we do not know where they are or what action has been taken.</P>
    <P>The movement of people has been widely discussed and I take the opportunity to congratulate those organisations which have responsibly decided to call off events where there would be major gatherings of people. That is the least that should be done. Every citizen has a duty to act in a responsible fashion due to the terrible effect this potential crisis could have on a wide range of families and on consumers.</P>
    <P>There is no information available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development website regarding the details of this disease. Farmers are not able to identify it until it is at a fairly advanced stage; they could not identify a potential case. It is important that a website be created immediately. The British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food website carries clear details of symptoms to help farmers identify potential dangers within their herds at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to get his officials on local radio and in touch with local newspapers to highlight the urgency in relation to foot and mouth. This is a crisis and it should not be underestimated. The lackadaisical approach and the incidences reported of people coming here without checks from agricultural colleges in England and from British farms is extraordinary. Every vehicle that comes in must be disinfected and monitored closely. To do that needs additional personnel at the ports. It is not going to happen by chance. I disagree with Senator Moylan who says that the onus is on the person coming in. The onus is on us to make sure that no one comes in without being vetted. It is vital that people arriving at Dublin Airport are directed into a disinfecting area. The same is true of Rosslare or crossing the Border where vehicles and passengers should be subject to the same procedure.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern is driving across the Border through south Armagh possibly in the exclusion zone of an infected area. At the very least traffic should be diverted to another route. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, may well shake his head and say it is all hogwash. This issue is too serious to treat in a dismissive fashion. I am somewhat concerned by his facial responses to some of the things I have said.</P>
    <P>He stated in his address that there are extensive advertisements going up. They are not that extensive. The level of the crisis has not really registered with the vast majority of the public. He stated that &ldquo;arrangements were put in place from the outset to ensure that disinfection of vehicles and people took place at entry points&rdquo;. The reality was very different. There is ample evidence that many vehicles and people have not been disinfected.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and it is only just beginning to register. There is an onus on the Department to be much more proactive and to <Col N="770" /> highlight the issues in local media and farming organisations. The farm organisations are not in a position to inform their members as to the details and symptoms of the disease. That is where the Department is falling down. It has not clearly advised in detail what the situation is and it has a duty to do that.</P>
    <P>It is highly commendable that sporting organisations have cancelled many events. Other organisations have a responsibility, in the national interest, to cancel any events they intend to hold in the coming days or weeks. In my opinion, no risks, no matter how minimal, should be taken and there is a need to communicate this to all organisations and bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also referred to the Commission's proposals for the reform of the beef regime. In my opinion that matter will have to be debated in greater detail when the opportunity presents itself. I do not believe that the proposals put forward are in the interests of small or medium farmers or the Irish economy and we must object to certain aspects of them. I hope we will have an opportunity at a future date to discuss that issue in greater detail.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the measures he has put in place to date. I was travelling down from Donegal on Sunday evening and, passing through Monaghan, I encountered a Garda Síochána checkpoint at which were stationed officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who had laid out disinfectant mats, etc. It was obvious that they were taking their job seriously. However, on Friday night when I was passing through the Six Counties on my way into Donegal there was a solitary member of the Garda Síochána on duty at Pettigoe. He did not stop me, wave me down or question me and there were no disinfectant mats to drive over. That was on the main artery taken by people travelling from Cavan, Navan, Belturbet or Enniskillen into Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that this matter has taken hold in the national consciousness. This is not merely a crisis in farming, it is a national crisis. If there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here, millions of pounds will have to be spent in compensating people. That money could be better spent in some other way. If there is an outbreak, the economy will be destroyed. I have discussed this matter with people since I returned to Dublin and, in general, they stated that it involves farmers, that it is a disease similar to BSE and that it does not harm humans. I hope the Minister of State can pressurise the media into highlighting on every news bulletin ways in which the disease can be identified early, the symptoms involved, the need to take precautions when entering and <Col N="771" /> leaving farms or when travelling from place to place and the ease with which this disease is communicated.</P>
    <P>We have been very fortunate that there has not been such an outbreak in the past 15 or 20 years. However, foot and mouth disease can take hold very quickly and destroy an entire economy. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, are aware of that fact. I appreciate the work they are doing, but I still believe that the members of the public, particularly city dwellers, have not grasped the seriousness of the situation. Due to the fact this is not just a farming crisis but one of national proportions, it is essential that we get the message across to people. I call on the Minister of State to do everything possible to encourage the media to co-operate. I am not stating that people are not co-operating or that anyone is to blame; I am merely stating that the implications for the economy have not yet permeated the public consciousness.</P>
    <P>I trust that everyone will play a part in getting the message across. The Opposition parties have all promised support for the measures we must put in place. I hope that we can keep the disease out of Ireland. In that context, everyone will have to do a great deal to ensure that there is no outbreak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this important issue. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, in Europe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, at home have worked effectively and efficiently in recent days to ensure that the necessary precautions have been taken. From Sunday or Monday onwards, the goalposts moved when we realised the full extent of the spread of this virus across the UK. Initially, it appeared that it would be contained locally but that did not happen. As a result we had to up the ante in various ways in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has been at pains to point out that everyone must take responsibility for ensuring that this terrible virus does not spread into this country. Senator Taylor-Quinn stated that this matter does not involve responsibility on the part of individuals. However, I believe it does. The IRFU and other sporting organisations took it upon themselves to shoulder responsibility by cancelling fixtures following encouragement from the Government, the Minister and the Department. However, the decision to cancel or postpone was voluntary and I compliment those involved for assuming responsibility in that regard. In the same way, every individual travelling from the UK must ask themselves whether it is necessary to make the journey in the first instance. If the answer is yes, then every necessary precaution should be taken because the agriculture industry and other industries will face devastation if proper care is not taken. The agriculture sector is already in the midst of a difficult <Col N="772" /> period, particularly in terms of trying to restore confidence in beef following the BSE crisis. It is incumbent on everyone to take the kind of responsibility to which the Minister of State referred in order to ensure that the disease does not spread to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was contacted this morning by constituents who expressed grave concerns that poultry and poultry products are still being imported from Europe. What is happening is that loads are being split: one part of a load is delivered to a destination in the UK while the remainder is delivered here. The poultry is very important to west Limerick, where three large poultry concerns are located. Approximately 40% of those employed in the industry are related to people who are directly involved in farming. I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter further. I am aware that poultry are not considered to be carriers of the virus. I do not mean to be alarmist but if a lorry driver delivers part of his load in the UK it is quite possible that someone might step on to the vehicle and that the virus could be spread in this manner. I have no evidence to suggest that but surely it is common sense. If the virus can spread as easily as we have been told in recent days, it is possible it could spread in this way. The position must be examined and, if necessary, this practice should stop immediately in order that there is no outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State and the Department for their efforts. I hope that the regulations and restrictions that have been put in place will be successful in ensuring that the virus does not spread to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion members of the public are being very sensible in their approach to this matter. I refer in particular to sporting groups, farming organisations, etc. To place this matter in context, any party's ard fheis is a major event. The fact that the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, with the exception of the Leader's speech on Saturday night, has been cancelled is sufficient to alert people to the dangers posed by the spread of this disease. This move is a major public relations exercise on the part of Fine Gael. Such is our concern about this matter that we have limited the Ard-Fheis to the Leader's speech on Saturday night. Deputies and Senators have been requested to remain in Dublin between now and Saturday to ensure that they do not return home and mingle with people before travelling back to the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cregan that people are not aware of what foot and mouth disease is like in animals and the Government must work with the media to get that across to everyone, particularly given Irish people's high level of mobility. A newspaper advertisement is not a sufficient deterrent. There are similar advertisements in newspapers about scares but not everyone reads <Col N="773" /> the newspapers. I am concerned by individual cases, such as the young man whose family contacted me when he returned from hill walking in Northumberland. He looked for a disinfection method in Dublin Airport last Thursday but found none. He lives on a farm but he did not return there; he stayed elsewhere and then went to work. He was horrified by the situation. The Slieve Felim singers from my area on the Tipperary-Limerick border returned from Britain to Shannon last Sunday night. They rang me early on Monday morning to tell me they had not been asked where they had been, where they had come from or whether they had visited farms, nor was there any disinfection.</P>
    <P>The public is leading this debate and asking the questions. That is unusual, but such is their concern and civic responsibility regarding the importance of agriculture and the devastation that may occur if foot and mouth breaks out here, though please God that will not happen. I read today accounts of burning pyres of thousands of cattle in Britain. There was a huge reaction recently from farmers when their beef cows were destroyed due to BSE, which shocked the country. This is a very hard time for farmers, given this is a second scare. The virus can spread unbelievably quickly. According to an eminent expert quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, this virulent virus can be carried by wind for up to 300 kilometres. There is no safe haven, particularly with the extraordinary weather changes we have experienced.</P>
    <P>This disastrous outbreak is now more widespread geographically than the 1967 outbreak, which I remember. The television clips of that period show the country coming to a complete standstill. The primary routes for infection are through animal to animal contact, meat products, animal to human contact, vehicles and even dirty boots. Precautions must be very stringent and that is why I was disappointed when, after the alert in the middle of last week, officials were not sent to the airports. Putting up a sign is not sufficient, as that leaves it up to the person to state whether he or she has been on a farm. There should be officials stopping passengers, as the latter would not mind having their journeys delayed because it is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The outbreak in Anglesey is so close to us that it was one of the reasons we in Fine Gael were so concerned and decided to cancel our Ard Fheis, but even when we made that decision we were not aware of the suspected outbreak in Armagh. Every hour the news gets more and more negative. I hope the farming population can survive this and that God is on our side. I hope we can say after this that every single precaution was taken. I compliment the Government on certain aspects of its approach but I would prefer to be able to say that every precaution has been taken and I cannot, particularly given the two cases I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> The extermination aspect of this crisis shocks me and we should empathise with the farmers of Britain and Northern Ireland. I know the Taoiseach is meeting the British Prime Minister to discuss this and to see what more can be done, but I hope there is contact every second of the day with the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Bríd Rodgers, and that we are on red alert to ensure that the infection will not spread here.</P>
    <P>This is a national emergency. In the Dáil debate on this matter today Deputy Dukes mentioned a road which goes through an exclusion zone but the Minister said he was not aware of it until 12 p.m., though he said that at 4.30 p.m. I would have thought the Garda or another appropriate body would have put a rerouting operation in place but apparently not. I hope it has been done by now.</P>
    <P>The precautions being taken in Britain indicate that this emergency will be very costly. Britain has more resources than us but the lesson for us is that we must be vigilant even during safe times. We have had the BSE scare and now we may face an epidemic, possibly because a lorry was not washed. Do we consider these matters in safer times and ensure we have absolute cleanliness everywhere in the meat and haulage industries? Every aspect of Irish economic life is affected by this. It is not just a farming problem, it requires industrial and environmental involvement also. Our party will co-operate with the Minister and the high level group which straddles other Departments that he has established to deal with this problem. We will be vigilant and supportive and perhaps it will stop short at either a sea or land border, but let us take every necessary precaution.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Department on the steps that have been taken but, like other Senators, I feel we need to make the public more aware of the enormity of the problem we face. I sympathise deeply with the farming community North and South, to whom this is yet another hammer blow, but there is a feeling among the urban population that since the disease is not transmissible to humans it is somehow not as important as BSE. I have lived through two of the previous crises and I know how serious it is. In the past there was great co-operation between the Department of Agriculture in the North of Ireland and the Department in the Republic, even when there were no North-South bodies, and I hope it will be possible to build on that. We should realise we are an island surrounded by water and, apart from the danger of wind-blown infection, that should <Col N="775" /> increase the possibility of keeping this dreaded disease out of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Four hours ago, I came through Meigh on the train. This is one of the problems when traffic is diverted around that particular exclusion zone. The main road to Belfast runs right through that town, as does the main railway line, and it is difficult terrain to find alternative routes or divert people. It may be a case for some degree of lateral thinking. I remember when going to Australia, people marched up and down the plane with an aerosol disinfecting the passengers and we put up with it in the interests of health. It may be that vehicles on the main road to the North and trains on the main line could be made to pass through some sort of tunnel in which disinfectant is spread on the body and wheels. Like other Senators, I came through Dublin Airport towards the end of last week and found no precautions being taken. I know how difficult it is, but nevertheless it is utterly important that it should be done.</P>
      <P>I commend the rugby authorities and the Fine Gael Party for the steps they have taken to cut down on travel. In so far as rugby and racing are concerned, we were all thinking about travel to and from Great Britain. Since there is a real possibility of an outbreak in county Armagh, we should ask the GAA, in particular, to review a number of their matches, which I enjoy going to myself. There is a broader national interest and people should not travel as happened in the past. I remember all-Ireland finals being postponed on account of foot and mouth disease. I commend the Minister for State and wish him well in the steps he is taking.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for allowing me to share his time. I am known for giving the farming community the sharp end of my tongue occasionally, but this is a time for solidarity across the whole country. Those of us from an urban background have a particular obligation to reiterate the seriousness of this matter. Because there is not a human health dimension to this, people living in urban areas are inclined to underestimate its significance. It is potentially the greatest economic catastrophe we have suffered, perhaps in 15 years. By an immense proportion, it is the biggest economic crisis since the beginning of our new-found prosperity.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly possible for people, including me, to say that things could and should have been done better. Perhaps they should, but there has been enough of that now. Every constructive suggestion made will be listened to and acted upon, and Senator Hayes made a series of them. We should all believe that this is a question of national solidarity in which everybody's interest is threatened. It is not just farming and agri-business, it is the country's future that is threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> All of us should do everything we can to encourage awareness and a practical patriotism. I do not believe that statements about going to Cheltenham, even if they are only aspirational, are the stuff to create a sense of crisis. I am sorry for the rugby players, the supporters, the Fine Gael members and everybody who is inconvenienced by this. That is not to say that anybody would have the right to do otherwise. It is far too serious a matter for that. It is potentially a catastrophe and the ramifications are great for a large part of our economy, a part which is becoming a real industry as opposed to something dependent on EU support.</P>
    <P>We need to think big when responding to this. Senator Hayes suggested large groups of people be disinfected. People might not like the smell of disinfectant on their clothes, but that is a minor inconvenience by comparison to what could happen, not just to farmers and to agri-business but to the whole country. We could turn from boom to a serious economic crisis if this threat materialises.</P>
    <P>We must learn a lesson about the way the European Single Market works and the freedom of movement. Even though it is 34 years since the last outbreak in Britain, we have had a single European market without customs boundaries for perhaps only eight years, since 1993. In that period, we have had one major outbreak which may have originated in Greece &ndash; we are not sure &ndash; or outside the EU, and in a liberalised trade regime it has moved around Europe. We need to review the way in which animals and livestock can move around a region as large as the European Union. It is only in the past eight years that Europe has been without customs boundaries and without checks. If once in eight years we are to have a catastrophe of this scale, it is clear there are issues about how we regulate the movement of livestock, which we have not yet dealt with satisfactorily. It may be necessary, not perhaps on a customs basis but on an animal health basis, to re-introduce significant controls on cross-border transport of livestock. We have now learnt that our controls, which we believed were perfect, are not perfect.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government success on this issue. It is not a question of the Government succeeding but of the country succeeding in averting what it is not exaggerating to call a potential catastrophe.</P>

      <P>I thank Members of this House for their very supportive comments and practical suggestions. Senator Hayes suggested spraying individuals. There would be many objections to that and we could be open to the possibility of being sued. It is something we will have to consider. We thought about using air disinfectants etc.</P>

    <P>If foot and mouth disease is on the island of Ireland, we have a major disaster. That will mean the restriction of individuals and preventing farm<Col N="777" /> ers from allowing anyone on their farm, except veterinary officers. Other Department staff will not go near farms until this is over. The movement of cattle from farm to farm will be stopped. The sale of cattle will only be allowed when they are being brought for slaughter, and even that may have to be reviewed in the next few days.</P>
    <P>This is a disease that is not of our origin but has come in through people who have been less responsible than others. This is a national emergency. We need the widespread co-operation of everybody, including people completely remote from farming. I was horrified and disgusted at the lack of reaction to a statement this morning that, irrespective of whether there was a disease, people would go to Cheltenham, particularly when I see what the IRFU, which is not directly involved in farming, is prepared to do. We are deeply concerned about the situation today and that the outbreak may have spread across the Border. Traceability of movement is difficult as people do not always co-operate. At this stage whatever measures need to be taken are a matter of national interest.</P>
    <P>I hope and pray the disease is not on this island. Within the jurisdiction of the Twenty-six Counties, in co-operation with the Northern counties, we have taken all the measures possible to prevent it spreading. The animals concerned came in before or after 1 February and the disease was not notified to us until 21 February. The incubation period could be between 20 and 30 days in sheep. It is a less virulent type of disease that sheep get but nevertheless it is one that can infect during the incubation period. I hope the Members will understand that I do not wish to say anything further until we have confirmation on the actions, in addition to those already taken, we will take in a purely extremely emergency situation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, to the House. I am delighted to have the opportunity of proposing this Bill on Second Stage and I would be heartened if the Minister would reply in the positive. The purpose of the Bill is to focus attention <Col N="778" /> on the Irish banking system, to examine its role in Irish society and specifically to provide for regulatory procedures to ensure that a social dimension is added to the existing regulation of the banks exercised at present by the Central Bank. Section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, provides for the Central Bank to grant licences to carry on a banking business. Licence may be refused if the Central Bank is satisfied that the granting of a licence would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking. Section 10 allows the Central Bank to impose conditions which in the opinion of the Central Bank are calculated to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking. Further conditions can be added to a licence already granted.</P>
    <P>In the context of these powers my amendment is simple and straightforward. It seeks to confer on the Central Bank the additional responsibility of supervising the operation of the banking system. It attempts to ensure that a bank has and maintains a sufficient number of branches and other offices throughout the State to meet the reasonable requirements of that bank. This Bill if passed will require the banking sector to live up to its social obligations and its much vaunted customer care pronouncements. How often have we seen literature on TV and radio advertisements presenting the banks as customer friendly, customer based and customer caring bodies? The impression given is that the customer comes first. In reality, that means the corporate customer. Unfortunately, the elderly pensioner, the happy couple buying their first home or the young people opening their first account who are so often depicted in the promotional literature are not central to the banks' customer service. I believe the banks are regularly guilty of false advertising.</P>
    <P>This harsh reality was driven home to me in July last year when the Bank of Ireland announced that it was closing 20% of its branch network throughout the country, approximately 60 branches, in a major cost-cutting exercise. The announcement was all the more appalling because the bank had just announced an 80% increase in annual pre-tax profits, a record increase which at that point was £0.75 billion for the 12 months. Allied Irish Bank has just announced record profits of almost £1 billion, the first Irish financial business to reach that level of profitability in a year. It is also engaged in a programme of cost-cutting and branch and office closures. The end result is that while the bank profits are soaring and while major changes that successive Governments have made to corporation tax has reduced the tax take bill from approximately 40% a few years ago to 12.5% in 2003, the service to the ordinary customer is declining if not disappearing altogether.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland dropped a bombshell on the communities of Stoneybatter and Cabra when it announced its intention to close its two <Col N="779" /> branches in these areas in July 2000. These were the first two of five branches that it closed before Christmas. I campaigned strongly against those closures and collected 12,000 petitions signed by local people who are extremely annoyed by the bank's decision. At the end of October I led a delegation of residents from Cabra and Stoneybatter to meet the bank's representatives and to present them with a petition urging them to keep the branches open. The delegation argued strenuously, but to no avail, on the grounds of the huge population of the two areas, the huge development and expansion that was taking place there and the heavy blow it would be to the elderly and the business community in particular. Condemnation of the closures even came from the pulpit of the local church in Aughrim Street. The bank representatives reiterated their decision to close the branches and to replace the direct customer service with Internet and telephone banking as though this was a satisfactory alternative to the needs of the ordinary customers who want and need an accessible service where they can conduct their business face to face and in private. That is customer service.</P>
    <P>I received many e-mails and letters about this, recording the frustration and annoyance of local people. One letter which was originally sent to Mr. Holden, the general manager in charge of personnel matters, states strong objections to the bank's decision to close the bank in Stoneybatter. It reminds him that in such a community the older people would be the most affected. They will now have to travel further to do their banking. It is disgusting to see the lack of care shown towards the people who built the country, people who worked themselves to the bone so that others could sit in warm, comfortable offices and receive generous monthly pay cheques.</P>
    <P>There are at least ten elderly people living in a very small street in Stonybatter, and 24 hour Internet banking and telephone banking means nothing to them. In some cases the trip to the bank was a weekly ritual which allowed them to get out and about, meet people and interact in a society that often ignores the basic rights of the elderly. When an institution like the Bank of Ireland leads the way in pushing the elderly into the background, others will follow.</P>
    <P>The next time there is news of an elderly person mugged on the journey to withdraw their pension, the banks must take the blame. The correspondent says that hopefully it will never happen to any of the bank employees' loved ones. This is a typical letter sent to the Bank of Ireland at the time and it was not heeded.</P>
    <P>The desire for profits at all costs, and particularly at the expense of customer service, is not in the long-term interests of the banks. In Britain, NatWest has realised the long-term benefits of retaining the existing branch structure. It has halted all proposed closures and has used this to <Col N="780" /> great effect in its publicity campaign. Instead of being driven by corporate greed, the banks should put people before profit and make friendly customer service the hallmark of the banking system.</P>
    <P>Recent announcements by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance relating to the Central Bank and a new financial services authority were made on 20 February 2001. They totally enhance and bolster the principles and substance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be subsumed into the new body in relation to financial services. A financial services ombudsman will deal with customer complaints. Consumer and customer protection will now be on a par with prudential supervision for the very first time. That in itself is a revolution in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>In his announcement of the new structure for financial services regulations, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said that the overall aim of all these changes is to develop a renewed focus on consumer issues while facilitating the development of a competitive and modern financial system. The Minister emphasised that customers' interests are important and must be taken into account. He said that the new regulatory body must also ensure that the institutions deal with their customers on the basis of standards of decency, probity and fairness.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to impose on the Central Bank an obligation to take into consideration the inadequacy of the branch network of each bank and to assure that there is a satisfactory level of customer service in place.</P>
    <P>I have read an internal document from the Bank of Ireland Group which details a profile of the closure of the Stonybatter branch. It notes that Stonybatter is located less than a mile from Smithfield and is one of the oldest suburban villages in Dublin, dating back 1,700 years. It states that in early August the bank manager contacted the top 50 customers and there were no defections. The remainder of the top customers and high-potential customers as defined by the bank's project office were contacted during August. The bank manager notes that the bank took a lot of flack during this time when the branch stopped accepting crossed cheques and cheques drawn on other banks.</P>
    <P>In September, the document records that customer reaction to the merger was gaining momentum and there was evidence of an organised campaign under way. The bank manager met officers from the residents' association and various projects representing the community. He reported that there was a steady flow of accounts transferring to other branches but not too many were going to competitors.</P>
    <P>By October the bank manager noted that the bank was in the thick of the closure reaction and that things were hotting up on all fronts, particularly on the customer reaction side. He says that <Col N="781" /> local politicians were galvanising support within the community and that customers were being encouraged to call to the branch and protest. On 2 October 2000, a customer rang to inform him that the bank had been denounced from the pulpit by the parish priest.</P>
    <P>The manager also records that he invited an important customer to the all-Ireland final replay. This person, a GAA fanatic and a long-standing customer, said that he would transfer his account to the Smithfield branch to ensure that he would get a ticket to the all-Ireland final.</P>
    <P>The date 16 October 2000 was referred to as D-day for the cessation of most of the labour-intensive, low profit, cashier transactions. A cashier noted that the customers were lining up to express their displeasure. By the end of the week, the cashiers and the customer service team were mentally and physically drained.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an t-Aire. Senator Costello has done a very simple job of exposing reality, especially in his last reference. There is a wonderful cosy mix about the benevolent bank, the banks who are just dying to loan you money to buy a car or a house. The banks portray themselves as a glamourised and romantic version of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, there to help you out of every possible loophole, provided of course you can pay for it. This is the one unstated distinction between them and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
      <P>This is about the interaction between the market and society. The market is a wonderful way to create wealth. Karl Marx accepted that more than 100 years ago. The real issue is how do you relate society to the market and what do you do when the market begins to lose the run of itself. What we have learned is that the only way, short of public control, to regulate a market, is to ensure that markets are competitive.</P>
      <P>Every good economist, and even a bad one, can tell you that a competitive market means there must be enough participants in the market. Then, if one leaves, it does not affect the market. That is manifestly not the case in the banking sector. If one bank left, there would be a national catastrophe.</P>
      <P>They have so many branches spread through society. The banks know that society needs them. When one of them almost went belly-up in the 1980s, society baled it out. They pretend now that it never happened. They have a degree of what Galbraith called oligopoly. This means they are not really a monopoly but they are not really a market either, they are somewhere in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even within the canons of market economics, their self-aggrandisement, shown by the minimising of what they regard as uneconomical cost bases to maximise their profits, is not regarded as optimal for society. No plausible argument can be made by an advocate of the marketplace to make <Col N="782" /> us believe that institutions as powerful as the two major banks should be allowed to make decisions of enormous social impact. Their interests and the interests of society at large do not and cannot overlap if they are not subject to vigorous and sustained competitive forces, which is not the case. If banks were subject to those forces they would not be able to write the cynical nonsense that Senator Costello has just read to the House.</P>
    <P>They take such risks because they know that competitors will not take over their customers. The banks know that no company in a competitive marketplace would ever be able to get away with treating a customer the way that bank described itself as treating its customers. If the market cannot guarantee that customers are not treated in this fashion, the market has failed, and it is a classic example of market failure, as any first year economics student will know.</P>
    <P>There is only one solution and that is light, but firm, regulation. The banks do not close all loss-making branches. There is not a student bank branch anywhere that is making money. These branches are open because of the potential profitability of their customers. The closure of branches is not about the profitability of the branch but a statement on the future of particular communities. Banks are saying that while a particular branch is making money now, there is nothing in its local community to give any hope that the people who use these branches will enable banks to make money in the future.</P>
    <P>Yet banks queue up in my workplace, the Cork Institute of Technology, and almost come to blows on occasions, to get students to join their branch. They will not make a penny from these students when they are in college, but want their custom because students are seen as those who will make real money, with the potential for long-term profitability. The banks will take the losses, the hit, the cost of sponsorship and funding, of being everybody's benevolent sister and brother giving out money, because they know in the long term there is money to be made.</P>
    <P>This is the basic decision that banks make when they close down a branch which they see as having no future. This is a further accumulation of a vision which divides society into those who have and those who have not. This is perfectly epitomised in my own city of Cork where you could count on one hand the number of ATMs north of the River Lee. That is where those who are considered poor live. On the south of the river there is an ATM wherever there are several shops together. That is where people with money live and they are seen as worth servicing by the banks, but one must drive for a mile or two on the north side of Cork to find an ATM. Of those ATMs on the north of the city, two are not serviced by the two major banks. There are four ATMs for the whole of Cork city north of the River Lee and that is because banks do not accept that they have social obligations. Many people tell banks that <Col N="783" /> they should not think about social obligations but it is a foolish, short-term view of society which believes that institutions as big, powerful and significant in our society do not have social obligations.</P>
    <P>We want to give a very gentle nudge to the Central Bank to ensure that as part of its brief, the physical, building-orientated manifestation of banking, rather than its Internet or telephone manifestation, remains a part of the structures of society. Bank branches are a part of the services to society and a part of what people need to live.</P>
    <P>One can do much by Internet or by telephone banking but you cannot lodge cash or cheques in this way. Every citizen must go to a bank to lodge cash. We are not near a cashless society nor a plastic society and the degree to which we depend on notes and coins will become apparent when the euro is introduced at the turn of the year.</P>
    <P>This is a cautious, non-radical Bill. It is simply a warning to the banks that they have social obligations and cannot pick and choose the areas of society they wish to support, as they have done by focusing on nice things such as GAA all-Ireland sponsorship. Banks have obligations not to walk away from a community because they decide that community does not count anymore. The communities within which banks are situated and where they were welcomed when they were small and less profit hungry have rights too.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank should be the arbiter which says no to the major banks, who should be told that to close bank branches leaves a community exposed and vulnerable. The Central Bank should make it clear that this is not something that society will tolerate. It is a very small change to ask for and I hope the Government will accept the principle and we can talk about the detail later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to this Private Members' Bill, which is sponsored by Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan.</P>
      <P>As the explanatory and financial memorandum explains, the purpose of the proposed Bill is to impose on the Central Bank, as the banking regulator, an obligation to consider whether to attach conditions regarding the adequacy of the branch network of a bank on the holder of a banking licence. This obligation would apply to existing licensees and to new applicants for such licences.</P>
      <P>How to maintain appropriate levels of access to banking services at a time of major restructuring in the banking sector is a topical issue and one which reaches into the lives of many of our fellow citizens. However, I have concerns of both a general and a specific nature about how the Bill proposes to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> It is useful to consider the background and context in which the current restructuring of bank branch networks is taking place. The dynamic changes experienced in Ireland over recent years have left very few sectors of our society untouched. The banking industry, perhaps contrary to popular stereotype, has been one of the sectors which has changed most in recent decades. It is a sector which has grown rapidly, mainly due to the growth of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Retail banking products have traditionally been delivered through an extensive branch structure. The physical evidence of this is the architectural presence of banking halls on our main streets throughout the country. These impressive structures symbolise the stability of the banks which operate from within, yet also serve to distract from the nature of the businesses to which they are home, businesses which have to react to the market and which must move with the times to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>The nature of the industry itself is also changing rapidly. With new investment outlets available to consumers, the banks not only have to rely on deposit-taking, but also must raise funds on the wholesale markets. One of the effects of this new environment is the need for banks to continually keep their branch presence under review and to monitor the costs associated with each branch.</P>
    <P>Over the last century, the number of branches and sub-branches in Ireland fluctuated between 700 and 1,000. As economic activity altered and as populations moved, this number varied. Figures up to the end of 1999 show that overall branch numbers were stable at around 900 nationwide. The growth of new suburbs and the development of retail shopping centres has seen the opening of new bank branches in or near these centres, while some branches would have closed for various reasons.</P>
    <P>The impact of technology on Irish banking and banking internationally cannot be understated. Today we receive a host of banking services on a 24 hour basis which a few decades ago would have been unimaginable. All Members present probably remember the first time they used an ATM and can recall the sense of wonder that it was possible to get cash on a weekend or late at night. Today, not alone can we access our cash while in Ireland, but we can use the same card to withdraw money from our accounts while travelling abroad.</P>
    <P>Back home the introduction of the laser card system has meant that we no longer need to carry money to pay cash. Instead with a swipe of the card our accounts can be debited and we can even request to be given some cash back&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen it done. It is increasingly the practice for salaries to be credited centrally to our bank accounts by electronic money transfer, removing the necessity to travel to our branches to lodge our pay cheques.</P>
      <P>Telephone and Internet banking offer the consumer the opportunity to transact much of their banking business without ever having to enter the door of their branch, to the extent even of negotiating a loan over the telephone. In addition, these services are available 24 hours of the day, seven days a week, a significant addition to the banks' customer service and a far cry from those distant days when banking business could only be transacted between ten in the morning and three in the afternoon, with a break for lunch.</P>
      <P>If the effect of these changes has been to change our relationships with our banks, their effect on the banks themselves has been even more profound. Huge investment in technology has been necessary to allow for the introduction of these additional services. The consequent changes in the way payments can be organised and the facilitation of remote access banking change the environment within which traditional banking, including branch banking, operates.</P>
      <P>We are beginning to see some of these changes at present. Where once bank branches worked virtually autonomously, in the more recent past the processing of payments and the provision of credit has become increasingly integrated and centralised. As so much of what had been traditionally the preserve of the branch is done elsewhere, we must expect that remote electronic delivery of banking services will become at least as important as branch based delivery over the period ahead. However, branches will continue to play a key role in the distribution of banking products, as information centres and as flagships for the bank. As some Internet banking ventures have discovered, many customers still like the comfort of bricks and mortar branches, even if they do not visit them often. Nevertheless, commercial realities will increase the pressure for branch rationalisation and consolidation. I will return to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our banks are also facing increased competition from new foreign based entrants to the banking scene. The EU has a single market for financial products, which is being deepened over the current period as a result of its financial services action plan. There are no regulatory barriers to banks from other EU countries competing in Ireland or, indeed, to Irish banks operating in any other EU country. Under EU legislation, a bank <Col N="786" /> may operate in Ireland on the basis of a licence granted by another member state and without having to apply to the Central Bank of Ireland for a local licence. That is an important point in the context of the Bill introduced by the Senators.</P>
    <P>It is worth dwelling on this point for a moment. It means that a foreign based bank can offer its services over the telephone to customers in Ireland and without having to establish a branch or branch network here. More Internet and telephone banks can be expected to look to the Irish market in the future without incurring the cost of developing a high street presence and while being supervised and regulated in another EU member state. The effect of this over time will be greatly to increase the competitive environment within which Irish banks operate.</P>
    <P>However, in publishing this Bill the Senators have highlighted an extremely important issue, namely, the quality of the service which banks offer their customers. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, raised this question in his address to the Institute of Bankers in Ireland on 2 November last, asking: &ldquo;Have the Irish banks got a long-term commitment to successful competition by providing a quality service?&rdquo;  The Minister noted that many of the public were not convinced that the banks did have such a commitment and reminded that audience of the findings of his strategic report on the banking sector, published by the Department of Finance last August. That report saw a need to monitor the performance of the banks on branch reorganisation, noting that it was in their commercial interests to manage such reorganisation so as to minimise the inconvenience to customers.</P>
    <P>Key to the maintenance and encouragement of public confidence in the banking sector is ensuring reasonable access to banking services for all, not just the better off or those living in urban areas. In this regard, the Department of Finance has suggested to the Irish Bankers' Federation that it, as the umbrella organisation for the banking sector, should evaluate industry practice and consider publishing a code of practice on branch restructuring. The federation is considering this suggestion and is hopeful that a basis for progress can be found.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government's decision last week to set up within the Central Bank a new structure for financial services regulation in Ireland will be an essential element in ensuring that Irish banks are more responsive to the consumer. The new body, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; the IFSRA &ndash; will, as part of its mandate, put consumer issues at the heart of the regulatory regime for the financial sector and, for the first time, give the financial services regulator a legal mandate to protect consumer interests. This will be assured through the creation of a post of customer protection director. The IFSRA will also have ancillary structures <Col N="787" /> such as a consumer panel which will be a consultative panel dedicated to consumer interests which, it is expected, will provide an effective forum for issues to be raised and analysed. In addition, the IFSRA will take up the relevant recommendations of the report on strategic issues facing the banking sector.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Government's proposals in this area will lead to a renewed focus on consumer issues in the banking sector while at the same time facilitating the development of a competitive modern financial system. I appreciate the concerns that arise at local level as a result of recent and proposed branch closures. I am certainly aware of them in my constituency. Nonetheless, banks are privately owned commercial entities operating in a highly competitive environment and should not be required to maintain a fixed number of branches, no more than a supermarket chain or a petrol company could be obliged to maintain a specific presence in a geographic area regardless of commercial realities.</P>
    <P>Such requirements are in any case difficult, if not impossible, to define. How many constitutes a &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; number of branches? How far away from each other can branches be? What happens if a competitor opens or closes a branch in a particular geographic location? What are the &ldquo;reasonable requirements&rdquo; of a bank's customers? To attempt to regulate on these points, in addition to being an extremely complex task, would represent an undue interference in the operation of the open market and would undermine the competitive positions of Irish banks. Banks must be free to have due regard to commercial realities when meeting the needs of their customers and the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the legitimate concerns which many express with regard to the restructuring of the branch networks of the main banks and the Government is firmly of the view that such restructuring has to be done in a sensible and intelligent way. Any decisions should be made in partnership with their customers. I note that the Bill would have legal effect only on those banks operating under a licence issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. Banks supervised and regulated elsewhere but selling into the Irish market would not be subject to the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Banks regulated here are not only competing in the management of technological change, but also competing with foreign based and foreign licensed banks. A key element to the maintenance of a strong and vital banking industry which continues to have a presence in our towns and villages is ensuring that all banks compete on a level playing field. The decision to open or close any bank branch is part of that institution's normal commercial activity and should not be regulated by the Central Bank, particularly if a bank's <Col N="788" /> main competitors cannot be made to be similarly accountable.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the approach proposed in this Bill is neither fair nor workable. Instead, I direct the Members' attention to recent initiatives taken or announced by the Minister for Finance. The recommendations of the strategic report on banking issues will be pursued. I also look forward to the advent of the ISFRA, which will improve the focus on consumer concerns. For these reasons, the Government will vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to amend section 10 of the Central Bank Act, 1971. The new subsection proposes that, when regulating the banking system, the Central Bank is to ensure that a bank has and maintains a sufficient number of branches and other offices in the State to meet the requirements of customers of that bank. The Private Members' Bill is introduced by the Labour Party. Senator Costello has always been steadfast in the view that legislation should be introduced to force banks to get Central Bank approval before closing branches.</P>
      <P>This debate comes at an opportune time. It is only days since the Tánaiste announced the establishment of a new authority which will be known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. In a statement accompanying the announcement the Tánaiste said it was a great day for consumers, the financial services industry and for public administration in Ireland. She continued: &ldquo;This is a win for consumers because, for the first time, the consumer is being placed explicitly at the heart of financial service regulation. Our goal is customer focused financial regulation, one port of call for financial customers.&rdquo;  This statement contrasts with the record of Irish banks which are reducing the number of branches available to the public. Bank of Ireland has started to close 65 of its 300 branches in the Republic. Allied Irish Banks, National Irish Bank, Irish Permanent and TSB are also tweaking their networks giving priority to branch closures and relocations. Job losses and pay cuts are also being proposed by most banks. Closing branches will severely affect some customers, particularly those in the inner city and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The banking system relies heavily on new technology. However, there is no point trying to force people away from paper transactions in favour of electronic or telephone banking if the result is disgruntled customers. It might be more appropriate to first generate customer interest in the new facilities and familiarise customers with their advantages. Arbitrarily removing and reducing facilities and services will not make any new friends for the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that like many other businesses, banks face the dilemma of whose interests they should <Col N="789" /> serve. Is their primary function to produce returns and profits for shareholders or should their policies and actions take into account the interests of all stakeholders &ndash; shareholders, employees and customers? In making this decision all businesses have to weigh up the short and long-term considerations. Sharply cutting costs may raise returns for shareholders in the short term but if the cutbacks result in disgruntled customers or demotivated employees the longer term result would be a fall in returns for shareholders.</P>
    <P>It appears that all financial institutions are radically changing the way they do business. The focus is on delivering traditional banking services cheaply <i>via</i> the Internet, telephones or automated cash machines. Bank officials who have been with banks for the past 20 or 30 years must find it difficult to adjust to their different roles. The days when they cashed cheques, lodged deposits and updated account balances are long gone. Before Christmas, Bank of Ireland introduced a strict policy on cashing cheques and will now only oblige certain customers. All these changes might be in banks' interests in terms of increasing profits but they are not in the interests of customers.</P>
    <P>The profits and associated charges of Irish banks are the highest in Europe and are built on cuts in customer services and branch closures. The icing on the cake is a guaranteed 4.5% annual reduction in corporation tax until 2003. For some time the Minister for Finance has been gently wagging his finger at the banks reminding them of their social responsibilities in return for such Government largesse. However, the banks do not seem to be paying any attention to what he is saying. Banks are situated in ivory counting houses. The bottom line is the only measure that matters and to hell with the ordinary paper using consumer.</P>
    <P>Banks are attempting to off-load unprofitable, paper based elements of their business to An Post. They wish to create a direct debit bill paying system which will take the human clutter out of their branches. This is the same human clutter on which they made their profits for many years. Banks are abrogating their social responsibilities to customers and this is not good enough. I hope the Bill in some way rectifies that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and the banking situation which, to some extent, gave rise to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Labour Party's intention behind this Bill is admirable but it would not work in practice as it would only apply to three banks. Other banks would not come under the ambit of the Bill, including the Ulster Bank which is regulated from the UK. All other banking institutions are regulated by the state from which they <Col N="790" /> come. Therefore, this Bill could not achieve the Labour Party's objectives.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of the comments of Senators Costello and Ryan. However, I differ on how they could achieve their objectives through a Bill such as this. There is a conflict of interest in that banks exist to make money and the position of customers comes second. Many of the debates on this issue in the House last year highlighted the fact that the Central Bank played no more than a prudential role as regards banks. Senator Joe Doyle and I spoke about the fact that the Central Bank played no role in protecting customers.</P>
    <P>In the past few days the Minister for Finance and the Government announced the establishment of an financial services regulator. Only when this authority is in place, including the proposed customer protection officer, will there be any protection for customers. The new authority will have the prudential role previously played by the Central Bank and a new function whereby there will be a customer protection officer. This is an important step forward.</P>
    <P>Banks have made enormous profits over the years and I do not understand some of their decisions which seem to make life difficult for their customers. It is extraordinary that a customer of a commercial bank cannot cash a cheque in a branch of the same bank in a different town. This is a recent decision taken by Bank of Ireland but I am not sure if other banks have taken a similar decision. This is a great injustice, an inconvenience and is in no way customer friendly. The bank stands condemned for this practice.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Costello's frustration in his bid to support the public in its attempt to retain branches in Stoneybatter and Cabra. I was involved in a similar campaign in Strokestown, County Roscommon, when we tried to pursued National Irish Bank to keep its branch open. Newspapers have highlighted similar campaigns in many other towns and villages.</P>
    <P>There would be a downside to this Bill if enacted in that it would make the three Irish banks involved uncompetitive against other banks. The Bill attempts to restrict these three banks in the making of commercial decisions concerning the location of branches. No similar restriction would be placed on banks licensed and regulated from other EU member states, including the Ulster Bank. We could put an imposition on those banks to keep branches open in a particular area, but that could do them harm in the long term and make them uncompetitive. That is one disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spoke on this matter recently to the Irish Bankers' Federation and he suggested a code of practice which would address the issue being debated here tonight. Perhaps that is a way forward. We should call on the banks to be more customer friendly. They can adopt such an approach because of the massive profits they <Col N="791" /> make. While I understand and sympathise with the intention of Senator Costello and his colleagues, it is not a practical way to do business and it would not work. I agree with the statement by the Minister of State. My party will vote against this Bill on Second Stage because it cannot be implemented in a practical way.</P>

      <P>I welcome any opportunity to debate the future of Irish banking and its regulation. No one would disagree with the appalling abuses these banks have perpetrated and continue to perpetrate on the people and the taxpayers. I share all the sentiments expressed by Senators Costello, Finneran and Joe Doyle about the difficulties the banks have imposed on communities, people and taxpayers and the embarrassment these institutions have caused us as a nation. There is no doubt that the banks are trying to close a chapter of shame. The institutionalised theft of public money has taken place in recent years and the banks are saying that is now over, we will pay it off and we will open a new chapter. However, leopards do not change their spots. Banks encouraged people to break the law and people did so by not paying their tax. The remedies for that are what we are partly considering tonight.</P>
      <P>Banks also abused and continue to abuse customers in terms of credit cards. They have deceived customers about the returns they are getting. They play on people's ignorance by offering returns which, by sleight of hand, look more than they are. I think of managed funds and other returns they are currently offering which take much explaining to people as they are not what they seem. There are currently advertisements in the media suggesting that preferential tax free instruments are available to people if they accept certain offerings at a particular time, but that is not the case. I do not want to go into detail because it would not be fair. One institution is doing that at present. The suggestion is that they are paying less tax, but they are paying more. That is the way banks behave and always will behave.</P>
      <P>They also rob people on foreign exchange, yet the Government is doing nothing about it. They are robbing them at the airports and on euros. They made larger profits when we entered the euro than they were making before. They are ripping customers off on euros when we are meant to have a united currency. Yet no one is doing anything about it. It passes from one person to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks are not saints but institutionalised sinners. That is one of the problems we must confront. However, this Bill does not answer that <Col N="792" /> requirement. We should do something about credit cards. It is inexcusable that 18% or 19% is being paid when inflation is running low. That is profiteering of the worst type. We should do something about sleight of hand advertisements which prey on the vulnerable by offering interest rates which are unacceptable. However, having read this Bill, it is not in the interest of the State, the taxpayers or the shareholders.</P>
    <P>We must remember one thing about banks. They are not and have not been charitable organisations. They should be policed in order to be transparent and so that abuses are stamped out. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a bank whose existence is based on commerciality and say it must be a charity at the same time. We are trying to reform a monster and all we can do is contain it. The Government should contain its excesses. We cannot direct privately-owned institutions to act in a way which is not in the interests of the shareholders. I do not hold shares in any of the banks and I would love to see what Senator Costello is doing here. As I do not have a stake in it, I would love to see the banks behaving in a philanthropic way. However, we cannot have shareholders and have that at the same time because the shareholders are looking for profit. There is nothing wrong with profit. It is a good thing and a free market concept. However, the banks' profits cannot be diluted by saying they can make a profit as long as they do things which are anti-profit.</P>
    <P>This Bill is anti-profit. Senator Costello should set up a State bank. He should bring the ICC back into the State and tell it to operate in a way which is socially acceptable. Banks do not operate in such a way. They may give a few thousand pounds to political parties in what they say is the interests of democracy. However, it is in self-interest and in the interest of backing the right horse in the next Government race. That is the way these monsters behave. We cannot expect them to act like saints or in the interests of the community. We cannot tell them to open a branch in one place and close one somewhere else. We cannot tell them they can make a profit here and a loss there. That is the role of a semi-State company or an organisation with deliberate State controlled social objectives. That is laudable but we cannot do it with banks owned by shareholders and pension funds who look for one thing only, namely, profit.</P>
    <P>This type of middle road will not work in a free market. I applaud Senator Costello's objectives but the State has no business pushing the private sector in a certain direction. If the State wants to do that, it should set up its own apparatus. However, it will not have a vibrant private sector if it works on these principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time with me. However, as he has turned out to be a banker, the three seconds I have left <Col N="793" /> would not be sufficient. Perhaps I could speak after Senator Cox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted I am not speaking after Senator Norris. While I applaud the Labour Party for trying to address what it sees as some of the problems in the banking industry, it is not doing so in the most informed way. I accept its bona fides in trying to address this problem, but it is foolish to think that this Bill will solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Various speakers have mentioned problems that exist in the banking industry, including policies and procedures that neither the Government nor society at large are happy with. The rates of interest that are being charged on balances by credit card companies are some of the highest in the EU. The small print is not big enough to inform the public that if they only pay off a small amount they will be charged interest on the outstanding balance. Credit cards are pushed from one promoter to another and, thus, while cards are withdrawn because people have not exercised self-discipline in using them, within three to six months people can be offered, probably by the same institution, the opportunity of applying for another credit card. These problems exist and I do not underestimate the severity of them.</P>
      <P>Banks are now being asked to be more honest with their customers concerning personal loans. It is not fair to offer money all the time to young people who think they will be able to repay a mortgage, and personal loans for a car and furniture. Lending institutions must take a more responsible approach towards granting personal loans, which should not be pushed on people. It is inappropriate to send out mailshots to young people, aged 19 to 21, in their first jobs, offering them personal loans of up to £10,000 once they sign a request. That is not the way to do business. Banks have a responsibility to examine how they conduct their business, but we will not solve these types of problems by the Bill that is the subject of this motion.</P>
      <P>While I object to the erosion of the banking network in rural areas due to branch closures, which is happening under the umbrella of commerciality and the need to make profits, this Bill is not the way to tackle the issue. As the Minister pointed out, introducing this amendment to the Central Bank Bill would place a noose around the necks of banks that are licensed by the Central Bank but it would not affect other banks that are operating here, such as the Ulster Bank or British-based banks. In recent days, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has urged the banks to examine what they are doing. There is no point in providing a service only in areas where people have easy access to branches. We should put pressure on banks to remember that they have customers outside urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the encashment policy that has been introduced by various banks whereby one <Col N="794" /> must lodge a cheque to one's account and cannot cash it. In Dublin just before Christmas a bank refused to cash a cheque for me. I was told that I had to lodge it to my account in Galway and could not have any cash until the following day. I have a fundamental objection to that because it is my money which I am lodging in the bank. The banks should seriously examine this issue and I am surprised there has not been stronger opposition to it.</P>
    <P>How many people think about the difference laser cards make to everyone? It is safer to have such a card in one's wallet because it obviates the need to carry cash. The days of carrying cash are going and technology is bringing about significant changes, including Internet banking. More and more personal and business customers are conducting their banking business over the Internet or telephone, thus avoiding queues in branches. Many of the major banks have fairly technology-friendly Internet and phone banking systems, which is a welcome change. If we were to proceed with the legislation that is proposed, however, it would be unfair to Irish banks, forcing them to operate in a market that is free and open for other banking institutions.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ross said, businesses need to change with the market in order to compete and the Government cannot impinge on that situation by placing restrictions on Irish banks. In recognising that there are problems in the financial services sector, the Government has proposed a new statutory financial services regulatory authority, under the control of a regulator. This demonstrates that the Government has consumer issues at heart. The establishment of a statutory post of financial services regulator will address the concerns that have been so well enunciated by the Labour Party in this debate. We cannot toy around with the fundamental elements of commerciality, however, whether for banks or any other business sector. There is no point in being in business if one cannot make a profit. Profit is not a dirty word. Banks may have branches in every town and village, but if they are not making money they will close anyway.</P>
    <P>While the intention of the motion before the House is well founded, this is not the way to go about it. Unfortunately, although I agree with the sentiment behind the Bill, I cannot support it. We cannot hold Irish banks to ransom and allow other banks, which are not licensed by the Central Bank, free reign throughout the country. I compliment the Minister and the Department of Finance on the initiatives they have taken in trying to ensure that consumers are better protected than they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope the new regulatory framework will take into account the issues I have raised in this debate, including loans, credit cards and a better service for customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="ÜfcMr. Norris ÜfcMr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Bill and if, for technical reasons, it is not possible for it to pass Second Stage, I will look to the Government to introduce legislation that will address the problem. Perhaps Senator Ross has come up with the correct solution which is to create a State bank. Why not have a State bank? I recognise that it may be difficult in commercial situations to force something upon a publicly quoted company because shareholders' rights are involved. There may be a legal and constitutional angle but I am worried by this kind of development. It happened in Ballymun and Stoneybatter, and it militates against the interests of ordinary people. It is all part of a clearly recognisable process that is happening throughout the country. We have seen the closure of rural post offices and Garda stations, while in city areas gardaí on the beat have been removed. As elected representatives, we should be addressing these socially negative factors if institutions such as the banks will not do so. Internet banking is of no use to people who are not computer literate. It attacks the most vulnerable sections of the community, the poor and elderly who do not have access to computers and computer skills. For that reason it is a very negative way to go.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross mentioned credit card interest rates in excess of 18%. I understand that some institutions charge much more than that, perhaps 23% or 24%, but people simply do not realise it. When has any of us seen a bank statement recently? We are not entitled to our own property any more. We used to get our cashed cheques back. I recently ordered Christmas cards from Amnesty International and asked if I could pay for them by credit card as I was going abroad. For some reason, however, it is not possible to do so because Amnesty International does not have the facility. When I returned I was surprised to receive a bill for £200 which I thought was a mistake. It turned out that I owed Amnesty International £200 but I could not get a proper statement from the credit card company. I asked them for one and they sent me a statement saying that I had spent X number of pounds in a month, but they did not provide me with the expenditure breakdown I wanted. I wrote them a clear letter seeking the breakdown. They sent me four more statements which only contained a total and not a breakdown. Somebody put a handwritten note on one saying I had not paid Amnesty International the £200 about which I was worried. That was what I wanted to know. Am I not entitled, as a customer, to that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was provoked to contribute to the debate by Senator Costello's contribution and his reference to the Bank of Ireland newsletter. It portrays an awful, grim atmosphere as if the author thought it was, in some curious way, funny. It begins in the Killiney Court Hotel. I very much doubt many of the elderly and disadvantaged customers of the Stoneybatter branch spend a great deal of time at little sponsored bashes in the corporate hotel. There was a discussion about the 3C pro<Col N="796" /> gramme at the hotel and the tone of the article is extraordinary. It states:</P>
    <P>Last day! Atmosphere very surreal. We presented a memento to the last customer to be served at the branch at 4.10 p.m... In summary, it has been a very difficult 14 weeks but we came through it very well. I am honoured to have worked with the staff in Stoneybatter, every one of whom was colossal from start to finish.</P>
    <P>I have news for the bank. That feeling is not reciprocated. A neighbour of mine haunts skips and three or four days ago, in a skip outside the Bank of Ireland head office on Baggot Street, he came across a bound copy of confidential reports about attitudes in banks, including the attitudes of the staff. It contained many idiotic corporate clichés such as &ldquo;Would you go the extra mile for the bank?&rdquo;  Of course, 98% of the staff, because their eyes were glued to the promotion process, said they would, but when they were asked whether they thought the bank, and this branch in particular, served well the community in which it found itself, 10% said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. That is interesting. This is the perception of people working within the bank about the operation of the bank and how it serves the community. It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Banks have a responsibility to people in Ballymun and Stoneybatter to look after their needs and to ensure elderly people are not placed at risk by having to transport cash over long distances. Senator Costello and the Labour Party have done the House a service by introducing this Bill, even if it may not be possible for technical reasons to pass it.</P>

      <P>Many issues have come to light in the banking system in recent years. At one stage the Tánaiste was before the House on an almost daily basis discussing problems in the banking sector. Recently the Bank of Ireland announced profits of £940 million and maintained that only 50% were earned in Ireland. I recall criticism of the banking sector three years ago when Bank of Ireland was earning profits in the region of £500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am annoyed by the anti-consumer attitude of banks. I met Senator Ross at Dublin Airport last Monday week. At the time I was a little distressed having been told there was no room for me on my flight to Brussels. I eventually negotiated my way onto another flight and received a cheque for £60 from Aer Rianta. I went to the Bank of Ireland branch at the airport to cash the cheque, <Col N="797" /> which was not a problem. However, I had another cheque from Eircom in my pocket which the official refused to cash when I presented it, even though I produced my passport and flight tickets. I was fortunate to have sufficient funds to cover my trip. Money laundering is the basis for the banks doing this.</P>
    <P>However, there is no intelligence and cop-on in the banking system anymore. That is reflected by the staff. When I set up my accountancy practice 25 years ago I was inundated by bank managers seeking business, trying to take business from other banks and opening branches all over the country, yet today they will hardly talk to me if they meet me on the street because they used me for that purpose. All the good managers have gone through early retirement. One wonders how the current managers got into the bank in the first place. That is a general sweeping statement, but that is the reality in many branches.</P>
    <P>We have discussed economic and monetary union on a number of occasions over the past few years. We thought it would be advantageous to the consumer as foreign currency charges would be removed. I paid a fee to buy foreign currency on my way to Brussels and I paid a bigger fee when I changed what I had left on my return.</P>
    <P>Other issues in the banking system included the DIRT regime and the NIB problem, particularly in the Carrick-on-Shannon branch where the consumer had no protection whatsoever. They received a refund belatedly. When one reflects on that issue, one can only think the Central Bank's function is to advise the Government on the direction of the economy and interest rates. There is no control over the banking system.</P>
    <P>There should be more comprehensive regulation of banks. Senator Norris referred to credit card companies. He is correct that such companies charge interest rates up to 24% and consumers receive the odd letter in the post advising them that if they switch companies the interest rate will reduce to 19%, yet credit card companies only pay 2% or 3% in deposit interest to banks.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed in general by the banking system. I am not a socialist but I am bothered by the large profits earned by banks, given the manner in which they treat the consumer. When small business people exceed their overdraft limit they pay a debit charge of £3.50 on their bank account. Some people I know have paid up to £1,500 per annum in extra bank charges whereas if they were given an increased overdraft, they would not have a problem.</P>
    <P>If one falls a month behind on a nominal payment on a credit card account, one is called by a junior employee who has been recruited by the credit card company to make such telephone calls. The computer does not recognise that a person has overlooked payments for one or two months and they receive telephone calls or letters from solicitors. Some people cannot repay a balance of £4,000 or £5,000 on their credit card but if they make the minimum payment every month nobody comes near them. The banking system <Col N="798" /> does not have the ability to see the wood from the trees.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste made an announcement regarding a new financial regulator. Seán Fitzpatrick, the chairman of the Irish Bankers' Federation, came out totally against the regulator, saying he or she will be anti-consumer. He has requested that the current regime remain in place whereby bankers continue as members on the voluntary body which investigates financial matters and if a consumer wins an appeal, £30,000 is the largest sum he or she can receive whereas the scheme to be introduced under the new proposal provides for an open-ended award to the consumer. He described the proposal as anti-consumer, but the reality is that he wants the cosy cartel to continue in every way.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the banks. When I came here for the first time three and a half years ago the banks were making half their current profits. Yet we thought when we joined EMU there would be no more charges, and hopefully this will be the case from next year, though I am sure the banks will find some other way of charging. Now more than ever we need some regulation. I cannot support the Bill, much as I would like to.</P>
    <P>Hopefully something better and more stringent will be put in place to protect consumers such as the ordinary housewife who may not have a bank account and whose husband may have bought Eircom shares for her. Because she has no bank account she will not be able to cash a cheque. Banks have got away with far too much for far too long. I was sucked in over 20 years ago and if I knew then what I know now I would have had nothing to do with them. As I said, I cannot support the Bill but I hope that in future there will be far better regulations to deal with banks.</P>

      <P>Some parts of the debate to which I listened were excellent. In general there is a feeling that ordinary people do not count in terms of banks. Years ago banks were part of social life, just like the post office and other community businesses. Recently banks have been putting people out the door rather than encouraging them in. The fact that cheques must be drawn on the bank where it is presented is one of the problems faced by many people. PMG cheques are accepted, but if one is always paid by AIB, the difficulty in going to Bank of Ireland, where one might have always banked, is that money has to be lodged to one's account and cleared which imposes a restriction on ordinary people. I like to go to my bank, meet those working there and have a chat, and when I raised this matter I was asked if I ever suffered from &ldquo;chequeitis&rdquo;, a reference to a person in a queue trying to cash a cheque who gets madder and madder when they cannot get to the teller's window.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry of the Bank of Scotland to the Irish banking system has introduced a new dimension to the way banks must do business. The Bank of Scotland is undercutting the rates of ordinary <Col N="799" /> banks which have standard facilities for ordinary people, including a branch system, and is providing serious competition. In terms of costs and profits banks must have an eye on shareholders and annual profits, which is why they have become less people friendly. On the other hand, it is possible to telephone reduced rate numbers &ndash; 1850-365365 in the case of Bank of Ireland &ndash; to get an update on one's account and how things stand. There is an excellent system whereby one can go through all the banking transactions carried out over any period, which is constructive and good. This is how things are going in the world and we must be part of it. There are good developments, therefore, in terms of technology, but banks are losing their identity. In future we will not know our bank managers &ndash; it will be a person with no human contact but who has all the technology at their fingertips and will not be in a position to make judgments about people.</P>
    <P>The good point was made that local bank managers could and would give support to people who did not have the wherewithal to carry out a good business plan or who were worth a chance. In future will the banking system have the specialised knowledge of the local banking system?</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I welcome it. Part of the reason I wish to contribute is the issue of interest charges on credit cards. The level of interest charged by some of these companies is disgraceful. I think it was the chairman of Allied Irish Bank who last week commented on the radio that in his view people use credit cards as cash cards for one month and more or less pay their balance immediately. Most of the evidence I read points in the opposite direction, with millions of pounds accumulated in credit card debt. Shopkeepers say that over Christmas credit cards are flashed everywhere and people in January are fearful of the post. Sometimes statements arrive on 6 or 7 January, a critical time when people do not have money.</P>
    <P>There is a need for consumers to be protected, certainly in terms of the interest charged by banks. The risk banks take with clients is very low. The rate at which banks get money is 3% or 4% while they make four or five times that through exceptionally high interest rates.</P>
    <P>One thing which might encourage people not to use their credit cards so much would be a legal requirement for credit card statements to have a running total of interest paid in the previous 12 months. Then people would realise how much money was being lifted out of their pockets by credit card companies.</P>
    <P>I know credit unions are separate, but they perform the function of the people's bank. They are very useful local institutions. As commercial banks move from smaller towns and villages, credit unions and, hopefully, An Post will move in. Most villages have post offices and An Post is developing an alternative to the banking system. If they are freed to do so, as I believe is hap<Col N="800" /> pening, An Post can fill the gap by improving their facilities and the services they offer to ordinary consumers. We are talking about the ordinary Joe Soap who is not a businessman, does not have an awful amount of money but who wants a locally based banking system. An Post can usefully and successfully improve services and thereby prosper.</P>
    <P>This has been an excellent debate and I welcome the speech by the Minister. I also welcome the improvements being made in terms of consumer protection in the banking system. The bottom line is that we are not getting a good deal from the banks, particularly in terms of facilities in smaller towns or the unacceptably high level of interest being charged. It is time for the Oireachtas and those who use the system to put a stop to their gallop and to place more restrictions on them, including the interest levels they can charge on credit cards. People would think twice if a clear figure was given on each bill showing the interest paid in the previous 12 months. The so-called flexible friend is not at all flexible; it is putting many people into significant debt and we must seriously tackle this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and Senators Doyle, Cox, Ross, Norris, Bonner, O'Dowd and Finneran for contributing. I was gratified to hear that all without exception supported the general thrust of what I am proposing. They want better customer services and were critical of the manner in which the banks are currently providing services. Some speakers had reservations as to whether the Bill would satisfy that objective. Indeed, Senator Bonner wanted the Bill to go much further in terms of its provisions and like the others he was very trenchant in his criticism of the manner in which banks conduct their business with customers.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators of what we are seeking to do. This is quite a modest proposal. It is not a heavy handed control or regulatory mechanism. We already have a prudential role under the Central Bank in licensing the banks and in terms of regulating how they carry out their business in a prudent financial, bonded fashion. I want to marry a social dimension to that. We are only dealing with money because we are dealing with customers, with people. Unless we do that we are not doing our duty as legislators but how we do it is the question. If the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has better ideas than I do I would love to hear them. They certainly have not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. What is being proposed is very much akin to what I am seeking to do in this legislation. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, indicates that: &ldquo;The Department of Finance has suggested to the Irish Bankers' Federation that it, as the umbrella organisation for the banking sector, should evaluate industry practice and consider publishing a code of practice on branch restructuring.&rdquo;  There is no sign of <Col N="801" /> that and by the sound of what the president of the Irish Bankers Federation is saying in relation to regulatory matters it is not likely to come. The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly of the view that such restructuring has to be done in a sensible and intelligent way. Any decisions should be made in partnership with their customers.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what I am looking for in this legislation. There should be a code of practice. I want criteria to be established. The relevant regulatory body to do that is the new IFSRA or the Central Bank which will have umbrella responsibility in relation to this. Surely we can incorporate my proposals in the IFSRA when it becomes a statutory body.</P>
    <P>One or two people said it might be difficult to take on board what I am saying here. Senators Ross and Cox talked about the possibility that it might interfere with competition. The best way to deal with competition is to ensure that you have a loyal and reliable clientele. If you have a satisfied customer base then you can take on any competition. It is the customers who provide the funding. I am not satisfied that that is the reason the banks are closing. I think it is largely fear and bad planning. There is a fear that the Bank of Scotland coming in with more competitive interest rates is going to eat into the market in a big way. The response is to close down branches to get rid of overheads. They get rid of face to face service with customers, retrench and consolidate. It is a short-sighted conclusion to draw and one that results in a loss of customer confidence, loyalty and service.</P>
    <P>I see from an internal document, the diary of <Col N="802" /> the manager of the Stoneybatter branch, that the bank was not loss making:</P>
    <P>We ended September on a real high when the half-year figures showed Stoneybatter as the number one branch in Dublin for performance against targets in insurance and investment activity. Our targets were fully achieved.</P>
    <P>That is not the type of argument to put forward for closing down a branch. Number one in Dublin? There has been bad planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One must remember that not so many years ago the banks were competing to open branches. Now they are competing to close them. It is bad planning and has nothing to do with competition. The Stoneybatter bank had an AIB branch beside it so there are no competition fears there.</P>
      <P>Everyone in this House has expressed dissatisfaction with the manner in which our national banks conduct their business. Abuses have taken place, there has been a lack of service and high charges have been imposed. Everyone here is looking for action by the Government but I see no sign that action is forthcoming. I cannot see why the Government is not prepared to accept this Bill and give it a Second Reading. If there are proposals for amending and improving it let us take them on Committee Stage, but first let us see an indication that this Government intends to reform the banking system. For that reason I am commending this Bill to the House and I will be putting it to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister of State's problems in the biological and bacteriological areas at the moment I thank him for dealing with this issue, which is in the same area.</P>
      <P>According to a report by Lara Marlowe in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 24 February this year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Paris that Iraq must comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1284, which demands the destruction of all chemical and biological weapons before sanctions against that country can be lifted. The State of Iraq has certainly used chemical weapons against its own citizens and possibly biological weapons too. However, Iraq is not the only country which holds chemical weapons or to engage in research in this area. Many other countries do so as well. Ours may be the only State on the Security Council which does not have such weapons or which has not had them in the recent past. It is extraordinarily important we take this fact on board. As well as states having bacteriological weapons, unfortunately terrorist groups such as the Aum Shinri Kyo have such weapons as well.</P>
      <P>Biological weapons have been used sporadically throughout time. In the last century the use of anthrax to kill either humans or animals was known. In contrast to the fabrication of nuclear weapons the production of biological weapons requires only a small quantity of equipment but 100 kg of anthrax spores dropped over a city from an unmanned plane could kill one million to three million people in a night. Massive casualties can be caused by small amounts of a bacteriological agent. With the advent of genetic engineering, bacteria which are now controllable by modern medical methods can be changed by gene splicing so that they are resistant to the antibiotic or other agent with which they were once eradicated.</P>
      <P>We know Iraq has anthrax, which was, astonishingly, given to them by George Bush senior when he was President of America, though relations between Iraq and America were different then. They also have botulism toxin which causes paralysis, clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene and perhaps other modified bacteria. We know approximately 20 other countries have much the same, so concentrating on Iraq will not solve the world situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only humans and animals may be targeted. During the Vietnam war the American military used herbicides for defoliation and crop destruction. Defoliation was the process of using herbi<Col N="803" /><Col N="804" /> cides to mimic certain hormones which cause leaf fall. Crop destruction was the process of using herbicides to destroy food sources. The primary effect of this programme was to deny local food supply to enemy manpower and to oblige them to use their time transporting food. However, it also denied the civilian population their food and frequently meant they had to move to the cities where they were more easily controlled. Agent Orange, as it was called, caused huge damage to the environment of Vietnam. Half the tropical forests were destroyed and the water there seriously polluted. The military gain was questionable, especially in view of the fact that many American soldiers were affected by Agent Orange from aerial spraying and by occupying the contaminated area. Eventually the US Government admitted that service personnel who had been exposed to Agent Orange had a higher rate of soft tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, Hodgkins disease and skin conditions such as chloroacne and porphyria cutanea tarda. Multiple myelona, cancers of the lung, larynx and trachea were also more common. Soviet planes dropped a mycotoxin in south-east Asia and Afghanistan in 1979. Mycotoxins are produced by fungi and have an effect on higher organisms. They are very stable and can be stored for years at room temperature.</P>
    <P>The then Director of the CIA, George J. Tenet, testified before the US Senate Committee on Intelligence on 2 February 2000 and said that the proliferaters of biological weapons are showing &ldquo;greater proficiency in the use of denial and deception.&rdquo;  He said that approximately a dozen countries had biological weapons and some terrorist organisations also had them. Some countries see them as a means of overcoming the overwhelming conventional military superiority of states such as the United States. Biological weapons programmes are becoming more sophisticated and slow and fast acting agents are being mixed.</P>
    <P>Biological weapons have been controlled for many years by the signatories to the Biological Weapons Convention, 1975. They are required to submit to the UN information on facilities where biological defence research is being conducted, scientific conferences that are held at specific facilities, exchanges of scientists and information and disease outbreaks. Some countries plead their bacteria and toxins are for defensive reasons, but the interpretation of &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; is a problem.</P>
    <P>The Security Council reserves the right to veto any request for an investigation should allegations of infraction be lodged with the United Nations. To stop the proliferation and use of biological weapons we should now use our increased profile on the Security Council to have a verification protocol added to the convention. Without verification, the whole process is useless. Given that we have such a problem with foot and mouth <Col N="805" /> disease, imagine if this was introduced as a biological weapon.</P>
    <P>Our seat on the Security Council of the UN gives us additional authority and responsibility. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, 1975, has been signed by 140 countries. It is reviewed on a five yearly basis and is up for such re-examination this autumn. It is essential that a verification protocol is added to the convention at this review.</P>
    <P>The convention prohibits the development, production, stockpiling or acquisition of biological weapons but has no effective means of verification. Offensive biological weapons programmes are, therefore, left unregulated by international arms control agreements at precisely the time when there is a revolution in modern biotechnology.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Professor Vivienne Nathanson of the British Medical Association Science Division, has been one of those insisting that doctors make known our ethical objections to such weapons of mass destruction. Superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering can be caused to huge members of civilians by these weapons, with little military advantage. Weapons could even be developed which target particular racial or ethnic groups, for example, those with black skin. These weapons must go and we must do our utmost to prevent the escalation in biological weapons.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern): I apologise that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, cannot be here as he is in America. I thank the Senator for raising this very timely issue.</P>
    <P>The motion which we are debating this evening provides a timely opportunity, which I welcome, to set out the policy and approach of the Government in regard of the most important matter of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the current actions which are in train to secure a verification protocol to this convention. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological and toxin weapons and provides for their destruction. The convention, therefore, is designed to ensure a total ban on these weapons. The convention was negotiated in Geneva by the United Nations Conference on Disarmament and was concluded in 1972. When the requisite number of states had signed and ratified the convention, it entered into force in 1975.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, at the time of negotiation of the convention, no verification measures were included in the text. It, therefore, did not have any means of enforcing its provisions. Ireland signed and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention shortly after it was concluded in 1972. It is axiomatic in the disarmament field that an arms or weapons control measure is only as <Col N="806" /> strong as its verification and compliance criteria. This is a view which has always been held by the Irish Government. To remedy this deficit with regard to compliance and verification, a special conference of states parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convection &ndash; BTWC &ndash; decided in September 1994 to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group to address the issue of a verification protocol. The objective of this regime was to mirror in its provisions and, to the extent relevant, the appropriate verification provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which entered into force in 1996. Ireland immediately joined in this work and continues to maintain a high level of engagement and input through its membership of the <i>ad hoc </i>group.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly describe the progress of the work of this group since its inception in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention took place in 1996 and it examined the results achieved at that time by the<i> ad hoc</i> group. It welcomed the determination of the <i>ad hoc </i>group to intensify its work with a view to bringing it to completion as early as possible, ideally before the fifth review conference.</P>
    <P>The fifth review conference is scheduled to take place in December of this year. The projected intensification of work did indeed take place and by the end of the year 2000 the<i> ad hoc </i>group had met for more than 50 weeks of intense negotiations. The <i>ad hoc</i> group has again started work this year. It is expected to maintain a good pace of work with a view to meeting the deadline for concluding a protocol by the end of this year. While it is the hope of Ireland and indeed of our European Union partners that the end of 2001 will see the completion of the work on the verification protocol, the subject matter, as has become clear in the course of negotiations, is both large and highly complex and the outstanding challenges must not be underestimated. Accordingly, I cannot underestimate the challenges to the completion of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Seanad will agree on the importance of concluding a strong and effective verification protocol to provide the necessary guarantees that biological weapons are not being produced. Nonetheless, together with her EU partners, Ireland believes that the review conference next December represents an important deadline for the conclusion of a substantive protocol, which will make a real contribution to strengthening the convention. The European Union has made representations to this effect to the chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, Ambassador Toth, encouraging him to work within this framework and timeframe.</P>
    <P>It is evident that, like any other major multilateral instrument, the protocol is being negotiated in a complex international environment in which many diverse external factors impinge upon the negotiations. The lack of clear negotiating posi<Col N="807" /> tions by some delegations involved in the negotiations might have a bearing on the firmness of their commitment to the 2001 deadline. Should that be the case, hard choices will have to be made by the chairman of the<i> ad hoc </i>group as to whether to let the deadline slip or to proceed with the conclusion of this important instrument by the end of 2001. The Government will continue to work with like-minded countries, particularly our EU partners, to force the pace of negotiations so that the protocol will be ready in time for the review conference.</P>
    <P>The six years, which have been spent negotiating this important instrument have borne fruit to the extent that there is now substantial agreement on a number of major elements of this protocol. Pending the conclusion of this instrument, I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform the House that Ireland has for some time been working to implement in a practical way the terms of the convention. By this I mean in particular that we are working actively to prevent any unwitting contribution by Irish companies to the supply of products, equipment, components or sub-components, which could contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons capacity. As a further measure we co-operate in this work with like-minded countries and in particular in the multilateral forum provided by the Australia group. This is an informal grouping of states, <Col N="808" /> which have chosen to voluntarily share standards and information in the field of biological and chemical weapons with the aim of controlling flows of chemicals and other agents, which could be used to create such weapons.</P>
    <P>The addition of a verification mechanism to the biological weapons convention will provide greater confidence in the implementation of the provisions of the convention. This is all the more important as biological research and development and the biological sciences in general have become more widespread in the period since the convention was concluded in 1972.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the attention that the Government is giving and will continue to give to this issue. It is the intention of the Government to keep the House informed of major developments. It would be my hope that, following the agreement of the protocol by the end of this year, we would be in a position to lay the text of the agreed protocol before the House at an early date in 2002.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. The biological disaster of foot and mouth disease which is around us at present makes us realise even more how potent biological weapons are and how important it is for us to use our place on the Security Council to fight against this serious threat.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 March 2001.</P>
