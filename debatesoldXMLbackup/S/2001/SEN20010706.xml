      <P>I have received notice from Senator Enda Bonner that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the circumstances in which all employees of Herdmans (Ireland) Limited were issued with redundancy notices this week and to ensure that the IDA carry out a review of employment policy for the Finn Valley area in Donegal.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it shall be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re official documents and private papers of Members, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 10 minutes; No. 4, statements on water quality, with contributions not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 3, statements regarding the inquiry into the Arms Trial, with contributions not to exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to. I accept the reasoning behind No. 1 being taken without debate. So many of these motions appear on a regular basis and the Leader circulates to me the reasons as to how they are dealt with. Perhaps we might find some way of reading these reasons into the record of the House in order that others are aware of the reasons particular motions are passed. I have no difficulty with these reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach to raise an issue we will be dealing with next week. <Col N="1174" /> I want to make a case to the Leader about the banning of opinion polls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant to allow the matter to be raised this morning because the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, will be the first item on the Order Paper for Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask your indulgence because the mechanisms that will be in place next week will be inadequate. I raise the matter because when the Bill passed through this House the banning of opinion polls was not part of it. That amendment was introduced at a late stage in the Dáil, which is none of our business, but the substantive issue of the banning of opinion polls was not debated there. Next week we will only be able to speak once on the entire Bill on the amendments and only one vote can be taken, though not on that particular issue which is an important one. I do not share the hysteria in the press. Talk about Hitlerism and Nazism is abusive language and totally out of proportion. Senator Hayes is far closer to the point when he talks of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It would be wrong for these Houses to introduce a substantial change to legislation without there being a proper debate, even a short one on Second Stage. I ask the Leader to set aside half an hour for statements on this matter on Tuesday, before we take the Bill. That would allow us to hear the reasons the Minister thinks it is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I have serious reservations about the amendment into which we are rushing although there is serious advice that it may be unconstitutional. This House would be doing the entire Oireachtas a service if we had a debate of that sort early next week to which we would all like to contribute. I thank the Cathaoileach for his indulgence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Senator to make the points he wished to make. I hope any further discussion on this matter will be among the Leader and the leaders of the other groups after the Order of Business. It does not concern today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the leaders of this group, I would be delighted to comply with your request in a limited way.</P>
      <P>I hate to introduce any element of disharmony as we come to the summer recess but I do not accept &ndash; though I will not oppose the Order of Business &ndash; that No. 1 should be taken without debate. I do not accept the fact that we get a note to explain the reasons this should be so. It is a bad principle. It is not satisfactory to accept from an explanatory note that this is somehow read into the record and that, therefore, an explanation is given to us with which we cannot argue. We are being asked to put through controversial matters which deserve discussion. I will not go into detail on the matter before us today, but it is important and I do not understand the reason we are being asked to put it through without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> The second item I would like to address is the way in which we conduct our business and what we will do with regard to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, on Tuesday. This is a diabolical amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have an opportunity to address that matter on Tuesday. During that debate I will be prepared to extend a considerable amount of latitude to the Senator to allow him make those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make further judgment on the Bill in this intervention. The material principle is that a matter of such controversy, which this is, should be debated fully. The fact that this is being rushed through both Houses indicates that the political parties are incredibly out of touch with the people. We saw this with the Nice treaty which was passed, virtually unanimously, by this House&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Should Senator Ross declare his interest in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no interest in the matter whatsoever but if the Senator thinks I have&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, this has nothing to do with today's business. I have made a suggestion as to how the leaders of the groups might further discuss or reflect on this matter in advance of Tuesday's sitting. I will not allow further discussion on the merits of the amendment on today's Order of Business. It is not relevant to the Order the Business and it is not in order to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with you, a Chathaoirligh. However, I do not wish to indulge in any type of conspiracy with the other leaders of the groups to get this through in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would be a bad conspirator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to obstruct&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such suggestion or implication in what I or Senator Manning said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not. I wish to obstruct this Bill. There is a matter of high principle involved here, that matters of this nature should be given a full discussion in both Houses. If this was not fully discussed in the Dáil, I hope it will be in the Seanad and I hope that the few of us who are opposed to this measure will be given a significant amount of time to do so. Debate on an issue such as this should not be restricted and Members opposed to the measure should not be restricted to 15 minutes or so. The matter is too important.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no time limits on Committee Stage of a Bill. I assure the Senator that as long as I am in the Chair and as long as the Senator is relevant, he will be given all the time he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but it is a Report Stage amendment. Can the Leader confirm that there will be no time restriction on debate on that Bill next week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would like a commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue that arises almost daily. There are motions before the House which we are expected to take without debate. We were circulated with a brief explanatory memorandum on No. 1 this morning but memoranda of this nature should be circulated to all Members and should be included in the agenda we receive in the morning. There should be time for Members to examine the motions and consider whether they agree with them and whether it is appropriate to take them without debate. It would also be useful, as Senator Manning suggested, if such an explanatory memorandum were read into the record where a debate does not take place. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider this issue.</P>
      <P>Why is No. 5, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, not before the House this morning? It was the first item on the agenda for Friday morning which was circulated to Members. That was my understanding as of this morning when I received my Order Paper. I still thought it would be the first item of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it is not before the House today is that printing difficulties arose because of the time the Bill came from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beneficial that it is not before us this morning for all the reasons mentioned by Senator Manning and Senator Ross. It is an extremely controversial matter. There has been advice from the Attorney General that it is unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is not before the House because it had to be reprinted as amended by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been rushed through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is relevant because it relates to No. 5 on the Order Paper. I want to know how an item which will be before the House next week will be dealt with. It has been suggested by at least two professionals, <Col N="1177" /> the previous Attorney General and a senior barrister and constitutional expert, that the Bill is unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The points being made by the Senator are not relevant to today's Order of Business. They can be made when this matter is before the House on Tuesday. Again, every latitude will be extended to the Senator. Perhaps the Senator will take up the suggestion I made that this be discussed between the Leader and the leaders of the other groups after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the concern about this issue, does the Leader not think it would be appropriate that he find time either later today or at an earlier time on Tuesday to allow the matter to be discussed, perhaps in another forum, before it is discussed on Report Stage? It is a much larger issue than an amendment that has come out of the blue. I am opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that by the time we come to this matter again, it will be guillotined like it was in the other House where it was not even brought to a vote. Are we going to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained on numerous occasions, how the other House does its business is not a matter for this House. The other House does its business independently of this House and we do our business independently of that House. We will do our business on Tuesday independently of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House take into consideration all that has been said? There is grave concern on these benches about not only the substance of this item but also the manner in which it has been dealt with so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader seek clarification of the unhelpful comments by David Trimble and his allegation that the republican movement was responsible for the recent death of a young man in Northern Ireland? The murder was attributed to and claimed by a loyalist movement and the RUC Chief Constable and a Northern Ireland Minister have condemned his remarks. It is appropriate that the Leader should seek clarification of such a serious allegation, which appears to be unfounded. It is a sensitive matter. I fully support decommissioning but this remark by David Trimble was unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the House did not have an opportunity to debate either education or disability over recent months, despite <Col N="1178" /> numerous calls for such debates from both sides of the House. I hope there will be an early opportunity when the House resumes to have these debates. I have no wish to comment on amendments to Bills which might come before the House but the increasingly frequent practice of dealing with a logjam of legislation at the end of the session should not continue. The Leader should use his good offices to ensure this does not happen again. It is not his wish that it should and I am aware it happens in the other House, but it does not make for good legislation. As we have seen, we reap the rewards from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to take up with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the intimidation occurring in recent months in the College Green, Grafton Street and Wicklow Street area of Dublin. This intimidation comes from groups of collectors for charities which I do not wish to name. They are excellent charities but their collectors are intimidating to people on the streets, particularly women. The collectors look like nightclub bouncers. It is not good enough that people cannot walk our main shopping streets without suffering intimidation by groups of young men. The collectors are probably working on commission for the charities concerned. The causes of these charities are good but the method of collection is atrocious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the impending crisis in high-tech industry, both here and globally, will the Leader consider a debate in the House during the summer recess if the crisis deepens? There appears to be an impending meltdown in the high-tech sector. Nortel is facing losses in the region of £15 billion, the second highest corporate loss in history. The top ten high-tech companies in Ireland provide 25,000 jobs. Those working in this sector are highly paid with high commitments and we are beginning to see repossessions affecting this group. All indicators point to a deepening of this crisis and, if that is the situation, I ask for a debate before we come back in October. This is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to remind those responsible of the public outrage at the way the Houses of the Oireachtas are conducting their business. We are open to criticism, and deserve it, for the rush of legislation through the Houses. The last few days of work every year in the Houses see legislation rushed through which does not get the attention it deserves. I am thinking particularly of the 2,000 sites recently identified as being potentially contaminated by hazardous waste. There is a Seanad Bill going through the Dáil today &ndash; the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. If amendments are taken, will they come before this House next week? Will we have a chance to debate these measures in the light of the information on these hazardous sites that has come through today? In the past, the Houses have suffered immense harm <Col N="1179" /> by the rushing of legislation. We are doing the same this year. I do not understand the reason so many Bills are put through without debate in the final weeks of the session. I assume it is in our hands whether we do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader confirm whether the Local Government Bill will come before the House next week? Will he convey the concern of local authority members that, once the Bill is passed next week, as I assume it will be, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will enter into early and meaningful dialogue with the three representative associations, the IAMI, LAMA and the general council? This dialogue should centre on the implementation of the Bill which applies to those councillors who are seeking, and I hope will now get under the Bill&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is anticipating legislation coming before the House next week. These are points that can be made in the debate on that legislation. Every latitude will be given to the Senator in that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that. It is correct. However, as the debate will be held in the last two days of the session, there will be no time for Members to effect changes that may be needed as a result of the Bill coming out of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ormonde is in Carlow already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Members, I attended a function last night relating to the publication of the debates of the Houses. I express the thanks of Members to all those responsible for the innovative decision to ensure this information is more readily available. Our thanks particularly go to the Editor Of Debates, Mr. Liam Fitzgibbon, and his staff. It behoves all Members to support this initiative.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go down the same road as Senator Ross in relation to polls, except to make a brief comment. Years ago, in racing parlance, a jockey was asked the reason he had not come earlier. He replied that he could not come as the horse would not move. Deputy Lenihan blamed the polls in relation to the Tipperary South by-election result but, as decent a man as Mr. Maguire is, Fianna Fáil had not got the best horse in the race. It was Fine Gael who had the best runner in former Senator Tom Hayes. The result cannot be changed nor the winning post moved if the horse does not quite get up. I support the call for a debate on this matter next week. There will then be an opportunity to discuss all its aspects. We all like good polls and dislike bad ones. If the results had been different, would this matter have got so much attention? This area needs to be debated more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> I also ask for a debate on the workings of courts system. In the light of the Attorney General's recent comments, perhaps the Leader could make time available for this in the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning and others who have requested additional time for consideration of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and other legislation. I hope the Leader is listening to what is being said and will reconsider his position on the matter.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Senator Caffrey said on high-tech industry. The possibility that Intel may close for three weeks in the near future, and the implications of this, suggest a real crisis in the industry. I ask for a discussion on the matter in the House next week. I hope the Tánaiste will come to the House to take part in the debate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Flynn report on the IBTS, I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Health and Children to publish the report. It is vital that there is full transparency and accountability, particularly on matters as sensitive as a report on an area that has caused huge concern and major trauma for many in recent years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the procedures of the House, it is time Members reconsidered how they comport themselves while in the House. The Minister for Finance was pictured last night on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; seated in his chair responding to Senators while another Senator was standing. It did nothing for the image of the House. There is a need for Members to respect its procedures, tradition and history.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Ross, Costello and Cosgrave expressed opinions regarding the banning of opinion polls section now proposed for the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which will be dealt with next week. I understand the proposal came from Fine Gael and was also supported by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that there will be no time limit for debate on the Bill. I agree with the Cathaoirleach's suggestion that the leaders meet after the Order of Business this morning to agree a timeframe. To those Senators who believe that legislation is to be guillotined in this House, I reply that during my four years acting as Leader of the House a Bill has never been guillotined. The longest possible time has been given for debate. Any fair-minded person only needed to witness the debate in the House yesterday to understand this. It continued late into the afternoon. Everyone had the opportunity to make their points because they were afforded ample time to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new section is extremely important and whatever time is necessary will be afforded. I will have no difficulty, when I meet the other leaders after the Order of Business, in <Col N="1181" /> acceding to whatever reasonable requests are made. We have nothing to fear, with the exception of the fact that, as legislators, we have a responsibility to members of the electorate to ensure that we are not dictated to and that they are not influenced by the media. There is no doubt that they are influenced between elections.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan called on David Trimble to clarify the statement he made yesterday. The Senator also referred to the Chief Constable's interview this morning during which he indicated that, in his professional opinion, no Nationalist organisation was involved in the crime in question and that his investigations would focus on organisations from the other side of the divide in Northern Ireland. Senator O'Donovan made a good point and I will forward his views to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh requested debates on disability and education. I have no difficulty in making time available but, as already stated, our primary duty is to ensure that legislation is processed. I will arrange to hold debates on these worthwhile topics when we return from the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan highlighted the fact that people collecting for worthy charitable organisations are doing so in a much more aggressive manner than heretofore. I will pass on his views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Senators Caffrey and Taylor-Quinn requested a debate on the future of the high-tech sector. High-tech industry has been very good to Ireland and we have gained enormously from our involvement with it, particularly in terms of the level of our exports. I heard the interview with Intel's public relations representative, who flatly denied reports that the company intended to close down operations for three weeks. I will make time available for a debate on this matter after the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn stated that legislation is being rushed through the Houses. If the Senator was present last evening &ndash; I am sure he was &ndash; he would have seen that people were given ample time to make their points. A guillotine or timeframe was not imposed on the debate on any Bill in this House during the past four years. That was also the case when Senator Manning was Leader of the House. During Senator Manning's period as Leader, I recall sitting until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and, on one occasion, 5 a.m. On the latter occasion, Senator Rory Kiely spoke on an Adjournment debate at the close of business. We do not do our business in the manner to which Senator Quinn referred. I must state, however, that I respect the opinions of the Senator who has contributed enormously to the workings of the House during the current session.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the Local Government Bill. It is proposed that the legislation will come before the House and, as already stated, all Stages of the debate on it will be dealt with by the House prior to the summer recess. Like all Members, Senator Mooney is closely connected <Col N="1182" /> to his constituents. I am sure they will all be meeting in session today and tomorrow in Carlow. I wish them well.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Cosgrave's views to the relevant Minister and I will forward those of Senator Taylor-Quinn on the report to which she referred to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for agreeing to deal with this matter so expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The passage of this relatively simple and straightforward Bill will allow me to make the necessary establishment day order under section 3 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, immediately following its signing into law by the President. This will mean that the Human Rights Commission, which has been operating for the past few months on an interim basis, will be fully constituted and can proceed immediately to fulfil its wide operational mandate and remit as set out in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the amendment arises from the fact that the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, provides for a nine member commission. However, following the initial appointments, the Government decided, in the interests of providing for a wider sphere of representation of interests on the commission, to increase the number to 15 by appointing six further human rights commissioners. The Government, in taking this step, acknowledged the reservations expressed by many of the interested groups and organisations in the human rights area in the matter. The Bill provides the necessary statutory cover for these additional six appointments to the commission. While the commission, as already stated, has been meeting as an interim body in recent months to deal mainly with general financial, accommodation and staffing matters, it is apparent that this state of affairs should not be allowed to continue <Col N="1183" /> for much longer. To develop its work programmes and strategies and fulfil its role under the Good Friday Agreement, particularly with regard to the establishment of the joint committee of representatives with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, it needs to have full statutory authority.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's original intention that the provision in this separate Bill could have been enacted fairly expeditiously as part of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, which is now awaiting Committee Stage in the other House. Following the wishes of the two Governments as expressed in last year's Hillsborough Agreement to implement fully all the outstanding matters under the Good Friday Agreement by June of this year, we had hoped to have the convention Bill enacted during the current session of the Oireachtas. However, that expectation proved to be somewhat optimistic. To meet the deadline to which I refer, the timescale for the consultative process with the various groups in the human rights area who wished to submit comments and observations on the substantive provisions of the convention Bill would have had to be abridged very significantly.</P>
    <P>The convention Bill is an important measure. It is also complex in that it seeks to balance the interplay between rights under the Constitution and rights under the convention in a way which fully takes account of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty as enshrined in the Constitution, as well as the related matter of the State's dualist approach to the giving of effect in our laws to the commitments entered into by our accession and ratification of international treaties. In the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms, this is a matter which has to be absolutely correct and, while the consultation process will delay progress on the Bill, the Government fully accepts that the views of interested organisations in this important area should be heard and considered. So as not to delay the establishment of the Human Rights Commission any longer, however, the Government wishes to proceed with the Bill now before the Seanad. I have always said that if this situation should come to pass, the Government would deal with it by means of a separate Bill, and we are delivering on that commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. Although it is short, the Bill is extremely important. It is 53 years since Ireland signed up to the United Nations universal declaration of human rights. We have done nothing dramatic since then in terms of formalising our position in respect of the declaration or establishing a human rights commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic proposal in the Bill to give statutory standing to the Human Rights Commission in the Republic is important and long overdue. A number of difficulties arose in respect of this area and there has been an extended debate on them. The Minister is, in a sense, a later convert with regard <Col N="1184" /> to the need for the European Convention on Human Rights. He held different views on this matter previously but has been prudent enough to adopt a new approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not incorporating the full European Convention on Human Rights. In the last two years, there have been serious discussions on this issue among the member states. I attended some of them and was amazed at the narrow conservative attitudes emerging from certain states towards aspects of the convention. It is important that this matter is dealt with separately because the revamped convention on human rights is a distinct issue which the Houses of the Oireachtas should consider separately.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister is establishing the human rights commission. I congratulate Mr. Justice Donal Barrington on becoming its president and wish him and its other members every success in their endeavours. Recent reports, like that of Amnesty International, examined human rights violations here. The commission will be able to consider such reports and ensure the end of human rights violations.</P>
    <P>This body is an important guardian of an individual's rights and it is preferable that it be based here, rather than individuals appealing to Brussels or Strasbourg. We know of the difficulties which arose over the Treaty of Nice and the feeling of citizens that there is a disconnection between Europe and the member states, of which there is proof. Establishing a commission here is a move in the right direction and will make European matters more relevant in the long term.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the commission here and that in Northern Ireland is important. The Minister must encourage close liaison between them. The level of human rights violation in Northern Ireland, and the continuing issues over the cases of Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane, is unsatisfactory. The commissions should support each other to ensure that justice is seen to be done, and that individuals' human rights are protected at all costs.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Barrington assumes an important post and he and the commission must be adequately funded. It needs the necessary resources to be effective in taking up individual cases and addressing fundamental breaches of human rights. The Minister, as a member of the Government of a democratic republic where social and natural justice are priorities, must ensure that the proper resources are given to the commission. It must not be hindered or restricted because of inadequate funding.</P>
    <P>Our written Constitution provides extensive protection for individuals. Nevertheless, in the past, people had to fight cases in the courts, here and in Europe, to get justice. Often they did not have the resources but were able to proceed only with the support of voluntary organisations and legal professionals. Such cases were major landmarks in establishing basic principles of human rights. This House should commend them for their work through the existing legal system. I <Col N="1185" /> hope that, in future, individuals will not have to follow this route because the commission will protect their rights and be amenable to them, instead of people having to go to court here and in Europe, which can be a heavy financial and personal burden.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's returning to the House with the redrafted European Convention on Human Rights, about which he must have an open mind. Having attended European meetings, I am concerned about the fear and inhibition over the provision of what I classify as basic human rights. These should be available to ordinary people without question. I am surprised at the conservatism, caution and fear emanating from various governments and political parties, and shared by some Irish people. A right is a right. Everyone is entitled to basic natural and human justice without that being a major issue. It is a fundamental principle that all open minded, democratic republics should accept as a hallmark of what their society and Government stand for. The Minister must not be cautious over this matter but be big in heart and mind in addressing the issue. Now that he has introduced legislation establishing the commission, he should adopt a bold attitude towards the Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael fully supports the Bill and I wish Mr. Justice Barrington and his colleagues every success in their work. I welcome this important, if late, development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He introduces this Bill at a difficult time for the Good Friday Agreement, which was a major factor in its introduction. We should wish him well and all concerned with that important work over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a proud history in the human rights field. This morning, in Skerries, I met Mary McGee. Senators will recall the McGee case in the 1970s, which was the precursor of a succession of cases brought by Irish people to Europe. Josie Earley was another in the legal aid area and our own colleague, Senator Norris, had a very celebrated case. They were all in a long tradition of Irish people asserting their rights.</P>
      <P>The names of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson should also be mentioned as strong defenders of human rights. Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned them and we look forward to real solutions and information emerging as to the precise nature of their deaths. There is a deep rooted philosophy of care for human rights innate in the vast majority of people on this island and long may that continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in the last couple of days we have seen the most basic denial of human rights with the murder of the young man in Northern Ireland. The spurious reason offered for the murder was the election of members of a certain party to certain positions in Northern Ireland. It is a sad day when the simple exercise of the democratic process has such an awful con<Col N="1186" /> sequence for a totally innocent individual. That is not to say that the taking of life at any time is justified. The attempt to justify such a brutal deed in this manner only serves to exacerbate the situation and rubs salt in the wound to everybody involved in the democratic process, whether those who vote or those involved in the legislatures of either part of the island.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on this Legislature to legislate for human rights and we are involved in this very process this morning. There is also a duty on the whole population to implement in their daily lives the spirit of human rights. An unfortunate trend in this country is that with the growth of materialism and the significant improvement in lifestyle and creature comforts there appears to be a growing reliance on the Legislature and on this famous third person plural &ldquo;they&rdquo; to do something about it. There is a growing tendency towards abdication of the role of the individual in democracy. One particular example comes to mind.</P>
    <P>The provision of wheelchair spaces at supermarkets and public places is something I have been conscious of for a number of years because two close friends are in wheelchairs as a result of tragic accidents. The number of times that one sees perfectly able bodied people taking those places and denying the basic right of access to a fellow citizen never ceases to amaze me. Recently I saw a high profile commercial vehicle with a logo emblazoned on the side occupy one of these places within 400 yards of this House. I was delighted to see the clampers arrive to deal with it. This serves to underline my point that there is a basic lack of consideration in our daily lives for the human rights of our fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>That human right is regardless of accent, language, creed, colour or nationality. We are all aware that this is an emerging difficulty and is something we must work at, be conscious of and be positive about. We cannot leave it to the agencies of enforcement to deal with. They should only be necessary as a last resort. In a fully fledged democracy each individual should be in a position to deal with it on their own behalf. They should also be the guardian of the weak and ensure that there is no inhibition or disruption of the rights of a weaker individual at the hands of a bully. Bullying is something we tend to talk about in the context of schools or the workplace but there is bullying in the streets and it is up to each individual to look out for and assert the right of their neighbour. While it is our duty to legislate there is a duty on each individual member of the population to look out for his or her weaker neighbour.</P>
    <P>We in this country have a proud tradition of dealing with human rights. In dealing with its history I should refer to the role of Amnesty International, which has been involved through the years in asserting the rights of the individual. I have been an active supporter of Amnesty International over the years but their recent advertising campaign was a source of considerable regret to me and to people in and outside the House. I <Col N="1187" /> raised the matter in the House and with Amnesty itself but its response was not particularly satisfactory. If we rely on institutions of State to protect the human rights of individuals it is vital that those institutions and the people who operate them be respected and, within the bounds of fair comment, that respect should be encouraged at all times.</P>
    <P>The recent Amnesty International campaign went beyond the bounds of fair comment. It personalised the campaign in a most unnecessary manner and Amnesty International itself and the cause it espouses will be the loser as a result. The campaign was counter productive. It is ironic when we have an organisation dedicated to respect the individual pursuing an advertising campaign based on the denigration of other individuals. It went beyond the bounds of fair comment and is to be regretted. It was a cheap shot which I hope will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill and for the huge <i>tranche</i> of legislation which he has introduced since his appointment four years ago. He is responsible for in excess of 30% of all legislation in the life of this Government. He used this House to initiate much of it and we thank him for that. I wish him well on his well-deserved holiday in August. Contrary to popular opinion, he is not going on holiday today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as anything that expands human rights on this island is to be welcomed. The extension of the Human Rights Commission from nine members to 15 is desirable, although it would have been better if the numbers were right originally. Following representations from various interest groups and organisations, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has acknowledged that the commission should be represented by a wider spectrum of interests. It is important that society is, as far as possible, fully reflected on the commission so that every breach of human rights can be investigated. For the first time, a body has been established by the State on a statutory basis to espouse, promote and examine human rights in Ireland, as catered for in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>We have been slow in getting the commission up and running. The European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, ground to a halt on Committee Stage earlier this week as many interest groups who wished to make presentations did not have time to do so. As a result, the Minister for Justice has to introduce this short amendment Bill to increase the numbers on the Human Rights Commission. A huge amount of work remains, including the receipt of submissions on Committee Stage during the next Dáil session. Every human rights body and voluntary body working in this area should be allowed to have a say and to have their submissions examined by a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> The establishment of the Human Rights Commission has been a good effect of the Good Friday Agreement in this jurisdiction. Many people think that human rights infringements on this island only take place in the North, as the world was presented with such a view over many years. The upholding of human rights and the establishment of a commission to ensure that human rights are respected are equally applicable in both jurisdictions. The commissions will have an enormous impact. Much of the work in this area has been done by voluntary organisations like Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and prisoners' rights organisations, with whom I was involved in years gone by. The fact that the State has a statutory obligation to uphold civil rights makes us a mature society and only good can flow from that.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Human Rights Commission will depend to a large extent on existing legislation and will be made difficult by our failure to ratify certain international conventions and legislate for certain areas of human rights. This Bill will ensure that the constitutional and statutory provisions that have been made will operate for the benefit of citizens and that human rights are not infringed upon. I presume the commission will produce annual reports and I look forward to reading them to see to what extent the measures and requirements under its remit are being implemented. I welcome the Bill and I look forward to seeing the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, signed into law in the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the Bill, which we should facilitate as quickly as possible. It is great to have a two-clause Bill as it restricts the temptation to engage widely in rhetoric. It is important we ensure that the Government honours its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that we facilitate co-operation with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Although I wish to make some brief remarks on human rights and their treatment, I will save most of my thoughts for the debate on the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001.</P>
      <P>I am sometimes worried by the flow of rhetoric produced by human rights. It is easy to speak of fundamental rights and to ask what is a right or what is natural law. It is not intended that the Human Rights Commission will pursue justice in the same manner as a Government. I am delighted Mr. Justice Barrington has consented to chair the commission, as I have huge respect for his experience and knowledge in this field. He will keep the commission focused on its terms of reference. It is important that the public is educated to accept a climate of rights, as Senator Glennon said. Those who need to take important test cases to court should be supported by the commission, but we should not require it to do any more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> We must not believe that the Human Rights Commission will cure all ills. It cannot deal with the weaknesses in distributive justice, in the political system through which policy decisions are made and resources are allocated and in the criminal justice system. To believe that the commission can do so is to do a disservice to fundamental human rights that need to be dealt with in a proper manner. We need to build an appreciation of equity and of what is fair and just. The attitude to be adopted is summarised by Seamus Heaney in his recent collection of poems, <i>Electric Light: </i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is my neighbour?' &lsquo;My neighbour is all mankind'&rdquo;. We should tackle human rights in that way without expecting the commission to do everything.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the cases of the lawyers Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson, both of whom I knew and respected. Their deaths were crimes and are matters for criminal investigation so that criminals can be brought to justice. If that fails, we may need to do other things, but I suggest that we do human rights a disservice by suggesting it can cure all ills. It is important that the capacity of the Human Rights Commission to deal with certain matters is not wider than its grasp. I have great confidence in the members of the commission, including Mr. Justice Barrington, and in Professor Bryce Dickson, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. It is important that we allow the commissions on both sides of the Border to get on with their jobs. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on bringing forward this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Taylor-Quinn, Costello, Hayes and Glennon for their contributions. I am particularly pleased they welcomed the legislation. It is significant that Senator Hayes, who has a deep involvement in the Northern situation, should have welcomed the fact Professor Bryce Dickson and Mr. Justice Donal Barrington have consented to act as leaders of the respective commissions. I agree this is of immense importance. It is essential that those at the head of the commission should have vast experience and, as Senator Hayes said, both these people are experienced.</P>
      <P>This is an important departure in Irish life. It means that for the first time the State will have a human rights commission which will interact with the Northern commission. In addition, the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into Irish law for the first time in the autumn. The reason this legislation was separated from the legislation incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights is, as Senator Costello said, that the select committee dealing with it wishes to hear submissions from various interest groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been easy to steamroll the legislation through the Houses and guillotine it but such legislation should not be guillotined. It is of <Col N="1190" /> crucial importance that there should be a broad consensus, not just in the Houses but across society in regard to the structures which will be utilised to enforce human rights. In that context, there has been a great degree of unanimity thus far among political representatives, non-governmental organisations and others involved in the human rights field as to how we should proceed.</P>
    <P>It is important this is not breached and that inclusivity should be the touchstone of legislation dealing with human rights in the State, whether it is the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, this legislation or the upcoming Bill incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. I sincerely hope we will be able to maintain that level of consensus. There are varying views as to how the incorporation of the convention should take place. I have set out my stall on behalf of the Government. There are others who believe incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights should be more expansive but I hold a different view.</P>
    <P>We are in a position where the State is subject to the Constitution and there are no circumstances under which we can seek or hope to circumvent it through the European Convention on Human Rights. It will be a difficult balance to strike. Various groups will make submissions and it will be difficult in the autumn to maintain the consensus to date. We will try our best to do so because we are dealing with an issue of fundamental human rights and it is important that a degree of unanimity should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it has been so far, so good. The commission, following the enactment of the legislation, will be up and running on a statutory basis, which is of considerable importance in terms of pointing the way forward. I thank Members who contributed constructively to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. The Minister has been courageous in steering it through both Houses. He has achieved a unique consensus on a complex issue which he hopes will hold. The legislation derives from the Good Friday Agreement and is unique in that Europe in recent years has attempted to come to grips with human rights. Human rights do not form part of the legislative framework of the Treaty of Rome. It is a relatively new concept. While the European Court of Justice is the benchmark for most of the appeals on the rights of citizens, the European Convention on Human Rights is used as a benchmark rather than a legal instrument.</P>
      <P>I have had the privilege of representing the Oireachtas over the past 12 to 18 months in a substitute capacity in the drafting of the charter on fundamental rights. It will be put before the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference which will decide whether the articles of the convention will be incorporated into the Treaty of Rome. The Minister said he did not believe the Bill should be more expansive and some are hoping many sections of the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into Irish law. He also said the Constitution is sacrosanct in this regard and we are somewhat hidebound.</P>
      <P>However, important work was carried out on the convention in drafting the charter on fundamental rights in the European Union. Will the charter have any impact on Irish law? Is this legislation being introduced parallel to the charter or is it more progressive? This is a matter for Government which the Minister must address in a few years. However, it has arisen in the context of the Nice treaty and there will be further debate on its implications for Ireland and other member states. If the charter is incorporated into a European constitution, will the legislation stand up? If a decision is taken in this regard, will Ireland already have in place far reaching and progressive legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his intervention. The objective of the Bill is to establish the commission in this jurisdiction. Originally, the legislation formed part of a larger Bill to deal with the question of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. Ireland ratified the convention 51 years ago. It was one of the first countries in Europe, if not the first, to do so but it was never incorporated into domestic law. That meant any person who wished to pursue his or her rights under the convention was obliged to exhaust all the procedures involved in the Irish courts first under the Constitution and go all the way to the Supreme Court. There was then an obligation on him or <Col N="1192" /> her to go to the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris was one of seven such litigants and eventually successful. His case related to the question of the decriminalisation of homosexuality. The European Court of Human Rights held with Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>The position following the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law will be that any person who wishes to enforce his or her convention right will be in a position to take his or her case in an Irish court. In other words, he or she will not be obliged to exhaust all the court processes here. That will obviate the necessity for large expense and so on. I do not anticipate a large rush of cases in the Irish courts under the European Convention on Human Rights any more than there were before the European Convention on Human Rights when an individual was obliged to go to Strasbourg. The reason is that under our 1937 Constitution certain human rights are enumerated; approximately 19 are set out specifically. Since the enactment of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has been liberal in its interpretation of provisions in the Constitution with a view to building up human rights which are not specifically set out in the Constitution. Between case law and the rights specifically set out in the Constitution, there is a considerable body of human rights or a bill of rights built up. It is different in other jurisdictions where, to use Senator Taylor-Quinn's words, there is no written constitution.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether there will be an increase in litigation demands a wait and see approach. While one can obviously expect an increase, I do not believe it will be major. It is a Pandora's Box in that it is difficult to call. However, a considerable number of authorities will say that the rights enshrined in the Constitution and which have been built up by the Supreme Court over the years are more expansive than the rights already contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. That is not to say there are not rights which are contained in the European Convention on Human Rights which are not contained in the Irish Constitution of 1937.</P>
      <P>It is felt that the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law will have some far-reaching consequences at an administrative level, for example, the local authorities, health boards, etc. In that context, it may touch the citizen in a tangible way where an individual feels he or she was hard done by in an application for a medical card or a council house. These are real problems which face people every day of the week and which could cause this bubble, which many people might consider the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law to be, before people's faces to burst. That is where it becomes important and relevant to people.</P>

    <P>As regards the Charter of Human Rights agreed at Nice, that is not a convention as such <Col N="1193" /> but a policy statement. Senator Mooney asked where it stands. It is a statement of policy agreed at Nice and how it will progress is a matter for 2004. Only then will we know where that will go. Whether it will become part of international law and subsequently part of domestic law is a matter which has not been addressed to the best of my knowledge, but it must be considered in time.</P>
    <P>We are setting up the Irish Human Rights Commission which will interact with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in terms of the issue of human rights. The commission here, as in the North of Ireland, is not intended to be a limb of the Government but to interface between the public and the Government. That is why the selection process has been difficult and complicated. The Government was obliged to set up a commission which would interface with the public and, although the Government formed the commission, it was of crucial importance that the commission should not only be in a position to assert its independence but should be seen to be independent. In that context, we adopted a novel approach by setting up a selection committee which brought forward names. The Government considered the names and picked nine people. The selection committee sent 16 names to the Government and some were appointed, while others were not.</P>
    <P>At a conference in Dublin Castle before Christmas it became clear to me that non-governmental organisations, for example, were cross about the fact they did not have adequate representation on the commission. I then decided immediately to change the legislation and the membership of the commission because if it was not going to be inclusive, it would be strangled at birth and it would not be much use to anyone. I think we have got the balance right.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Donal Barrington has shown vividly that he feels independent and he has asserted his independence. The commission will also assert its independence. That is not to say the commission will go overboard. I am sure the members of the commission are eminent and sensible people. However, there is an opportunity, as I said in the other House yesterday, to shine a light into a part of Ireland and parts of our society where lights have not been shone before. That is welcome. We have a comprehensive bill of rights built up by the Constitution and the Supreme Court over the years.</P>
    <P>The next stage of this debate will be the incorporation of the convention. That will be a more difficult debate. Views have been expressed that our approach as published is less expansive than the British approach. However, I take issue with that. The British approach is more minimalist. I am not being critical of the British approach in terms of its operation. All these matters are for another day.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I wish the Dáil committee well in its work in taking the submissions from the various groups. We separated this legislation <Col N="1194" /> from the incorporation legislation to give them the opportunity, because they requested it, to discuss this issue. Various groups have expressed an interest in putting forward their views. There is no point in anyone pretending that he or she is omnipotent in relation to this or any other issue. The groups which will have the opportunity to address the committee will appreciate the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas have given them that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on changing his mind. It takes courage and character for someone in a ministerial position to change a position he or she held. I compliment him on listening to the NGOs regarding the composition of the commission. I hope that will ensure it is effective and inclusive and that it works to the community's best advantage.</P>
      <P>I also agree with his comments about the minimalist approach of the British. A minimalist approach to human rights issues was adopted at the meetings I attended with representatives of the British Government. We will have a long debate on that matter another day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to comment on water quality. I propose to outline the measures already in place, and those being developed, to protect and improve water quality nationally. I am confident Members will agree these measures are appropriate and deserve the full support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major assessments of environmental quality became available last year, namely, the EPA millennium report on the state of the environment and the OECD environmental performance review of Ireland, 2000. Both reports concluded that Ireland's environmental quality remains relatively good in comparison with most European countries. For example, compared with other EU waters, Irish waters are generally in good condition, with two thirds of the length of rivers being unpolluted. However, the situation has been deteriorating since the 1970s and by 1997 one third of our river length was affected by eutrophication &ndash; over-enrichment &ndash; mainly <Col N="1195" /> caused by excessive inputs of nutrients from various sources.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. Major catchment based projects for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems are well under way, or nearing completion, regarding loughs Derg, Ree and Leane and the Boyne, Liffey and Suir rivers. The final report of the project regarding Lough Derg and Lough Ree will be launched next week. Substantial investment of over £160 million is also to be made in sewage infrastructure in these catchments. The strategy is underpinned by water quality regulations which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by the end of 2007.</P>
    <P>These measure are beginning to show positive results. I am happy to report that recent data suggest the continuing deterioration in water quality may have been halted. Confirmation of this welcome news must await the next comprehensive review of water quality by the EPA due later this year.</P>
    <P>However, there is still a major challenge and no room for complacency given that the EPA millennium report indicated that eutrophication in inland waters was, perhaps, our most serious environmental pollution problem. The report also highlighted elevated levels of nitrates in certain waters. There is still a long way to go, therefore, to achieve good quality in all our waters.</P>
    <P>I will review the interim targets set by the phosphorus regulations for 2007 with a view to establishing more stringent long-term targets. Agriculture has been identified as the largest single contributor to water pollution, accounting for 73% and 82% of total inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. Significant inputs also arise from sewage discharges and industry.</P>
    <P>The Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001, which I introduced in January 2001, prescribe water quality standards in respect of 14 dangerous substances, including certain pesticides, solvents and metals. These regulations have come into operation and complement the 1998 phosphorus regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department is expanding the catchment-based approach by promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including ground water and all sources of water pollution. Substantial funding is being assigned by my Department to support local authority expenditure on river basin management projects. A river basin management project for the south-east has been approved in principle and I expect that similar projects to address inland and coastal waters in all other areas will be approved during the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> This comprehensive approach is being supported by my Department's major investment programme in sewerage infrastructure facilities throughout the country. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for capital investment of almost £3 billion, the major portion of which will be devoted to waste water infrastructure. This will largely complete Ireland's implementation of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Large-scale projects are being completed or advanced in major cities and towns, including Dublin, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The investment programme places particular emphasis on the provision of nutrient reduction facilities where these are required.</P>
    <P>I made regulations in June to designate 30 additional water bodies as sensitive areas for the purposes of urban waste water treatment. Tertiary treatment will be provided for all discharges into these waters from large waste water treatment plants and will provide for removal of phosphorus or nitrogen as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has undertaken substantial initiatives to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the farm waste management scheme. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is currently developing a code of good farming practice and payments under agri-assistance schemes will be conditional on compliance with the code.</P>
    <P>To reduce phosphorus inputs from domestic sewage, my Department concluded a voluntary agreement with the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association, which effectively provides for a phase-out of phosphorus-based laundry detergents by members of the association. The agreement sets phase-out targets of 55% by end June 2000, 90% by end 2001 and 95% by end 2002. I am glad to report that these targets are being met or exceeded. I pay tribute to the association for this very positive and responsible contribution to our efforts to protect water quality.</P>
    <P>My Department is also putting in place a framework for action programmes in areas where the levels of nitrates in ground water are approaching or exceeding the limits set by European legislation. As I indicated in a public statement in July 2000, the affected waters are located in counties Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford. Work is under way on the identification of the catchments related to these waters and, on its completion, I will formally designate the appropriate areas as nitrate vulnerable zones &ndash; NVZs. The voluntary code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates, the &ldquo;blue book&rdquo;, issued in 1996, will become mandatory in an NVZ. A primary consideration will be the management of manures and slurries.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady improvement in Irish bathing water quality throughout the 1990s and a recent report of the European Commission indi<Col N="1197" /> cates that the results for monitoring of bathing water quality in Ireland in 2000 are among the best in Europe. The compliance rate for mandatory values for bathing water quality in 2000 was 98% in coastal zones and 100% in freshwater zones.</P>
    <P>The most recent EPA report on the quality of drinking water confirms the fundamentally good quality of drinking water in public supplies. There are, however, difficulties with the quality of privately owned group water schemes, which supply 50,000 rural households, or 5% of households nationally. These difficulties are being comprehensively addressed under the rural water programme for which investment of £420 million is provided under the national development plan. Under a revamp of the grant and subsidy schemes, disinfection and filtration equipment now qualifies for 100% capital grants. Capital grants of up to 85% of the cost of the scheme are being provided for the upgrading of distribution systems, provision of source protection measures and the extension of group networks to houses, which are currently dependent on private individual supplies.</P>
    <P>Suppliers of drinking water are statutorily required to rectify all deficiencies in drinking water quality within a specified timeframe. Regulations which I made in December 2000 to transpose the EU Directive 98/83/EC on drinking water introduce stricter time limits for compliance and provision for offences and penalties for non-compliant private suppliers. The EPA report has also drawn attention to water quality deficiencies in some of the smaller public schemes. These deficiencies are being addressed by the relevant local authorities and my Department on the basis of assessments of needs and priorities carried out by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Most of my comments so far have related to the measures being taken by public authorities for better water management. This might give rise to a misleading impression that the protection of water quality is solely the responsibility of public authorities. This is certainly not the case. I emphasise the basic responsibility that we all carry to protect the environment. Where a person carries on an activity, which involves a risk of polluting waters, that person carries the primary responsibility for ensuring that pollution does not occur. It is an offence under the Water Pollution Acts and other legislation to cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters. The penalties and liabilities arising from such an offence can be severe.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year in particular I appeal to all sections of the community to take the greatest care to protect water quality. Fish stocks are particularly vulnerable to pollution in summer months when water levels are low. Farmers especially should exercise care in slurry spreading and avoid spreading where weather conditions are unsuitable. Dry soil conditions are required to absorb the slurry. Slurry should not be spread near watercourses or in wet conditions or when <Col N="1198" /> heavy rain is forecast. Slurry spreading in wet conditions runs completely contrary to good farming practices and creates a high risk of losses to waters and of serious water pollution. All facilities for the storage of waste or silage effluent should be checked and maintained in good condition.</P>
    <P>As has been my usual practice, I have also issued a circular letter to local authorities advising them of the need for heightened water quality awareness and for particular vigilance in respect of activities which have potential for increased impact in low water conditions.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to delivering on all the commitments I have outlined and I am confident these initiatives will deliver on their objectives of ensuring good water quality for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I know that he was in the Dáil until just seconds before he came into this House and I appreciate his taking time out on the last day of the session to deal with this issue. When I asked the Leader for a debate on this issue, it was as a result of the crisis in Galway last weekend when we faced the difficulties experienced by all local authorities and everybody involved in the tourism industry, public health industry etc. when a city's public water system becomes contaminated. It brought home to many people how important water quality is to all of us. I did not doubt the Minister was committed to protecting our water quality and I am delighted he has acknowledged that today.</P>
      <P>As he stated in his introduction, the OECD report and the EPA millennium report on the state of our water state that Ireland's environmental quality remains relatively good when compared with most other EU countries. That is something we need to protect. This offers a challenge to us and the Minister recognises this challenge. All of us as members of local authorities and as consumers recognise that there is no room for complacency and that is why we are discussing the issue today.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very wide-ranging update on all the various issues, and the points I will make are also wide-ranging. I will talk about waste water treatment plants, drinking water, the regulations that may be needed in some areas, the impact of the various problems caused by not having appropriate water quality and the cost savings and value for money that result from a focus on this area.</P>
      <P>The 1997 report of the Environmental Protection Agency stated that over 44% of our drinking water was contaminated. The figure for 1998 was 43%. This is a huge public health issue. Every day people throughout the country are drinking water, either from local authority or group water schemes, yet they are not always certain about its quality. It is a concern that we all have. As we witness the move to greater investment in water quality, it is vitally important to ensure the money achieves what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> A recent report entitled, An Irish Water Infrastructure: A National Way Forward, was prepared by Ladige. I have no doubt that this company is probably selling services to the water industry but it gave a fairly clear assessment of the system in place. The report stated:</P>
    <P>The fragmented nature of Ireland's infrastructure presents the Department of the Environment, which has prime responsibility for water, with serious challenges in complying with the European Union's regulatory and reporting requirements for water quality. The Department of the Environment should have up-to-the-minute, accurate information relating to water quality, and other parameters, constantly available. The current position hinders effective management and has already resulted in legal action.</P>
    <P>The points to be taken from that statement are that, in future, we will need an overall national approach. This will probably mean that savings can be achieved and that we will have a national standard for group or local authority water schemes.</P>
    <P>As people become more aware of how water quality impacts upon them, they will become more concerned about the quality of drinking water. I am speaking from the viewpoint of the consumer. Many now purchase bottled water from various companies throughout the country. When I was abroad many years ago I remember laughing because people were drinking bottled water in European countries. I thought it was lovely that we, in Ireland, could drink tap water whenever we wanted. While that is still the case, and I accept that we have a very good water supply, consumers are increasingly choosing to drink bottled water. They are also installing water filtration or purification systems in their homes. This demand has created an industry in itself. The difficulty, however, with any new industry is that it can develop without regulation, a code of practice or any identification of best practice. As with any industry, there will always be cowboys promising the earth and charging a lot of money to install a particular system. Householders who are already vulnerable in that the water supply may not be adequate, may invest a significant amount in a purification system, yet when problems occur the company may not have replacement parts, have no testing service, or may have gone out of business. The Minister of State and his officials should examine this issue to see what needs to be done to introduce standardisation and ensure everyone operating in the industry does so to a uniform standard.</P>
    <P>I became aware of this difficulty recently when I was asked to visit a company called Ionics, based in Galway. There are 40 or 50 people employed in the Galway plant and many others are employed throughout the world. The company is facing competition from people who do not measure up to the standards it believes should be set. We should <Col N="1200" /> establish the highest standards which, in turn, should be demanded of service providers.</P>
    <P>We have the ludicrous situation where there is insufficient drinking water on one of the Aran Islands, although the Minister of State may not be aware of this as it does not come under his direct area of responsibility. In the summer season water is rationed as there is no fresh water source on the island. Rain water is stored in tanks but, unfortunately, due to various issues, water rationing is having a negative impact on the island's ability to attract tourists. Can one imagine having to tell a tourist, booking into a guesthouse, that they cannot take a shower between 8 p.m. and 11 a.m. because there is insufficient water?</P>
    <P>The issue was raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, on a recent visit to the Aran Islands. I understand she has requested a report on the matter from Galway County Council. I hope we will be in a position to address the issue through Roinn na Gaeltachta, the county council and perhaps the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In this day and age, it is crazy that people on an offshore island cannot have sufficient tap water, particularly when we have so much rain in the west.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, we received a deputation from people who made a round trip of 320 miles from Carraroe to protest about waste water. Fifty of them came by bus from County Galway to demonstrate their concern about the sewerage scheme in Carraroe which is not doing the job it is supposed to. It appears that the local drinking water is now being contaminated by waste water. While the problem is not directly the concern of the Minister, Galway County Council must request priority status for this sewerage scheme. I will see what can be done locally. If we can get it onto the priority list, I will ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to see what he can do to ensure the required funding is made available. South Connemara is a famous tourist area. Throughout the summer it welcomes hundreds of youngsters who stay for two or three weeks to learn or improve their Irish. It is not good enough, however, if people who visit such areas cannot enjoy the same water quality as in other areas, including, Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the huge investment of £3 billion being made to improve water supplies under the national development plan. It is equally important, however, to ensure the money we invest in such schemes under the national programme will achieve what we want. The Minister of State has said that we face the challenge of ensuring our water quality is maintained and improved upon. Water quality is essential to the tourism industry and public health. It is important for us to protect the environment for which we have fought for so long.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House for this debate and hope he will take into account the various points I have made. Perhaps <Col N="1201" /> we will be able to revisit this issue in October or early November to see if anything specific can be done through regulation and legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, to the House. I appreciate that he has only just left the Dáil where a very important Bill is being debated.</P>
      <P>This matter is of great importance and I compliment the Leader of the House for placing statements on water quality on the Order Paper for today. This matter has been raised a number of times on the Order of Business and it is very disappointing that there is not a queue of Members waiting to speak. We are all aware of the difficulties with water supply and the great work that has been done in our towns and villages through the rural group water schemes. The availability of a high quality water supply is the basic right of every person and household but it does not always happen. I recognise the major improvements and grant aid the Minister of State and his Department have introduced. Grants of 75% are available for small public water schemes. That is excellent and worthwhile. Many important developments are taking place with proposals and planning for group water schemes. Grant aid of £1,600 to supply water to a house, and £1,200 in the case of a farm, is essential in rural areas. We must recognise and commend the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State for this.</P>
      <P>In May 1999 funding was made available to local authorities for the take-over of many group schemes that had been in difficulty. Local authorities are now in a position to upgrade these water supplies for houses more than ten years old. We must examine local authorities while they have to look at sewerage schemes &ndash; for which the Department has made much funding available &ndash; as well as water supplies. There are many problems with small sewerage schemes that are now unable to serve expanding villages and towns. Up to a point, local authorities might have been happy if there was an overflow to an available river but that has to be stopped. In my county we have made great strides in the past five years to ensure that practice has stopped in major problem areas. Coming from the county I do, I recognise the problems on the River Shannon. The Lough Derg report, which the Minister of State says will be out next week, will be vital. Perhaps we will return to a debate or discussion on it. The major financial contribution the Department has made to the schemes in Athlone, Ferbane, Banagher and Clara must be recognised. These towns have tributaries which flow into the Shannon and I hope improvements will be described in the report to which we look forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last report I read on lake water quality was published in 1999. It showed a distinct trend towards slight and moderate pollution. When one sees a trend of increasing pollution the alarm bells must ring. This represented a reversal of a <Col N="1202" /> decrease in serious pollution, which had been the trend. This has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned farming. When the local authority nutrient management plans are on stream there will be tremendous improvement. These plans will ensure farming will be carried out to the standard required by the rural environment protection scheme. This will effect great improvements in water quality, particularly where there is extensive dependence on underground water supplies, as is the case for many rural areas and aquifers. We must protect them at all costs, even if to do so causes some pain to certain people. Teagasc and farmers must work together. The spreading of fertiliser and slurry must be looked at and we have to move towards licensing of this regardless of whether we like it. It is like the tagging of sheep. We did not like it but were forced to do it. Those speaking against licensing slurry and fertiliser spreading will have to change their attitude if we are to ensure a quality water supply. The rate of inspection of farmyards and areas where pollution is likely to occur has to be increased at local authority level. When we get too busy with planning, illegal development takes place. Many farmers are doing an excellent job but, as with the problems we had with cattle and sheep, there are always a few who like to bend the rules if they can get away with it. We must clamp down on them.</P>
    <P>All local authorities will have to examine the monitoring of water supplies and the volume of quality water being lost through burst mains. We have to detect these leaks and repair them as millions of gallons of quality water are flowing away daily simply because our maintenance is not up to the standard required. We tend to wait until the water flows over ground and down the streets and roads before we take action. It costs money to provide quality water and we must certainly take action.</P>
    <P>Something also has to be done about waste from housing and the problem of detergents. There is a huge amount of new housing being built and we must look at the standard of grease traps in these houses. Water and grease are flowing into the system and causing major problems. They should be trapped at source, in the house. There is an onus on the resident to ensure this. We welcome spending under the national development plan of £420 million, a substantial sum which will make a great difference. We look forward to major developments.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise the contribution made by the fishing organisations and fishermen in general. They monitor the water supply because they have seen excellent fishing areas disimprove. This has happened because the quality of water has deteriorated. Senator Cox commented on the recent problems in Galway. The same thing could happen in any town or village.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the local authority and group water schemes. In many cases there are only part-time caretakers for the schemes. We must consider amalgamating those schemes and appointing full-time caretakers to ensure that if a prob<Col N="1203" /> lem arises they are available to sort it out. They can ensure millions of gallons of water are not lost or, on the other hand, that there will not be a major pollution problem. They can monitor the supply and ensure maintenance work is carried out immediately rather than waiting for members of the public to complain to the local radio station or newspapers before action is taken.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to this important debate. The Department recently announced a water and sewerage services investment programme. I was delighted to read of the major proposals for investment and I look forward to improvements in those services over the next few years. I wish the Minister and the Department well in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and compliment Senator Cox on seeking it. She had good reasons for doing so. We recently learned about the contamination of the Galway city water supply. It is hugely worrying that an entire city could find itself with a water supply that could be dangerous and to consider how that might have happened. To compound the problem, Galway Corporation is the main culprit. That was not great news but it brings into focus the fragility of the regular supply of good quality water that we take for granted.</P>
      <P>Ireland always had a good water supply. There is no reason it should not have an abundant supply of fresh, clean, uncontaminated water. However, hardly a day goes by without a story in the newspapers or in the media about fish kills, leakages into our rivers and lakes, radioactivity along our coast, nitrates, areas that are unsafe for swimming and the fact that blue flags for our beaches are getting fewer. These incidents give rise to considerable concern that we are not doing enough to protect our water supply.</P>
      <P>There are numerous culprits who are readily identifiable. In the past a huge amount of factory waste was dumped or allowed to leak into rivers and lakes. There are now more stringent regulations and a substantial amount of legislation has been passed. The rural environment protection scheme in rural areas offers great encouragement to farmers to keep sheep and cattle in during the year, thereby allowing waste to be collected so slurry will not be washed off the land into streams and rivers. Nevertheless, there is still a considerable number of fish kills.</P>
      <P>There are different water supply systems in rural and urban areas. Water supply in rural areas is often dependent on group schemes. These are community based schemes which were often introduced on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without proper monitoring or standards for health and safety. The Minister said a substantial amount of money is being invested in the improvement of group water schemes. However, given that 40% of our drinking water supplies are contaminated, a great deal of work must still be done in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The situation in urban areas is different. One would have thought it would be easier to ensure continuity of uncontaminated supply in urban areas. There are reservoirs with treatment plants and pipelines to bring the water straight to the home. It is subject to constant monitoring and inspection. However, as we saw in Galway city, this supply can also be contaminated. It can be contaminated during the process of channelling the water to the home. In blocks of flats and houses throughout the city, particularly in inner city areas, the water is regularly dirty and discoloured and contains particles of material. While an analysis generally shows it is not dangerous to health, the particles are clearly visible to the eye. That is not attractive or encouraging for the consumer.</P>
    <P>A major upgrade of the pipes and the mains in Dublin city is required. The pipes that carry the water are ancient. There was a huge delay by the local authority in accessing European Union funding, which has been available for years to provide the north fringe supply. That is now being carried out.</P>
    <P>Connections between houses leave much to be desired. The old half inch pipes connected residential homes. Now, however, one or other of those homes might be changed to private rented accommodation, resulting in an inadequacy of supply. Various residual materials are also building up in the pipes which discolour the water and render it undrinkable.</P>
    <P>The alternative is bottled water and we are fast becoming a bottled water society. Forty years ago that would have been unthinkable. Twenty years ago only the most <i>avant garde</i> drank Perrier or Vichy water or its equivalent. Then Ballygowan water arrived on the scene and Ireland soon had a generous supply of indigenous producers of bottled water. That water is expensive. We are given to understand that the quality of the bottled water is unmonitored, is not subject to strict regulations and is no better than the water from the household tap. However, that is the way society is going. We will become like some countries on the Continent and undeveloped countries where the only water that is safe to drink is bottled water. I hate to think a day will come when one will not be able to ask for a glass of water in a public house or restaurant without it being presumed that it must come from a bottle.</P>
    <P>The upgrading of our water supplies is a further issue. Dublin Corporation is currently proposing a £60 million upgrade of the Ballymore Eustace scheme which provides 80% of Dublin's water. The proposal is that the work be done by a private company which would part-finance the project in a public private venture with the Government. The running and maintenance would be handed over to the private company. That is totally at variance with the agreements reached by trade unions with the management of Dublin Corporation. It has led, as recently as yesterday, to industrial action outside this House and will lead to further action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> The real concern is that such policies will lead to the privatisation of the water supply and that charges will be introduced for the provision of water to householders. That would be a retrograde step and would lead to major levels of unrest, not just industrial unrest but also unrest in Dublin city. The manner in which the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is providing funds to the various developments needs to be looked at, as does the degree to which privatisation is coming in, and the degree to which this is without consultation. I have no principled objection to a public private partnership in relation to development. However, if it is done contrary to expectations and agreements, and done to suit an agenda that people are not aware of, then we are in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Substantial work is also taking place on the disposal of sewage and waste water in Dublin city. We are in the happy position that in an estimated two years' time, we will have a blue ribbon for Dublin Bay. The city can expect an uncontaminated sea right up to the Liffey. This was unheard of in the past, but there is about £2 million worth of investment going into waste water treatment and sewage disposal which will result in no further dumping at sea in Dublin Bay. It will be dealt with at the secondary and tertiary treatment plant. That is to be welcomed. If we reach the blue ribbon stage for Dublin Bay, that would be a symbol of success and an achievement to hold up. It would be a marker for other projects and the symbol of quality that we need. It has been the perception that the Liffey and Dublin Bay have been the most contaminated areas in the country.</P>
    <P>There are concerns around the country about the quality of water, which is essential to our existence. Good quality is what we seek. We should be the foremost country in the world in ensuring that there is a good quality of water in all areas, whether sea, lakes, rivers or the water that tourists get in their hotel taps. There are few countries where hotel tap water can be drunk. It should be the case in Ireland. Every hotel should be able to put up a sign saying that it is safe to drink our tap water. When that day comes, and when we are able to swim safely in Dublin Bay, we can say that we have got it right.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for outlining in great detail the exemplary record of his Department, and by extension this Government, over the past four years in attacking and addressing complex and difficult environmental problems, as they apply to waste and water management. I felt that one element was missing from Senator Costello's contribution as I tried to establish the thread of his argument. The problems which he mentioned are those which this Government has addressed very effectively, particularly in the Dublin area which <Col N="1206" /> has been the subject of severe criticism for the past two decades.</P>
      <P>I recall Greenpeace members and other environmental NGO members walking on Dollymount and Sandymount strands in protest at the quality of the water in Dublin Bay. They are not protesting now because there is a general recognition that this Government has pumped a sufficient amount of money into dealing with the problems. However, we are not complacent and the Minister acknowledged that we have some way to go in this regard, but we have come a considerable way. Senator Cox outlined the huge amount of money for the environmental area in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 &ndash; some £3 billion, which is not to be sniffed at.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox also mentioned bottled water in her excellent contribution. This area is a surprise to many. Some 40 years ago, problems of water quality were not thought about and the issue never impacted on political debate. Water quality and environmental issues were only raised by Bord Fáilte when releasing pretty pictures of our wonderful green and pleasant land, with its beautiful clean waters for anglers and free roads and unspoilt scenery for visitors.</P>
      <P>The onward march of progress and prosperity has brought huge benefits since then but there is also a downside. Previous administrations did not address environmental issues as this Government has done, and I am not attempting to score political points by saying that. It is fortunate that the philosophy of the Government when it came into office coincided with massive budget surpluses, which has allowed us not only to benefit from European money but to address the issues with our money also. It is accepted that progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to address an increasingly serious pollution problem in the upper Shannon. The Lough Derg/Lough Ree catchment area has been the subject of emphasis from central and local government in addressing the pollution issue, and also in the injection of significant sums of money in recent years. This has resulted in the happy situation where both lakes will soon be returned to their original pristine condition. I was delighted to read recently that the water quality in Lough Derg has greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Ironically, this is partly due to the existence of the zebra mussel. However, there is a downside to the existence of the zebra mussel, and this is evident in the upper Shannon from Rooskey/Lanesborough north to Lough Allen, where I live. The zebra mussel has sadly now been introduced to Lough Allen, a lake which never had a pollution problem. This has come about over the past five years primarily due to the re-opening of the Lough Allen canal which allows navigation into the lake from the Shannon. The lack of proper pumping-out facilities on some boats and the introduction of the mussels, which cling to the bottom of boats, is now a cause of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I have been in receipt of ongoing correspondence from coarse fishing interests in the area of Rooskey and Lanesborough. In that context, I compliment in particular Mr. Alan Forrest of Coarse Fishing Ireland, who has been highlighting this problem and sending missives not only to me but also to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the past two years pointing out that there is a real pollution problem in the area.</P>
    <P>I have seen photographs of white foam, which is high in phosphates and an obvious pollutant, on the River Shannon. The statistics produced over the past five years regarding the decline in fish stocks in the upper Shannon region are frightening. The Minister of State indicated that 73% of water pollution comes from agricultural sources, which is unacceptable. The Government is moving to ensure that action will be taken to address this problem.</P>
    <P>The development of services along the shoreline of the upper Shannon in recent years came about as a direct result of the income generated by visiting coarse anglers. When I was a small child living in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, English anglers used to visit the area on two or three occasions each year to fish what were then well stocked waters. The Shannon was the jewel in the crown at that stage. Lough Allen remains the jewel in the crown in fishing terms and attracts a large number of coarse fishing anglers. However, a serious pollution problem exists in the Longford, Leitrim and the upper Shannon region. I am not sure how this matter can be addressed. It seems there is a need to duplicate what happened in the Lough Ree/Lough Derg area and encourage the local authorities whose areas of remit lie within the Shannon region to come together to address this problem.</P>
    <P>The enforcement measures relating to pollution should be more stringent in nature and I agree with what Senator Moylan said about appointing people to monitor the situation. There is a need to make an example of people in legal terms. I accept that a number of high profile court cases have occurred and that corporations have been brought to book. However, I am referring to individuals who are completely unscrupulous in terms of polluting the Shannon and other waterways. These people appear to be able to act with impunity.</P>
    <P>I accept it might be difficult, but there is a need to put in place an enforcement section in the Department of the Environment and Local Government similar to that which operates within the Food Safety Authority. Since the relevant legislation was passed in the past 12 months, the FSA has managed to increase significantly its profile and level of activity in restaurants and fast food outlets throughout the country. In recent weeks a number of high profile hotels, restaurants and food outlets have been arbitrarily closed down by inspectors from the Food Safety Authority. For example, inspectors visited the Ryan <Col N="1208" /> hotel in Galway and, on entering the kitchen, ordered an immediate shut down of operations. I appreciate that we cannot compare like with like in this regard, but there is a need for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to provide greater resources in the area of enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Fisheries Board, which is involved in enforcement activities to a certain degree, is inadequately resourced in that regard. Perhaps the Department could consider appointing enforcement officers. It may have already done so, but there may not be an adequate number. Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that those who are polluting our rivers and inland waterways are able to get away with it. I accept that they are operating by stealth and that it is difficult to pinpoint the source of pollution. However, where the source is located, it should not be beyond the capacity of the Department to enforce the relevant legislative provisions.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter, not least because the environmental damage will have implications for future generations. People in the area from which I come rely on niche tourism or economic activities such as coarse angling. The area in question lacks a traditional industrial infrastructure and has no tradition of job creation. The niche activities to which I refer are its lifeblood. It is, therefore, vital that pollution should be completely stamped out, otherwise there will be a loss of jobs and a breakdown in the social and economic fabric of the small towns and villages in the area.</P>
    <P>Another matter of importance &ndash; in respect of which the Minister of State and the Department have already taken action &ndash; is education. The level of activity in primary and secondary levels, where environmental projects are the order of day, is quite impressive. I am aware that the Department is constantly coming up with new ways and means to connect with members of the public and alerting them to the dangers of damaging the environment. A sustained effort should be made in this regard. Education is the key word in terms of making people aware of the damage they are doing.</P>
    <P>There is one example of pollution with which everyone will be familiar. On how many occasions when driving in their cars have Members witnessed the driver of the vehicle in front throwing a cigarette butt or an empty cigarette box or bag out of their window? These people have a total disregard for the consequences of their actions. They may argue that they are only disposing of the butt of a cigarette or an empty box, but if one adds together all the empty boxes and cigarette butts, one will be faced with a mountain of rubbish. The ongoing development of our road network has led to evidence of this phenomenon becoming increasingly apparent. If Members have ever been stopped in their cars alongside temporary traffic lights set up to facilitate traffic movement around road resurfacing or widening works, they will have noticed <Col N="1209" /> a mountain of rubbish to the right and left of those traffic lights.</P>
    <P>It was stated not so long ago that the Irish are a dirty people. This is true to a certain extent because we seem to have a particular disregard for the environment. We act in a way outside our homes that we would not tolerate or accept in those homes. It appears that this is also true in terms of water quality and water management.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cox that there is a need to regulate the bottled water industry and the domestic water purification industry. There are unscrupulous companies which may be playing on people's fears about the quality of the domestic water supply. In my opinion there is a need to give careful consideration to this matter. Senator Cox is correct regarding the widespread perception that people are far better off drinking bottled water as opposed to domestic tap water. A recent survey stated baldly that, to a large extent, there is no qualitative difference between bottled water and domestic tap water in Ireland. In other words, one would be better off keeping one's money and drinking water from the tap than buying bottled water.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties involved, work is being carried out and progress is being achieved in this area. At this, the mid-term stage, I say to the Minister of State well done and keep up the good work.</P>

    <Title>Inquiry into Arms Trial: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in accordance with a commitment I made on 11 April last, I laid before both Houses a report on allegations of an attempt to suppress evidence in the Arms Trial. I am conscious that, in the time available today, we can make only short statements and that in any event Members may wish to consider at more length the contents of the report, but I thought it would be useful if we in this House had the opportunity at least to exchange some preliminary thoughts on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arms Trial was not only a criminal trial of unusual importance, but an event of political significance and historical interest. It took place against a backdrop of unprecedented civil dis<Col N="1210" /> turbances and disorder in the North, events which still reverberate today.</P>
    <P>From the outset, therefore, I regarded the issues raised first by the <i>News of the World</i> newspaper and, subsequently, by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; as significant and requiring investigation, not only because they relate to the Arms Trial, important though that is, but because they question the integrity of the criminal justice system at that time.</P>
    <P>I am conscious too that the issues raised by the media have serious implications for the reputation and integrity of a number of persons who, in some cases, fiercely contested the most fundamental issues in the Arms Trial. Some of these persons are no longer with us and cannot defend themselves against allegations, and I know that the House will share with me a concern that any discussion of this matter should take account of that fact.</P>
    <P>The questions raised in the media amounted to an allegation that the statement of Colonel Hefferon, an important witness in the Arms Trial, was altered prior to inclusion in the book of evidence so as to remove from it references to the state of knowledge of the then Minister for Defence, Jim Gibbons, of the planned importation of arms. This was one of the key points of contention in the Arms Trial. At least some of the defendants claimed that the Minister for Defence knew of the planned importation and at least tacitly approved of it and that, far from conspiring to import arms unlawfully, they were acting at all times on the lawful authority of the Minister. The Minister for Defence always strongly denied this.</P>
    <P>There is the complication here that the Minister for Defence could, in any event, only have authorised the importation of arms for the use of the Defence Forces, and that if he had purported to authorise the importation of arms, this would only have been lawful if they had been intended for such use. This is a distinction of significant legal importance, but it does not take away from the central issue, which is that at least some of the defendants claimed to be acting on the authority of the Minister. Supporters of this view will no doubt point to the fact that while it is clearly not the case that the &ldquo;Berry markings&rdquo; coincide with the subsequent omissions from the book of evidence, it is the case that, in both instances, material tending to suggest that Mr. Gibbons had knowledge of what was taking place was at issue.</P>
    <P>In making my inquiries, I asked the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána for a report on the allegation in so far as it touched on their areas of responsibilities. Their reports are attached to my report.</P>
    <P>My objective in conducting my inquiries and in making my report to this House was to set out for the information of Members as much of the relevant evidence as is currently available. As my report acknowledges, there are difficulties in the way of establishing, in any definitive way, the truth of the allegations. We are dealing with events of over 30 years ago in circumstances <Col N="1211" /> where some of the central personalities are now dead, and where the documentation is incomplete. There is also the obvious consideration, which I mention in my report, that evidence of any conspiracy to pervert the course of justice would be very unlikely to be recorded in documentary form. Indeed, one would imagine that anyone attempting such a conspiracy would take care to avoid any appearance of impropriety. For all of these reasons, it is impossible, at least on the evidence currently available, to make an authoritative finding of fact in relation to the truth of the allegation. Instead, we must seek to establish the likelihood of any such conspiracy by reference to the existing documentation and the surrounding circumstances.</P>
    <P>I conclude in my report that, on the basis of an analysis of all of the available material, and on the basis of all other relevant considerations, it seems reasonable to infer that the likelihood of an attempt to suppress evidence is remote. I say that for a number of reasons set out in my report but, in particular, and apart altogether from the serious wrong involved in any suppression of evidence in a criminal trial, I think it is reasonable to doubt seriously whether a number of persons who held positions of responsibility would have engaged in a conspiracy which, from their undoubted knowledge of the law, they surely would have known was almost certain to be exposed. The risk would have been enormous. Any such conspiracy, if exposed, would have collapsed the trial, ended the conspirators' careers and, most probably, left them facing serious criminal charges. It is difficult to imagine such persons taking such a huge risk in circumstances where there would have been every chance of exposure and where in any event the potential gain was so uncertain, given that Colonel Hefferon was in any event going to give his evidence in court. I fully acknowledge that any conclusion as to the truth of the allegation must be qualified by the limitations I have mentioned and cannot, therefore, be definitive. It may be that others will form their own view of the evidence.</P>
    <P>What I have set out to achieve in my report, with the assistance of the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána, is to put Members of this House, and the wider community, in the best possible position to form their own judgments in this matter, by establishing the available evidence and publishing it. I do not claim to have any monopoly of judgment on this matter.</P>
    <P>For all that the documentation and other evidence is incomplete, it is still the case that these reports, taken together, contain detailed and complex information on the prosecution in the Arms Trial. I appreciate that Deputies will need time to consider more carefully the contents of these reports and to form their own conclusions. I am sure more time will be needed in the House to discuss the matter further and when we resume after the recess, it can be dealt with again in the House in early autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> I undertook to inquire into the allegation raised in the media and to report back to both Houses. I have now done so. The reality of the circumstances dictates that my report cannot reach definitive conclusions, but I hope Deputies will accept the report as a genuine attempt to establish as far as possible the circumstances which gave rise to the allegation. It may be that a definitive conclusion will never be possible. Certainly, the passing of the years will diminish the possibility but, in another sense, perhaps the passage of time will bring objectivity and perspective to our understanding of the events of 30 years ago and enable a fuller understanding of the events of that time. Perhaps, in this as in so many other matters, history will have to be the best judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I know he has already given his report in the other House. It was followed by quite an interesting debate with a variety of points of view put across and no great meeting of minds across the floor.</P>
      <P>I am critical of the timing of the release of these documents. It is over six weeks since their release was promised and the fact they were released at 6 o'clock on the day before the Houses rise indicates that the Government is not prepared to take the debate seriously. However, the Minister has indicated, and I accept his assurance, that a full debate will be possible in both Houses when they resume in October. The documents published bear detailed scrutiny as to the full implications.</P>
      <P>The reports are already under attack from a number of quarters, most predictably from Mr. Michael Heney of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. I share his concern, as do many in the Lower House, about the significant number of files that are now missing. I do not necessarily believe in a conspiracy theory as files can go missing for all sorts of reasons such as misfiling, being mislaid or lost etc., but there is public unease at the extent of the files unavailable or missing. Conspiracy theories grow and develop in such situations. Many of those involved in this debate are well used to such theories. This is one issue the Minister will have to address in order to assure the public that the files are missing for genuine reasons rather than that they disappeared during a particular administration or in order to protect reputations. I do not believe that happened but we need to know. An external examination would have given greater confidence to the public that all avenues had been explored. The Minister will obviously deal with this issue which also caused great concern in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer again to Mr. Michael Heney, who is not a conspiracy theorist but who raised questions today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; about the scope and methodology of the inquiry. He promised that &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; would give a full response to the reports. I look forward to that and hope it will not be like the last &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes <Col N="1213" /> which were more a case for the prosecution than an objective analysis of a major event.</P>
    <P>One of the points raised by Mr. Michael Heney was the fact that the Attorney General did not speak with people who might have been in a position to help him in his inquiries. He named in particular Mr. Colm Condon, who was then Attorney General, Mr. Séamas McKenna who was then senior counsel and Mr. Patrick McEntee. He criticised the report particularly because Captain Kelly was not interviewed. I do not know how important such an interview might have been, or even whether it was within the purview of the Attorney General to conduct such an interview. The omission is strange because some people were interviewed, including officials and former officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  </P>
    <P>Page 7 of the Attorney General's report includes an intriguing reference to Captain Kelly making an indication to the Attorney General. Does this mean that he interviewed or even spoke to Captain Kelly? It is strange that such an interview is not mentioned in the acknowledgements of people to whom the Attorney General spoke at the beginning of his report. I would like this to be clarified, although I am not certain it would add anything of great substance.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the nub of the debate is a series of allegations made on two &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programmes. It was alleged that vital evidence was withheld during the trial and that other evidence was altered with malice aforethought. The effect of this, allegedly, was to damage Captain Kelly, resulting in his marginalisation and victimisation during the past 30 years. The programmes alleged that the tampering of evidence was done deliberately, that privilege was sought in a manner that would cover up evidence and that the people who could have done this were the then secretary, Peter Berry and the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley. The programme alleged that there had been a perversion of justice and that there was a State conspiracy against certain people. As they watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, the people of Ireland received the message I have outlined. I have no doubt that many people today believe the allegations to be true as a result of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The charges made by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; were of great importance and cannot be brushed aside easily. The Attorney General and the Minister cannot relegate this issue to secondary importance by referring to it as merely a question of modern history, which the historians will answer when the dust finally settles. Reputations have been seriously damaged by the allegations. It is important that, 30 years on, we discover the truth about events that shaped the recent history of this country and that are still relevant for some people today.</P>
    <P>We must ask what the reports of the Attorney General and the Minister tell us. At its most basic, history is what evidence forces us to <Col N="1214" /> believe. The reports published today provide us with some more evidence to take into consideration. From my reading of the detail, the reports conclude that the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; charges do not stand up to close scrutiny. The Attorney General's report is clear on the matter of whether the original statements were available in court, as it concludes that they were. His report also says that it is highly unlikely that Peter Berry tampered with Colonel Hefferon's statement. No attempt, according to the report, was made to deceive the legal drafters of the book of evidence regarding the substance of Colonel Hefferon's statement. This is a key finding.</P>
    <P>Could the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, or his Department have been party to a conspiracy to deceive the prosecution team? The Attorney General's report deals with this question at some length and concludes that such a strategy of deception was highly unlikely. The reports released today find against the key allegations of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, although the reports are not the last word. In a convincing speech in the other House, Deputy O'Malley dealt at great length and detail with some of the charges made. The reports are of great help and move the debate forward, but they are not the last word, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said.</P>
    <P>An overwhelming case can be made in the public interest for a structured investigation into the events of 1970, based on access to archival material and perhaps also on interviews with the survivors. I realise most people have made up their minds at this stage and new evidence may not change that. I do not envy the Minister or anyone charged with setting up an inquiry, but it is clear that today's reports do not push this matter to a conclusion. The Minister and others seem to think that I am asking for a version of official history, but there is no such thing outside a country run by Stalin or Hitler. As the Minister said, we should not try to get Tim Pat Coogan or Ruth Dudley Edwards to agree, nor do I want to try to get them to agree. We must open up the archives to some form of public inquiry or investigation into the events of 1970. They are not just part of recent history, they are also part of the continuing life of this State.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's invitation to reflect on the reports over the summer months and to return in the autumn with a more structured set of proposals regarding what should be done. I look forward to hearing what the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; team have to say. I read Deputy O'Malley's statement with great interest and although the Minister might like to bring matters to a conclusion today, I think this debate has only just begun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the publication of these reports. I concur with Senator Manning's view that it is unfortunate that the reports came to hand only at 6 p.m. yesterday. It is difficult to examine in detail a document of the volume of the Attorney General's report. <Col N="1215" /> Nevertheless, it is fairly obvious from the reports that the allegations made on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; in April do not stand up. The programme focused on a single issue, although we know there are many aspects to the period in question. By concentrating on a single side of the story, however, huge question marks were placed over many people, some of whom are still alive and others who have passed away. It gave my family and me great discomfort to have the situation portrayed in the manner in which it was. We discussed the matter in this House shortly after the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast and the result of our contributions was that reports would be made by the Attorney General and the Minister. I am grateful that the reports are now before us.</P>
      <P>As Senator Manning has said, the reports have moved the debate on to another phase. Certain information and analysis has been provided, particularly in relation to Colonel Hefferon's original statement of evidence. It is correct, fair and proper that all statements submitted at the time should be examined in the same manner as Colonel Hefferon's statement to see what changes may have been made. We know that huge deletions were made, and reasons have been given for them. RTE's response to the reports will be interesting, but the situation has to move on. The Minister's report causes me great concern where it mentions that a number of documents, which could be of great benefit, are missing. The documents in question include the prosecution file, the Garda investigation file, working papers from which the book of evidence was constructed, transcripts of both trials and sound recordings of both trials. Where is this information? How did it disappear? It is important that we find out what happened to these documents because they contain extremely important information which could clarify a great deal for many different people. It is imperative that we investigate when the documents went missing and why. If they can be recovered, they should be because it is in everybody's interest that this should happen.</P>
      <P>In the context of the debate moving forward and in the interest of writing history properly, all the information should be made available. However, a great deal of archival information has not yet entered the public domain. Military intelligence files are available but people have been threatened with law suits if they publish them. That is alarming. What type of State are we living in? Do we want to know all the facts or only some of them? Are we trying to portray a particular picture or do we want the true picture?</P>
      <P>A number of interesting Army archive documents from the Army intelligence section came to my attention recently. One relates to the transfer of power from Colonel Hefferon to Colonel Delaney. The undated memorandum states:</P>
      <P>1. Colonel HEFFERON said that he did not tell Colonel DELANEY about Captain KELLY's activities as he thought the Minister should tell Colonel DELANEY himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> How could this be true since Colonel HEFFERON kept Colonel DELANEY's existence in Intelligence from 9 February to 8 April secret from the Minister for Defence? The Minister did not know Colonel DELANEY existed in Intelligence until Colonel DELANEY walked into his office on 8 April 1970.</P>
    <P>2. Colonel DELANEY asked Colonel HEFFERON many times during these two months to introduce him to the Minister for Defence. Colonel HEFFERON did not do so until the day before he retired from the Army &ndash; 8 April 1970.</P>
    <P>Questions must be asked about this. If one is handing over power to one's successor, surely one must follow the proper procedures. Why did that not happen? The procedure used was not proper.</P>
    <P>I have another document which is a statement dated 29 September 1970 for Mr. McKenna from Colonel Delaney who was director of intelligence. It states:</P>
    <P>1. Captain James KELLY's name appeared on the Duty Roster for Regimental Duties at Army Headquarters for 11th April 1970.</P>
    <P>2. On 10th April 1970 I instructed Captain O'SHEA of the Intelligence Section to arrange to have Captain James KELLY relieved off Regimental Duties as they pertained to Army Headquarters. I told Captain O'SHEA that my reasons for this were the same as the reasons I had for having him relieved off Intelligence Duties generally in that if he were permitted to do Regimental Duties at Army Headquarters he would have possession of the keys of the Intelligence Section offices and he would be the recipient of possible Intelligence reports from various parts of the country from Army sources.</P>
    <P>3. Captain O'SHEA telephoned Captain KELLY on 10th April and informed him that he was relieved off Regimental Duties for 11th April. Captain O'SHEA did not give Captain KELLY any reason whatsoever for this action.</P>
    <P>4. Mr. McKENNA will see from the Press Cutting attached that Colonel HEFFERON said he was not able to arrange to relieve Captain KELLY from Regimental Duties on his own authority and that he had to ask Mr. GIBBONS to have him so relieved. It is believed to be most unusual if not indeed unprecedented to have a Minister asked to have a Captain relieved off Regimental Duties,</P>
    <P>These documents pose questions which must be answered. There is a great deal of information in the Army intelligence archives which must be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the Lower House that he expected to return to this issue in the new session. It is important that all the information is put in the public domain because at the end of the day people must make up their minds about what really happened on that occasion. I look forward <Col N="1217" /> to the day genuinely interested people, particularly historians, will have the opportunity to avail of all the information.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am disappointed the report was circulated only last night. It was quite difficult to gain access to the report and, therefore, we have not had the opportunity to examine it in the necessary detail. The time provided for the debate at the end of the session is a nonsense and it is unfortunate that the Government did not see fit to publish the report and debate it long before now.</P>
      <P>I observed the debate in the Lower House and it was a travesty of justice that the former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, had no more than ten minutes to make his case. His contribution is viewed as crucial and it does not do democracy in this State any good that a person who is still alive to put on record what he knows did not get ample opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>As Senator Manning stated, the report is clear in regard to the allegation made in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that the statement of Colonel Hefferon was substantially interfered with so as to change its tone, content and intent in its presentation in the book of evidence. All the evidence in the Minister's report suggests that is not the case and the original statement, while not in its original form in the book of evidence, was available to the trial and could have been used any time during the trial.</P>
      <P>The debate earlier in the Lower House brought back memories of the debate there 31 years ago and it was interesting that similar divisions and divisiveness surfaced. The Minister has a combination of responsibilities in regard to this issue. He has a responsibility to ensure the truth is put on the record. As previous speakers said, this report is only beginning to open up the issue. It does not present the full picture to tell the full story. Perhaps the Minister feels he has a party political responsibility to contain the issue as much as possible because it may lead to internal lynching in the Fianna Fáil Party. However, his prime responsibility is his constitutional responsibility as Minister to ensure the truth is put on the record openly and clearly.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline in detail, in regard to the documentation that was not released into the archives, who makes such decisions, how such decisions are reached and who assesses whether documents have a security content or whether there is a fear about certain individuals? The public deserves a full, transparent account of how this was assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda report is clear, precise and concise. The Garda's role at the time was to write down and then type the statements. The legal team which came from the Attorney General's office included three individuals who edited the statements and the Garda personnel involved subsequently typed them. Commissioner Byrne states clearly in his report that the legal team, Mr. <Col N="1218" /> Durand, Mr. Browne and Mr. Quigley, read and edited the statements and the gardaí typed them up.</P>
    <P>I also note in the report that Mr. John Gallagher, who was a detective garda at the time and is now a senior counsel, was not interviewed. I would like the Minister to tell us why he was not interviewed. Why was there selectivity in terms of who was interviewed? The Minister said it is not possible to come to certain conclusions because a number of people are deceased. He also said it was not possible to interview certain people because they are deceased. Why were all the people who were alive and were central to the case at the time not interviewed? They should have been interviewed. The report presented to the Houses should have included interviews with everyone concerned, whether they were on the side of the prosecution or the defence. I want to know why there was selectivity in terms of those who were interviewed.</P>
    <P>Extensive reference has been made to the Attorney General's report. The Minister mentioned what the Attorney General did in analysing the allegations of interference with the statement of Colonel Hefferon. I commend the Attorney General for doing that. However, when the Attorney General makes statements about formal and informal interviews, he is doing so as the Attorney General, not as a private citizen. There is no such thing as formal and informal interviews. Once he speaks about such a matter, he is doing so in his role as Attorney General. I criticise that aspect that refers to informal interviews or discussions with individuals. That is unacceptable. We want full details about who was spoken to and we will not categorise it as formal or informal. The report does not give us those details. We cannot have selectivity. This matter must be discussed openly and we should be given all the details.</P>
    <P>The report states that no unreleased papers were identified which could shed light on the issues raised. Who decided that no unreleased papers were identified? Is it possible that unreleased papers were not identified that could shed light on the issues raised? Deputy O'Malley in his contribution in the other House clearly stated that the S/7/70 file which was released into the archives was different from the file with which he was familiar. Perhaps we should have more detail about that file.</P>
    <P>A major problem with the report and the investigation is the absence of important documentation, such as the prosecution file. That was referred to by previous speakers. We are talking about an event in Irish history which was the singular most serious event in terms of the foundation of our democratic institutions. It is a serious matter &ndash; I will not take as soft an approach as Senator Manning on this issue &ndash;  for any Government since 1969 or 1970 to say that the Garda investigation file, the working papers from which the book of evidence would have been constructed, the transcript of the two trials and the <Col N="1219" /> sound recordings made at the two trials were unavailable. The Minister has questions to answer. When were those files last available in the Four Courts, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General's office or the Chief State Solicitor's office? Who last handled those files and when did they go missing? We want to know the answers. The Minister is talking about a critical time in our democracy and Government history, yet the most critical evidence is missing. That is a serious matter and the Minister has an obligation to investigate it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain gaps. He said that certain files are not available and other witnesses may need to be interviewed. We should interview them. Why is there selectivity? He also said he has raised further queries on these matters and he will report on the outcome of these queries when he has been provided with the answers. Perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply with whom he has raised other queries. On what specific issues has he raised queries? How long will it be before he will be in a position to come back with answers on those queries? I would like answers this evening. There is a need to address that issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the state of knowledge of the late Mr. Jim Gibbons. I have sympathy with the Gibbons family in this matter. The former Minister for Justice at that time, Deputy O'Malley, presented his side of the case in the other House today. Unfortunately, Jim Gibbons is no longer with us so he is not in a position to present his case. The way Mr. Gibbons's case is dealt with in the report raises questions. I am concerned that it is easy to raise questions when someone is dead compared to when people are alive. There is a need for balance and for the full truth to be put on the record. This report is only a slight look at what happened. We have not got the entire story. The Minister said that the possibility of an attempt to suppress evidence cannot be definitely ruled out. I acknowledge that because of the type of evidence available to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's report is an analysis of why these changes have been made by reference to the rule against hearsay. It does not emphasise that there is no information available which would indicate definitely what the actual intention was behind each of the changes as distinct from the likely intention. This is a case of the actual versus the likely intention. There is a need for something more specific and for clarification on this matter. The statement about the risk of exposure because of the possibility that Colonel Hefferon might give the same evidence is acceptable. It is clear that Mr. Berry's name has been completely cleared in this report. There is evidence available to justify why that is the case, and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>The report contains more questions than answers, and the onus is on the Minister to <Col N="1220" /> answer those questions. Deputy O'Malley asked a number of questions during his contribution in the other House. Now that the issue has been raised, the full truth should be known. If that includes a thorough examination of files which have not yet been released to the archives but which are in the Department, the Attorney General's office or the Chief State Solicitor's office, that should be done and the information should be pulled together to give the full picture. He said clearly that there was a conspiracy in 1969 and 1970 to illegally import arms into this country and wanted to know which politicians conspired to import them, with whom they conspired and what happened to the bulk of the money, particularly the £70,000 that has never been accounted for. These questions have never been answered and it is time the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, had the files thoroughly examined and presented answers to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the report on the Arms Trial. While I am not qualified to judge what happened one way or another, I accept what Senators Manning and Gibbons said, but reject totally what Senator Taylor-Quinn said over the past ten minutes. She should apologise to the House and the Minister for her remarks. To call on him to tell the full truth in such a demanding way is very wrong. She has, basically, accused the Government, civil servants, the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of some type of corruption. If somebody from another country was visiting this House today, they would say the Minister and the Department for which he is responsible are corrupt in some way.

He has put the facts, as best he can and with what is available to him, before us today. He was not the person who had to trawl through all the documents. He had civil servants to do so. Is somebody trying to tell me that every now and then they threw a few pages under the table? I accept the Minister's word that these files are missing or mislaid. That is all I am trying to say. The Minister is not telling us lies. I wish people would accept the contents of the report.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for all those on both sides of the argument. This argument will go on forever and no matter what happens, people on both sides will maintain that they are right.

      <P>I am almost afraid to put my head above the parapet, with all that has gone on. I was very struck by what both Senator Manning and Senator Gibbons had to say about this matter. I welcome the Minister and commend him on the work that has been done in presenting the report. I do not intend to comment on the substance of the report because I have not had the opportunity to study it, but was pleased to hear the Minister say we will have an opportunity to debate it more fully in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I am interested, if Senator Manning will allow me to call myself an historian and a student of Irish politics, in the whole issue. It is important because people's reputations, some of whom are dead and some of whom are still alive, are at risk and they are entitled to have the information available to clearly set out the facts. Society and historians have a right to the maximum information available to enable them form a view on this matter.</P>
      <P>I had intended to comment briefly on methodology. The report is welcome but it is a bit like the dance of the seven veils &ndash; tantalising rather than revealing. I have worked long enough in the business to know that files go astray and do not feel the need to invent conspiracy theories. For me, the cock-up theory of administration has been sufficient to explain most matters.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the prosecution file on this case, which, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, is one of the landmark cases of modern Irish politics, has gone astray. In most countries it would be a collector's piece, and might have become such. Before we resume this debate in the autumn, it might be helpful if efforts were made to see if these files could be found or recreated from other sources to a greater or lesser extent because as long as they are not available, people will speculate on their contents. I am not for one moment imputing anything other than the greatest probity and care of records but it would help us, and allay the public concern about these matters, if another search could be made. My own view, for what it is worth, is that the sensible approach would be to have a commission of academics, historians or those used to devilling around in archives to examine them because, increasingly, it is an archival matter rather than a matter of taking evidence.</P>
      <P>In so far as we have the report before us, I am grateful to the Minister for it. I thank him for the time he took to present it to us and the comments he made, and look forward to a longer debate in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read the report because I was in Carlow last night at the general council and had other work to do today, but I made a contribution on the occasion when we last debated this matter. If he did not know by now, the Minister will realise how protective Senator Tom Fitzgerald is in his position as Whip, and rightly so. I commend the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The Minister outlined that his statement did not contain the final assumptions or interpretations which can be made of the report. He is not suggesting this is the end of the matter. My primary interest in this matter is due to the fact that I come from County Donegal and am a member of the party of which the late Deputy Neil Blaney was a member for many years. These events had a significant effect on all of us through the years. For years after them, many people in Fianna Fáil continued to support Neil Blaney. Only when it was obvious he was not going to return to the party, and other events took place, did we get on with our lives. We experienced difficult times, as did those in the Blaney camp. When we should have been working on behalf of our county, we divided. Neil Blaney stated he did not leave Fianna Fáil, but Fianna Fáil left him. This may be true to some extent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, over 30 years have gone by and many of those involved in these events are dead. He also stated that evidence of any conspiracy to pervert the course of justice would be unlikely to be recorded in documentary form. I accept that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said it was reasonable to doubt seriously whether a number of persons who held positions of responsibility would have engaged in a conspiracy. I presume he is referring to those in the Department. I find it difficult to believe all those involved in the Arms Trial, and the events which led to it, would have become involved in something they thought was illegal because of the effect it would have on them.</P>
    <P>These events had particularly significant effects on Captain Kelly. I commend him for his research to try to get behind some of the information. I am not a lawyer and have never been involved in court cases, but a previous speaker noted that even though the entire statement was not included in the book of evidence, it was available at the trial. Was there no indication of any of these allegations at the time? I commend Captain Kelly for going behind the scenes. I also compliment the Minister on stating this is not the end of the matter and that when we have a better opportunity to examine the report, we can debate the issue again in the House.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by the fact that documents are missing. I bow to Senator Maurice Hayes's experience of working in the Civil Service and his assertion that files do go missing. I worked in the private sector for years. While files go missing, they turn up when one looks for them. Every effort must be made to find these files.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the opportunity to debate this issue again in the House when we are in a better position to examine events. Perhaps some commission of historians could interview those involved who are still alive, examine the documents and report on the matter. This issue should not be left to fester on the back-burner. Both sides have a right to the truth. It may be difficult, <Col N="1224" /> but I hope we will get closer to what actually happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, but I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Harney, is not in the House as I have things to say directly to her. This matter concerns job losses at the Herdmans factory in Ballybofey which is of serious concern to the people of Ballybofey and the Finn Valley in general.</P>
      <P>People in the area are in a state of shock following the unwarranted notice given to 59 full-time and 28 temporary staff at the Herdmans (Ireland) factory in Ballybofey. This company has been in Ballybofey for about 40 years, but was originally based in Sion Mills for about 100 years. The company's main manufacturing base is in Sion Mills where up to 650 are employed. The plant in Ballybofey produced linen yarn for finishing in Sion Mills.</P>
      <P>The company has been a good employer in Ballybofey and the Finn Valley area and is one of the few manufacturing employers in the region. In April 1998 the House debated the company's reduction in its workforce by 42 in what we were told at the time was a rationalisation programme to help secure the remaining jobs at the plant. Unfortunately we are debating this issue again following the announcement that all jobs in Ballybofey are to go.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the company's flax section was relocated to Sion Mills. Unfortunately some the workers in Sion Mills are also being made redundant due to the rationalisation programme. The cutting of weekend and some nightshift work is regrettable as all the workers who will be laid off are from the Ballybofey area. This is a black day for the Finn Valley.</P>
      <P>The problems arise due to the fact this company is involved in the textile industry and is not immune from competition from countries with low production costs, fluctuations in fashion and the general difficulties faced by manufacturing companies. The two main manufacturing employers in the Finn Valley area were both involved in textiles. Unfortunately Nena Models in Stranorlar had to lay off 43 employees in January. County Donegal has lost over 3,000 jobs in the textile industry in recent years. Many of these jobs have been lost due to the relocation of production to low-cost countries. I hope the Minister of State will clarify whether this option is being considered by Herdmans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employees being made redundant have given long service to the company. Many of them are in their forties or fifties and have given over 30 years' service to the company. These workers were offered statutory redundancy, but this is not <Col N="1225" /> good enough after all these years of service. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in this regard?</P>
    <P>Were the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the agencies under its remit notified in advance of last Wednesday's notice to the employees? I trust the Department will ensure the State agencies try to find an alternative industry for this plant. Public representatives from Donegal South-West are meeting the management on Monday. The Minister must go to Ballybofey and the Finn Valley.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put to the county council meeting last Monday and the Minister is visiting Inishowen next Friday to advise on two further employment projects. Before we even knew of these job losses the councillors knew how poorly the Finn Valley area had been looked after by the State agencies. We decided at that meeting that the Minister, Deputy Harney, would be asked to come to meet us in Ballybofey next Friday.</P>
    <P>Questions have to be asked about the State agencies and their performance in the Finn Valley area. This area has suffered due to 30 years of Northern Ireland troubles. While our colleagues across the Border are getting 80% of European funding, we are getting only 20%. I have been at meetings in Ballybofey long before these job losses were announced, complaining about the lack of investment in industry. While there is investment for small indigenous industry coming through Enterprise Ireland, the policy of IDA Ireland is to concentrate on Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Following the Fruit of the Loom debacle, Letterkenny and Buncrana were highlighted as the two towns for attracting employment under the policies of the IDA. That is of no benefit to most of the western rural part of Donegal and particularly the Finn Valley where for years there was nothing other than agriculture. There is a good commercial community in that area. It is not good enough to decide to put the jobs in Letterkenny and expect people to travel there from Ballybofey. Great improvements have been made, but they are all in the Letterkenny area. I want that policy changed.</P>
    <P>Ballybofey is a large town where there are very few opportunities available and in this year alone the town has lost between 200 and 250 jobs in the manufacturing industry. I want places like Ballybofey to be given special attention to try to attract a serious large-scale industry. I accept Enterprise Ireland is trying to create small indigenous employment but that is not enough. The Minister should look at the policy of IDA Ireland in relation to Donegal. We cannot put all the jobs into Letterkenny and leave the rest of the county without jobs. Even Ballyshannon is one of the towns included in IDA Ireland policy. I cannot recall over the past four or five years one job being created in the Ballyshannon area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done in coming to Donegal on numerous occasions to assist, advise and announce new jobs. However, <Col N="1226" /> she must now change the policy of IDA Ireland in relation to places like the Finn Valley.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I share fully his disappointment at the announcement of the closure of the Herdmans plant. I apologise for the inability of the Minister, Deputy Harney, to be here this evening. She is on international business on behalf of the Government and regrets she cannot be here.</P>
      <P>Herdmans (Ireland) Limited was established in Ballybofey, County Donegal, in 1965 by Herdmans Limited of Sion Mills, County Tyrone, to produce linen yarn for final finishing at the Sion Mills facility. Over the years this process worked well, but as costs continue to rise and the world price of linen continues to fall, Herdmans has been incurring losses in recent years. It is understood that the company has also been experiencing difficulties in relation to its effluent treatment facilities which would require considerable expenditure to rectify, which the company cannot afford. Based on these facts, Herdmans has proposed to close the Ballybofey operation and let go the staff of 59 full-time and 28 temporary staff at the plant. A further 80 jobs are to go at the Sion Mills facility.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland last approved grants to the company in October 1991. The last payment of grants was in 1994 and the company has no outstanding contingent liability to IDA Ireland at this stage.</P>
      <P>FÁS has been in contact with the company to offer its full range of services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs. Depending on the requirement needs of the staff, suitable training courses will be run and every effort will be made to find alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Over the past 18 months, IDA Ireland has radically changed its strategy with a view to achieving a better regional distribution of jobs. The agency's new strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new inward investment projects, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in each region. This new strategy also provides for an upgrading of IDA Ireland's land in regional locations and the provision of new modern facilities in appropriate locations to cater for the emerging sectors. In this context, IDA Ireland's strategies for Donegal have been formulated and tailored, following a wide consultative process, to meet the specific needs of the area. The agency's regional office was re-established in Letterkenny. In addition, IDA Ireland is in the process of relocating a number of key operating units into the north-west region. Engineering and consumer products, with a section of international services, are relocating to Sligo. This move is designed to stimulate and support growth from within the region.</P>

      <Col N="1227" /> IDA Ireland's strategy for this region, is beginning to show positive results and the agency is confident that the recovery of jobs in the area will become more apparent as the new projects which have been approved make their impact in the years ahead. Significant developments in Donegal will impact positively on the Finn Valley region as it is located approximately 20 to 30 minutes from Letterkenny, which is the main focus of IDA Ireland's activity in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the development of Letterkenny Business Park has been completed. PacifiCare, which employs 180 people, occupies building one. The company recently announced an expansion project to create an additional 160 jobs at full development. Work is nearing completion on the provision of a second 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance factory.</P>
    <P>Prudential Insurance Company of America has occupied a new office facility at Letterkenny Office Park and employs 150 people. On 26 June, the Minister announced that Prumerica Systems Ireland Limited, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, is to significantly expand its operations in Letterkenny, with the support of IDA Ireland, in developments which will add 325 new jobs by the end of 2003, with the potential for a further 125 new jobs as the operations develop. Prumerica proposes to establish a transaction processing customer service and shared services centre. Prumerica Systems will also expand its existing software development centre. Jobs will include high-end software development, software testing, financial reporting and administration, transaction processing and customer service. This new project will be located in a second facility on the office park.</P>
    <P>There are other job expansions in the area. Kirchhoff Ireland recently announced an expansion of its automotive components operation in Letterkenny. The company employs 53 people and the expansion will employ an additional 50 people at full development. Interventional Technologies &ndash; IVT &ndash; which is owned by Boston Scientific, has announced plans to create an additional 90 jobs through the expansion of its existing operation in Letterkenny. Abbott Laboratories in Donegal town, which employs 550 people, has announced plans to invest £50 million, with the support of IDA Ireland, for the development of its operation, which will secure the future of the facility. IDA Ireland is also marketing vacant facilities previously occupied by Fruit of the Loom at Raphoe.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above positive developments, the implementation of the recommendations of <Col N="1228" /> the Donegal employment initiative task force has been allocated to the Donegal County Development Board. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are participating in the work of the board. As part of IDA Ireland's regional agenda for the north-west region, the agency has put in place a programme to encourage the development of infrastructure, skills and education in the region, to enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment. Work is ongoing in the area of roads, telecommunications and electricity as there are particular issues to be addressed.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and IDB Northern Ireland have put in place a joint marketing programme for the north-west region, which includes counties Donegal and Derry. The initiative involves the marketing of the region by overseas executives to potential investors. Some of the work to date has included the setting up of a joint database of information. Familiarisation trips for the relevant executives in IDA and IDB have also been arranged. Other areas of co-operation are being explored, including the development of a website and a cross-Border business park.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland for the north-west region will result in the creation of good and enduring employment for County Donegal, including the Finn Valley areas. I appreciate the sincerity and passion with which Senator Bonner has addressed this issue. I sympathise deeply with the people in Ballybofey and County Donegal in general over the huge number of jobs, which have been lost there over the past few years, particularly in the textile area which is going through a very traumatic period of down-sizing throughout the world. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working in consultation with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Donegal County Enterprise Board to ensure that we can stimulate as many jobs as possible to sustain the local economy and make up for the serious shortfall that has been placed on human resource and employment opportunities in Donegal in the recent past. We are optimistic about the future and are confident that we will deliver as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, but with due respect, I already knew all that information. The IDA report for last year shows a net decrease of 96 jobs in Donegal, while there was an increase of 16,000 jobs in the country as a whole. That is the fifth year in succession in which there have been reductions. I appreciate what is being done but we have to broaden it out and the policy must change to adapt to rural areas, particularly the Finn valley.</P>
