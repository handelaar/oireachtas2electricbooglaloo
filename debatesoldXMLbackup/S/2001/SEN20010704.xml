    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be asking the House to take an earlier signature motion on the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000, without debate when the amendment made by the Seanad yesterday is dealt with in the Dáil this morning.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, not to be taken before 2 p.m.; No. 17, motion No. 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m and business, if not previously concluded, to resume thereafter. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate the business not ordered for this week which he intends to take before the end of the session? Will he confirm that the debate on the post-Nice Treaty situation will take place next week?</P>
      <P>In view of earlier commitments and the assurance given to the Dáil by the Taoiseach yesterday, will the Leader ensure when the report on the Arms Trial affair is published tomorrow that time will be made available in the House for a short debate on it? That assurance was given last April and it would be wrong if Members of the Seanad had to wait until October for that debate. The delays in the Office of the Attorney General have now been dealt with and the report is expected tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader ensure when No. 4 is being taken, which I presume will be before the end of this session, that the House is briefed on the reasons for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent Senators are happy with the Order of Business, although we support Senator Manning's request for information about next week, particularly the promised debate on the Nice treaty and whether the Taoiseach will come to the House for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the <Col N="1010" /> relevant Ministers the information provided by the National Road Safety Council on reduced figures for road deaths? The number of deaths could be reduced further if Ireland was not practically the only country in Europe without an air ambulance service. The coastguard has a search and rescue helicopter at Dublin Airport and saved a number of lives in the last two years. With an air ambulance service it would be possible to bring the hospital services to the accident scene. It would not mean a reduction in the number of accidents but in the number of deaths from accidents. Funding should be allocated for such a service immediately and its provision should be a high priority. I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the relevant Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a discussion on the Arms Trial report. The Senator has been calling for the publication of the report for a long period and it would be a shame if the summer recess passed without giving Senators an opportunity to discuss it. I hope the Leader will allocate time next week to do so.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands announced an increase of £14.50 in the licence fee for RTÉ rather than the £50 increase sought. Will the Leader ask the Minister to publish the PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants' report on the requested increase? So far, there is no information in the public domain on the reason the Minister made her decision. It seems a strange decision and a belated one. It was not expected and I am concerned about its implications for public sector broadcasting. We need to know the reasons for that decision.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Leader whether we can get clarification of the Government decision not to allow the ESB to purchase eight electricity distribution networks in Poland. When a semi-State body shows commercial initiative, we should laud and support that. For some reason, which we have not been given, the Government has vetoed this interesting and valuable initiative by the ESB. The Leader should ask the Government why this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for the repeal or reform of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act, 1996, in the next session. I raised this matter three years ago. This law is outdated and archaic. It badly needs reform.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to allow time in the next term for a debate on internal air fares. It is noticeably cheaper to travel to Amsterdam and Paris from places like Cork, Farranfore and Sligo than to travel internally. It would be a great fillip to regional airports to have a proper shuttle service at a reasonable price. It perplexes me that international travel is cheaper than domestic travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Arms Trial report before the House rises next week. It is a long time since this was promised. The Minister for Justice, <Col N="1011" /> Equality and Law Reform led us to believe that we would have had this debate some time back. The delay is not his fault but, now that the hold-up in the Attorney General's office has been resolved, we should deal with this matter before the House rises.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Leader what, if anything, the Government intends concerning the establishment of a forum on the legal and the justice systems. Such a forum has been supported not only by the Attorney General but by the eminent counsel, Mr. Eamon Leahy. On the basis that justice delayed is justice denied, and given the huge backlog of cases clogging up the courts system, it is a matter of urgency that the Government should act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on the tourism industry. The recent barometer survey carried out by Bord Fáilte has come up with some worrying statistics. It is evident that the foot and mouth crisis has had an impact in many parts of the industry. Some parts of the country are more vulnerable than others and my big fear is that vulnerable sections might never recover.</P>
      <P>The debate should focus not just on this year, but on how to win back business next year. Many tour operators who chose a different tour destination for this year may not return to Ireland in the future. We owe it to the industry, particularly the weaker sections, to aid it in whatever way we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's comments on the National Road Safety Council. In the next session, we should have a wider debate about its role, its relationship with local authorities, how accountable the authority is, and other matters such as road design. The issue calls for a greater level of debate on and between the National Roads Authority, the National Road Safety Council, the Transport Authority, local government and the many other agencies involved. Their relationships are an important matter for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú's request for a debate on tourism. There is a total lack of commitment on the part of the Government and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in respect of this area. The tourism industry has been badly affected this year and, regardless of whether the foot and mouth disease crisis is to blame, the Government's commitment to it falls far short of what is required. Much of the revenue from this year's tourist season has been lost and it would probably be advisable to begin planning for next year. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate if it would be possible to arrange a debate on water quality before the end of the session? Recent events in Galway focused the minds of members of the population of that city on the importance of water. It appears that the activities of those who claim to be providing solutions to both group water schemes and individual households are not regulated. The relevant Departments and Ministers should address this matter during the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on disability services as soon as possible? At present, the disabled person's grant is being administered by two agencies, namely, the health boards and the county councils, which is leading to unacceptable delays. For example, some grants can take up to six months to be processed. If one agency, either the health boards or the county councils, was responsible for administering the grants, they could be issued quickly and in a more efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the decision of An Bord Pleanála to uphold the appeal of the anti-pylons group, will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to encourage the ESB to review the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the provision of 110kv lines to the north-west part of County Donegal? Everyone has an opinion on the decision made by An Bord Pleanála but the reality is that north-west Donegal is starved of a proper electrical power supply because the area is totally reliant on 38kv lines. Not only is industry hampered but the health board is also encountering difficulties, particularly in terms of being able to operate its equipment and machinery. It is imperative that the ESB addresses this situation immediately and puts forward an alternative as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning requested a list of the legislation to be processed by the House before the summer recess. I will circulate this to the leaders after the Order of Business. I am aware that many Senators will be attending a conference in Carlow later and I assure them that all Stages of the Local Government Bill will be passed by the House before the summer recess. I understand that many Senators are keenly interested in the current position in respect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and Quinn inquired when statements on the aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum would be taken. I hope these will be taken next week &ndash; they will definitely not be taken this week.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Coghlan requested a debate on the Arms Trial report. I have given a commitment to the House on this matter and, if possible, I hope to arrange a debate on it on Friday afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning also inquired about No. 4 on the Order Paper. I hope this will be before the House for agreement on tomorrow's Order of <Col N="1013" /> Business. I have an up-to-date briefing for the leaders and Whips on that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to he National Road Safety Council and the excellent proposal to provide an air ambulance service. I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello requested that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands publish the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. I understand this report will be made available to Members in the Oireachtas Library later today. I welcome the announcement of the £14.50 increase in the licence fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a proposal that a further increase can be granted, based on the station's performance. Last Sunday we saw an example of RTÉ's great work in the sports department when it broadcast the Munster hurling final, the Connacht final, the Irish Derby, the golf open in Fota&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>RTÉ provides many services and last Sunday was magnificent. I congratulate those concerned. Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on the Gaming and Lotteries Acts and also on air fares. I will pass on his views to the Minister and set time aside in the next session for the debate. Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the proposed forum on the legal justice system. Delays have been reduced in the courts, although the High Court still has difficulties. I will convey the Senator's views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators Ó Murchú and Burke sought a debate on tourism, which is timely as we can review the difficulties created by the UK foot and mouth disease crisis. There will be time for that debate in the next session. The trade is not picking up compared to other years. The short season makes it difficult for the industry, which needs all the support the Government can give it.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on water quality. I will discuss this with her after the Order of Business to arrange it late on Friday evening. Senator O'Dowd asked for a debate on disability services and the grant system. I will include this in the next session. I will convey to the Minister for Public Enterprise Senator Bonner's views on the 110kv lines in Donegal.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>For about a decade or so, the issue of dormant accounts in finan<Col N="1014" /> cial institutions has attracted casual but sustained interest from Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas in the potential there might be for the State to put these funds to good use. Investigation into the matter raised complex constitutional, legal, operational, prudential and investment considerations &ndash; the right to private property, rights on foot of the Succession Act, 1965, and the State Property Act, 1954, the bank-customer implied contract of confidentiality, and the implication for banks' solvency and liquidity. The Minister for Finance also had to consider the public perception impact of introducing such a scheme, and what effect this would have on potential investors both domestically and overseas.</P>
      <P>The main concern was that there was no onus on credit institutions to trace the owners of deposits lodged with them. It was up to clients or their next-of-kin to come looking for their money. The days of personal banking, in which bank staff knew their clients and notified their dependants in circumstances where the account holder had died, for instance, have long passed, and no system was in place which guaranteed next-of-kin their rightful inheritance. In addition, there are many instances where people have chosen to remain secretive about their financial affairs, in which cases dependants or next-of-kin have found it impossible to trace the relevant accounts.</P>
      <P>This failure to trace account holders has long been a matter of public conjecture and concern. Demutualisation of the Irish Permanent and First National Building Societies in recent years indicated the extent of the problem. In the Irish Permanent flotation, in 1994, almost half of those people entitled to free shares did not initially take up that offer. However, by the time the process was completed in 1997, and following the extensive advertising campaign, the percentage of non-claimants had fallen to 8% of customers. Nevertheless, this still numbered about 12,000 accounts.</P>
      <P>The momentum for reform in this area increased with the publication of the report, Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT. Senators will recall that the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee on certain revenue matters recommended that, as soon as was feasible, legislation should be prepared by the Minister for Finance so that funds in dormant accounts could be used for specified purposes of societal and community benefit. The sub-committee considered that the money in these accounts represented &ldquo;free capital&rdquo; for financial institutions, in that deposit takers had free use of these funds and in effect the moneys had become part of the capital base of these institutions. The sub-committee was anxious that the benefit of these funds, which seemed to lie unclaimed for long periods of time, should accrue to society as a whole, and not just to the financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the various considerations mentioned above, last November the Minister proposed the outline of a scheme to deal with dormant accounts. The Government accepted the <Col N="1015" /> proposals and gave permission for legislation to be formally drafted. This proved a long and challenging task, as many issues came to light in the drafting process that had not previously been considered. The Minister was aware that the successful development and implementation of the proposed scheme would require the full co-operation of the financial institutions and their representatives, as well as the advice and co-operation of the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency, whose assistance was always forthcoming and of enormous benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation is without precedent in this jurisdiction. There was no other statutory scheme that could be used as a template to guide us along the path we wished to take. Nevertheless, this legislation gives the most equitable balance between the rights of account holders and the desire that neither the credit institutions nor the State should be burdened with an unduly bureaucratic scheme. In addition, the Bill fully addresses the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts for the use of the moneys in dormant accounts, in that charities and the community at large will, once the scheme is operational, benefit from the moneys.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has attempted to estimate the amount of dormant funds held in accounts with credit institutions, on the basis of information supplied by the banks, building societies and An Post. After much discussion of the parameters, the institutions agreed to supply information relating to the number and value of deposit accounts dormant for various periods of time. An Post also supplied relevant information relating to savings bonds, savings certificates and instalment savings schemes. A period of 15 years of dormancy, when there has been no customer initiated transaction on an account for at least 15 years, was decided upon. A lesser period might cause disquiet among account holders and lead to an inordinately high level of reactivation of accounts. This could have created an unsuitable workload for all concerned. It should also be noted that 15 years is the shortest defined period for dormancy in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Given the large volume of dormant accounts initially identified by credit institutions, the Minister had to settle on a dormancy period manageable by the institutions. The Bill provides that the timeframe settled on can, at a later date, be reduced by way of ministerial regulation. Once the backlog of dormant accounts has been reduced, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will consider whether the timeframe is still appropriate, given that the public will be well aware of the new regime. Given a period of dormancy of 15 years, the Minister was advised that the number of such accounts could be more than 840,000 and their value about £130 million. These figures are estimates of the amounts involved and do not take account of the likely level of reactivations <Col N="1016" /> once the institutions in question bring the proposed scheme to the attention of their customers. They represent the best estimate of the institutions and provide sufficient evidence for the Minister to pursue his stated aim of bringing forward proposals to deal with dormant accounts. </P>
    <P>The Government decided that the scheme would also apply to mature, but unclaimed life assurance policies. The Minister is still pursuing this matter with the insurance industry and intends to bring forward proposals later this year. The proposals in the Bill are more modest than what the Government originally envisaged, but more achievable. The Bill is a good first step on the issue of dealing with funds long neglected by owners and will help to establish the basic framework within which other dormant products can be dealt with. The Government also agreed that the Department of Finance should continue to hold talks with the Irish League of Credit Unions with a view to reaching agreement, on a formal basis, for the treatment of dormant accounts in credit unions. Such discussions are ongoing and the Minister hopes to provide for the inclusion of dormant credit union accounts at a later date, possibly through an extension of the current scheme by way of ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which will come into effect on 1 April 2002, will provide a legislative framework which will improve regulation in relation to the handling and management of funds in dormant accounts in credit institutions. Such institutions will be required to actively take all reasonable steps to identify the beneficial owners of dormant funds, with a view to alerting them to their existence, or repayment if the customer wishes. If the owner or owners cannot be traced, dormant funds will be taken into the care of the State, although the owner will be guaranteed the right to seek a refund. The moneys will be held in a separate fund to be established by the National Treasury Management Agency, whose remit will be to invest the moneys prudently, especially given the possibility of claimants seeking a return of their moneys at a later date.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the introduction of a scheme for the disbursement of surplus dormant funds for the benefit of charities and the community at large. The purposes for which this money may be disbursed are set out in section 41. The projects or programmes to benefit will be those designed to alleviate poverty or social deprivation or to assist those who are physically disadvantaged. However, in particular, it provides that special priority for funding is to be given to programmes or projects designed to assist primary school children experiencing learning difficulties. Once organisations involved in the design or implementation of such programmes become aware of the scheme, and I hope apply for funding, it is hoped this will help minimise the number of children leaving primary school with literacy or numeracy problems below standard for their age. The public will be pleased when the signal <Col N="1017" /> goes out that these moneys are to be spent on worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides that moneys currently vesting in the intestate estates fund deposit account may be transferred, henceforth, to the dormant accounts fund on foot of an amendment to the State Property Act, 1954. I would like to clarify for Deputies that, while the Minister for Finance is bringing forward the framework legislation, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will have the primary ministerial responsibility for the scheme once it is up and running, especially for the disbursement aspects.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extremely conscious that the moneys being dealt with derive, in the main, from private bank and building society accounts and that, as such, they must be handled and invested prudently, having regard to the constitutionally guaranteed right to private property and the confidential nature of the relationship the credit institutions enjoy with their customers. His concern that customers should be reunited with their moneys, including all interest due thereon, is reflected in four key features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First, the term &ldquo;dormancy&rdquo; will be statutorily defined and, therefore, applied uniformly by all institutions that fall within the ambit of the scheme. This will provide clarity for customers in that they can be certain that if they have not carried out any transaction on their accounts for 15 years or more, as and from 31 March next year, the money in the account is due to be dealt with in a defined manner. This should also encourage account holders to make contact with their bank or building society to ascertain whether they have an account at that institution.</P>
    <P>Second, the institutions in question will be required to make best efforts to contact their customers. This may be done in one of two ways. Banks and building societies will be required to personally contact those account holders whose accounts are valued at or above 100, making them aware of the scheme and their rights and obligations under it. Notification will be by way of advertisement in two or more national daily newspapers for accounts valued at less than 100, as well as for so-called &ldquo;non-correspondence&rdquo; accounts. &ldquo;Non-correspondence&rdquo; accounts are those in regard to which the account holder has requested that no correspondence be sent to his or her home address or where correspondence sent to an address has been returned to the credit institution.</P>
    <P>These annual advertisements, the first of which is scheduled to take place in April next year, will generate public awareness of the scheme. In this regard, members will be pleased to know that subsequent to the drafting of the legislation, the Department of Finance finalised discussions with the Central Bank that have resulted in the application of a new, statutory code of practice on licensed credit institutions. This code of practice provides that credit institutions issue statements on all accounts valued at or above 20, at least once a year. Everybody will agree that this is a <Col N="1018" /> welcome development within the banking sector and will go even further down the road started with this Bill in attempting to reunite customers with their moneys.</P>
    <P>Third, the legislation provides that the National Treasury Management Agency will establish and manage a dormant accounts fund into which moneys from dormant accounts will be transferred from April 2003. The agency will be required to invest these moneys prudently, based on guidelines which the Minister will help to draw up but having regard to the need to meet the costs of making repayments to valid claimants seeking a return of their moneys. The main issue in this regard is that not only is a claimant entitled to a return of the principal transferred from his or her account, he or she is also entitled to any interest that he or she would have been due on that principal had the account remained with the institution. The moneys in the fund will generate an investment income, some of which will be used to offset the costs of interest payments to claimants and the rest of which will be reapplied to the fund.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the legislation will give the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs authority to appoint not only the members of the disbursements board, but also inspectors for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the scheme on the part of the institutions. These inspectors, who will essentially be professional accountants hired on contract, will be empowered to examine the systems and practices which an institution employs to ascertain if they are adequate for the purposes of identifying and notifying the holders of dormant accounts. They will also ascertain whether all moneys due to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund have been transferred and properly recorded and will report back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Having highlighted these main features, I will now set out the main provisions of the Bill. In summary, the Bill provides for identification of the types of accounts and institutions to be covered by the scheme; the period of dormancy; the obligations of the institutions in relation to notification of account holders that their accounts may be deemed dormant; the establishment of a dormant accounts fund to be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency and the procedure, including the timeframe, within which moneys are to be transferred to that fund; the rights of share account holders in building societies on foot of the legislation; a new recording procedure to be adopted by the credit institutions in relation to the holders of dormant accounts; the introduction of a scheme whereby institutions will be obliged to complete certificates of compliance with the provisions of the legislation so that any failure on the part of institutions can be quickly identified; a new role of inspector whose remit will be to check compliance with the legislation on the part of the institutions; amendment of the State Property Act, 1954, so that moneys from the intestate estates fund deposit account can be transferred to the dormant accounts fund; the <Col N="1019" /> appointment by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of the dormant accounts fund disbursements board, whose remit will be to disburse moneys from the dormant accounts fund for specified purposes on receipt of successful applications for such; accountability of the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency and the chairperson of the dormant accounts fund disbursement board to the Committee of Public Accounts for the functions of the agency and the board, respectively &ndash; this includes provision for annual reports from each of those bodies; maintenance of confidentiality in relation to ownership of the moneys in dormant accounts and extension of the scheme to other classes of product and-or other classes of institution at a later date by ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>While this Bill does not purport to address all the issues or to provide for a complete solution to the issue of dormant accounts, it makes an ambitious start down that road. It enables us to begin to provide for a systematic approach to the regulation of these accounts in the strive for transparency of their treatment, as well as providing for an equitable and socially beneficial use of any surplus moneys identified. The Bill is innovative and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for presenting the Bill to us. For many years discussions have taken place about dormant bank accounts and how they could be dealt with. My first experience of unclaimed funds goes back to the Funds of Suitors Act, which was passed in the early 1980s to deal with funds lodged in the courts for the benefit of clients which remained unclaimed. That Act specified how the money could be used. A disbursement board was set up similar to the board the Minister is setting up under this Bill. The amounts to be disbursed were smaller. Because there was a connection with the courts the disbursement board recommended that a major part of the funds should be used for the refurbishment of the premises at the Kings Inns. I refer to that case to show there is a precedent for the disbursement of unclaimed funds. </P>
      <P>I understand the definition of a dormant account is a fairly grey area as far as the banks are concerned because each bank has a different opinion of the length of time before an account becomes dormant. It would probably be after six or seven years if a transaction has not been registered. However, even when a bank labels an account dormant, the depositor retains the legal right of ownership. There is also a legal view that the State does not have a natural or statutory entitlement to funds in non-active accounts. For the State to suppress a person's bank account by virtue of it not being used could raise serious legal and constitutional issues about public property. This difficulty could apply if the owners of the account or his or her heirs or successors are still alive. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> The treatment of moneys in these accounts varies between member states of the European Union. I want to reflect on how other European countries deal with this matter. A number of European countries have made arrangements, such as those proposed in the Bill. In Portugal, where an account is not used for 15 years, the balance becomes the property of the state. The period of inactivity used to define an account as dormant is 20 years in Spain. In France, after ten years of inactivity, the funds in the dormant accounts are transferred to a holding agency which manages the money for a further 20 years, after which it becomes the property of the state. In the District of Columbia, in the United States, financial institutions are required to submit an annual report on accounts that have not had any owner transaction activity for five years and if these accounts show no activity within the next year, they are seized by the district.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be many reasons accounts become dormant. This is mainly due to forgetfulness, emigration, death and change of address. It is interesting to note, however, that in the District of Columbia, many accounts opened on behalf of children are forgotten over the years. That trend runs through dormant accounts. Grandparents, on the birth of their grandchildren, open accounts on their behalf but when the grandparents pass on, these accounts are forgotten.</P>
    <P>While the issue of dealing with dormant accounts has been discussed over many years, the matter came to a head with the recommendation of the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts which recommended that as soon as it was feasible, legislation should be prepared by the Minister for Finance so that funds in dormant accounts could be used for specific purposes to benefit society.</P>
    <P>There are many legal difficulties in drafting this legislation. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Bill the Minister has brought before the House today fully addresses the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts on the use of money in dormant accounts in that charities and the community at large will benefit from these moneys once the scheme is in operation.</P>
    <P>There have been varying estimates of the amount of money lying in dormant accounts. The amounts depend on the number of years one considers an account dormant. Under the Bill, the period of dormancy is 15 years, that is where there has been no customer initiated transaction in an account for at least 15 years. As the Minister of State stated earlier, any lesser period of time might cause disquiet among account holders. </P>
    <P>Given the period of dormancy of 15 years, it is estimated that there could be at least 800,000 accounts with a value in the order of £130 million. When the measures proposed in the Bill are put in place to try to trace the owners of these accounts, the number of accounts and the amounts will be substantially reduced. The Mini<Col N="1021" /> ster of State made further reference to that this morning.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention that strenuous attempts have to be made to reunite account holders with their funds. The underlying objective of this legislation is to ensure that funds in dormant accounts are returned to their rightful owners. A number of measures are proposed in the Bill to bring this about. For example, institutions will be required to make the best efforts to contact their customers. The Bill makes a distinction between accounts over £100 and those under £100. For customers who have accounts over £100, the banks and building societies will be required to personally contact these account holders and make them aware of the scheme and their rights and obligations under it. For accounts under £100, notification will take place by advertisements in national newspapers. These annual advertisements, which are scheduled to commence next April, will generate public awareness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House also provides that the National Treasury Management Agency will establish and manage a dormant accounts fund into which moneys from dormant accounts will be transferred. The money will be prudently invested by the National Treasury Management Agency so as to provide an investment income. If the depositor turns up after a number of years to claim that account, they will be able to claim the account with interest.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs may appoint a dormant accounts fund board whose remit will be to disburse moneys from the dormant account fund. Will the Minister of State clarify this issue as it is not clear from the Bill where the division lies between the investment fund and the disbursement fund? The Bill stipulates the mechanism under which the NTMA is obliged to invest money. However, what mechanism will be used to transfer moneys from the investment fund to the disbursement board so it can allocate funds as outlined in section 42? There is an obligation on the NTMA to invest moneys and on the disbursement board to spend moneys. Will the Minister of State clarify the balance between the two?</P>
    <P>The definitions in section 41 are weak. The section states that funds shall be used for reasons of social inclusion. Health care is a priority, particularly in Dublin, where a woman recently had to go to court to secure chemotherapy treatment. Many areas of the health service have been neglected and underfunded, including services for people with disabilities, mental handicap and special needs. Funds should also be refinanced so they can be spent on the elderly.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides an opportunity to fund a pet subject of mine, namely, education. In the Dáil, the Minister accepted an amendment regarding children who leave primary education with serious literacy and numeracy difficulties. However, many young people in areas which suffer social exclusion and deprivation leave second<Col N="1022" /> ary school at 14 or 15 years without qualifications and become involved in crime or drugs.</P>
    <P>Figures indicate that, in one of the most deprived areas in Dublin, 51% of the school-going population leaves school at 14 or 15 years. These children are assisted in primary school by remedial teachers, but no such support is available in secondary school. As a result they are unable to compete with their peers and drop out. The disbursement board should examine this problem when considering the disbursement of funds. I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has been a long time coming. The legislation was difficult to draft and I congratulate all involved in its production. The Bill has been given a boost by the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. We must put this legislation in perspective. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, initiated public debate on this issue, many figures were mentioned in the press as to how much money might, or might not, be held in dormant accounts. We are now down to realistic figures in that there may be up to one million accounts, but the amount involved may be only about £130 million. However, it is important that we deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>Banks have assessed these funds for many years and, if nothing else, this legislation will compel them to contact the account holders. This is the most important provision in the Bill. I do not wish to take from the opportunities being created to disburse funds to charities and social inclusion programmes, but we must appreciate that the funds involved will be limited in so far as the Bill provides that people may reclaim the principal and the interest accrued. This provision requires that a sufficient amount of money is retained to meet the demands of the rightful account owners if they claim these funds. It should be made clear that the State is not confiscating money from private individuals. The money is available to them in the event of their claiming it, with the interest that has accrued. The legislation compels financial institutions in this regard, as a certificate of compliance must be provided by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every attempt must be made to contact the rightful owners &ndash; or their next of kin &ndash; of accounts containing sums over 100 that have lain dormant for many years. There are various reasons people might have set up accounts many years ago in the midlands, west and other regions, yet at a later stage did not access them. For one reason or another, thousands of people who left for England and America deposited money before leaving, or brought back money when they returned on holidays. Such accounts have lain dormant for years. I know of many families who have received letters concerning accounts from banks which are obviously pre-empting the provisions of this legislation. Prior to the Bill being <Col N="1023" /> enacted, the Minister has already kick-started the financial institutions to respond to a large number of dormant accounts. The banks could readily have made contact with the account holders during the years but it was in their own interest not to do so. To some extent, it may have been a matter of greed. I welcome the fact that the Bill will compel financial institutions to do so now.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision for certain moneys to be paid to charities and advances in social inclusion &ndash; such proposals are both laudable and worthwhile. We all wish to see young people remaining at school to finish their secondary education, as well as entering third level education. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case and there are many reasons this legislation will not resolve the difficulty of children abandoning their studies. In many cases, those reasons have little to do with finance. They have more to do with child abuse, parental neglect, mental illness, alcoholism and drug addiction, all of which contribute to an unstable home or community environment. These are major contributing factors to early school leaving, homelessness and crime. We should not consider that the money in dormant accounts will resolve such social ills because it will not do so. Such sums would only amount to window dressing. Early school leaving and associated health problems are matters of far deeper importance which require greater analysis and resources than this Bill can provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the intestate estates fund deposit account. He says that the dormant account fund will be amalgamated with this fund. What type of money is in that account? Is there a similar amount or is it greater or less? While I have a relatively good idea how this fund came into place, I ask the Minister to explain a little more about this and its operation.</P>
    <P>It is important that the National Treasury Management Agency will be involved in the investment part of the fund because that is where the expertise is. I compliment that agency on the wonderful work it has done on behalf of the nation. It reinvested and moved around the funds, which saved the country millions of pounds in interest. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, set up this agency when he was Minister for Finance. It was an innovative idea which has proved very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on dormant accounts within health boards. I am not sure if this has been dealt with under any other legislation. There were millions of pounds in dormant accounts of people who were in long-term care institutions. Is there any provision in this legislation for dealing with that? In the 1970s and 1980s, I had direct access to what was happening within the health board structures and I always found it extraordinary that at a time when money was extremely scarce, we had this large amount of money which could not be touched. I felt that health boards should have moved forward and <Col N="1024" /> sought temporary use of the money in the best interests of the people for whom they were providing the services. Perhaps the Minister might address that. If it has nothing to do with this legislation, I will accept that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will have responsibility for the charity funds. The voluntary sector has had a major involvement in providing services, which is almost exclusive to this country. Some of the problems in the education and health systems relate to the religious orders leaving both of those important areas of public life and the transition to direct departmental involvement in the control and resourcing of those services. In the past, not only did many religious orders provide the service but they also ploughed their own salaries back into it. That is part, but not all, of the reason for some of the great problems in the health service today.</P>
    <P>The same is true to some extent in education. Part of the reason we have so many people in our prisons may be due to the closing down of so many care institutions provided by religious orders. Of course some were out of order and were found to have been guilty of abuse rather than providing care, but there were only a limited number of them.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector is becoming thinner on the ground because people have so many other activities. However, a large number of people give their time on a voluntary basis and they are doing great work at parish and community level using a bottom up approach. I am talking about associations for the mentally handicapped and others who are doing wonderful work and are complementing, supplementing and in some cases providing the only services available in some communities. I call on the Minister to ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure that these groups get some of the funds.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on bringing forward this legislation, without which the financial institutions would sit on this money. I am pleased that this legislation compels them to contact every person who has an account with more than 100. The most important thing is that both the principal and the interest are available to the rightful owners of these accounts. That is a safeguard that the public wants and I am pleased it is in the legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Everyone would have to welcome the principle in the legislation that money which has being lying idle in an account should be used and should not remain simply dormant within the confines of the financial institution. There are questions of constitutionality relating to the State taking possession of funds that belong to private individuals. However, within this legislation, all the pitfalls that might have been perceived to be in the way have been overcome by the commitments that are given. It is merely a transfer from <Col N="1025" /> the coffers of the institutions to the care of the State.</P>
      <P>When the trawl takes place, I imagine we will find that accounts go back inordinate periods of time. I wonder what onus there will be on the financial institutions to go back to the beginning of the 20th century. How far back are the banks and building societies expected to go? I presume that at present every financial institution has a computerised database but what exactly do they contain? Questions have to be asked of the financial institutions to discover whether or not their databases are comprehensive. Have all the accounts of under and over £100 been transferred into the database? Have there been transfers from the time of the previous administration? Financial institutions could have funding in their coffers dating from the 19th century which we are only beginning to ask about. There is a question mark over that and I ask the Minister of State to indicate how far back in time he expects financial institutions to trawl through their accounts. Will computer databases be accepted or will institutions be expected to go back to pre-electronic accounts?</P>
      <P>The possible extent of funds was discussed at the Public Accounts Committee. The Minister gives figures of 840,000 accounts and £130 million but I do not believe it is anything like as small as that. The figures the Minister gave are the preliminary figures from the institutions themselves and we know how good the preliminary figures from them were when their spokespersons came before the Public Accounts Committee. It was not until the Comptroller and Auditor General had a closer look and they were pressed on the point that we began to see the truth about some of the accounts and the quantity of money in them. I do not accept the figure that has been given to the Minister of State and we will find it is not accurate.</P>
      <P>Essentially, we are talking about the banks, building societies and the intestate deposit fund, to which Senator Finneran referred when he asked the relevant question as to what money is in that fund. We would certainly like to have that information. There are also credit unions and life assurance policies not covered by this legislation which have yet to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran referred to prize bonds and the health authorities as well. Money has been taken into care by the health authorities and has lain dormant for a period of time and I would like the Department to look into that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Off-shore accounts do not appear here and they are very interesting. There are many off-shore financial institutions in which Irish citizens hold accounts that may be dormant. Some of them are secret and have been hidden away. To what extent is there a dormant element? The Public Accounts Committee revealed the extent <Col N="1026" /> of off-shore accounts held by citizens from Miltown Malbay and Tralee. There are thousands from small villages alone and there may well be tens of thousands of dormant off-shore accounts. Is there any mechanism by which we can communicate to off-shore institutions the fact that we are about to pass legislation requiring domestic financial institutions to contact account holders and that if moneys are dormant for 15 years or more we expect them to be transferred to the State? That would be an interesting exercise and I am sure the revelations would be interesting too. In all seriousness, there is a vast quantity of money off-shore which may very well be dormant and waiting for the Minister for Finance's grubby fingers. It could doubtless be spent on very useful voluntary and community projects. I ask the Minister to come back to that.</P>
    <P>Many financial institutions are not covered by the legislation and it would be interesting to look at how we can reach them all. We are putting the onus largely on the banks to do the work and that is proper. Banks hold the funds and should be the ones to identify and contact the owners of the accounts. They should produce an annual report of their efforts, success rate, percentage of account holders contacted and the method by which contact has been made. They should report if successful contact was made by letter or if they simply went to the last address they had for an account holder &ndash; dating from perhaps 20 years ago &ndash; and left it at that. The legislation provides that notification of dormant accounts containing under £100 will be by public advertisement. I am not happy with that. Every account, no matter how small, should be the subject of an attempt at direct contact with its holder. Many elderly people may not get the paper on the day the advertisement is published and they may have failing eyesight. There are many other reasons they might not become aware of the advertisement.</P>
    <P>Contact identification is the key to the problem but the onus on the banks is fairly minimal. The Bill provides that each holder of an account shall be notified in writing of the account. Notification in writing is unsatisfactory. If there has been no contact over a period of 15 years or more, notification in writing can reach only a very limited number of the account holders. It is quite normal for people to change their place of residence and they may very well be out of the country. There is no requirement that any attempt be made to approach the next of kin or to meet the residents' association who might know where someone who used to live at an address might be now. There is plenty of useful information in the community where the person was living providing a great opportunity to identify them. The likelihood of identification taking place by a simple written notification is slight and I fear the banks and building societies will do the minimum because to do more than that incurs costs.</P>
    <P>The last thing building societies and banks want is to reduce the profits of their shareholders, <Col N="1027" /> as we well know from the way in which branches are closing down all over the place. Personal services are being reduced and the more that happens the less contact is being made with account holders. As time goes by there will be even more dormant accounts because the nature of banking in the future will be entirely robotic. Banking will become entirely electronic if the banks have their way. They do not want to meet account holders as they are just trouble and mean overheads through the maintenance of offices and the employment of personnel. The result of this trend will be very little awareness of who account holders are. In the old days the bank manager knew a considerable percentage of customers. Had this legislation gone through 20 or 30 years I do not doubt he or she would have been able to identify many of the dormant account holders. That was the personal nature of banking then but things have changed entirely and for the worse. The service has been reduced enormously and the likelihood of anybody in the bank having contact with an account holder is diminishing rapidly.</P>
    <P>In addition to the question of how comprehensive the notification process will be, there is the issue of sensitivity. Institutions are already contacting people about their dormant accounts. A number of institutions have presumed this legislation will be passed and have started to contact elderly people who can be worried by letters asking them to identify bank accounts. There is need for an awareness programme in order that people will understand what the Government is doing. As well as the banks publishing notices in the newspapers in relation to accounts of under £100, the Government should conduct a publicity campaign to reassure people that this is a confidential matter and that they need not worry about the fact that their account may be dormant for many years or what it might be for.</P>
    <P>People might have opened an account ages ago for their burial, to buy a grave or for a similar purpose and might be concerned that tax might be due on it or that there is some other obligation in relation to the account which they have not fulfilled. There must be a degree of sensitivity about how the contacts take place as well as a degree of thoroughness in ensuring every attempt is made to identify the holders of these accounts. A huge amount of work will be required in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other issue is what will be done with the money. I am pleased with the proposal that the funds be disbursed not by the Minister for Finance but by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is appropriate that the money be spent on projects dealing with social inclusion, communities that have suffered deprivation during the years and an anti-poverty programme. I am not convinced that it should go towards education. That is a let off for the Department of Education and Science. Education is an essential requirement in life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> There are two groups of absolute importance, the young and the old. Young people should have a thorough, adequately funded system of education. It is not good enough to talk about providing money for young people who fall out of the education system because of lack of funding and resources. A structural response with proper funding is required, not an <i>ad hoc</i> funding mechanism. Every community will welcome funding being allocated to the primary sector. Last week I raised on the Order of Business the loss of a teacher in an East Wall school. The primary school lost the teacher because numbers were decreasing but the result is that next year two classes will be combined into a class of 39 pupils because the teacher is gone.</P>
    <P>That problem cannot be addressed by providing funds of this nature. If the funds are to be directed to dealing with problems such as this, they should be put into programmes and projects which support a pupil-teacher ratio that is so preferential it ensures there can be individual attention for students, particularly where they are at risk or have been disadvantaged and need special attention. If that is to be done, it should be done directly through the Department of Education and Science, rather than the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Otherwise the programme will be an <i>ad hoc</i> rather than a structured arrangement which will end up being something like a slush fund that is allocated for some of the right reasons but will not be properly administered. It must be administered in a structured fashion.</P>
    <P>If the money is transferred from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to the Department of Education and Science for a structured programme to deal with primary school children, I will welcome it but if it is administered simply on the basis of so-called social inclusion programmes under the sole auspices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, it will be the wrong way to deal with it. It will not be a satisfactory situation in either educational or community terms.</P>
    <P>The legislation which I welcome is interesting. It is great that we will make use of this money. I also welcome the fact that it is only being temporarily held in care in order that if somebody becomes aware of their money in the future and wants it reimbursed, the State will do this. There will be no fear, therefore, that anybody will lose out. It is a win-win situation. However, more time must be spent determining how the money will be used.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it will amount to £130 million; it will be a great deal more than that. Once the Minister gets around to considering the other areas to which we referred, such as the other institutions which have a considerable number of dormant accounts but are not covered by this legislation, and finding a mechanism to deal with offshore accounts, we will really hit the big time and a huge amount of money will flow into the coffers of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> I welcome the legislation and hope the Minister will take account of the suggestions we have made. The disbursement could be a little more flexible than the legislation seems to suggest. Both the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should be able to interact with the Department of Education and Science, given the Minister's focus in terms of the people who are to be the recipients of these funds, and put together a programme with a structured element to it which would not be an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement that would disappear once the the dormant funds ceased to be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this innovative legislation which could have great potential. I welcome the intention of reconnecting people with their money and ensuring dormant moneys are put to public and social use and not used for the benefit of the banks.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill, which are of particular interest to me. I can declare a peripheral interest in that I am chairman of the Ireland Fund, a charity. The Minister has a great opportunity with this Bill to do something imaginative to help the charitable, voluntary and community sector. This country lacks great foundations such as Gulbenkian and Ford in the United States and Rountree and Cadbury in the United Kingdom. These foundations, in a most unbureaucratic way, come to the assistance of groups which are otherwise unfashionable charities dealing with minority groups in society. They help innovative projects to get off the ground. This money could be used to set up a community chest or fund which would transform that sector of society which is crying out in need.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Members of the Oireachtas, local authorities and health boards are excluded from the board. That is proper but I would go further. Civil servants and politicians should be excluded from having dealings with these funds. Civil servants protect their Votes while politicians protect their seats. It is a bad recipe for objectivity when one is dealing with charitable funds.</P>
      <P>The amount of money is not enormous. Senator Costello may be right, but the Minister gives figures which indicate that the amount to be disbursed will be from £5 million to £10 million per year. That disbursal should be undertaken with a minimum of fuss. I would remove all Ministers from involvement with the funds, not just the Minister for Finance. A board should be set up, and while it should operate under set conditions and Government control, it should be for the board to decide priorities within the broad area of social inclusion. They should be allowed to get on with the job. This is truncated unnecessarily if a Minister retains the right to direct, even on the board's submitted plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a temptation to use these moneys to fund projects which should properly be funded through the ordinary Vote. I agree strongly with <Col N="1030" /> Senator Costello that the funding of literacy and education &ndash; teaching people to read and write in school &ndash; is a basic element. If we vote money for education, that is what we are voting it for. We should not use these &ldquo;Band-Aid&rdquo; type measures in addition.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are given flexibility in their use of the funding. Considering some of the points made by Senators Costello and Finneran, the Minister would be wise to provide the board with the power to accept moneys from other sources. When dormant offshore accounts or dormant health board accounts are discovered, no further legislation should be needed. That is why I argue against the Bill specifying that areas such as education be funded. Social needs may change over coming years and it would be best not to have to return constantly to the House to address those changes.</P>
    <P>The example of a similar scheme in Northern Ireland may prove a worthwhile guide for the Minister. It is a voluntary trust scheme which I was involved in setting up some 25 years ago. The scheme was established to assist bodies which find it difficult to access public or other funds because they do not have the expertise to do so. It attempted to give these groups a chance to survive until they qualified for statutory and other schemes. It has been remarkably successful in many ways. The groups were given clear determinants on how they should behave and they could then operate within those parameters. I will forward information on the workings of this scheme to the Minister and his officials, who may also wish to talk to the director of that fund, Ms Avila Kilmurray. She has long experience of dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives an exciting opportunity to re-invigorate the voluntary sector. It would be a pity to bureaucratise procedures or to see the Bill as a means to find additional funds to plug holes in public spending. Despite this, I commend the legislation to the House and congratulate the Minister on having taken it so far. The matters I raise can be dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, particularly as the Bill has now been extended to deal with educational matters. This Bill addresses a problem that has built up over the last 20 to 30 years and which was not a major issue prior to that. It has arisen due to the impersonal nature of banking today, which is caused particularly by the IT take-over of banking services.</P>
      <P>Banks have for many years had full use of dormant funds. The Minister has described the funds as free capital for the financial institutions. There has been no onus on banks to seek out the owners of accounts. I am glad that this legislation means some effort must be made to find the owners of accounts over 100. It should go further and ensure that banks make every effort to trace the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> Some 30 or 40 years ago, every bank branch had a manager who, like the local parish priest or doctor, was a pillar of local society. The bank manager knew every family in the local community and because of this the difficulties experienced today did not arise. That system has now changed and computerisation has taken over. The closure of bank branches, which is a feature of our time, will exacerbate the problem.</P>
    <P>When old people die, today's bank managers do not know them personally and because of this will not be able to trace their next of kin. In many cases, there is no local bank manager. The post has been down-graded and officials are in charge of branches. They have no way of identifying families. Banks only contact customers when they are in the red. The banks worry less when dealing with money on deposit or money that customers may have forgotten.</P>
    <P>Many older people keep their affairs to themselves. In the past many people, particularly in rural areas, kept money under the bed in a biscuit tin. However, changes in society, including break-ins, encouraged people to lodge their money in bank accounts. Due to the secrecy of the operation of bank accounts, money has built up in some and, in many cases, little effort is made to trace the beneficial owner. This was noticeable when the flotation of the Irish Permanent and First National building societies took place. Initially, some 50% of customers could not be traced. Eventually, as the Minister has said, some 8%, or 12,000 accounts, remained in that bracket. I am glad the Bill provides that the shareholders will retain all rights even though the funds may go into the dormant account.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been expedited by the DIRT inquiry and the identification of a fast-track in relation to banking in Ireland. That inquiry suggested that dormant accounts be used for the benefit of the community in general. The money should not be merely for the benefit of the financial institution. The intention is that charities and communities will benefit from the fund when the scheme is fully operational. This was the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee. I am glad to see that this has been extended, after some debate in the Dáil, to educational projects.</P>
    <P>The Government sought advice from the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency in preparing the scheme. They will now require the full co-operation of the banks to get the scheme operational and to identify the moneys that can be transferred to the fund. While it would be preferable to see those who own those moneys claim them, it is good that moneys which are not claimed in the short term can be transferred to the fund. Section 6 deals with the penalties to be imposed on institutions or officials thereof who commit offences within the meaning of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Lower House also debated the length of the period to which the Bill should apply. The <Col N="1032" /> Government has been realistic in using a period of 15 years dormancy to gauge the level of dormant accounts. Only when the scheme has been in operation for a year or two will the real position will be revealed. It was suggested in the Lower House that a period of seven years dormancy should apply. However, it was also indicated that when a 15 year period is applied the number of dormant accounts could be in excess of 800,000 and their value could be in the order of £130 million, that when a 20 year period is applied the value is reduced to £54 million and when a ten year period is applied it rises to £402 million. This, when taken in conjunction with the five year figure, indicates how active are these accounts. Taking on board what has happened in other European countries, the Government was right to opt for a period of 15 years.</P>
    <P>Many people do not take proper care of their financial affairs because they do not visit their bank on a daily basis. However, the advertising campaign that will be put in place and the media reaction to this scheme will lead to the identification of accounts which were, until now, treated as dormant but which are not dormant. When I played football over 30 years ago in my parish, a second team was established for those players who could not gain a place on the first team. As their fortunes began to decline, the two teams eventually amalgamated for the championship. I was treasurer of one of the clubs and the money taken at the gate for the new team's first match amounted to £7. The treasurer of the other club and I lodged that money into a joint account but neither he nor I has been near the bank in the interim, nor have we received correspondence from it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the banks will be obliged to make every possible effort to identify account holders and alert them to the fact that they may have funds about which they have forgotten. Moneys belonging to those who cannot be identified will be transferred to the fund to which the Minister of State referred. However, I am concerned the legislation stipulates that the owners of accounts containing under 100 will not be notified but that information on these accounts will be printed in two daily newspapers and <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. Most holders of small accounts do not read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, as another Member stated, some of them do not even read the daily newspapers. Perhaps in the initial year of the scheme we should consider the possibility of placing advertisements relating to dormant accounts in one weekly newspaper in each county so that as many people as possible will be notified of their existence.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, the moneys in the dormant accounts fund will be distributed to relieve poverty and social deprivation and will also be spent for the benefit of the physically disadvantaged. According to the legislation, the scheme will be administered by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am delighted that moneys from the fund will also be used to assist primary school students with learning difficulties. <Col N="1033" /> In that context, should it be left entirely under the supervision of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs? This funding is additional in nature and is not meant to get the Department out of a hole. As a result, another Department, perhaps the Department of Education and Science, should have a say in how the money is spent. Since I entered the House I have argued on many occasions on behalf of children with learning difficulties. I have witnessed the great success the Government has enjoyed in this area in moving from a static situation to one where progress is being made.</P>
    <P>When we entered office, many schools had no special needs teachers and all of them have children with such needs. At present, school authorities are encountering difficulties in obtaining the services of psychologists. For example, my son sat the junior certificate last year and he was only assessed by a psychologist three weeks before his examinations began. That was unacceptable because it meant that he had no opportunity to practice with the tapes and equipment he would be obliged to use. There are huge delays in assessing children at present.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the moneys in the fund should be used outside the mainstream education system. I raised this matter with the Minister of State on previous occasions, particularly in the context of the great work the ACLD workshops are doing throughout the country. Many parents, including myself, have gained knowledge of this matter during the past four years and have come to appreciate the problems their children face. Most parents to whom I speak inform me that their children blossom outside the classroom environment while working in the type of groups to which I refer. Perhaps we should try to spend the moneys previously considered to be required in the mainstream education system on the type of projects I have described.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the dormant accounts fund but I am somewhat confused with regard to how it will be administered. I understand how the reserve fund will operate, but I am in the dark in respect of the investment and disbursement fund. Initially I believed that, like the banks, only a certain percentage of the money could be released, based on deposits received. Now, however, I understand funding will be issued on an annual basis. The provisions in this area could be widened to allow loans to be given to community groups rather than their merely being given grants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that post offices will be included under the legislation, particularly because I believe that many dormant accounts are held in post offices. These accounts were often opened by mothers and fathers, who are now dead, for their children who never knew of their existence. Even though it is not the Government's policy, the provisions of the Bill should also be extended to prize bonds.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Finance to consider extending the Bill to cover <Col N="1034" /> agricultural co-ops? Many of the older agricultural co-ops took deposits from their shareholders and many of those accounts are dormant. There is a discrepancy in the company law relating to corporate bodies and friendly societies and, given that most of the agricultural co-ops are friendly societies, perhaps this matter could also be investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their views, which I will convey faithfully to the Minister for Finance. This Bill represents a new chapter in the relationship between the State, the financial services sector and the consumer. Its provisions will invoke a new regime of transparency in terms of the methods used in dealing with account holders' money and will encourage the consumer to take more of an interest and responsibility in the administration of his or her accounts.</P>
      <P>As stated at the outset, the issue of dormant accounts and how best to deal with them, both in terms of their administration and how to put moneys therein to best use, has presented a challenge to successive Governments for a long period. I am sure Members will agree it is no small achievement that the Government has formulated what is, on the face of it, a simple yet comprehensive scheme which will provide clarity and guarantees to consumers in relation to their accounts. The Bill provides for the best compromise between the rights of credit institutions and those of account holders. The co-operation and assistance of the credit institutions while the proposals were being formulated should not go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>The duties and obligations which will be placed on the institutions will result in a new and heavy administrative burden for them, particularly in the first year of operation, 2002, when the bulk of dormant accounts will have to be identified and the relevant customers notified. However, the administrative tasks which comprise this process and which have been placed firmly at the door of these institutions are ones they have been willing to take up in the spirit of reuniting customers with their money. In addition, it is to be welcomed that the proposals set out an innovative and laudable scheme for the use of surplus money for these dormant accounts. This will be of great interest to the public at large and it will see many charitable and community projects benefit for years to come.</P>
      <P>As Senators will know, section 41 of the Bill sets out the purposes for which surplus moneys in the dormant accounts fund can be used. By virtue of that section, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the board, established under section 30, will have a broad mandate to benefit worthy causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle raised a number of matters. Banks currently transfer a dormant account into a control account, called a petty balances account. This legislation provides for money in such an <Col N="1035" /> account to be transferred to the fund under the new definition of dormancy. The decision was that the money in such accounts should not be transferred to the State, as happens elsewhere. This was decided in the interests of equity, and following a Committee of Public Accounts recommendation that the money should always be reclaimable by customers. However, the account holder, or his or her beneficiary, must lodge a claim.</P>
    <P>The fund will have two accounts, the investment and disbursement account and the reserve account. Money in the first account will be invested in order that disbursements can be made. The reserve account will be used to meet reclaims. Its level will be set by the National Treasury Management Agency based on guidelines from the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs. It will be possibly 50% or more of the fund until a feel for the scheme is achieved. Section 41 provides for disbursements for educational advancement, which allows organisations designing secondary level programmes to submit applications which the board and the Minister will assess on merit.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked about the intestate estate fund, which holds approximately £2.7 million. It will not be amalgamated with this fund, but the Bill allows money from it to be transferred to the dormant account fund at the discretion of the Minister for Finance. Moneys in the former fund come from the escheated estates of the dead, much through health boards when patients die in their care. The Senator also asked about voluntary organisations. They can apply for funding and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who recently produced a report on the sector, will consider these applications.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello is concerned about the period which financial institutions must go back. They must go over all their accounts, both on computer and paper. The Department of Finance knows of accounts from the turn of the previous century being identified. We can only estimate the amount that will ultimately be in the fund, based on information supplied by the institutions. This does not consider the likely reactivation of accounts when the legislation is brought to the attention of customers. As Senator Bonner stated, we will not know the amount until next April.</P>
    <P>The Government decided not to touch prize bonds because they are part of the prize fund. Extracting from them would deplete the value of the prizes and the bonds' owners could not be entered in the draw. We have no jurisdiction over off-shore accounts. We may extend the legislation by regulation when these come to light as the Bill takes effect. Banks introduced a new statutory code of practice whereby holders of old accounts, valued at or above 20, will be issued with a statement at least once a year. This goes further than these proposals. It must be sent to the last address given to the institution as it has no other means <Col N="1036" /> of tracing the account holders. If they were compelled to spend money to employ persons to investigate all avenues of inquiry to trace them, it would deplete the value of the funds. A balance must be found and the safeguards in the Bill, the obligations and inspections, for example, achieve this. The Minister for Finance also proposes running a public awareness campaign later this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised section 41. Section 41(1)(<i>a</i>) outlines the parameters within which disbursements may be made, that is, the criteria to be met by a programme or project seeking funding. It must be designed to assist the personal education and social development of persons economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged. It can also be designed to assist those with any physical or mental disability. These wide parameters should encompass any project that the Minister or board considers worthy. The section also provides that special priority will be given to any programme or project to assist primary schoolchildren experiencing learning difficulties. Despite what Senators think, money will not be remitted to the Department of Education and Science but will be disbursed by the board.</P>
    <P>I bow to Senator Hayes's expertise in this area. The Government's original decision was to make who benefits as wide as possible and at the board's discretion, but the Minister accepted a well argued Opposition amendment that there be particular reference to schoolchildren who leave the primary system without proper numeracy or literacy skills. He fought off another amendment to extend this to secondary level pupils, on the basis that it would be wrong to particularise the scheme too much and limit the board's discretion. I understand Senator Hayes's argument, but he envisages a different scheme from the Government's.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that money from dormant accounts be used by the State for charitable purposes within certain guidelines, but anyone proving entitlement to it can claim it. Once the scheme is operational, the Minister for Finance will have a small role, but the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will have an important one, given his portfolio for expenditure and meeting social need. He will guide the board on the nature of projects seeking funding. Considerable sums will be distributed and the Minister's Department has the requisite experience in this field.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their eloquent, considered contributions and excellent ideas and suggestions which I will pass on to the Minister for Finance before Committee Stage later today. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 32 subsection (1)(a), line 6, after &ldquo;primary&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and post-primary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main emphasis in the debate this morning was in relation to this section and how the money in the disbursement fund should be used. The Bill provides that it is to be used to assist the personal educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability. Then it goes on to refer in particular to &ldquo;programmes or projects that are designed to assist primary school students with learning difficulties&rdquo;. I was interested in hearing the comments of Members that the Department of Education's responsibility would be solely with learning difficulties at primary level whereas I propose in my amendment that post primary should be included.</P>
      <P>I was involved some time ago in a report dealing with EU funds for Dublin. That report showed that in certain areas of the city where there was social exclusion and deprivation 51% of boys and girls left school at the age of 15 and 16 years because they could not compete with their peers. I made further inquiries as a result of these figures and I found these children were supported by remedial teachers etc. in the primary cycle but when they entered the secondary cycle they were lost and consequently dropped out. Unfortunately, these children had no qualification whatsoever and the report showed that they often fell into crime and drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if we have money to disburse it should be spent on the most needy in our society. I agree fully with section 41 and I have no difficulty in asking the Minister to supplement this <Col N="1038" /> area above what the Department of Education and Science pays. Throughout the country, as Senator Bonner mentioned, there is now an industry in tuition for children whose parents can afford it. These parents can afford special tuition for children who need extra help or even to help children cram for their exams in order to get better results. Unemployed and less well off people have not got that kind of funding. If we have funds from dormant accounts they should be used to help the less well off in our society. Money should be provided to help those our education system has lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that funds should be provided to help people with learning difficulties at primary level and I ask him to add post primary to that. It is a reasonable request and I hope he will have no difficulty with it. The Bill has to return to the other House for his own amendment and I hope he will include my amendment also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have enormous sympathy with the point raised by Senator Doyle. I agree that the problem of adult literacy and the problem of helping children from deprived backgrounds through school are real problems. I argued earlier for leaving a maximum amount of discretion to the board. We should not trammel it particularly since, as the Minister explained, there is nothing in the legislation which prevents it from doing this sort of thing. If we begin to lumber the board with specific groups that makes its task more difficult.</P>
      <P>The essence of the Bill and the thrust for it came from the need for dealing with dormant accounts. We may in a sense have missed an opportunity since perhaps less thought has gone into dealing with the money. It is not an enormous sum of money and it would not solve all the social problems of society, nor should we expect it. The way we are dealing with it is actually a bit of a cod because the Committee procedure is so truncated. I know the Minister wants the Bill and we will not stop the process but we could have helped make it a better Bill if we had more time. Will the Minister assure us that there will be wide consultation with bodies working in the community and voluntary field when making appointments to the board and in arriving at a plan and proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate entirely what Senator Doyle has said and I have had the same experience when dealing with primary school children. I agree that the funding should be given to assist children of parents who cannot afford to get them extra private tuition. The groups I have been dealing with, such as Leader groups and the Association of Children with Learning Difficulties, would be able to take on more children if there was funding available. The whole idea is that we are making a new start. This fund is just an addition. We will not let the Department of Education and Science off the hook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if we give this extra funding to the primary sector that we can eliminate adult illiter<Col N="1039" /> acy in the years to come. We should not be restrictive and the board should be in a position to broaden it out. We should leave it as it is and then, along with pressure from us on the Government to provide extra funding, all the aspects referred to by Senator Doyle can be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Hayes that there will be wide consultation as we want to ensure the best people are on the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which will have a responsible task.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment suggested by Senator Doyle as I consider that the provisions already made sufficiently cover this matter. Section 41(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that moneys in the investment and disbursements account should be used, among other matters, for programmes or projects designed to assist the educational development of disadvantaged people. The Bill specifically provides that priority may be given to projects designed to help primary school children experiencing learning difficulties. Many children leave primary school with literacy and numeracy levels below standard for their age and the Government considers that anything that can be done to address such problems at the earliest possible stage of a child's educational development should be done. In this way fewer problems should become evident at post-primary level. To dilute further the purposes for which this fund can be used would make increasingly ineffectual the provision that the money be used for the educational development of disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that if we make specific provision for the post-primary school sector, third level students from disadvantaged areas should be catered for too. The matter is more properly dealt with by moneys provided by the Oireachtas to the Minister for Education and Science. Nevertheless, in deference to Senator Doyle's comments, should the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs decide that money should be made available from the fund to the post-primary sector specifically, section 41(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill allows the Minister to do so, having regard to the plans of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1)Before the commencement of this Act the Minister shall, by Order, set out in detail the procedure for making, processing and rebutting complaints.</P>
      <P>(2)(<i>a</i>) The Order made under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall also provide for summary dismissal of complaints deemed to be vexatious or frivolous.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)Any complaint summarily dismissed under this subsection shall constitute an offence.</P>
      <P>(3)The Order made under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall provide an appeal procedure against any decision on a complaint by the Commission under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we discussed at length the difficulty relating to vexatious complaints. I tabled the amendment so that we could do likewise today. Vexatious and frivolous complaints can damage a person's name. Senator Cosgrave referred to the allegations made against the Taoiseach recently. They received much publicity in one Sunday newspaper, which listed details such as the amount involved, the place where the transaction took place and the time and date of the transaction. Fortunately, the Taoiseach had an opportunity to deny the allegations on the evening in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> However, if the complaint had been made to an inquiry officer or to the commission, the reputation of the person against whom it was made would have been damaged because the allegations appeared to have substance. As we now know, they were a ball of smoke and there was no substance to them. When allegations are made against a Member it affects his or her character and good name, even though the inquiry officer or the commission might reject them.</P>
    <P>The only asset a Member has is his or her good name. The Minister of State stated that guarantees are provided in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1996, against such complaints but I would like further reassurance on this issue because I am concerned about this aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this matter on a number of occasions and I made a number of contributions on it at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I have also taken cognisance of legislation in this area which has been implemented in Canada and elsewhere. We must provide adequate safeguards so that vexatious accusations cannot be made which can then be withdrawn when damage has been inflicted.</P>
      <P>For example, a serious allegation was made against the Taoiseach. It was alleged that a sum of £50,000 was handed over in a car park in a Dublin hotel. This week it emerged there was no substance whatsoever to the allegation because it was withdrawn. If such an allegation had been made against a person of lesser standing I have no doubt he or she would not be involved in public life today. Due to the perseverance of the Taoiseach and his ability to stand up to such allegations, he saw off the challenge and the allegation was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue. As an Oireachtas Member and a member of a Government party, I fully support the legislation and compliment the Government on having the courage to bring it forward. However, an opportunity must not be provided to individuals to make an allegation against a candidate during an election campaign, for political reasons or otherwise, because the candidate's credibility will be undermined and his or her position in the eyes of the electorate will be damaged even if the allegation is withdrawn at a later stage. If an individual makes a frivolous or vexatious complaint, he or she should be penalised. If he or she has a genuine case and is making it in the common good, he or she has a duty to expose wrongdoing. To undermine a person's character by taking an electoral swipe at him or her is dangerous and anyone who does so should be severely punished. The Minister of State might reassure me and the Members of this House that people of such mind will not be given that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards procedures, the ethics Act already provides that the commission and committees should decide on the details of their <Col N="1042" /> internal procedures in relation to complaints. The relevant provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, already specify a wide range of areas in which they should determine such procedures. This seems appropriate since it is only these bodies which will over time develop an expertise in relation to the processing of these complaints. Moreover, the Bill makes a number of additions which make the skeleton of the complaints procedures more explicit than heretofore. There is no explicit requirement for publication of these procedures, but one would expect the commission or a committee to make clear the procedures it intends to follow in any case. The current commission published its investigation procedure in its report for 1997. The Dáil Select Committee on Members Interests published a memorandum on the procedures it followed during its investigation of the case of Deputy Foley.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of frivolous and vexatious cases, it would not appear appropriate to create an offence. The existence of the offence provision might deter genuine complainants. There are already considerable new provisions designed as safeguards against frivolous and vexatious complaints. Those which lack substance are different in law. A person who makes a frivolous or vexatious complaint may have costs awarded against him or her. That is a significant element of this Bill. Anyone making a frivolous or vexatious complaint or a false accusation should be aware that they could have the costs awarded against them. Government amendments aimed at protecting persons who make complaints from liability will not be applicable to anyone who makes a frivolous or vexatious complaint or a complaint which they know to be false in the first instance. The protective procedures for normal complainants do not apply in the context of vexatious or frivolous complaints.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of an appeals procedure, it should be noted that committees and the commission will not set out penalties. Their function is to assess facts and make recommendations. In the case of Members, the Houses of the Oireachtas will make the final determination. It seems inappropriate there should be a right of appeal against a decision of the House. As regards public servants, the commission's findings will be telling, but the decision in relation to any penalties, etc. must be taken within the normal procedures. An appeal against the commission's finding does not seem to be appropriate. It may be that the Senator has in mind the situation in relation to the electoral Acts where the commission can make a report to the DPP about any suspected offence. A penalty would not be imposed unless the DPP decided to prosecute and the person was found guilty in court with all the standard appeals. Any decision of a body, such as the commission, is open to judicial review in the normal course of events.</P>

      <P>If costs are awarded against someone who makes an unsubstantiated complaint, will the commission award them or does the person concerned have to go to the civil court to get them? If the commission receives a complaint and comes to the conclusion there is no substance to it, can an individual find out under the Freedom of Information Act that the commission is examining it and thereby get the person's name released? Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that because it is important. The commission should be allowed to examine a complaint in private before any public decision is made on it.</P>

      <P>The Senator is right. Information about an investigation of any matter before the commission would not be releasable under the Freedom of Information Act while the matter is being assessed. Unlike previous Bills where we strengthened this area, it will be open to the commission to dismiss automatically a complaint which it believes to be frivolous or vexatious without any investigation. It also has the ability under this Bill to appoint an inquiry officer who can make a quick preliminary investigation if it has doubts about it. That could also lead to a dismissal of the complaint. There are ways in which to protect it. I do not want to intervene in the procedures of the committees of the Seanad and the Dáil. It is a matter for each House to set its own procedures. As I highlighted, in cases where there have been investigations, the committee has set out the procedures which have been adopted. That was satisfactory to all members involved.</P>

      <P>The complexity of this section may have misled me. Section 7 is an amendment to section 23(1) of the principal Act. It refers to paragraphs which are not in the amendment but which are in the principal Act. I am, therefore, at a loss. Paragraph (1B) states that the &ldquo;Commission shall not investigate a complaint by a person other than a member or a person referred to in paragraph (<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>) of section 22(4) if it considers the complaint to be frivolous or vexatious.&rdquo; It is possible to interpret that paragraph as meaning only a vexatious complaint made by &ldquo;a person other than a member or a person referred to in paragraph (<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>)&rdquo;. It leaves open the possibility of a frivolous or vexatious complaint being made by persons other than &ldquo;a person other than a member or a person referred to in paragraph (<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>)&rdquo;. I find the language extremely confusing. I hope the Minister of State can clarify what this paragraph means.</P>

Any of us who have had the misfortune to talk to the people who parade outside this House will realise that a large number of people have a conviction of the level of conspiracy that is taking place against them as individuals and they will submit enough documentation to the commission to keep it going for the next five years, if it does not quickly realise that many of these complaints are frivolous.

      <P>How extensive is the preservation of the anonymity of the person making a complaint? How widely used is that in other investigations? As far as I am aware it is not possible to make a complaint through a tribunal of inquiry without the identity of the person making the complaint being known, but in this case there is no obligation on the part of the commission, though it may do so if it wishes, or a committee to tell a person who is making the complaint about them. Is that a common practice? I do not know that it is. I know it is not the practice in tribunals of inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one point before I answer the Senator directly. He will be aware that in the context of this Bill I do not intend to accept anonymous complaints, which is welcomed by everybody. Certain special circumstances may arise, but by and large that is the case. That is something we all want because many accusations made in writing are anonymous and if people are not accountable for making the complaint in the first place, the complaint should not be treated seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue the Senator raised with regard to protecting the identity of the person concerned is a good one. It is not a general provision but it is one we have included in the Bill. The Bill does not refer only to politicians. It refers to the structure within the public service and one can think of many examples where it might be difficult for a person to make a complaint about somebody. They could be working close to the person, he or she could be their immediate boss etc. and they might feel some serious wrongdoing had occurred. In the context of the procedures involved, the protection of the complainant's identity is important. In conjunction with the legislation my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is preparing the whistleblower's charter &ndash; we are trying to protect people where necessary. There are instances in which it would be important that the identity is not known, yet it is not an anonymous complaint. If needs be, the <Col N="1046" /> identity of the person who made the complaint can be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily. I do not dispute the principle outlined by the Minister of State. Some circumstances may arise although we have not allowed that privilege to anybody who wished to make a complaint to any of the tribunals of inquiry. A considerable number of the people who made those complaints might feel vulnerable or at risk. Employees of certain builders who shall be nameless and associates of certain politicians who shall be nameless were not and could not be given any assurance that their identities would be withheld, even temporarily. It is far too late in the session to deal with it now, but it would have been better to include a statement of principle to the effect that the identity of a complainant would be made known but that exceptional circumstances could arise, rather than the situation where the commission considers it appropriate to do so.</P>
      <P>The section states: &ldquo;. it may restrict the disclosure of such identity to those to whom knowledge of it is necessary or expedient for the purposes or by reason of the investigation .&rdquo; That is giving considerable latitude without proper guidelines and I suspect, although I may be wrong, that it might result in trouble in the courts. I am sure the Attorney General has said it is appropriate, but I have had many disagreements with the Attorney General and believe he is wrong about many matters, so I do not have a problem in thinking he might be wrong about this also. I would have preferred a statement of principle that the identity would be a matter of record, particularly in regard to the person about whom the complaint is being made.</P>

      <P>I want to come back to what the Minister of State said earlier about the awarding of costs. A considerable amount of the litigation in which the State is sued results in the awarding of costs, in many cases against the complainant. In many of those cases, however, the complainant turns out to have only a basic income and to own no property. There is not a remote possibility, therefore, in any decent society of ever recouping the costs because the complainant would be totally impoverished, destitute and homeless. In most cases the State does not seek to recoup costs. Many of the professional complainers I know are in the category of people who are on limited incomes and I wonder if we are leaving the issue of costs too open. I do not want to revisit Senator Doyle's amendment but an issue arises in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Senator is correct. Legislation introduced in recent years, including this Bill, places a heavy burden on Members. We would all be happy if this was unnecessary, but the world in which we live is different from that of the past. The public expects us to put in place, in an open and transparent manner, systems which ensure all Members are honest and act with integrity in carrying out their duties. Codes of conduct and practice are set down to ensure Members, and public servants, have guidelines which they must follow.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is correct. The various forms which Members have to fill out tend to come on different dates, require one to go to different places at different times and so on. The Bill provides for a streamlining of this process whereby separate forms will issue together, be filled in at the same time and returned to the same place. This will significantly simplify matters. This issue was raised in the Dáil and I thought it wise and fair to introduce such a provision. We have moved to reduce the burden somewhat.</P>

      <P>(<i>a</i>) a person who gives evidence before a Committee or the Commission or to a person for the purposes of an examination by him or her pursuant to subsection (4A) of that section shall not be entitled to refuse to answer any question put to him or her, and</P>

      <P>I raise this matter in a reasonably bland manner. The Information Commissioner complains he is under-resourced and cannot deal with matters within the desired timeframe. The Ombudsman, who is the same person, makes a similar point. How will we be guaranteed that the Revenue authorities or the Paymaster General will have the resources to provide the necessary certification within the allotted timeframe?</P>
      <P>There is no ring-fencing or staffing to ensure this will be done. It is a very serious obligation and a correct one with which I have no dispute.

Only those of us who are regarded as being in suspect professions are required to do so with some diligence.</P>
      <P>It would have been useful to insert in the Bill an obligation on the various statutory bodies to do this within the required timeframe. How are we to ensure that this occurs?

      <P>Among other things, section 29 deals with commencement but it is a strange form of commencement and quite unusual in my fairly extensive, but patchy, memory of legislation. It states that &ldquo;subject to paragraph (<i>b</i>) the Act shall not come into operation until such day as the Government appoints by order.&rdquo; That wording is fine because it is standard, but paragraph (<i>b</i>) states that &ldquo;paragraph (<i>a</i>) does not apply to this Act in so far as it applies to either House, or Members, or the Clerk of either House, or committees, or other Members&rdquo;. It is, therefore, only with the approval of the Houses that the rest of it can come into operation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why this is necessary? I would have thought that this is the sort of legislation that could come into force on an appointed date, say a month or two after enactment.</P>

Now that we have put together a significant body of legislation to deal with ethics in the public sector, we could perhaps direct our attention to ethics in the business sector. The business sector has a long way to go before it emulates the standards now being set in the public sector. There is a level of murkiness, a lack of accountability and a lack transparency in the business sector which is wrong for shareholders, customers and society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, concerned that elderly people will have appropriate, responsive, accessible and high quality care and supports either at home or in extended care settings, such as nursing homes, calls on the Government immediately to introduce a comprehensive package of care supports, including an independent inspectorate of nursing homes, both private and public, an approved quality training programme for care assistants, and the creation of the office of ombudsman or advocate for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an díospóireacht seo. Is é mo thuairim go mbeidh an dá thaobh den Teach aontaithe maidir leis an bprionsabal gur chóir go mbeadh saol chomh sonasach agus is féidir ag sean daoine agus go gcabhródh an Rialtas agus an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha, Pobail agus Teaghlaigh chun an aidhm sin a cur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>This is a very important issue. I am concerned generally with the care of the elderly, but particularly with nursing home care and the problems arising from that. Everybody agrees that we should have the best possible care for our senior citizens and that care should in the first instance be in the home if at all possible. Every effort made by the Government and health boards should be to care for our senior citizens or disabled people in their homes for as long as possible. Therefore we should have properly paid home helps or carers if they are members of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant issue in County Louth is that it is not possible to get home helps or carers &ndash; for love certainly but maybe for money it would be possible. People are taking better-paid jobs in other sectors of the economy because the pay that home helps get to look after senior citizens who are ill is unacceptably low. Despite the fact that there has been a rise in income recently, there has also been an increase in taxation for these people. We should make every possible effort to have a career for carers. There should be a specific designated course in a third level institution so that people can become carers and be paid a <Col N="1054" /> proper salary. This would result in people remaining out of private or public long-term care.</P>
    <P>Older people have their rights. I commend the National Council for the Aged on its publications and its efforts to direct Government policy towards improving their care.</P>
    <P>There are specific issues relating to the investigation of public or private long-term care institutions for senior citizens. We do not have a uniform inspectorate to deal with the inspection of such institutions. At present each health board designates in most cases a director of public health, a doctor, a public health nurse or an environmental health officer to carry out these inspections. They are obliged in law to have these inspections twice per annum but in many health board areas they do not have the staff to provide the minimum number of inspections. In many cases they are only inspected once if at all.</P>
    <P>There is no uniformity of form, applied formula or standards. The regulations are ambiguous and there is no clarity for instance in the number of people who should be on duty at any one time. One registered nurse is required to be on duty at all times, but there is no definitive ratio of registered nurses to patients. While the number of nursing homes is falling, the existing nursing homes are getting bigger and for new buildings I believe that a 60 bed unit is the minimum that is economically viable.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to immediately apply its mind to this issue. There should be an inspectorate separate from the health boards and from every other organisation, which would be fully qualified, resourced and staffed. There should be a national inspectorate for all our long-term institutions, be they private nursing homes or public long-term care units for the elderly. Having uniformity of inspection is a first step.</P>
    <P>At the moment many of the inspections take place between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. We need a much more rigorous inspection system, particularly at night-time. Senators might find it hard to believe that there is a nursing home in the North Eastern Health Board region that gets its patients up at 5.30 a.m., but it is true. The reason they are out of bed at that hour is that there are several high dependent patients there and there is inadequate staff to go in at 8 o'clock to get them dressed and ready for breakfast. This is where a rigorous independent inspectorate would make a significant difference.</P>
    <P>If a nursing home patient or the family of a patient have a complaint what do they do? In many cases they are fearful because nursing home places are so valued and rare that the presence of a complaint could result in the permanent absence of the client. There is no proper system to ensure that complaints go through proper channels to be investigated. We need an independent ombudsman for senior citizens in long-term care, as they have in the United States. The office of the ombudsman for senior citizens looks after all complaints, visits those people who are making the complaint in the institutions and talks to <Col N="1055" /> the family. There is a proper structure and a proper dialogue between the person who is complaining and the nursing home. This results in a fair, adequate and organised complaints system with no downside to it, particularly for the client who is complaining.</P>
    <P>In America private nursing home care is taken much more seriously than here. In particular the inspectorate has powers to impose immediate<i> per diem</i> fines on the occasion of the visit if there are serious breaches of the regulations. There is a policy in America of fining homes that are in breach of regulation &ndash; there is no such policy here because the health boards have neither the resources nor the determination to pursue these people through the courts. They are probably fearful that these nursing homes would be put out of business and they try to effect improvements by making repeated complaints rather than going in and putting the very bad nursing homes &ndash; there are significant numbers of them &ndash; under the scrutiny of the law and the local court.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I acknowledge that there is a tremendous number of professional people providing first class care in the private sector. However, we must put out of business those nursing homes that are abusing patients and are negligent towards them. I am in the course of preparing documentation for the Minister, which will identify through the health board investigating report system the very bad nursing homes. A number of them are on appeal to the Information Commissioner. I have a bundle of them here, which I received just before I came into the House and which unfortunately I have not yet had time to read.</P>
    <P>This area needs significant attention by the Government. We cannot continue to ignore the plight of senior citizens in our institutions. Some of the things happening in our nursing homes are disgraceful. For instance there is one home in the south where a meal for 30 people consisted of 13 pieces of small portioned and unsavoury fish. How is that for a meal? The report says of a nursing home in the north-west: &ldquo;The smell of sewage permeated the air as I entered the nursing home&rdquo;, and nobody could find out where the septic tank was leaking and why that was so. In a nursing home in the north-east the report reads: &ldquo;When I went in to see the patient in the room, the headboard was broken, the linen was soiled, the place was just literally in bits.&rdquo; That is shameful and unacceptable. Obviously, I have looked at the adverse reports, not the good ones. The majority of them are excellent, but the ones that are bad need to be put out of business and I hope the Minister will confirm that tonight.</P>
    <P>We must ensure uniformity of standards in our nursing homes in measurable terms across all areas in all long-term sty facilities, public, voluntary and private. The difficulty is that the Nursing Homes Act has not been revisited for a number of years. It was introduced in about 1994 and the regulations need to be upgraded. We need to be <Col N="1056" /> much more scientific in the measurement of needs.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in nursing homes is that the person most involved with the patient is the care assistant because the one SRN there is quite often the manager and the administrator. Care assistants in nursing homes need a proper career structure. There are two colleges which have excellent courses and the Minister is in a position to insist that all care assistants in nursing homes be trained and have a specific qualification from a PLC or a regional college. That would create uniformity of standards.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of care assistants are excellent but they are not well paid and many are over-worked and cannot keep up with the demands on their time. There is an absence of qualified staff, of care assistants and there are not enough people to manage institutions that care for our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>By putting all of these issues under the microscope, as we are doing tonight, we can decide that the care of the elderly is to be the prime interest of the Department and the Minister. I look forward to the Minister of State's response. A significant and clear plan for progress should be put in place.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the assistance of the Irish Nursing Home Association, public health doctors and of all those to whom I spoke who are involved in this area. All of them said it needs more attention, investment and, most of all, action from the Minister of State and his Department. This resolution is about ensuring our elderly have an appropriate, responsive, accessible and high quality care. I will return to this when I conclude this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion. I commend Senator O'Dowd for the research he has put into his motion and his deep knowledge of it, particularly of carers and care of the elderly in nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Anyone with sensibilities would recognise that the need to care for the elderly is justified on many grounds. It is justified on the grounds of the contribution they have made to the country and its standing today as well as on the simple grounds of humanity and the right to quality of life. That can only happen in an atmosphere of generosity, hospitality and genuine care. One can talk about nursing being a job to some and a profession to others, but the care of the elderly is in the hands of those who have a vocational, committed interest in ensuring the elderly finish their years in a quality environment. The only way for that to happen is to ensure the surroundings, quality of food and treatment of them is such that it reflects their contribution over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to invest and we always say that throwing money at something will repair everything. That is not necessarily so, but in this case the simple things mentioned by Senator O'Dowd, such as the quality of inspectors and standards, funding would go a long way towards ensuring <Col N="1057" /> that people in nursing homes receive proper care and attention. I ask the Minister of State to take into account the points raised and the fact that there should be a charter of rights for the elderly. If one reflects on one's future, one wants to know care will be provided properly if needed. One does not want to fear the future but wants a quality of life to the very end. That quality is not guaranteed today.</P>
    <P>This motion is put down with the interests of the elderly at heart and in the interests of those who genuinely care about what they are doing. It is not an occupation. One does not open a building, throw people into it and treat them as one would machines to be manufactured. The only thing to do is to agree standards.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Dowd stated, one never hears a complaint about the majority of nursing homes. However, the standards of some are so bad that they should be closed down. Tonight's appeal is to set standards below which nothing should drop. An ombudsman should be appointed and the finance should be provided to ensure standards are maintained. The cost would not be excessive. I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the commitment of the Government to the provision of comprehensive care for older people both in the community and residential setting as evidenced by the provision of significant additional resources since 1997, and notes the Government's intention to continue to develop services to meet the needs of this valued section of our population.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffat. He is a man wholly committed to the care of the aged as he has demonstrated by ensuring the availability of moneys to the many health boards for the improvements to facilities that were sought for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have first-hand knowledge of the Midland Health Board. Having been on visiting committees I recognise the points made by Senator O'Dowd relating to private nursing homes. The vast majority of people are in State-owned nursing units and I remember matrons and administrators pleading with our committees not many years ago for some few shillings to provide paint or panes of glass. That has changed. Many new long-stay units have been provided over the last few years. A number are currently at the planning stage and we hope to have them in place for the proper care of our elderly in the very near future. A vast amount of money has been spent on the refurbishment of long-stay units and patient care is taking place in a better environment as a result. On many visits we discovered wind blowing through those units but now the windows have <Col N="1058" /> been replaced, there is double-glazing and they are warm and comfortable.</P>
    <P>It is a credit to the Government and the health boards that moneys were wisely spent to ensure comfort for the patients. Quality beds have been provided for those in long-stay institutions, some of whom are bed-ridden, and there are rotating beds which give some quality of life to patients. That must be recognised.</P>
    <P>In the Midland Health Board region many developments have taken place in County Laois at Mountmellick, Abbeyleix and Shean. The development of Shean afforded many elderly patients the opportunity to get out of St. Fintan's psychiatric unit. They are now in a quality unit and I commend the Minister of State for that development. Money was also well spent in the provision of lifts in those hospitals to ensure patients were not confined to the top storey until the undertaker took them out. Now they can go outside in their wheelchairs on fine days.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the benefit of community housing for the elderly. There have been a number of developments in my county and construction of a new care unit in Birr is due to start soon. I compliment the staff who have worked in difficult circumstances in the old units. At last they are seeing money wisely spent on new modern units. We should also commend the friends of the institutions and hospitals who have raised so many funds to provide for the special needs of the patients. Their contribution must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Patients now have the opportunity to participate in arts, crafts and other activities. Day care centres for the elderly are being developed throughout the country. At these centres services such as physiotherapy and chiropody are provided, while ladies can take advantage of the hairdressing services. The Government has also made money available to retirement groups where people get together once a week or so and have a game of bingo or whatever. That is part of caring for the elderly. This is backed up by money made available to the health boards from both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise the contribution of the local authorities in caring for the elderly. A number of years ago they took the decision to provide houses for the elderly. The houses are specially designed with ramps, wider door frames and so forth to be adaptable and facilitate access both for the able and the disabled. The local authorities deserve our compliments on that policy.</P>
    <P>There have also been huge increases in the number of nursing staff, district nurses, carers and home helps and in the amount of funding provided for these services. There is never enough funding but there have been vast improvements in recent years. The Minister has increased substantially the number employed, both full-time and part-time, in the care of the elderly. Government spending has increased enormously. I recall being a member of the health board when it had <Col N="1059" /> just £10 million to spend in this sector. Now spending over a three year term is between £55 million and £60 million. That is a huge increase.</P>
    <P>The winter initiative was also of great benefit. It ensured many elderly people were taken care of over the winter in care units and hospitals. The Minister has ensured all elderly people over the age of 70 years will have the medical card, irrespective of their means. That must be acknowledged as a major benefit. In future, all elderly people will be able to call the doctor when they do not feel well and the cost will be covered by the medical card.</P>
    <P>There was a comment about inspections of private nursing homes. I agree something should be done in that regard but the best inspectors are the families of the patients in the institutions. If they see things are not right, they will ensure their elderly relatives are cared for elsewhere. However, that issue must be examined. We must also acknowledge the great work of our general practitioners and district nurses. Our main aim must be that the elderly live with dignity and proper care. I commend the Minister's work in this area to date and the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and appreciate Senator O'Dowd's concern for people of a certain age who need care. It is a broad issue but I am anxious to bring a number of matters to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>In earlier times, when there were larger families, this issue did not arise often. People who had to go into homes tended to go into the county home and, in some cases, it was almost considered a disgrace on the family that their parent ended up there. That is not to say that the work of the staff in the county homes was not good. However, society has shifted so much, particularly with regard to family numbers, that it is reasonable to expect that the private and public nursing home system will continue to grow. In most families there will probably be only two children and it is likely that both will live outside their own county and possibly outside the country.</P>
      <P>I can speak about the caring systems in place previously in Dublin. The housing accommodation in the old tenements was deplorable but there was always community care in them, whether it was for somebody having a baby or where there was a death in the family. In particular, the elderly were cared for. There was never a shortage of neighbours to look in on them. It was easy when there were up to 15 families in one big house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has changed drastically. I will always acknowledge the excellence of many of the private nursing homes and the fact that they have tried to police their institutions. They have done a great deal on their own initiative for which they deserve to be commended. However, having seen some of the private nursing homes in my health board area, I would prefer to go to a public <Col N="1060" /> home. In the health board nursing homes in the greater Dublin area the standard of food, which might appear to be a small consideration, is excellent. The homes also provide reminiscence therapy and physiotherapy and people are not rigorously ordered around. They are not woken up at 6 a.m., do not have breakfast forced upon them at 7 a.m., dinner provided at 12 midday and tea at 4 p.m. after which they are not supposed to exist but to be in bed and under control.</P>
    <P>It is hard for anybody with a conscience to see the plight of some of our elderly. I only give bouquets where they are deserved. I have intimate knowledge of this matter, having had an elderly parent in a nursing home. I must emphasise I am not speaking about that home. I have visited other nursing homes. If a person's brain is functioning but their limbs are not good, it is awful to have one's day controlled with regard to where one can go and what one can do.</P>
    <P>I have been in nursing homes which did not have a garden even though there were up to 30 people in the home. There was no place where one could sit on a bench or be wheeled to a bench to enjoy a sunny day. Is that quality of life? It is mostly women who I am referring to as they outlive men. You might see two men and 14 women sitting in a day room. &ldquo;Grimsville&rdquo; is not the word for it. It is appalling. There are no activities other than the &ldquo;telly.&rdquo; Mealtime is longed for as it brings a diversion.</P>
    <P>Some of these people's brains are extremely active, yet they have no interaction with local communities. There was a system in place in my area where young people in transition year came to nursing homes as visitors. That is a good idea but as these students must then do their leaving certificate exams in the following years, they drop away. In this year of the volunteer, the lack of volunteers is striking. This is because people's lives are too busy.</P>
    <P>How can people say that they are caring for the elderly if they take the subvention and the remuneration available and provide only the cheapest food? I know of elderly patients who are not able to get about by themselves. They are taken out of bed in the morning and put in a control-chair with a bar at the front. I have seen people left in these control-chairs from the time they get up in the morning until they are put to bed at night. There are cries for help coming from those who cannot cry anymore.</P>
    <P>This situation has grown particularly in the past ten years and it is not about to go away. The Government proposal to give help to families to care for elderly relatives is a good one but, unfortunately, we need an inspectorate. There could not be a sane inspector who has seen the places I am describing without being shocked. I am not alone in my criticism of those who are in the care business for &ldquo;grab and greed.&rdquo; These people are only too happy when someone is dispatched as they will then have a chance to get another patient in who might pay more. It sounds terrible but I know that type of predator is alive and well, and <Col N="1061" /> is giving a bad name to the many dedicated people caring for the elderly with wonderful facilities.</P>
    <P>We are all great at platitudes. We can all wish everybody well. Santa will come to the nursing home at Christmas and give a present to each patient. However, Santa only comes once a year. The number of people who abandon their relatives and never visit even once is striking. It is pathetic and a slur on some families that they dump their relatives and never hear about them. Yet, they cry at the funeral, which is usual.</P>
    <P>We should encourage, through the schools, education on the needs of the elderly. Elderly people are flung together in these homes and there is nothing to divert their minds. They must sit &ldquo;waiting for Godot.&rdquo; The Minister should give us hope by outlining how he intends to make life better for the elderly. Irish people have ambivalent ideas. Everyone will rush to protect a helpless baby, but an elderly person is equally helpless. Because the elderly are less cuddly, people do not care.</P>
    <P>We have the most uncharitable and uncaring society with regard to the aged. I heard a foreigner recently describe Ireland as the place where they put people into homes when they get old. &ldquo;Home&rdquo; is a misnomer. It is a kind of baby-sitting in reverse. I appreciate that where somebody is in need of constant medical attention, the family cannot care for them. However, if the person is just a little slow or suffering some memory loss, they should not be abandoned. Why can we not treasure our aged as other people do?</P>
    <P>I want to see more realistic home help provided. I visited an elderly couple recently when their home help was present and she was a joy and a delight to the couple. She is the couple's messenger to the outside world, but she only visits three days per week. Even if we only achieved some of the objectives in tonight's motion, we would have achieved much with regard to inspection. Public utilities should be inspected also. The Minister is a kind and compassionate man but talking compassion is not good enough, making it happen is in his hands.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Government on health services for older people is as outlined in the report, The Years Ahead, first published in 1988 and reaffirmed in the Review of The Years Ahead, published in 1997. This policy is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home those older people who have been ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; to provide high quality hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The anticipated change in demographics in the period 1996-2011 has, and will continue to have, significant implications for service planners, service providers and all in government, whether at local or national level. The changing health and social needs of older people present a major challenge to society. The longer that older people remain in good health and disability free, the better will be their quality of life and the greater their contribution to society. Ageing is a normal dynamic process, it is not a disease. While ageing is inevitable and irreversible, the chronic disabling conditions that often accompany it can be prevented or delayed, not only by medical interventions but also by social, economic and environmental policies. These policies need to be informed by a wider, more positive view of old age.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office in 1997, the Government has allocated significant resources to services for older people, particularly health services, in an attempt to deal with this change and the resulting issues which will emerge. Additional funding for the development of health services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, while in 2001 an additional £57.42 million will be provided. This has resulted in approximately 880 posts approved to services for older people between 1997 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, over 400 additional beds have been provided in ten new community nursing units and over 1,000 day places per week have been provided in ten new day care centres.</P>
    <P>A total of £2 billion has been made available by the Government for investment in the health services under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This represents a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven-year period. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service. There is a commitment from the Government to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-hospital sector so that the £2 billion is divided equally between the acute hospital and non-acute sectors.</P>
    <P>In the case of services for older people, it is proposed to provide for a greatly improved physical environment to ensure a high quality and client-centred service. Approximately £200 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. A broad range of facilities will either be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result, including assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, day care centres and services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there are specialised areas which require particular attention, including the provision of assessment and rehabilitation units and day hospitals, extended care units and, in particular, the development and enhancement <Col N="1063" /> of community based services. The latter include the provision of day care centres, the promotion of home help services, home care teams and paramedical supports, which are essential to facilitate an older person remaining in their home and familiar surroundings.</P>
    <P>Together with considerable investment in health board facilities and the area of community care, substantial additional resources have also been made available for the nursing home subvention scheme. As Members will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, under which subvention regulations were made, has two principal objectives: first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and, second, to provide for a new system of nursing home subvention in order that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available from the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority indicate that there are currently 8,001 people receiving the benefit of the subvention scheme, either through the provision of a basic subvention, enhanced subvention or contract bed. It is also worth noting that in the first full year of operation, the funding allocated for the nursing home subvention scheme was £12 million. This year the funding available for the scheme is £52 million, more that four times the original allocation.</P>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme was published recently. It deals with the role of the Department of Health and Children in making regulations and overseeing the introduction of the scheme and examines the administration of the scheme by the health boards since its inception in 1993. Certain articles in the nursing home subvention regulations were the subject of critical comment, namely, article 8.2, the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; provision, and articles 9.1 and 9.2, which allowed for the income of adult sons and/or daughters to be assessed when determining the level of subvention to be paid. The immediate priority of the Department of Health and Children is to ensure the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. In this regard, I will outline the action taken to date.</P>
    <P>Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 to six of the health boards where the regulations were applied incorrectly to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of article 8.2 arrears. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result <Col N="1064" /> of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996. These regulations, signed in July 1996, increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and daughters of an applicant for subvention. The funding was intended to address both problems and meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally. My Department has been informed by the health boards concerned that the funding provided was also used to cover arrears payments under article 8.2, the payment of enhanced subventions and expenditure shortfalls arising from increasing demands under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand a proportion of the allocation was used by three of the health boards to fund other services for older people, including the provision of aids and appliances, improved home help services and the opening of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm. While this money was not expended on the subvention scheme, I am assured it was used by the relevant health boards for the benefit of older people. Nonetheless, when my Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears, it took the matter up with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue it. The health boards have advised that, to date, approximately £1.5 million has been paid out in respect of article 8.2 arrears. It is not possible at this stage to provide a figure for the total cost of article 8.2 arrears payments as a number of boards have not as yet completed the process of calculating the amounts due. However, my Department is continuing to pursue this matter with the health boards concerned to ensure every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As Members will be aware, articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. A review of the operation of the subvention scheme was carried out in 1995, following which an amendment was made to the Schedule which provided that, in calculating the income of sons and daughters, health boards were to disregard income tax, rent, mortgage repayments and certain other outgoings. This Schedule increased the personal allowances applied by designated officers of the health board when assessing the circumstances of adult sons and daughters of an applicant for subvention. The subvention regulations were further amended from 1 January 1999 and the provision to assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent was deleted.</P>
    <P>The amendment to which I refer was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community <Col N="1065" /> and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and/or daughters of applicants. Nonetheless, I am concerned that the issue of making payments to those adversely affected by this regulation remains. However, it is important to state that legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicates there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nonetheless, in the interests of fairness and natural justice, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in government agree with this view. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as Members will appreciate, and bearing in mind that since the scheme's introduction, approximately 35,000 applications for subvention have been received, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and may take some time to complete. It is, nonetheless, expected that payments will begin this month and I offer assurances that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>An issue that has been raised in this debate is that of inspection procedures for extended care facilities. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in private nursing homes in respect of adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Many Members, including Senator O'Dowd, highlighted the need to investigate the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the standards which apply in respect of food preparation and provision. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years and a health board may impose conditions in relation to registration. These regulations provide for periodic inspections by health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of those regulations.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations provide that the registered proprietor and any member of staff shall permit designated officers to enter and inspect the nursing home, to examine records kept by it, conduct interviews with persons, including staff, and examine any dependent person there, where the officer has reasonable cause to believe that a person in a nursing home is not, or has not been, receiving proper care. During such inspections, any shortcomings should be brought to the attention of the proprietor and the person in charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Homes are duly monitored to ensure compliance with the regulations. There is no limit on the number of times an inspection may be conducted and the boards may visit at more frequent intervals where this is felt necessary. In order to obtain a rounded and comprehensive view of a nursing home and the standard of care, it will be inspected by professionals of various disciplines, such as a public health nurse, medical officer and environmental health officer. An inspection involves a systematic review of facilities, services and care to ensure continuing compliance with the statutory requirements and the conditions for registration.</P>
    <P>There is concern that while there is provision, as outlined above, under the nursing home legislation for monitoring standards in private nursing homes, no similar arrangements are in place for health board facilities, an issue both I and my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, will rectify. As Members will be aware, the social services inspectorate has the authority to monitor standards in children's residential centres and is operating effectively. It is intended to expand its role to cover extended care facilities for older people. It will also extend its remit to residential services for children with disabilities arising from the provisions of the Children Bill, 1999, which is shortly to be enacted. Given the heavy demands on the inspectorate in monitoring standards in the child care area, additional resources are required to enable it to take on this additional function. Proposals in regard to services for older people will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In 1999, I established a working group which is currently preparing guidance and training materials in relation to elder abuse, including abuse in institutional settings, following publication of the report, Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: an Exploratory Study by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. The group's terms of reference are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse, and to make recommendations on matters including, <i>inter alia</i>, on definitions, terminology, identification, screening procedures, and assessment protocols and procedures. The group consists of representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, and other organisations representing the interests of older people as well as a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist and a general practitioner. It has drafted a comprehensive two year work programme which involves, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes, preparation of evaluation reports, and will present a final report to me. I have provided resources to ensure that the work is completed within the envisaged timeframe. The report will be completed following the testing of draft policies, procedures and guidelines in pilot projects. <Col N="1067" /> Training programmes will be provided to staff members and ongoing evaluation will take place. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess whether the draft policies, procedures and guidelines in the identification, assessment and management of elder abuse are appropriately designed and effective in the two health boards areas. The report is expected to be completed by the end of 2001, when the evaluated results of the pilot projects are available.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme undertaken by my Department, in association with the Department of Finance, was recently completed. Proposals will be brought to Government on whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure over the years to recognise the contribution of carers to the maintenance of the health and well-being of dependent family members and friends. Support to carers is widely recognised as inadequate. As Minister of State, Deputy and general practitioner, I am well aware of carers' invaluable role in supporting and maintaining dependent relatives or friends. Caring can be at great expense to the carer and many feel isolated, alone and taken for granted by society. The role of and the cost to the carer is only being acknowledged in recent years. I am glad to say that efforts are now being made to address this issue. From talking to carers and meeting with organisations representing them, I know that recognition of their role is important to them. The failure over the years to provide this recognition, with inadequate support services, has been a major deficit in our provisions. That situation is changing. Initiatives have been taken, particularly in the past two years, to address their needs.</P>
    <P>In the last three years, my Department provided an additional £4 million to the health boards for the support of carers. This is used by them to fund carer support groups, provide training to carers and support carers through, for example, the employment of liaison officers and the provision of respite breaks. The funding is used to support home care services. Funding has also been provided for the provision of items such as walking sticks and frames, wheelchairs, commodes, bed rests, special beds with hoists, stair rails and other vital appliances for an older person to remain at home and maintain their independence.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, oversees many improvements in the carer's allowance scheme. An overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and published in October 1998. Following a detailed examination of the review, measures were introduced in the <Col N="1068" /> 1999 and 2000 budgets to improve and develop the position of carers, including the extension of free schemes. As is evident from this, the Government is committed to improving the needs of carers. It will be clear to the House that this Government places a high value on the contribution which older people made and continue to make to our society. It is the Government's aim to ensure that as many as possible of our senior citizens live an independent life for as long as possible, and that the necessary supports are in place to achieve this. We are also committed to providing the necessary level of care, at home or in residential accommodation, for older people who need such services. The additional funding provided by the Government, since it came to office in 1997, is proof of our commitment to older people, a commitment that will not waver in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Government cannot accept the Fine Gael motion and commends instead the amended motion. I thank the Opposition Members, especially Senator O'Dowd, who took the time to investigate the plight of the elderly. It is said that our care should be the best in the world. We examine care around the world and think that our standard of care is generally good. There are exceptions in some nursing homes but we welcome the bringing to our attention of any defaulters which Senators may have discovered.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done and we will still depend on family and community. All the investigations that have been done show that home is the best location for the elderly. It is up to us to provide better community care. We have problems getting physiotherapists and speech and occupational therapists but we have increased the numbers in training and will continue in that vein. Overall we have increased the moneys going to the care of the elderly. Money alone will not solve all the problems and we still depend on the family, community and voluntary organisations to play a part. I did not mention transport which is another particular problem for the elderly. There are numerous problems but overall, despite what we might see on the Internet about the great care service in America, I would rather be an older person in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems in debating in this House, particularly with the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, is that when one has such a likeable personality it is difficult and makes one appear churlish to say anything which could be remarked upon as of a political nature. I do not want to excessively politicise this motion but there are a few issues in his script I will mention. It is a pity to see such a fine Minister reading what is in some cases Civil Service gobbledegook. He adverted at some length to the Ombudsman's report, yet he did not say that the Department of Health and Children was sorry for the mess it had created. The Ombudsman said that it had obfuscated, delayed, ignored advice from the Attorney <Col N="1069" /> General, misled people and colluded with health boards to mislead people for budgetary reasons.</P>
      <P>It would have been good to hear the Minister say that was wrong and that it should never have happened and would never happen again. A Department should not attempt to subvert the Ombudsman by taking up to a year to answer a letter looking for information. The fundamental problem that will continue to bedevil us occurs when our institutions regard people like the Ombudsman or inspectors etc. as intrusions on their patch rather than the providers of systems that make for quality care provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the Government was advised by the Attorney General that there was no legal obligation to make retrospective payments, but in fairness and out of consideration for natural justice it was decided to do so. Natural justice is a constitutional obligation more fundamental than a legal obligation. It is an exercise in hair-splitting to suggest there was no legal obligation when one recognises that natural justice demands it. Natural justice is a constitutional obligation which would ultimately have arisen because of all the anomalies in the way the subvention scheme worked.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the difficulty of traceability for repayments to people who were improperly, if not illegally, charged. It is not the people who are difficult to trace who are out there waiting for the money but the people who know they paid it and have told the health boards and the Department. These are just bureaucratic excuses. Of course there are traceability difficulties with 35,000 people but large numbers of them are known to the Department and the health boards. Some may be more difficult to trace. Judging by the Ombudsman's report, some of the people had their means assessed by health board officials taking a figure between one and 500 from the air. These people may be difficult to trace because the health boards never even knew who they were. There are thousands of people waiting who are well known to health boards and individuals within the boards. The reason they are not being paid is bureaucratic inertia, and saying that there are difficult issues of traceability is no more than a red herring.</P>
      <P>I now come back to the issue&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this issue very seriously because, among other reasons, on 6 August I technically qualify as an older person, as 55 is regarded as the threshold by most of the caring bodies. We should not romanticise the old days too much. They were the days of mass emigration. The romantic vision of children caring for the parent may be well written in literature but it did not happen in Ireland because most of the children were gone, particularly in rural Ireland. It must have been the most horrendous existence for elderly parents in Ireland in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s when everybody was gone <Col N="1070" /> and old people were left on their own. The old idea of the caring community and children living near their parents has not existed in this country since the tradition of emigration developed 70 or 80 years ago, and we should not romanticise it.</P>
      <P>The area of rural Ireland I know best is the area of the west Kerry Gaeltacht. There were many lovely old people there 25 years ago and each one of them was excruciatingly lonely. They had a wonderful community of their own age group but there were no children, no young people and no families. It was not a romantic, wonderful, caring existence. The prosperity that has produced some problems is the prosperity that has made many young people willing and able because they now have the resources, the mobility, the transport and the money to care more for their parents. They worried about them from a distance of hundreds if not thousands of miles in the past. Now they try to do something and do it well, and it is up to society to knit in with that.</P>
      <P>What one finds when one goes knocking on doors during political campaigns is interesting. If one goes to the homes of people not that well off one hears about the health care services as far as it affects the individuals and their children but when one moves into more affluent areas one hears about the huge burden of caring for elderly people. It is not a burden that people want to off-load on to the State but they want to feel that the resources will be there to make sure that the burden of looking after one's parents will not leave them in a position of being financially stretched themselves in their old years.</P>
      <P>There is no cheap way of getting good public service. We as a society, no matter who is in government, have to get this sorted out. We cannot go on reducing taxation &ndash; I said this long before the ICTU said it this week &ndash; and at the same time promise to improve public services. No country in the world has done it. The countries in Europe that have the best public services have rates of taxation well in excess of ours. We must now make a choice. Tax cuts are something we can afford after we have provided good public services, not the other way round. If we want care for the elderly, a good health service and good public transport, it is time we accepted that we will have to pay a moderate to high level of taxation. There is no other route. We need the consensus that got us out of the crisis of the 1980s in order that we can develop the society that the affluence of the 1990s deserves. We must recognise that good public services do not come cheap, we have to pay for them while ensuring we introduce our plans efficiently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and support the amendment to the motion. The Government is committed to the provision of comprehensive care for older people, in the community and residential settings. Significant additional resources have been allocated since 1997 and the Government intends to continue to <Col N="1071" /> develop services to meet the needs of this valued section of the population. As far as I recall, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is the first to be given specific responsibility for the care of the elderly. The Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs are fulfilling their duties in this regard.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan's point that we tend to romanticise the hard times we had some years ago, particularly the conditions that prevailed in rural Ireland and other disadvantaged areas. Huge progress has been made and the elderly in rural communities are helped to remain in their homes. The ideal scenario for all concerned is to keep older people in their homes and help them to be as independent as possible. While I realise Senator O'Dowd's motion concentrates on nursing homes and other residential units, Government policy must continue to support the care of people in their own homes. As Senators have said, the population is ageing and we do not have enough carers and residential units for everybody. We should aim to keep older people as independent as possible by facilitating their care in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd said that it is difficult to get people to provide the valuable community service of home help. Many people, however, provide help voluntarily but only recently have they been paid £7 per hour, a decent wage considering the work they do. They might as well have been caring voluntarily up to now as they were not paid enough. We have to fund the provision of home help as it is an essential part of keeping people in their own homes. I welcome the additional funding allocated to train home carers, because capable and qualified people, willing to do the job properly, are needed. As Senator O'Dowd said in relation to residential units, there is nothing worse than being cared for by an incompetent carer.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is responsible for the housing aid for the elderly scheme, although it is not relevant to this debate. No matter how much money is allocated for this valuable scheme, it will not be enough. The most important thing for an elderly person is to have adequate food and heating and a level of comfort in his or her own home. The housing aid for the elderly scheme has been particularly effective since the Minister extended it to include central heating. The more money provided to help keep people in comfort at home, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to improve the standard of living of the elderly in recent years through the social welfare system. Everybody wants to be independent, but this is impossible if one is not financially independent. Life is made a little easier for people when they have money, whether they are physically able. As promised before we came into office, the Government has significantly increased old age pensions in recent years. We have extended the telephone rental allowance to everyone over 70 years, who will also receive free medical cards. Although these measures can be brushed aside as small, they are extremely important for those who fear they will be not be <Col N="1072" /> financially secure and thereby unable to manage in their own homes. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has made huge efforts, not only financially but also by providing security systems for older people. We should target our resources in such areas.</P>
    <P>If he is committed to keeping people in their own homes, I urge the Minister to look at the provision of social workers for the elderly. Many older people living in their own homes do not receive basic care, such as nourishment. Just as social workers are allocated to children in danger, we have to consider a system of social workers for our elderly community. We must look at new ways of helping those considered in need of extra care, or simply needing more care than can be provided at home. The system I have suggested would be beneficial as an extra support for those who look after the elderly in their homes, such as public health nurses and general practitioners. The commitment in the national development plan to further developing and extending community based services and supports, particularly day care centres and extra places in nursing units, is welcome. The most important thing for those caring for the elderly is that they get a rest as it keeps minds and bodies active. Older people are given a purpose in life if they can leave home for a short period on a couple of days each week. Social contact is important for those with limited mobility.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments in relation to the nursing homes inspectorate, especially that the social services inspectorate which looks after child residential units will be extended to units where the elderly are cared for. I agree with Senator O'Dowd that there are cases where inadequate care is given in nursing homes, such as physical or psychological mistreatment. It has to be said that the care provided in the vast majority of cases is excellent.</P>
    <P>The care provided by nurses often goes beyond the call of duty. There is a shortage of staff in many residential units for elderly people, although I realise there is a general shortage of labour. The nature of ageing means that we must provide more total nursing care. While I agree that proper training of care assistants is necessary and that more assistants are needed, the provision of more specifically trained nurses is equally important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as much has been said already. I support the Government amendment. The Minister of State said he places a high value on the contribution which old people have made and continue to make to our society. When the Government came to power in 1997, it dedicated £10 million towards the care of the elderly. That sum had increased to £36 million by last year while this year more than £54 million has been allocated. That indicates the Government's commitment and demonstrates that it recognises the value of the elderly to our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this issue does not always revolve around money but about quality of life, as the Minister of State acknowledged. While money may be pumped into services for the elderly, that <Col N="1073" /> does not necessarily improve their quality of life. I recognise there must be a shift from residential care to looking after the elderly in their own homes and communities. There should be a commitment by all sectors of society to ensure the necessary resources are provided so that a proper infrastructure will be in place for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed itself in the national development plan and in other fora to provide support services for the elderly to improve their quality of life in their own homes. We should try to make old people feel as independent as possible so that they feel they belong in our society. We have a role to ensure proper home care support systems are put in place and training is provided. The public must also be educated. All of us will be old some day and we will want our families to recognise our value to society and acknowledge that the elderly must be looked up to and cared for. When I am old I hope the infrastructure will be in place to support me and many others who may not have the means to support themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government has stated that it is committed to care for the elderly and, as the Minister of State said, much more needs to be done. Once the infrastructure is in place, it will be easy to make the system work. The Minister of State is a doctor and he has a feel for this area. This Government is the first to appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly and to ensure the proper infrastructure is in place so that support systems will be available to avoid a scenario in ten years where the elderly will have no one to care for them.</P>
    <P>The motion is worthwhile but Fine Gael must recognise the Government has put in place the structure to address comprehensively the care of the elderly and it has outlined where we are heading in this area. It must be acknowledged the Government has made an investment which previous Governments did not even attempt to make. The appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly is a clear indication of the Government's commitment. We will make sure that the elderly who made a significant contribution to our society as it evolved will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>While the Celtic tiger may be roaring, people's quality of life has suffered. The manner in which parents, teachers and young people are educated is important. It is not always about money but about quality of life, which is lacking. The Minister of State must examine how the quality of life of the elderly is improved in terms of the resources invested. Support services must be provided and there must be a shift from residential care to care in the home and community. That is the Government's aim. This area is a success story which must be endorsed and I know the Government will do so.</P>

      <P>I wish to outline a number of cases involving nursing homes which have appeared in recent reports. A report following an inspection of a nursing home in Dublin stated, &ldquo;The practice of nursing staff administering 'flu vaccine to patients without medical back-up and <Col N="1074" /> in the absence of emergency drugs is contrary to a safe practice&rdquo;. In another nursing home there was no doctor's signature for medications given to a named patient. A report on an inspection of the home carried out on 22 June 2000 stated:</P>
      <P>Another resident has not had his prescription renewed since November 1999. This resident is being physically restrained without a current authorisation from his GP. The previous authorisation is dated February 1998. We remain concerned about the welfare of this person and, again, we request that every effort be made to improve his quality of life. He remains isolated, room bound and physically restrained.</P>
      <P>The report stated in regard to another nursing home:</P>
      <P>However, there is still no register of chemical restraint use, although on a complete review of all drugs records, we found at least 12 residents were ordered PRN sedation, some in quite large dosages, leaving nursing staff with what we consider an excessive degree of discretion regarding the use of sedation.</P>
      <P>I want to help keep the elderly in their homes but the reality is that more and more older people will be cared for in nursing homes and, whether we like it, such homes must come under greater scrutiny. The Minister of State said he would prefer to be an old person in an Irish nursing home rather than in an American one. However, the difference is in America if an elderly person experiences difficulties the office of the ombudsman examines the home and a vigorous independent inspectorate has been established which visits nursing homes and fines them on the spot and, if necessary, takes over the running of the home. However, in Ireland very few nursing homes are prosecuted and a different climate of inspection is needed.</P>
      <P>I welcome much of the Minister of State's contribution and I acknowledge the work and efficiency of the social services inspectorate, particularly in regard to cases involving children. I am not worried about its title but the Minister of State must establish a dedicated, independent inspectorate to monitor care of the elderly. Perhaps he could establish a separate division within the social services inspectorate. However, it must be specialised and focus on the needs of the elderly &ndash; it is significant that the Minister of State referred to such an inspectorate in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The <i>Lancet</i> recently published a study on deaths in Ireland and Norway during the winter. Both countries have a similar population and while the number of deaths as a result of cardiovascular disease is approximately the same, in the age cohort of people over 65 a significantly higher number of people die in Ireland than in Norway because they have inadequate heating in their homes. While I welcome housing aid for the elderly, many people qualify for the disabled person's grant and they can obtain up to £16,000 to carry out works on their homes to adapt them to suit their medical conditions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> However, most senior citizens who suffer from long-term illness want heating in their homes. Changes must be made in the regulations covering the disabled person's grant to include all citizens over 65 years who are living alone. If they want to install central heating, they should receive the money to do so and that would have a significant effect on their health and the quality of their lives. It is important that this is done. In exceptional circumstances the health board makes a representation to the grants section of the Department in the Minister of State's home town, Ballina. Administratively, the system is too bureaucratic and is not efficient enough, and he should make an important intervention in this regard immediately. There is no reason not to do so as such a change could have a significant long-term impact as well as allowing elderly people to stay in their own homes.</P>
    <P>There is a potential disaster awaiting us regarding fire safety in nursing homes for the elderly. I have read many reports which have stated that fire inspections have not been carried out rigorously, if at all, and in many cases there are 12 months between each inspection. Often the fire report is not available to the inspector when he visits a home. There are many two and three storey nursing homes which cater for a significant number of highly dependent people using small <Col N="1076" /> cohorts of staff. In one home a nurse looks after approximately 76 patients and two care assistants help out at night. The number of inspections of these homes suggests that the danger of fire is not recognised.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Minister of State to fast-track this issue in the Department. I have every confidence in the Minister of State's ability to deliver a service, but the Government must be involved. The document, A Framework for Quality in Long-Term Residential Care for Older People in Ireland, published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, refers to the resources which are needed in this area. I acknowledge the Minister of State's recognition that resources are needed. The council believes that financing should be provided for a social insurance scheme that would guarantee social security in old age in the form of pensions and long-term care.</P>
    <P>The biggest issue facing the country is how we will pay for the long-term care because the number of people living to the age of 85 will double to almost three quarters of a million in ten years. The Government must look at a mechanism whereby people can pay for health insurance to cover their long-term care because that is where the need will be.</P>
