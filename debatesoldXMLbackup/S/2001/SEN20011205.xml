      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide the necessary funding for the construction of five buildings on the Bishopstown campus of the Cork Institute of Technology, where large numbers of students are currently housed in temporary or prefabricated buildings.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to detail the measures he proposes to take against a company based in north Dublin inner city, which has been convicted in the courts of the illegal dumping of waste and other breaches of its licence; and if he will further detail the measures he proposes to take against waste disposal companies that have engaged in illegal activities to prevent them from engaging in such activities in the future.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 22, motion 18, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business will be interrupted from 4 p.m. to 6 p. m. to allow Senators attend the budget debate in the other House. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 15 in the names of Senator Henry, Senator Costello and myself, be taken before No. 1. I am merely asking that the Bill be published. Surely that is not a matter for a Minister but for the House. It is a short, simple Bill and all we ask is that it be published.</P>
      <P>I raise the difficulties arising in coroner's courts. Much of the legislation is outdated. A case arose yesterday where apparently a very important witness will not attend the coroner's court and the only fine available is one of £5. This legislation needs to be looked at and coroners may well need stronger powers to oblige key witnesses to attend. I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come in to discuss this question in the next session. There are also other issues arising out of recent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years we have traditionally taken a very keen interest in developments in the Middle East and the matter has been raised here significantly and often. I raise with the Leader the possibility of asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in and deal with that issue on the basis of what Europe is going to do. There seems to be absolute silence from the European Union on this issue and on how it intends to influence it. The Middle East is within a step or two of all-out war, about which there is no doubt at this stage. It seems to be sitting in the lap of the US once again. Europe has a duty in that area. I will not push the issue further, but we need to be seen to take a view on this in the interests of peace and not take one side or the other.</P>
      <P>The second issue I raise may seem flippant but it is not intended to be. The date of the beginning of the leaving certificate next year clashes with Ireland's first match in the World Cup. In terms of recognising the interest young people take in sport and ensuring it is feasible for them to participate in what will be a great national day, arrangements should be made to ensure that leaving certificate examinations do not clash with matches in which Ireland is playing. I would like this issue to be raised with the Minister for Education and Science and I do not want it to be seen as flippant. As we all know, students take a huge interest in sport. They will follow those matches and they do not need a further distraction. It would be a great distraction were they to be in an examination hall while a match was going on. I ask that this matter be raised with the Minister. I may put it down as a matter on the Adjournment if the Minister is not prepared to deal with it directly with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Pensions (Amendment) Bill. We had a fairly wide-ranging discussion on it in this House and it seems to have run into the sand. Is there a difficulty with the Bill? Will the Leader <Col N="1103" /> tell us what that difficulty is and what is causing the delay? The Leader has given an indication that it will be taken on the first day of the next session. I would like his word that he is committed to taking it on the first day of the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Manning. I agree with Senator O'Toole that the Minister for Education and Science should look at the dates on which Ireland is playing and try to avoid holding examinations on those dates.</P>
      <P>Also, the Minister for Education and Science should come to the House to discuss the good news that we heard in the media that Ireland is close to the top of the league in terms of the educational attainment of our young students and teenagers. We have seen statistics from the OECD so often showing that our young people are close to the top of the league in respect of substance abuse and other bad things, it is great to see that, in terms of educational attainment, we are one of the top countries in Europe. However, that should be looked at in the context of the downside &ndash; the OECD report found that we are guilty of under-investment and that our students have had to work a lot harder than their European counterparts as a result. Because we have practically eliminated illiteracy among our present student cohort, we should attack the very substantial adult illiteracy problem which has been reflected in previous OECD reports.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole in calling for a debate on the Palestinian issue &ndash; a request that was also made yesterday. We are probably alone in the European Union in taking this issue seriously. The European Union does not seem to have any sense of urgency or sense of the enormity and impact on the world stage of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House so we can discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators O'Toole and Costello that the problem in the Middle East is very grave and merits immediate discussion by the House. It would be wrong to suggest that the European Union does not have a view on it. On yesterday's Order of Business, I said the European Union's view is that the Israeli response should be proportionate, that the Palestinian Authority should be maintained and that President Arafat should continue in office. The Minister for Foreign Affairs underlined that last night when he was speaking on national television. It would be useful if we could have the Minister here to clarify these issues and expand on them because we all share the grave concern that the conflict will spiral totally out of control, if it has not done so already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="ÜfcDr. Henry ÜfcDr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Manning and Costello for asking that my Bill be published. I am beginning to fear that the Leader's reluctance to publish it means the Bill being brought through this year will suffer the same fate as the Mental Health Bill of 1981, which was never implemented.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the cancer strategy? I hope Senators heard of the improved results of the treatment of cancer by specialised units. The national cancer strategy appears to have been badly derailed by local political considerations around the country. This is most unfair to patients. We need to discuss this urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, Deputy Treacy, to examine the issue of personal injury claims? At the moment, over 40% of the costs involved in personal injury claims are going towards legal fees. This does not seem right. I raised this issue after reading in the newspaper an account of a claim in Galway involving Supermac's. The case was withdrawn from the court minutes before it was due to be heard because the plaintive discovered there was a CCTV camera in the gentlemen's toilet. The camera caught a particular person splashing water from the hand basin on to the floor and then throwing himself down. He had two friends with him and they were practising this for a while. Eventually this person threw himself down and remained on the floor. An ambulance had to be called as he pretended to be unconscious. It is outrageous. He went to a solicitor and claimed £30,000 in damages.</P>
      <P>There are 111 cases pending against 47 Supermacs stores and the owner believes that 75% of these are fraudulent. It happens every day in my trade, the pub trade, that people trip over carpets and so on, and it seems that all they have to do is go to a solicitor and with the &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; provision those solicitors are falling over themselves to take the cases. I have been speaking for only half a minute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Chair has allowed the other side a lot more slack.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very unfair to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. I know what I am saying. I ask the Leader to talk to the Minister with a view to changing the law regarding those fraudulent claims as business cannot afford to carry those costs indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1105" />
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate in the new year on water quality. In rural areas there are some water schemes which are effectively polluted. They are outdated and the supply is very poor. Many of their trustees have died while others have retired and it is incumbent on the State, given the amount of money available, to give funding to local authorities so that these group water schemes can be taken in charge. A good quality of water is of the essence to the life of the people and I seek a debate on this in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point made by Senator O'Toole about the timetabling of leaving certificate examinations so that they do not clash with World Cup games. That would be a psychological disaster for those seeking points for their careers. It would be timely if the Leader conveyed the House's views on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science should attend the House, perhaps early in the new year, to debate the conflicting reports about our education system. A Senator mentioned one report yesterday which referred to Ireland being down the league table of science subjects and up in terms of literature, but today's report suggests we are doing well. It would be a pity if the Department of Education and Science did not clarify the situation arising out of the conflicting reports and surveys coming on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the important examinations in June as well as the possibility of a general election around the same time, perhaps we could have the time of the World Cup changed to facilitate various priorities.</P>
      <P>When does the Leader expect to take the disability Bill? It is difficult to concentrate on one particular area of disability but one's mind focuses on the difficulties of autistic children and their parents in having facilities provided for them. I would like the Bill to come to the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senators Costello and Ormonde for a debate on the recent OECD report, Knowledge and Skills for Life, obviously in the next session. The report's contents give much encouragement to our teachers and demonstrate that our system of education has improved dramatically in recent years. Literacy attainment among some of our older people is still very low but the report demonstrates that attainment in literacy, science and mathematics among 15 year olds is very high. I ask for a debate in the next session, but it is proper that we congratulate students and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Keogh mentioned that the timing of the leaving certificate and the World Cup may coincide. Any change in the timing of the leaving certificate examinations will be an interesting indicator of our priorities. While football is not <Col N="1106" /> my preferred discipline, I expected those arranging World Cup matches to consider the dates of leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join those on all sides of the House who asked for a debate on the Middle East, which is a subject close to my heart. I know the region well as it was my second home for over a quarter of a century. I spoke to friends there last night who said they believe the area is heading inexorably towards war. Ariel Sharon, to whom President Bush has given the green light, and Yasser Arafat are dangerous men, fighting a bitter personal duel over the corpses of their citizens. It is an outrage. I was in the region when the Intifada was initiated and I witnessed Yasser Arafat deliberately unleashing Hamas bombers. While watching Bethlehem TV, I heard calls being made for suicide bombers. There is no doubt&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is anticipating the debate which has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to finish this point&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to pre-empt a debate which has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to underline its importance. The point needs to be made that Mr. Sharon and Hamas are co-operating in an attempt to destroy the Palestinian Authority.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, we need a debate on Operation Freeflow. We ought to ask why it seemed to work today. I believe it was because the dangerous parking situation in Dublin was freed up. Two lines of traffic on Gardiner Street feed into a line of traffic and a line of parked cars. Dublin Corporation does not provide parking and does not require it in most developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will confine myself to calling for a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points I wanted to raise have been covered. I support the calls for an urgent debate on the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have a debate in the new year on the important recent OECD education report. <Col N="1107" /> While I congratulate those who deserve congratulations, we should focus on those parts of the system which do not meet the needs of a developing economy. I refer particularly to science and mathematics.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Henry's call for a debate on the cancer strategy. There is incontrovertible evidence that those with cancer benefit from being in specialised centres. We do not serve the people well if we resist their desire to attend such centres.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the tardiness of the introduction to this House of mental health legislation. I would like the Leader to say that the Bill will be introduced on a certain date to allay the concerns of Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the OECD education report. I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the pay discrimination against special needs assistants in primary schools. Those who look after children in infant classes are viewed as part-time employees and their weekly pay is an average of £100 less than special needs assistants in senior classes. As a result, these excellent special needs assistants are leaving the infants sector of the primary education system for other employment. This is a serious matter for the children, parents and teachers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's call for a debate on centres of excellence. It is time we abandoned the notion of having a specialist hospital at every crossroads as that is not possible. Politicians will have to be realistic and stop playing politics with an issue as serious as health.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Department and the medical profession for the strides which have been made in dealing with the curse of cancer. I welcome the 20% reduction in the number of deaths from cancer in the eastern region and I hope this progress continues.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Bohan's request for a debate on the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture which is the ruination of this country. There have been many inquiries into the religious, teachers and politicians, but it is time we set up an inquiry into the judicial system because what is happening in our courts is scandalous. We need an inquiry&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Leader has a full schedule but will he make time available before Christmas to debate yesterday's admission by the Taoiseach that the Government will not deliver on its PPF commitment regarding social housing? The Government will not meet that target by a significant margin. This is perhaps the largest failure of the PPF at a time when 125,000 people are accepted as being in need of social housing. This issue should be debated in the House, particularly as we often debate homelessness at this time of year. Homelessness is the most extreme manifestation of the problem caused by the inadequate provision of social housing.</P>
      <P>As someone involved in education, I wish to be associated with the compliments paid to the very good performance by the education system. The Department of Finance in particular should note that, according to the OECD, the education system is good value for money. That Department insists on describing education as social investment. However, investment in education is productive investment without which nothing else can happen. It is a scandalous misuse of language for the Department of Finance to describe this as social investment as if we could do without it.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of Senators regarding the quality of centres of excellence for the treatment of cancer. However, the House should debate the related issue of how people get to such centres. Those receiving treatment at such centres often have to circumnavigate the country and this burden is the main reason people resist such developments. There should be a simple means of getting to these centres without having to travel half way around the country in an ambulance which takes 12 hours to get there and 12 hours to get back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the fishing industry, particularly in light of Commissioner Fischler's announcement regarding a reduction in whitefish quotas? Castletownbere is a port close to my heart and is the largest whitefish port on this island. A 60% reduction in the quota would have devastating consequences for the fishing industry and the entire Cork and Kerry region. If it is not possible to have the debate before the recess, the Leader should urgently convey to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, the serious situation which faces the fishing industry. There is a need for conservation, but a 60% reduction in the quota would have immense repercussions for a port such as Castletownbere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Middle East. I also support Senator Farrell in his call for a debate on the Judiciary. I believe we can do this without interfering with the separation of powers. We frequently see decisions of <Col N="1109" /> the High Court reversed by the Supreme Court, yet when a Supreme Court judge retires he is replaced by a judge from the High Court. I have often wondered how, when a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court he becomes so clever that he can reverse a previous decision of the High Court. This is a topic we should debate. It is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Henry and Hayes asked that No. 15, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, 2001 be published and debated. I have no difficulty in relation to this matter and I will inform the House tomorrow morning when the matter can be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Henry and Hayes called for stronger regulations with regard to coroner court fines. I fully agree with Senator Manning. The current practice is totally outdated and I will allow as much time as needed for this matter. I will pass the Senators' views to the Minister after the Order of Business today.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Norris and Hayes called for a debate on the Middle East. I will endeavour to have this take place next week. Senators O'Toole, Ormonde and Quill expressed their views and concerns regarding a clash between the dates of the leaving certificate examination and Ireland's participation in the World Cup. I will pass their views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001. I said in the House last week that we would debate Committee Stage of this Bill on the first sitting day after the Christmas recess. Senators Costello, Ormonde, Quill, Hayes, O'Dowd and Ryan congratulated Ireland's education system on the performance of pupils, as described in the new OECD report. All Governments can be congratulated on their investment in education, in good times and bad, and in making education a priority during the past 30 or 35 years. I congratulate everyone concerned. This report can be debated in the House after the Christmas recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass the views of Senators Henry, Hayes and Farrell on the cancer strategy to the Minister for Health and Children. Senators Bohan, Farrell <Col N="1110" /> and Lydon called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to debate personal insurance claims. Various examples of spurious claims have been given by the Senators and I will pass their views to the Minister. I have already discussed this matter with the Minister and I hope we will have an all-day debate on the insurance industry after the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh expressed his concerns about water quality. I understand that most local authorities find it difficult to spend their allocations for the group water scheme programme. However, the CLÁR programme will complement most of these schemes. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, has undertaken that his officials will liaise with the Department of the Environment and Local Government to get the maximum amount of funding for group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh inquired about the disability Bill. I will inform the House tomorrow when the final stages of this Bill are to be taken. Senator Norris again expressed his views on Operation Freeflow. I congratulate everyone concerned. Many people work in the areas to which the Senator referred and they deserve to be able to park near their places of employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the Government's policy on social housing. The Senator may raise this matter this evening during Private Members' Time when the independent Senators' motion on the Budget Statement will be debated and the Minister for Finance will be present.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan spoke about the implications of the proposed new quota system in the fishing industry. This is a serious matter. I will see if two or three hours can be allowed in the interim to highlight our concerns regarding these new proposals. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, has made clear his total opposition to this. I will endeavour to find agreement with the Whips and the leaders on time to debate the issue next week.</P>

      <P>These amendments are intended to provide for the coming into operation of a number of sections of the Bill upon enactment. At present, section 1(2) provides that all these provisions will be brought into operation by orders to be made by me, as Minister. Certain provisions in the Bill implement commitments at EU level in relation to the euro and measures to combat money laundering more effectively. In these cases, there is a deadline to be met on 1 January next. Accordingly, in view of the tight timeframe in which we are operating, I have concluded that it is appropriate to provide that the relevant sections should come into operation immediately upon enactment. In brief, the provisions in question are those concerned with reporting certain financial transactions for the purpose of preventing money laundering, currency counterfeiting, the investigation of offences, certain aspects of trial procedure, liability of bodies corporate and documentary evidence in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment. In his Second Stage speech, the Minister announced his intention to bring forward this amendment and it is very appropriate to ensure that no space is left, as the euro is introduced, for fraud to take place, for counterfeit to get into circulation or for any other opportunistic abuses to occur. I hope the Minister will provide the necessary protection for corporate bodies and firms in this regard so that no undue stress or demands are imposed on them. In light of the provisions of these amendments, I hope the Minister will look favourably at further amendments which we have tabled to address those issues. Now, more than ever, it is important that other aspects of the Bill are looked at more closely.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;claim of right&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of a number of amendments I have put down to section 2. It relates to the definition of &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo;. I am not a lawyer but the definition has never troubled me until now and I do not propose to let it. The definition is: &ldquo;means <Col N="1113" /> without a claim of right made in good faith&rdquo;. My amendment would insert after &ldquo;claim of right&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;or other lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am told by lawyers that the phraseology in the Bill is extremely restrictive and the Law Reform Commission has said that the concept of a claim of right is somewhat limited. That is the reason we suggest the inclusion of &ldquo;or other lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo;. The desire to make it easy to convict must always be balanced with the fact that people are entitled to the benefit of some doubt. The insertion of the phrase &ldquo;other lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo; might be short of a claim of right but appears to be a reasonable compromise which will not affect the integrity of what the Minister is attempting to do. It will insert proper phraseology into what is an otherwise demanding definition from the point of view of the defendant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; should mean not only an absence of a claim of right, as provided in the Bill, but also an absence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse. I appreciate the intention of the amendment but I do not see how it helps to clarify what is meant by &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; in the context of the Bill. Such a change would only add confusion in an area where clarity is required.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission examined this matter in detail and it was the subject of considerable consultation. In the end it recommended the meaning contained in the Bill. This meaning also has the advantage that it is already used in the larceny Acts and the courts will be familiar with its meaning. These Acts are being repealed but that does not mean we cannot retain what is useful. The Law Reform Commission acknowledged that defining dishonesty in terms of an absence of a clear and legal right was not without its problems. It was suggested, for example, that the parameters of dishonesty are not identical to those of a claim of right, that is, not every act done without such a claim is necessarily dishonest. In the end, however, its recommendation was broadly along the lines set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Taken together with the offences in the Bill involving dishonesty, it should be clear that any claim of right is one which must be made in good faith, that is, an accused must genuinely have believed that his or her action was justified and that he or she was entitled to take the goods. There have been a number of cases where it was held that a claim of right provided a successful defence to a charge of taking property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the intention of the legislation is to be clear about the elements which constitute an offence, the reference to other lawful authority might serve only to confuse. It is clear that lawful authority is a defence to any charge of dishonesty. Thus section 4, dealing with theft, provides that <Col N="1114" /> it will not be theft where a person believes that he or she has the owner's consent. This would surely amount to lawful authority.</P>
    <P>The amendment could also present further difficulties. The reference to reasonable excuse, for example, has the potential to permit many types of dishonesty to go unpunished. It is possible to postulate a situation where an individual who may be in financial difficulty steals something and pleads that there was a reasonable excuse for his or her action. I am not necessarily thinking of somebody stealing food to feed a hungry child. It could be a business person whose business has hit a particularly hard patch. Who is to say that one or the other is not entitled to plead reasonable excuse and escape liability? Where is the line to be drawn? When is theft reasonably excusable? I do not wish to give the impression that the law should not show compassion to those who are particularly needy but it is a leap from that to rendering it inoperable. Accordingly, I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), line 28, before &ldquo;prevents&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unjustifiably&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the definition of deception for the purposes of the Bill. Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) currently states: &ldquo;prevents another person from acquiring information. . . &rdquo;  The Law Reform Commission suggested something like this but, as the Minister said, it is not necessarily the absolute guide. It is possible to argue in some situations that it might be justifiable to withhold information. To suggest that there could be no claim that under certain circumstances a person was justifiably withholding information seems to be pushing it.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to damage the integrity of the Act, including the Minister, but it would be better to include &ldquo;unjustifiably prevents another person from acquiring information which would affect that person's judgment of a transaction&rdquo;. It is an interesting phrase although I appreciate that it is only for the purpose of this Act. Nevertheless, it has considerable breadth and could do with being tightened up. We suggest that &ldquo;justifiably&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;prevents&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 2(2) of the Bill. This amendment would add a subjective element to the requirement that deception consists in part of preventing a person from acquiring certain information. As section 2(2) stands, deception may involve creating or reinforcing a false impression, preventing the acquisition of certain information or failing to correct a false impression. The amendment seeks to add that there must be some unjustifiable element attached to the prevention of the person <Col N="1115" /> acquiring certain information which would affect that person's judgment of a transaction before it could constitute deception.</P>
      <P>Having examined the possible effects of the inclusion of &ldquo;unjustifiably&rdquo;, it would be possible for a defendant to claim that his or her preventing the other person acquiring the information was justified and it could be extremely difficult for the prosecution to prove otherwise. Deception is an ingredient of the offence of theft in section 4. It is also an element of the offences set out in sections 6 and 7. Is it seriously suggested that a person should not be guilty of theft where the consent of the owner has been obtained through some deception, such as preventing that person from obtaining certain information, merely because the deceiver claimed that he was justified in withholding the information? </P>
      <P>Without inferring a base motive, his or her alleged justification might be that someone else might benefit more than the person properly entitled. It would amount to allowing one person to determine whether another should be denied what is rightfully his or hers by reference only to that person's view of the matter. It would be a recipe for all sorts of people to avoid liability. In the case of sections 6 and 7, the effect of the amendment would be to enable a person to dishonestly make a gain, or cause a loss, or to dishonestly obtain services by a deception which he or she claimed was justifiable. I cannot accept an amendment that would have that effect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2)(<i>c</i>), line 33, to delete &ldquo;or confidential&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) deals with situations where a person deceives if he or she fails to correct a false impression which the deceiver had previously created or reinforced, or which the deceiver knows to be influencing another with whom he or she stands in a fiduciary or confidential relationship. Nobody has any problem with the situation of a fiduciary relationship because one can understand legal obligations in that case. However, a confidential relationship exists at many levels, including in business dealings. Many of those would be better dealt with in the civil courts rather than as criminal activities. There is a danger of extending the criminal law into areas relating to trust in business. That is a large area to extend into, if that is what the Bill is suggesting. If there is a confidentiality agreement, one could be involved in criminal activities by not correcting impressions that people had previously obtained from another. I do not argue with the idea, but I dispute whether it should be a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Ryan. This is a valid amendment to prevent the introduction of the term &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; into statute law. The term can be widely defined and can be involved in a variety of situations. Nobody should be excused and there should be no exceptions made where there is a confidential relationship. That would be dangerous and the Bill would be all the worse for including this term. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and to withdraw the words &ldquo;or confidential&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that persons in a fiduciary relationship should be targeted by this Bill. That is specific and clear. There is an accepted definition of a fiduciary relationship. However, confidentiality is extremely wide and varied. People speak in confidence all the time. It would be possible to discuss a matter of a criminal nature and to subsequently realise that such a discussion could then be a matter for criminal examination. There is an obligation that a person in such a situation should not be exempt. It is vital that this amendment is supported and that the phrase &ldquo;or confidential&rdquo; is withdrawn from the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is also an amendment to section 2(2) of the Bill. It seeks to restrict the application of section 2(2)(<i>c</i>) to cases where there is a fiduciary relationship between an accused and the person he or she deceives. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) follows a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. Its intention was to include relationships which fell short of a fiduciary relationship but in which there was a requirement for the utmost good faith on the part of the accused.</P>
      <P>A fiduciary relationship is one which implies trust and honesty. However, there are other relationships which fall short of a fiduciary one in which a special responsibility is owed by one person to another. Such a relationship may be characterised by a requirement of confidentiality between the persons and it would be implicit that the person owing the duty should act at all times in the interests of the other person and should not be permitted to benefit from an error which he or she failed to correct. Such dishonesty should be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was to recognise this that paragraph (<i>c</i>) included references to confidential relationships. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) may involve some action by the person who engages in the deception such as that the false impression is one which the deceiver may have either previously created or reinforced. There is an obligation on the person to correct this and the failure to do so should attract criminal liability. The essence of the deception in paragraph (<i>c</i>) is that there are special circumstances arising from the relationship between the parties which it is reasonable to expect should impose a duty to correct the mistake. The person who relies on another is entitled to count on him or her to inform them fully and honestly about rel<Col N="1117" /> evant matters. The effect of deleting the reference to &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; would be to limit the application of this paragraph to fiduciary relationships alone. It would restrict its application and possibly permit certain actions which would be penalised to go unpunished. I do not believe this should be the case and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hesitant to argue with a lawyer on a matter as technical as this, but I am not totally hesitant. I accept there is an argument on this matter and I will not pretend that there is a single view. The Minister's point was that by leaving out &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;, some offences might go unpunished. That is an argument for precise drafting but not an argument for including in the Bill a catch-all phrase such as &ldquo;or confidential&rdquo; which not only includes some situations where the Minister's point is valid, but stretches well beyond them. Nobody disputes that specific circumstances can arise where the criminal law seems appropriate to deal with certain confidential non-fiduciary relationships. However, that certain things are not covered by one word does not justify putting in an entirely different word which has an enormous breadth.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on this before Report Stage. The section could be reworded to deal with the issues that he has apparently identified but which would not be covered by a fiduciary obligation. It could be dealt with in a way that does not involve a word as broad as &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;. &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; applies in all sorts of places. Virtually everybody who works in the pharmaceutical industry in Cork harbour signs a confidentiality agreement. If they leave their jobs, workers are supposed to be bound by that agreement. Most who leave ignore it and in most cases that does not matter because patent and other laws come into effect. However, I know people who have ended up in civil disputes because they moved jobs and the other party, the previous employer, believed that they were going to work for a potential competitor. Therefore, some issues arise.</P>
      <P>In terms of dishonesty and theft, will it be the case that people who break that sort of confidentiality agreement are potentially open to criminal prosecution as well as civil action? The word has bigger implications than the Minister intended and that is the problem with it. The fact that it will cover a couple of things we all agree should be covered does not mean it is the correct description because it may well cover many other matters which should not be under criminal law at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for the Minister to look at this section again and to introduce a further amendment on Report Stage to define in greater detail his interpretation of &ldquo;con<Col N="1118" /> fidential&rdquo;. I appreciate from where the Minister is coming, but, as it stands, it is clear that it can be defined in a wide variety of ways. I ask the Minister to remember we are talking about the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill, 2001. We are talking about a certain type of individual with a certain frame of mind and if he or she sees anything in the Bill which would open up opportunities for him or her, he or she will be the first to define it and to recognise the potential of working around something as open and loose as this. It is dangerous to leave it this way. There is a need for balance and, as it stands, there is no balance; it is much too wide and it must be more clearly defined. I ask the Minister to come back on Report Stage with a clearer definition.</P>

      <P>It states categorically that it relates to a person who deceives another. In that context, deception includes failing to correct a false impression which the deceiver previously created or reinforced or which the deceiver knows to be influencing another with whom he or she stands in a fiduciary or confidential relationship. The amendment seeks to restrict it to a fiduciary relationship and if I was to accede to that request, there would be a range of possibilities where people would seek to create or reinforce a false impression in another where there was a confidential relationship and there would be no sanction for it. That would be an unacceptable position.</P>
      <P>For example, if a person was to give power of attorney over his or her affairs to another, surely he or she would be entitled to have any false impression which he or she had in relation to his or her property corrected by the person to whom he or she gave the power of attorney. That might not be construed as a fiduciary relationship. There are many other examples which can be given. One thing which is certain is that if the question of a confidential relationship is excluded from the section, it would undoubtedly open the way for deception in a series of relationships to go unpunished. That is not acceptable. I cannot accept the amendment because to do so would be to confine the criminal law to a fiduciary relationship where deception occurs. That is not acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about what the Minister said and the example he used. Power of attorney is a specific legal enabling power bestowed by one individual on another. There is a very clear definition and clear case law surrounds it. I do not see how that is remotely related to this subsection or wording. Sufficient law gives it a very clear definition and clear obligations. It is an erroneous example to use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity because the Minister could have discussed this with some precision. He has resources at his disposal. A fiduciary relationship, as I understand it, is fairly well understood in law and there is a good deal of back up in terms of defining precisely what it means. A confidential relationship, however, could be something on which two people agree. It could be at a series of levels. It could be a verbal agreement about which people may say they will not talk to anybody and that they will do it themselves. It could be a relationship, for instance, between a client purchasing property and an auctioneer. It could be many things like that. There is a huge number of areas.</P>
      <P>My understanding, which is based on good advice on this matter, is that the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; is pushing it out. The Law Reform Commission thought about it and accepted, I understand, the US model. One would wish us to learn from the experiences of other countries but one has to judge them in the context of how our law operates. To introduce an extra level broadened out like this is a mistake. It is an example of imprecise drafting and trawling to make sure that what we are concerned about is included. In the process, it is trawling way beyond what is explained to us as being necessary. There are so many levels. This is new territory and merits, at the very least, an insertion into the definitions of what is meant by a confidential relationship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more to be said. The reality is that there are relationships which do not imply trust and honesty but in which, nonetheless, a special responsibility is owed by one person to another. There is certainly a responsibility to correct a false impression created or reinforced. I gave one example. It may not be the best example but it is one of many one could give. I cannot have a situation where relationships would exist, where people would be operating with the utmost good faith and where one person does not deliver and allows another to have a false impression. That is deception and I cannot allow a situation to exist where such deception would go unpunished. It would probably encourage people to deceive others in the certain knowledge that there would be no criminal sanction. As I said, it is not a runner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting irritated now. On what planet is the Minister? Deception goes on all the time. It goes on in half the lettings of private rented accommodation in which less than complete pictures of the property are given to tenants. It goes on in house purchase, in land purchase and many other areas. People do not tell each other the whole story. That happens all the time and if every deception is a criminal offence, then a huge part of the bourgeois section of our society should be in jail. Incomplete information <Col N="1120" /> is how people gain advantage in a market economy. Very few people in a buyer-seller relationship have complete information.</P>
      <P>Apparently it will be a criminal offence if there is a confidential element and I know something about a property about which the other person has not found out and he or she buys the property and finds I did not tell him or her about something about which he or she forgot to ask. Maybe it is a good idea but it will keep a large number of the Garda Síochána in business for a long time. If every deception where there is a confidential element in a relationship is to be criminalised, we will have other legislation which is seriously flawed. This should be looked at again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3), lines 28 to 38, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>).</P>
      <P>One of a number of peculiar things in this Bill concerns the definition of theft under section 4. Subsection 3(<i>c</i>) states:</P>
      <P>If in any proceedings against a person to whom this subsection applies for theft of some or all of the property so held by him or her it is proved that&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;there is a deficiency in the property or a sum representing it, and</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;the person has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the whole or any part of the deficiency,</P>
      <P>it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i> but subject to <i>subsection (2),</i> that the person appropriated, without the consent of its owner or owners, the whole or that part of the deficiency.</P>
      <P>If there is something missing, the presumption is that the person in question is guilty of misappropriation unless her or she can prove the contrary. I grew up in a society where the presumption was that a person was innocent until proven guilty. This turns that presumption around by saying &ldquo;it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved . . . that the person appropriated, without the consent of its owner or owners, the whole or that part of the deficiency&rdquo;. That is not what I understood to be the basis of our criminal law. I object to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to remove from the Bill the presumption that a person who held property in trust <Col N="1122" /> for one or more persons had appropriated it for his or her own benefit for use in certain specific circumstances. Section 4(3) is based on a recommendation by the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud. It recommended the creation of what is described as a general deficiency offence. This offence occurs when a person who holds money in trust as agent for others does not maintain in the account sufficient funds at all times to pay in full what is due to each person. For example, at present, where an auctioneer or solicitor holds money on behalf of several clients in a mixed account and then takes some of it for personal use, it may be difficult to prove an offence. It may not be clear whose money was taken. This is because there may be enough remaining to repay some clients, but the general deficiency becomes apparent only if all clients seek repayment at the same time.</P>
      <P>Section 4(3)(<i>c</i>) provides that, where there is a deficiency and the person fails to provide a satisfactory explanation, it will be presumed that he or she appropriated without the consent of the owner or owners all or part of the deficiency. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
      <P>The offence to which the presumption in paragraph (<i>c</i>) refers requires an appropriation of property, a dishonest intent, and that the appropriation was without the owner's consent. The purpose of paragraph (<i>c</i>) is to provide that the person is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have appropriated the deficiency without consent in the circumstances provided for in the paragraph. It does not presume any intention to deprive or any dishonest intent and would not obtain if there were a satisfactory explanation. Therefore, it is not presuming guilt.</P>
      <P>When a person holds property in trust for one or more persons, it is not inconsistent with the presumption of innocence that the trustee, who has a duty to account for the property and who alone is in a position to know how the deficiency arose, be called upon to provide a satisfactory explanation of that deficiency. Therefore, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>) would be to leave the subsection without the necessary means to ensure that trustees can be held responsible for the disappearance of property. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his predecessors intrigue me because they seem to look at the world from a particular perspective. For fear that somebody might ever get away with something, they feel we should turn the whole code inside out. We all agree with everything the Minister says about people misappropriating other people's funds. However, the lazy one person option in this respect is to turn the system over and say that because there is a deficiency, a gap and a prob<Col N="1123" /> lem, we will therefore presume that the person did something wrong. Let them prove that they did not do anything wrong or commit any criminal offence.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;reasonable explanation&rdquo; is not used. Instead it is stated that, until the contrary is proved, the person is &ldquo;presumed to have appropriated, without the consent of its owner or owners, the whole or that part of the deficiency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The fact that some advisory body advised that this should be the case is unimportant. It is always easy to check the reasons because we all know the hard cases of crooked solicitors and auctioneers who misappropriated clients' funds. We also all know because we set up many of these professions as self-governing. Therefore, it is very difficult for the public to obtain any serious redress from any of them. We also all know that that is not a reason to turn the normal criminal law inside out to a considerable degree. If the Minister wants to include &ldquo;unless the person provides a reasonable explanation&rdquo;, we might be able to work with him. The current phrase is &ldquo;until the contrary is proved&rdquo;. I presume that involves proof in a court of law. Therefore, what it actually says is that a person must go to court and be charged on the basis of the deficit of information and must prove that he or she did not do anything wrong. That is not giving a reasonable excuse; that is proving. That is what is wrong with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the section. In reality, the section seeks to get an individual, who is uniquely placed, to provide information regarding an actual deficiency in an account. A person in charge of an account is in a unique position to explain the reason for a deficiency. I cannot see why Senator Ryan feels it is unreasonable to ask such a person to provide an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be tilting at windmills. Nobody said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be abundantly clear, particularly where people hold money for a number of others, that situations arise in which the general account can become deficient and where it is not possible to establish, to the satisfaction of any jury or court, that a given individual's money has been taken. Consider a case where there are 100 clients, each holding £1,000 in an account. Assume there is a deficiency of £1,000. It is not possible in that kind of situation to say whose money is gone. One thing is certain &ndash; there is a deficiency in the account. It seems perfectly reasonable that if one person is uniquely placed to explain that, it having been established beyond reasonable doubt that there was a deficiency in the account, that person should be <Col N="1124" /> asked to explain it. Let me put it another way: who should be asked to explain it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If everything that is imperfect has to be explained, we could all end up explaining to the Revenue Commissioners why something is not true. For instance, when the Revenue Commissioners were oblivious to Mr. Haughey's high living, they were asking people like me to explain the various properties they thought I owned, which were various cheap apartments I lived in when single. They wrote to me on each occasion asking how I got the money to pay for them and I wrote back to say I rented the apartments. I could not prove it. How could I? I had been five years out of some of the places. If the Revenue Commissioners had the power to say to me that unless I could prove I had rented the accommodation, they would be in a position to say they presumed I owned them and that I had funds which I had not disclosed. That is what this means. If there is a deficit of information we are saying that unless one can prove one has a reasonable explanation one is guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister wants to do and nobody has a dispute with that. However, using a metaphorical sledgehammer to crack a nut is an old response of departments of justice all over the world. It is to be deplored because it does not usually achieve much apart from making life difficult for people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This has to do with a person's holding multiple accounts on behalf of people. It has nothing to do with taxes or anything else. It relates to where there is a deficiency in an account and it cannot be established whom the deficiency relates to. All the individual is being asked is to explain why there is a deficiency. If there is a deficiency because a client has paid back money that is fair enough, but if it is because the person concerned has used clients' money for his or her own benefit it is a different matter. In those circumstances the client is entitled to be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ideal scenario painted by Senator Ryan there would be no possibility of protecting the client because if there were a deficiency of £1,000 in an account holding £100,000 it would not be possible to identify whose money was gone. In those circumstances it <Col N="1125" /> must become immediately apparent that a difficulty would arise in relation to proving the charge. If the presumption does not exist and the person is not obliged to explain why there is a deficiency in the account, it appears that he would escape scot free. That is not what Senator Ryan wants to see happen and it is certainly not what I want. I wish the world were a far simpler place but I did not make the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the Minister is making the rules.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes a plausible case for abolishing the whole idea of innocent until proven guilty. It is more difficult to prove people are guilty than to say to them, &ldquo;We think you're guilty, prove to us that you're innocent.&rdquo; One could apply that across the whole area of criminal activity. The presumption is: &ldquo;You were in a place at a certain time and you are not very nice, therefore we believe you did X. Prove to us we are wrong. Something happened, you were there, prove to us that you did not do it.&rdquo; That would be very easy and convenient and a great way to ensure people did not get off, but it is not the way we do it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right. This sort of thing should not happen and it makes a case, particularly with self-regulated professions such as law, for taking that power away and giving society the power to regulate those professions, which have such a considerable capacity to waste people's money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4(4) states that if, at the trial of a person for theft, the court or jury, as the case may be, has to consider whether the person believed that the owner could not be discovered by taking reasonable steps, etc., the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for such a belief is a matter to which the court or jury shall have regard, in conjunction with any other relevant matters, in considering whether the person so believed. What does that mean? I did not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4(4) is linked to section 4(2), on which it builds by setting out the grounds which must be considered by a court or jury, as the case may be, in deciding whether the accused person had this belief. It addresses the point acknowledged by the Law Reform Commission that, given its approach of defining dishonesty as without a claim of legal right, which has been adopted by this Bill, there would be a need for a court or jury to consider the relevance of dishonesty to the guilt of the accused. Under present law it must convict the accused if he has not a claim of legal right, regardless of the question of his honesty or dishonesty. This is the effect of the judicial interpretation of the term &ldquo;fraudu<Col N="1126" /> lently&rdquo; in section 1 of the Larceny Act, 1916. Under our proposal the legislative provision will confront the question in direct language and make it clear to the court and jury that it is not permissible to acquit the accused where it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he appropriated the property without a claim of legal right.</P>
      <P>Section 4(4) sets out three grounds for a court or jury to consider: that the person had not acted dishonestly, that the property's owners had consented or would have consented to its appropriation; and that the owner could not be discovered by taking reasonable steps for his or her discovery. This provides an objective test for the jury to consider, along with other relevant issues, in arriving at a view as to whether the person formed such a belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is getting annoyed but I have a question about the necessity of section 5(4). In the middle of a Bill dealing with the most profound criminal offences, this subsection states that a person who picks mushrooms or any other fungus growing wild in the land or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant, including any shrub or tree growing wild on any land, does not, although not in possession of the lands, steal what is picked unless he or she does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purposes.

The wording of subsection (4) distinguishes between mushrooms or any other fungus growing wild on any land and flowers, fruit or foliage of a plant, including any shrub or tree, because unlike other plants, the Senator will be surprised to hear that to pick a mushroom is to pick it in its entirety.</P>

      <P>Coming from a rural background, I am a little concerned about this section as it can almost be said to encourage trespass or to condone picking items from the land or lifting <Col N="1127" /> whatever moves on the land as long as it is not done for commercial purposes. The Minister knows the legal difficulties that arise when people damage themselves on the property of others. What is the wisdom of section 5(4), which may be considered to slightly condone trespass? Although there are laws in relation to trespass and insurance claims, this section encourages people to enter the land of others. Should the Bill not include a reference that such behaviour should only be conducted with the permission of the property owner to ensure this section will not be seen as condoning trespass? I know people who lamp foxes in County Clare and sell the skins for commercial purposes. Will they be deemed to have committed an offence under this Bill?</P>

      <P>Section 5(4) provides regulations if, for example, someone picks a bluebell or a daffodil while walking in the countryside. One cannot expect such a person to be brought before the courts and fined. We should not, however, tolerate someone entering the property of another person to exploit the land for commercial purposes. An example of this may be if the person grows &ldquo;a host of golden daffodils&rdquo;, in the immortal words of the poem, although such commercial use may not have been envisaged by William Wordsworth. Senators know that the Bill represents common sense.</P>

      <P>On an entirely separate issue, I am concerned about the penalty of ten years for <Col N="1128" /> indictment under sections 4 and 5. Many of the penalties in the Bill are draconian and can be contrasted with penalties for offences against the person in other legislation. Imprisonment not exceeding ten years is the maximum penalty for threatening to kill someone, five years can be given for assault causing harm and there is a maximum penalty of seven years for possession with intent of a syringe, one of the most terrifying modern offences.</P>
      <P>The Bill suggests that the protection of property is a more important priority than the protection of people. Many offences under this Bill carry more severe sentences than offences which many people would regard as more serious, such as threats or injuries against the person. It is astonishing that there is a maximum penalty of seven years for child abduction, whereas the theft of any kind of property carries a maximum penalty of ten years. This suggests somehow, in the back of one's mind, that the protection of property is a more important fundamental duty of the State than the security of citizens.</P>

      <P>I know the word is included and I am familiar with its definition, but it is still a large <Col N="1129" /> penalty for someone found guilty. Students in the college in which I work are required to meet certain conditions before they can use a computer. They may break the rules about how the computer should be used with the intention of making a personal gain. It could be argued that although the use of someone else's computer may be dishonest, the gain made may be legitimate. The computer could be dishonestly used to enter a quiz or to participate in on-line gambling, but the gain could be legitimate. A penalty of imprisonment of ten years in such circumstances, even though the gain was legitimate, is disproportionate.</P>

      <P>The Bill merely provides for a maximum penalty of ten years. From my experience over the past 20 years or more, maximum penalties are rarely imposed. It is a wise and prudent move by the Minister and his officials to include a maximum penalty as a deterrent. The maximum penalty is unlikely to be used unless the dishonest use of the computer was so extreme as to lead to a significant financial loss. The maximum penalty is a deterrent which will ensure that few, if any, people will use a computer for dishonest purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ingredients to the offence, an element of dishonesty and the intention of making a gain or causing a loss. Senator O'Donovan correctly dealt with the issue of the penalty and the Bill provides for a maximum penalty in terms of imprisonment, but it is open to the court to impose a lower sentence.</P>
      <P>Any perusal of prison sentences imposed by courts would show that the principle of proportionality between the offence and the term of imprisonment or punishment is jealousy guarded. That is the correct way in which to do business. There is no possibility of an injustice being done by a court in imposing the penalty available under this section.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is correct to point out that there are varying degrees of seriousness. However, one must expect that the court will decide on the seriousness of an offence. One cannot expect that a Bill can set out a given sentence for every possible offence as that would be impossible. To that extent I hope the Senator will accept my assurance that courts will carefully apply the principle of proportionality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one disputes the idea that people should be penalised for using a computer to do something dishonest. However, that is what the section should state. It should state: &ldquo;A person who dishonestly, whether within or outside the State, operates or causes to be operated a computer within the State with the intention of dishonestly making a gain for himself of another, or of dishonestly causing loss to another, is guilty of an offence.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; should refer to someone who dishonestly makes a gain or dishonestly causes a loss, but not to someone who <Col N="1130" /> dishonestly uses a computer. The latter criminalises everyone who uses a computer to which they do not have a claim of right made in good faith. That is not what the Minister said he wishes to achieve. He wishes to achieve what I am suggesting which is that people who use or abuse computers to do dishonest things should be criminalised. I agree with that objective. However, people who use other people's computers in instances where they do not have a claim of right made in good faith should not be criminalised <i>per se.</i> If they should be criminalised, we should include it as a separate offence.</P>
      <P>There are 1,000 computers in CIT for which there are regulations which state that, for example, people are not supposed to use them for gambling. That is a matter for the college and we can deal with it, but such behaviour should not constitute a criminal offence. However, someone who uses a computer, whether it is their own, to do something dishonest should be penalised. There is an important distinction between the two scenarios which could be dealt with by placing the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; where I have suggested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the section states. The Minister has the time and the opportunity to legitimately look at this section again and rephrase it to achieve his objectives, rather than creating a criminal offence where someone uses a computer dishonestly to do something legitimate. That is the effect of the manner in which the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; is defined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House, but the Minister is being unreasonable as the section could be rephrased to create the offence he is trying to create. We do not wish everyone who uses a computer without a claim of right made in good faith to be criminalised. The country is awash with computers and people use them all the time without consent or approval to do things they should not be doing. The simple solution is to move the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; to where I suggest. If the Minister does not agree to even consider this proposal, he is being unreasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that a stockbroker has a computer. His or her daily function is to buy and sell shares and his or her intention is to make a gain. The stockbroker is not doing so dishonestly and that is the crucial difference. All the ingredients of the section have to be in place before there is an offence. I cannot envisage a situation in which <Col N="1131" /> an innocent person could be convicted under this section.</P>

      <P>I promise not to push your patience too far, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. It is arguable that this section will not penalise those who should be penalised as a reasonable reading of it would suggest that the offence is the dishonest operation of the computer. The section refers to someone who dishonestly operates a computer, but that could be interpreted as meaning that he or she should not have been using the computer.</P>
      <P>However, if someone honestly uses a computer, in other words he or she does so with a claim of right made in good faith, there is no offence no matter what he or she does with the computer. If I use my computer there is no offence. The section is sloppily drafted and could benefit from a review and a revision. That is all I am asking, yet the Minister says he will not do so.</P>

      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the need to use ordinary English when we are writing legislation. Other countries do it. It is often a pleasure to read US legislation because it reads like ordinary English. I have drawn attention on many previous occasions to the peculiar usage in this section which defines a crossbow as a firearm. This is a long-standing issue of mine. We ought to use English in the way it is used, simply to make for legal simplicity and not turn it inside out and redefine it. A crossbow is not a firearm in any reasonable person's definition. It does not use any form of explosive to send a projectile. It is not a firearm. It has been so defined since the Firearms Act was passed in the 1980s <Col N="1133" /> when I was a recent arrival in this House. We should use sensible English in our legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not here to redefine what a firearm is. The section explains what a firearm is for the purposes of the legislation. It goes on to describe what an imitation firearm and a weapon of offence are. Very ordinary English is used. For example, a weapon of offence is defined as including &ldquo;any article which has a blade or a sharp point&rdquo;. That is straightforward English. We try to keep language as straightforward as we can.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's point that sometimes language in legislation can be very arcane and appear to the public to be designed to confuse. We are trying to simplify it as best we can and to use ordinary everyday parlance. Sometimes it is not possible to do that. In this legislation, for example, we are not changing firearms legislation, we are merely following what is in the Firearms Acts.</P>

It is sufficient to put a person in fear of his or her safety. In the same way, a person can be just as fearful of an imitation firearm as of a real one.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

If, for example, a person drives a motorcar along a country road at ten miles per hour in the knowledge that there may be sheep around any bend of the road and if the person concerned hits the sheep and one of them is killed, it is difficult to believe there would be a high degree of culpability or that in those circumstances the person concerned would be guilty of dangerous driving. On the other hand, if a person were to drive up a one-way street in Dublin at 60 or 70 miles per hour in the knowledge that the street was full of pedestrians crossing the road and someone was killed, one might come to the conclusion that a high degree of culpability was involved and that the person was reckless as to his or her behaviour. In those circumstances the person might be found guilty of dangerous driving causing death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 38 to 46 and in page 17, lines 1 to 3, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Again, I am sure the Minister and I will disagree. Section 17(1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" />A person is guilty of handling stolen property if (otherwise than in the course of the stealing) he or she, knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, dishonestly&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;receives or arranges to receive it, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;undertakes, or assists in, its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or arranges to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 17(2) states that such a person &ldquo;shall be taken, for the purpose of this section, to have so known or to have been so reckless, unless the Court or the jury is satisfied that there is a reasonable doubt&rdquo;. Again, it is assumed the person is guilty and he or she must satisfy the court to the contrary. The Minister is aware that the considerable controversy on this issue in the other House was never aired because the Bill was guillotined. It deserves an airing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of handling stolen property can be one of the most difficult offences to prove in a court of law. The section seeks to set out an objective test that there would be an assessment of whether the person charged with the offence knew or suspected that the property in question was stolen, providing the court can satisfy itself that this inference can be made on the basis of the criminal test, that is, that the matter is beyond a reasonable doubt. The court would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof in all criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Occasions arise where stolen property is obtained by a person in circumstances where it may be reasonably concluded that it was stolen. To ignore that would leave a significant gap in the legislation. The amendment proposed by Senator Ryan would remove from the Bill a provision which would allow a court or jury to conclude from the circumstances in which a person came into possession of property that he or she either knew or was reckless as to whether it was stolen. If the person can tender evidence which raises a reasonable doubt about this, he or she will not be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with stolen property and under the Bill that also includes unlawfully obtained property. I doubt if anybody seriously suggests that a person should not face any sanction where he or she obtains stolen property in circumstances where any sensible or reasonable person would conclude there is something suspicious about it. That suspicion may arise from the fact that, to use a cliché, it is being sold at a ridiculous under price from the back of a lorry. There may be other factors which would lead a person to question the origins of the property. The section seeks to provide that a person handling stolen property, no matter how far removed from the stealing, cannot claim not to have known or suspected it was stolen. Section 17(2) <Col N="1136" /> provides that a court or jury may decide that a person knew or was reckless that property was stolen in circumstances where it is reasonable to come to such a conclusion. However, such conclusion will not arise where the court or jury is satisfied, on the basis of all the evidence in the case, that there is a reasonable doubt about this.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned one type of circumstance where a person should properly be suspicious about the origins of the property and I am sure Senators can envisage many others. The point is that stolen property belongs only to the rightful owner and nobody should be allowed to obtain the benefit of any loophole in the law. This section prevents people pleading ignorance about the possibility that property might be stolen where the circumstances in which they acquired it should have alerted them to this possibility. For example, if a Michelangelo painting was for sale in Moore Street at £50 it might be concluded that there was something suspicious about it. However, no suspicions might arise if the same painting was on sale in Moore Street for £2 million.</P>

      <P>(b)&nbsp;undertakes, or assists in, its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or arranges to do so.</P>
      <P>Nobody is endeavouring to eliminate the offence of receiving or handling stolen property. The amendment suggests that this extra element of loading in one direction pushes the burden or proof away from the normal procedure where there must be proof of guilt to proof of innocence. The court or jury must be satisfied having regard to all the evidence that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the person knew or was reckless. That is an additional step and it has nothing to do with the principle of it being an offence knowingly to have stolen property in one's possession. The amendment seeks to remove that, not the offence itself.</P>

      <P>I have already said that the offence of handling stolen property can be very difficult to prove. Section 17(2), which Senator Ryan seeks to remove, seeks to ensure that a person will not be permitted to claim that he or she did not know certain facts if the circumstances are such that it is clear that they should have been known. I have explained the position by way of the example of the sale of a painting by Michelangelo in Moore Street. Most people would consider that to be reasonable. There is no attempt to criminalise the innocent or to put people on the back foot in respect of a criminal charge.</P>
      <P>There is also no question of reversing the burden of proof in the legislation. The prosecution will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt in every case. There may be times when certain assumptions will arise following evidence given in the case but, even then, the presumptions may be rebutted and may not be presumed until evidence is forthcoming. This is a reasonable provision for an offence that can be very difficult to prove.</P>
      <P>This legislation, dealing with larceny and all the other offences of dishonesty, has been required for a long time. Much of our legislation dealing with dishonesty has been inadequate. Sometimes it has been extremely difficult for juries to understand cases and sometimes, when others may have considered them to be guilty, people have had cases dismissed against them because the jury found it difficult to follow the case in terms of the archaic definitions to which Senator Ryan referred. We are trying to modernise the law and bring it up to date. This includes recognising there are computer offences and that, essentially, any person who dishonestly makes a gain or causes a loss should pay the price.</P>
      <P>We are also trying to sweep away definitions, procedures and meanings which have little relevance to the ordinary person. It does nothing but a disservice to the criminal justice system if ordinary people, looking at the criminal justice system, see people walk free from court without apparent reason having been charged with certain offences of dishonesty. This provision is an example of what we are trying to achieve. We are seeking to ensure that a person buying very valuable property for a very small price will not fool anybody. That is what the public expects.</P>

      <P>I am slightly concerned about subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) which deals with cases where a person undertakes or assists in the retention of stolen property. Let us consider a case where a person owns a property that he or she does not regularly frequent. This property could be situated in a less frequented part of a town or in an isolated rural area and it might emerge that stolen goods were retained on that property. The Minister may state that a judge and jury will have to decide whether it is reasonable to suspect that the individual in question knowingly allowed the goods to be retained on his or her property. What will happen if two similar cases arise where stolen property was knowingly retained? How will it be decided that one individual is guilty of retention while the second is not?</P>
      <P>I highlight this matter because I am aware of situations where stolen property has been stored at isolated farmhouses or in sheds. In one instance, it would be local knowledge that the person who owned the disused property would have co-operated in receiving and retaining the stolen goods. In the other instance, however, it would be known that the person on whose property the stolen goods were being retained would not have been involved. On foot of local knowledge, I would be in a position to state that subject A is highly suspect while subject B is definitely innocent but it would be difficult to provide conclusive proof. How can it be conclusively proven that there is a reasonable doubt that stolen property either has or has not been received and retained?</P>
      <P>The position is questionable and I would like the Minister to elaborate further on it. I would not like an innocent person at whose property stolen goods had been retained to be deemed guilty on the conclusion of a judge who would not be privy to local knowledge. Further elaboration is required.</P>

      <P>The ingredient of the offence is such that in my view it is not possible for an innocent person to be convicted. I accept that there are occasions when innocent people are convicted but these are rare. In my opinion, that eventuality is minimised to the greatest extent possible in the legislation. The person handling the stolen property must know that it was stolen or be reckless as to whether it was stolen and I have provided examples in that regard. In addition, there must also be activity, namely, he has to receive or arrange to receive the stolen property or he has to undertake or assist in its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person or arrange to do so. I do not believe that the <Col N="1139" /> example to which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred would lead to a person being convicted in the courts.</P>

      <P>I might find myself before the courts as an innocent party trying to prove that I did not assist in the retention of property in an isolated shed I own. The legislation will place innocent people in an extremely invidious position. I am unhappy about this provision, which needs to be examined in greater detail.</P>
      <P>I know of people who have found themselves in the type of situation to which I referred earlier. If the legislation is enacted as it stands, innocent people who have never had any dealings with the courts will find themselves before them trying to prove their innocence and their fate will be decided on the whim of various judges. We have seen how inconsistent are judges in terms of their judgments and sentencing policies. One judge might state that a person is innocent while another will state that he is guilty. The provision is quite dangerous.</P>

The Senator may be able to provide an example where this might not be the case, but I have never heard of a person retaining something that he did not know was there. If an item is retained, one must know it is there in the first instance. There would have to be knowledge on the person's part. Even if that unlikely eventuality were to occur and a person retained something without knowing it, he would have to know it was stolen or be reckless as to whether it was stolen. If he retained it and did not know it was there, which I do not believe he could do, there is no way he could know it was stolen or be reckless as to whether it was stolen if he had not retained it in the first instance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" />In page 17, lines 16 to 24, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    <P>This amendment returns to the argument about whether the provisions in subsection (2) represent a reversal of the burden of proof. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person has in his or her possession stolen property in such circumstances (including purchase of the property at a price below its market value) that it is reasonable to conclude that the person either knew that the property was stolen or was reckless as to whether it was stolen, he or she shall be taken for the purposes of this section to have so known or to have been so reckless, unless the court or the jury, as the case may be, is satisfied . . .</P>
    <P>This is a repetition of what is contained in section 17, but in this instance it refers to the possession of stolen property. I reiterate that this is an unnecessary and excessive response to what are obviously occasional problems in respect of prosecutions. In my view the subsection should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment covers similar ground to that covered in amendment No. 7 which Senators have just been discussing. The reasons for opposing it are also similar to those the Minister outlined in relation to amendment No. 7. As he stated, we are concerned here with stolen or unlawfully obtained property. A person should not be in a position to avoid liability for possessing stolen property by simply claiming that he or she could not have known that it was stolen. The circumstances in which it came into the person's possession should have alerted them to the possibility that there was something suspicious about it.</P>
      <P>For too long we have been prepared to turn a blind eye to the obvious but that will no longer be the case. Under section 18 a person will be guilty of possessing stolen property where he or she knew it was stolen or was reckless as to its origins. The Minister made this point in respect of the previous amendment. The person will also be guilty where the property came into his or her possession in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that he or she knew it was stolen or was reckless in this regard. Any comprehensive Bill dealing with theft and related offences would be seriously lacking if it did not cater for the type of situation at which section 18(2) is aimed. We cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1141" /> SECTION 19.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the fundamental rights which I thought everyone took for granted and which has only been marginally changed over the years is the right to silence or the right not to be required to say anything. In other words, whatever one might have done or what one might know, one could not be coerced by law into disclosing it. That was a fundamental freedom.</P>
      <P>Section 19 states:</P>
      <P>(1)&nbsp;Where a member of the Garda Síochána&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence consisting of stealing property or of handling stolen property has been committed,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;finds any person in possession of any property,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;has reasonable grounds for believing that the property referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i> includes, or may include, property referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> or part of it, or the whole or any part of the proceeds of that property or part, and</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;informs the person of his or her belief, the member may require the person to give an account of how he or she came by the property.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (4), any information supplied shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his or her spouse in any criminal proceedings. I note, however, that information could be admissible against another member of a person's family. This is an extraordinary change in the law. I understand it was not extensively debated in the other House or perhaps it was.</P>
      <P>If a garda thinks something which I have in my possession was stolen or that I have the proceeds from the sale of something that was stolen, I am now legally obliged to explain to him or her where I got it. This will sound good to people who think civil liberties are egalitarian nonsense best disposed of but to those of us who know the balance of a democratic society is precisely that, it is a balance between conflicting rights and powers to protect the freedom of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;, frequently used in legislation, has never been defined. No one is prepared to define it because to do so would be to constrain it. Therefore, it means, if a garda &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; I have in my possession something that was stolen, then I am legally obliged to provide him or her with an explanation of where I got it. That has echoes of totalitarianism. It is saying that in the interests of dealing with the offence of possession of stolen property I can be <Col N="1142" /> required to tell the Garda Síochána everything about property which I have in my possession. Let us figure this through in, say, the area of antiques.</P>
    <P>The Traveller community who are involved in the business of antiques are often accused of untruths and stigmatised &ndash; they often deserve the blame for many things of which they are accused. Anybody who buys anything will now have to explain, by law, to any member of the Garda Síochána where they got it. There will be a criminal penalty for not doing so. A garda could trawl through anybody's home saying &ldquo;I think that is stolen, tell me where you got it?&rdquo; That is regarded as reasonable in a society where the right to say nothing was the most fundamental right of all. We adjusted the law to enable an inference to be drawn from a person's refusal to give an explanation. On each occasion we did so, we were criticised for breaching a person's traditional right to silence. The right to silence meant nothing could be drawn from a person's refusal to communicate.</P>
    <P>In this case, not only can an inference be drawn but if one persists in refusing to communicate, one could be convicted under sections 17 and 18 whereby one has to rebut any inference drawn &ndash; the Minister said that under section 17 a conclusion can be drawn which the person has to rebut &ndash; and one could also be convicted of a separate offence for refusing to explain where you got the property. Any member of the Garda Síochána can request a citizen to explain where he or she got a particular piece of property. Under this legislation the citizen will have to give an explanation and if he/she does not, he/she can be subject to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. One could be sent to jail for 12 months for refusing to tell a garda where one obtained a particular piece of property.</P>
    <P>If one does not want to worry about the balance of power in a free society, this is an easy way to do things. It makes for a hugely broadened capacity to trawl and gather information. It makes for a hugely broadened ability to pinpoint the network of things. It is a grand idea if one only looks at it from the point of view of finding ways to secure convictions efficiently. If one looks at it from the balance of a free society, it is inherently wrong. It turns our traditional position on its head and does so for no reason of which I am aware. I am not aware there is such a huge business in stolen property going on unprosecuted. I am aware, however, of a section in this Bill which effectively says that if a garda thinks something I possess is stolen or even thinks I have the proceeds of something that was stolen, he/she is entitled to demand from me an explanation as to where I got it. I find this a quite repugnant section and I am opposed to it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;which is being deleted. The section has been adjusted to meet the specific requirements of the Bill. Section 16 of the 1984 Act dealt with larceny and the proceeds from stolen goods; this section deals with theft, handling and obtaining by deception. We have taken what was contained in section 16, made some minor changes and inserted it into this Bill. It is important to point out that no change is being made to the law.</P>
      <P>Section 19 is intended to provide assistance in the investigation of offences of stealing or handling stolen property. Senators are seeking to delete the section from the Bill. The purpose of the section is to give the Garda power to require a person to give certain information in specifically defined circumstances. These circumstances are the Garda has reasonable grounds for suspecting an offence of stealing or handling, finds a person in possession of the property, has reasonable grounds for believing the property includes stolen property or the proceeds of it or-and has informed the person of his or her belief. It is not unreasonable, we would suggest, in those circumstances that the Garda be entitled to ask how the person acquired the property. If one finds someone in possession of one's stolen television it is not unreasonable to ask him how he acquired it.</P>
      <P>This section does not give the Garda the right to stop people at random and demand information. There must be reasonable grounds for the action and they must relate to a suspected offence of theft or handling. The gardaí will not arrive in someone's sitting room and ask a person where he or she got the chair he or she is sitting on unless they suspect an offence of theft or handling or that they have reasonable grounds for the action&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are many people whose property has been stolen. I wish to ensure, if they report it and if the property is suspected or found to be at a certain place, that the Garda has the resources to investigate and the appropriate powers to enforce that law. We have provisions in other legislation for search warrants, for seizing goods, for requiring persons to account for certain objects and for drawing appropriate inferences. Those provisions are necessary in the fight against crime but each of them is ringed with safeguards for the person.</P>
      <P>In the context of section 19, we have already set out what these safeguards are. Subsection (2) provides that any information given under the section will not be admitted in criminal proceedings against a person, other than, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, for an offence of failing to give a proper account when requested. As there is nothing new in the section &ndash; and I stress that &ndash; and since it forms a necessary aid to the Garda in investigating offences under the Bill, I cannot support the Senator's argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), lines 15 to 17 to delete paragraph <i>(b)</i>.</P>
      <P>Section 20(1) states:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Part relating to property which has been stolen apply&ndash;</P>

      <P>I know what is intended here &ndash; and I do not wish to repeat the unhappy metaphor of the sledgehammer and the nut &ndash; but this is a very sweeping measure. Let me take a particular example. There are societies in which a man's spouse is regarded as his property. If a man arrives in this country with a spouse whom he has allegedly stolen from somebody in a primitive society, is he guilty of an offence? The definition of property in this Bill does not exclude that possibility. What constitutes the property of an individual varies from society to society. The definition in the Bill does not deal with the matter satisfactorily &ndash; I would not have raised this without checking it. It states that &ldquo;property&rdquo; means money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property. It is deliberately drafted in the widest possible sense. What happens if the offence is committed abroad? How do we ensure that we do not penalise people for things that are far outside our criminal code? That is what we have to do if this subsection is to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I also apologise for my reaction. The Senator pushed the wrong button on that issue. In terms of section 20, the Bill defines the circumstances in which property will be regarded as having been stolen and thus being subject to the provisions of the Bill. Section 7 of the Larceny Act, 1990, contained a similar provision in relation to the handling of stolen property. Under section 20(1)(<i>b</i>), property which is stolen outside the State and brought into the country will be subject to the provisions of the Bill provided &ndash; and this is the important point &ndash; that an offence has also been committed where the property was stolen. By virtue of subsection (2), stolen property includes any property, including money, which represents the proceeds of stolen property. The effect of the amendment would be prevent a person who either stole such property abroad and brought it into the country or who acquired such property in this country, from being prosecuted under the Bill. Accordingly, a person might avoid liability for the offence. This seems a strange proposition. It means that a person who succeeds in removing property from another country in which it was stolen and bringing it to this country would frustrate the efforts of both countries to prosecute him or her because the person and the property were no longer present in the state in which the offence took place and our law would not recognise the property as stolen. This would afford the perpetrator a form of immunity. A similar provision is already contained in the Larceny Act, 1990, and I am not aware that it has proved in any way problematic in terms of unfairly penalising anyone. Therefore, its inclusion in the Bill is merely retaining an existing legislative provision or the 1990 Act.</P>

      <P>I have no idea why the Minister of State felt she had to become agitated on the equality issue. She is well aware that, on all equality legislation in this House, I was arguing <Col N="1146" /> against her conservative view on most issues. She is profoundly conservative on most of these issues &ndash; remarkably so for a Minister of State with responsibility for equality. Disappointingly, she has produced no constitutional amendments to assert the equality rights that were just struck down by a reactionary Supreme Court. She would be better employed in doing that than in lecturing me about equality and women's rights.</P>
      <P>Section 20(1) states: </P>
      <P>The provisions of this Part relating to property which has been stolen apply&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;to stealing outside the State [that is the first point, &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo;] if the stealing constituted an offence where . . . . . the property was stolen.</P>
      <P>It does not say &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence in this State&rdquo;. It says &ldquo;. . . if the stealing constituted an offence where the property was stolen&rdquo;. Nobody has a problem in relation to theft carried out outside this State where the stealing would have constituted an offence under the law of this State. The phraseology here is &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence where the property was stolen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for equality is saying it is all right to have in our legislation a provision which could well imply that, in societies where a wife is regarded as the property of her husband, the offence of stealing that wife is recognised as an offence in this country because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform drafts sloppy legislation. That is easily dealt with by a Report Stage amendment but I know the Minister of State and her senior Minister will not accept it. The provision should read &ldquo;where the theft was an offence in this State&rdquo;. I am quite happy to accept that any definition of theft should apply extra-territorially, provided it is a definition of theft as defined in Irish law and not in the law of the Taliban in Afghanistan, or Libya or other countries where women have no rights. The Minister of State can go away and think about it if she wishes but, as it stands, the provision covers that.</P>

Second, even if a woman is the property of her husband in that country &ndash; something neither I nor the Senator would agree with in terms of its application here &ndash; and if that is considered to be an ownership of property issue in that country, the ownership of the property and the stealing of that property are two different issues. If a man owns his wife in Africa and his <Col N="1147" /> wife travels with him to Ireland, does that mean he stole her?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simple. One need only look at the interpretation section with regard to the meaning of &ldquo;property&rdquo;. It means &ldquo;money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property&rdquo; as defined by the law in this land. We know what personal property means as interpreted by Irish law and it does not cover the issue mentioned by the Senator. Human trafficking is a separate issue which is dealt with in a different manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn might be right about the meaning of the definition. I believe it could include many things. There is a simple solution to this which is to specify that the stealing outside the State is stealing which would have constituted an offence within the State. It should not state &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen&rdquo;. There is the issue, for example, of joint ownership of property by married couples. It is difficult to talk about a spouse stealing something from a spouse. However, it is conceivable that there are other societies where such joint ownership does not exist and where a separated spouse could be guilty of the offence of theft in that society while they would not be guilty of it here.</P>
      <P>It is not my job to do the Department's work. There is a clear anomaly in this provision. The Department has sloppily included the words, &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen&rdquo;. That means anywhere on the planet. It is not my job to do the work of the Attorney General in rewriting the provision in a sensible way which deals with the issue. That is the Department's job. It has enough resources to do it. The Minister should offer to look at the issue again so we can move on. However, I will not move on from this issue until I get some sense from the Department.</P>

Under common and statute law, stealing means to take something and permanently deprive the owner thereof. We must legislate for what we can do within this jurisdiction. I am not taking the Minister's side but I am certain that if any person in some bizarre way stole a man's wife in Afghanistan or in an Asian country, if such can happen, we would not recognise that here. We do not recognise that in any form or fashion but we cannot seek to legislate for countries outside the EU, whatever chance we might have of doing so in the EU.</P>

In this case we are relying on the good sense of the DPP, which is usually in plentiful supply. The reason we are relying on it is that somebody drafted a section of the legislation which is extremely sloppy, regardless of whether it was drafted in 1990 or now. It uses the phrase &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen&rdquo;.</P>

They might come here and be followed by their husband who might make a formal complaint to the Garda Síochána. The letter of the law, as it is written here, states that the woman stole property which was an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen. Under Irish law, if somebody makes such a complaint to the Garda, the Garda can either ignore the law, which we all wish they would do, or they can enforce the law, <Col N="1149" /> which is probably what they should do under the legal system. Another alternative, before this goes any further, is that we can change the provision to one which is based on our definition of theft. It should be an offence under Irish law or the provision should not be there.</P>
      <P>Let us say the theft takes place in Northern Ireland or somewhere else. If it would be an offence under our law, by all means let us prosecute it here. I have no problem with that but I have a serious problem with theft being defined by cockamamie anti-women societies, of which there are many, who would define it differently.</P>

      <P>It annoys me intensely that women from Afghanistan and elsewhere are being used in this debate as an example concerning this section of the Bill. This section deals specifically with criminals who are robbing property in another jurisdiction and then coming here to sell it. Women from deprived countries are lucky if they come to Ireland with the clothes they have on their backs. To suggest that they are to be prosecuted and that this section of the Bill would enable the Garda to prosecute them because they have arrived with clothes that belong to their husbands and not to them is ridiculous. This section could not be used in that way and these women should not be used as an excuse to delete this section of the Bill. This section deals with hardened criminals who travel to other countries to commit crimes and then return to Ireland with stolen goods to sell. I find the examples used offensive.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan is out-numbered, but whether he can be out-manoeuvred is another matter. Senator Ryan takes the view that we in Ireland accept without question what is seen as right or wrong in another jurisdiction. However, for several decades this jurisdiction did not agree with the position of other countries with regard to divorce. In the 1970s, a Brazilian person domiciled here but previously divorced in Brazil took a Supreme Court case so that the divorce which had taken place in another jurisdiction could be recognised.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn has put the matter well. Extreme examples may be used but the thrust of this Bill is about fraud and criminal justice. It is not about stealing women or women's property. To quote extreme examples regarding the ownership or stealing of women, which is considered bizarre in this country, is wrong.</P>

Senator Ryan should leave these issues aside and accept that some of what takes place in other countries is totally unacceptable to us in Ireland. To drop this part of the Bill would mean that criminals could go to Northern Ireland, rob what they like, take it back to Sunday markets in the Republic and sell the goods. We would not be able to tackle such crime because the goods were stolen in another jurisdiction. That example might get the point home to Senator Ryan. It would not make sense to go down that road.

      <P>In page 18, line 44, after &ldquo;if,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in relation to property which is or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Who could object to the principle behind this amendment, anymore than the last amendment which we spent too much time discussing? We are dealing with money laundering. Who could object to dealing with that? However, as the Bill is currently drafted, a person is guilty of an offence if he or she thinks that he or she is money laundering, even if it turns out that is not the case. It is peculiar. If a person thinks the money is covered by the money laundering provisions and does not do anything about it, they are guilty of an offence because they thought it was money laundering even if it turns out it was not. Our first amendment tightens that up by saying &ldquo;if in relation to property which is or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The second amendment refers to the line &ldquo;without lawful authority or excuse (the proof of which shall lie on him or her)-.&rdquo;  In other words, there is an offence because a person might think he or she is doing something wrong even if it turns out they are not. Proof of the fact they had lawful authority or excuse rests on the person against whom the accusation is made. This changes the burden of proof. The legislation states the proof of lawful authority or excuse shall lie on the individual. In other words, the individual has to prove that what he or she was doing was lawful and that reverses the burden of proof. Unless there is an overwhelming argument, we should not change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are to section 31(1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which is being amended by section 21 of this Bill. As I understand it, the first of Senator Ryan's amendments proposes the addition of the words <Col N="1153" /> suggested and is intended to make it clear that the property in question is property which is or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct. I do not think it is necessary to do this. It is already clear from the wording of that section what type of property is being referred to. Subsection (1) states that a person shall be guilty of money laundering if he or she knows or believes that or is reckless about whether the property is or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct. Where the property is not or does not represent such proceeds, there can be no question of money laundering under the subsection. Clearly, the only property which will give rise to liability under the subsection is property which is or represents criminal proceeds. It does not seem necessary to add any further clarification to that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second amendment which would delete the words contained in brackets, these state that when a person claims that he or she had lawful authority or excuse for doing certain things in relation to criminal proceeds, which are otherwise criminalised under the section, he or she should be required to prove that there was lawful authority or excuse. This does not seem an unnatural requirement in the circumstances. It should not pose an insurmountable obstacle to a person claiming lawful authority or excuse. After all, it is well within the capacity of such a person to produce the necessary proof.</P>
      <P>If this amendment was accepted, it would mean that a person could claim lawful authority or excuse for laundering criminal proceeds and the Garda would then have to set about proving that he or she did not have lawful authority or excuse. Having proved that the person had laundered criminal proceeds, the Garda is then faced with a defence of lawful authority and excuse. Will we now expect it to disprove this when the obvious and logical solution is to expect the person to be able to prove that he or she had lawful authority or excuse? What are we trying to do here? Are we trying to hinder the effective implementation of anti-money laundering measures and allow the culprits to walk free or are we seeking to stop this criminal activity and give the Garda appropriate and effective weapons to combat it? I cannot accept that a claim of lawful authority or excuse, the proof of which is almost uniquely within the knowledge of the person claiming it, should not place an onus on that person to tell of that proof. Is that unreasonable? Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas got a lesson in the courts recently about the need to be attentive to due process, particularly to be attentive to what is written in anything that passes through the Houses. We all learned something from that. It is extremely important that we are aware of what we are doing. When that is not the case, we are liable to end up somewhat embarrassed. If the Minister of State wants to make a Second Stage speech about who is better at beating up criminals, fair enough, let her do that. <Col N="1154" /> Nobody is objecting to dealing with the issue of money laundering but we do so in a free society which is constructed according to certain norms and principles, one of which is that the burden is on society to prove that offenders are guilty and not on suspected offenders to prove to society that they are innocent. That is the reason for the two amendments.</P>
      <P>Since it is manifestly clear that we will not make any progress in this discussion, I do not propose to pursue the matter further. I hoped there would be specific reasons that these matters should be dealt with in a specific way. It is the eternal desire of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to abolish as many of our civil liberties as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of an important element of the new section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, dealing with cases where a court or jury may conclude that a person should have known that he or she was laundering criminal proceeds. In this regard, it is similar to amendments Nos. 7 and 8 with which we have already dealt and for the same reasons, we cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>Again, I bring to the attention of Senators the basic fact that the Bill's intention is to eliminate the possibilities that may exist for persons, through wilful blindness, to avoid liability for their actions. In this case, we are concerned with money laundering. The terrible events of 11 September in the USA have given added urgency to the fight against terrorism and all its manifestations. Money laundering associated with terrorist organisations has become a particular focus.</P>
      <P>The new section 31 will update the offence of money laundering. Part of that process is the closing off of opportunities for persons to maintain they did not know they were involved. I have already stated in relation to earlier amendments that the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of property should alert persons to the possibility that it was stolen. Similar considerations arise here. Where the circumstances are such that it is reasonable to conclude that the person knew or believed that or was reckless about whether the property was or represented criminal proceeds, he or she will be taken to have known, believed or have been reckless on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is a criminal justice Bill and justice would not be served by disregarding the possibility that the person did not know, etc. Therefore, this is not an absolute and it is open to a person to offer evidence to the effect that there is reasonable doubt on this score. As Senators know, the standard of proof in a crimi<Col N="1155" /> nal trial is beyond a reasonable doubt. If the person can produce evidence which casts a doubt on the reasonableness of the conclusion that he or she should, in the circumstances, have known that the property was or represented criminal proceeds, no liability will be attached to the person under the section. This is clearly spelled out in the section and represents an important safeguard against injustice arising in its implementation.</P>
    <P>As I already said, money laundering associated with terrorist organisations must be effectively tackled. I emphasise that legislation against money laundering is as much concerned with the laundering of ordinary criminal proceeds, for want of a better term. These organisations need money to carry out their activities and they need ways to disguise that money. Various methods of laundering have been developed. The terrorist or criminal organisation and the law enforcement agencies know the importance of disguising the origins or true ownership of that money. Our aim must be to divest them of it. To do that, we must have effective laws and there is no point leaving gaps for people to exploit. Such a gap would be to allow persons to feign ignorance and the provisions in question in this amendment would stop that.</P>
    <P>The provisions in question deal with situations where the circumstances are such that it is reasonable to conclude that a person should have known, etc, that he or she was laundering criminal proceeds. Therefore, we cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, the fact that an offence is heinous, such as that of 11 September, and that terrorists use money laundering unscrupulously is also acknowledged and accepted. These things do not, in themselves, justify a fundamental change in law, if that is what is involved. It is just too trite to expect that this will make it easier to secure convictions. There are many things we could do to make it easier to secure convictions. We could abolish jury trials. That has been proven to work in this regard. The Special Criminal Court does it with great efficiency. We could do a whole lot of things like that, but we must ask how we should balance these rights in a free society. If we do not balance them in a free society, the objective of all the terrorists, which is to destroy the free societies we have, will be well on the way to being achieved.</P>
      <P>The internment of 600 or 700 people in the United States without trial and incommunicado does not do much for the concept of freedom in the United States. It makes it easier for lazy prosecutors if they do not have to prove offences and the other person has to do the proving. What this is about is making prosecutions easier to sustain with less difficulty for the prosecutor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that a person is guilty of money laundering if he or she knows or believes that, or is reckless about whether, the property is <Col N="1156" /> or represents the proceeds of criminal conduct. Imagine the result if we changed the licensing laws pertaining to drunken driving and said that the proprietor of a licensed premises is an accessory to drunken driving unless he can show he had no reason to believe that a person on his premises was unfit to drive a car. Drunken driving kills 300 or 400 people per year. Suppose we said that anybody who served drink to a person who was liable to drive a car and kill somebody was an accessory after the fact and would have to go to court to prove that they did not know what the driver was doing, imagine the outcry there would be if publicans had to do that. It would possibly save 200 or 300 lives every year. The reason I would not support it is that I do not believe that people should have to prove their innocence, but that society should have to prove people are guilty. That is what the current disagreement is about. I do not propose to push the amendment to a vote because it would deprive me of the opportunity to raise the matter again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>We need to stress that the circumstances in which the acquisition takes place provide the key to the matter. The circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the property should have alerted the person to the possibility that it was stolen. We are dealing with money laundering and such issues. We do not want people who obviously knew what they were involved in saying they did not know or could not have known. As the Minister outlined clearly, people are guilty if they knew, believed or were reckless as to whether the property was or represented the proceeds of criminal conduct. That trust pervades the entire matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is concerned about making it easier to secure convictions. We need to secure convictions. The circumstances surrounding the acquisition of property must be taken into account. I do not know if the Senator is aware of all the victims of stolen property etc. One cannot always say, &ldquo;Let us make it difficult to secure convictions.&rdquo; We want to secure convictions. That is the whole point in changing the law.</P>

The same principle applies to money laundering. It is a way of dealing with the proceeds of crime. Why not do it? I would not do it because it is wrong, but it would deter an enormous number of people from selling drink to people who would leave the premises and drive away under the influence of alcohol.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete line 47 and in page 21, to delete lines 1 to 13.</P>
      <P>This part of the section to which the amendment refers is peculiar. It concerns the identification that an offence where a person handles property is an offence in another country. For the purposes of this, a document purporting to be signed by a lawyer practising in the state or territory in which the criminal conduct concerned is alleged to have occurred and stating that such conduct is an offence under the law of that state or territorial unit and a document purporting to be a translation of a document mentioned to be certified as correct by a person appearing to be competent shall be admissible in any proceedings without further proof as evidence of the matters mentioned in these documents.</P>
      <P>Yet again, in proving that something is an offence in another country, we will not make the effort of examining the law of that country. We will say that any lawyer from that country can write a letter making a certain allegation in his own language, after which we will get somebody to translate it into English. Then we will ask the defendant to prove the allegation is not true. That is not the way I understood we did our business concerning criminal law. I am disappointed because, obviously, we have identified with a scattergun every single thing that might constitute an offence.</P>
      <P>Sometimes guilty people get off. It is the price we pay for living in a free society. If one has a society in which one can be absolutely certain that everybody who is guilty is convicted, one will lock up many innocent people as well. In the light of the events of 11 September, we are in danger of erring on the side of prosecution. I do not propose to push my amendment further.</P>

      <P>Section 31(7)(<i>c</i>) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, substituted by section 21 of <Col N="1158" /> this Bill, will permit documentary evidence to be admissible concerning foreign law in cases of money laundering. Such evidence will be accepted without further proof unless the contrary is shown. The phrase &ldquo;unless the contrary is shown&rdquo; is important. Section 60 is similar in terms of how it relates to offences under the Bill and evidence that a person was an Irish citizen at the specified time of the crime.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to delete these provisions. The concern appears to be that these provisions preclude cross-examination either by the content of the document or the person who prepared it while the provisions of both sections provide that such a document shall be admissible in any proceedings without proof of evidence of the matters mentioned in them. They specify that this will not be the case where the contrary is shown, thus it is clearly open to the defendant to rebut such evidence.</P>
      <P>Our intention here is to include provisions such as these to attempt to streamline criminal procedures and speed up the work of the courts. These are clearly circumstances where it should be possible to tender evidence set out or documents where the matter purported to be proven is straightforward. In those circumstances it should not always be necessary to call the person as a witness.</P>
      <P>It is strange that on the one hand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is often criticised for delays in the processing of court cases when on the other hand he is criticised when he tries to do something practical to alleviate the problem. We see this as being practical. As outlined, if the contrary is shown it is up to the defendant to rebut that evidence and the matter is covered. The provision of the Bill which it is sought to delete is an important element of the fight against money laundering and offences of dishonesty. Accordingly we cannot agree to its deletion.</P>

      <P>The sanctimonious claim that there are good guys over there and bad guys like me who want different things is a load of nonsense. I want to defend the integrity of a criminal justice system which has served freedom well. This is about defending the freedoms of ordinary people, one of which is the right to be free from terrorism and crime. The basic belief that underlies our society is that we want to live in a free society, not one which is not free yet free from crime &ndash; we want a society which is free for each citizen and free from crime. What we are saying here is that it would be up to any defendant in a money laundering case to prove that these documents were not valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to the legal profession, to suggest that a document signed by any lawyer practising in the State or territorial unit would be acceptable as proof in a criminal case unless the contrary is proven is being very generous to the prosecution. He or she does not have to be a lawyer of any particular experience, even five years' <Col N="1159" /> experience, but someone who is simply qualified to be a lawyer in the country. I do not have an argument with the translation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that the person is entitled to rebut this but we live in a free society. It would be quite extraordinary if they could not rebut it. That is not a virtue but a necessity of any level of free society. Like much of this Bill, the provision is not written as it should be. There should be some level of experience or competence required of a lawyer.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty is that refutation of this will probably necessitate the defence bringing somebody from that country. The State is saved the expense of prosecution while the defence is burdened with the expense of bringing someone from another country to show that what is claimed to be the case is not the case. That is the way we do things now, apparently.</P>

      <P>We seem to be spending a lot of time discussing issues related to the new section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and perhaps this is a reflection of the importance of ensuring we get these provisions right. The new section 31 criminalises various actions which amount to money laundering. These actions include laundering by a person of his or her own criminal proceeds as well as laundering by a third party of others' criminal proceeds. The section also penalises persons who have known or suspected that property was or represented criminal proceeds. Obviously banks and so on are prime targets for those trying to launder dirty money <Col N="1160" /> and the 1994 Act places certain obligations on these institutions to have in place measures to detect and report suspicions of money laundering. There are, in addition, provisions which penalise anyone who prejudices any investigation into suspected money laundering by, for example, revealing that an investigation is under way or by tipping off the account holder. In view of the fact that money laundering may consist of acquiring, possessing or using criminal proceeds, there may be a danger that an institution will feel that it must, in addition to reporting any suspicion of laundering, divest itself of any account which it suspects of being used for money laundering or risk prosecution under the Act. In doing this it may feel it is contravening the provision against revealing that the account is being investigated by the Garda.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 is intended to get over this dilemma. It provides that where the institution has reported to the Garda its suspicions or where the Garda has informed the institution that it is suspected of being used for money laundering, the institution will not be guilty of laundering or tipping off a person so long as it is complying with Garda directions in the matter. I hope the House accepts this represents a sensible approach to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 23, lines 18 to 25, to delete paragraphs (<i>m</i>), (<i>n</i>) and (<i>o</i>).</P>
      <P>Section 24 of Part 4 deals with forgery. I do not take issue with much of it as, contrary to what the Minister likes to suggest, I am as much in favour of dealing with criminals as she is. I just have a different approach to dealing with them.</P>
      <P>The amendment arises out of three documents mentioned as instruments under this. One is a passport or document which can be used instead of a passport, the second is a document issued by or on behalf of the Minister to enter or remain in the State and the third is a registration under Article 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not want to encourage those practices but to put these into criminal law under forgery is pushing a little hard. Subparagraph (<i>m</i>) refers to a passport or document which can be used instead of a passport. Making the use of such a document a criminal offence would mean that a huge number of genuine asylum seekers would be penalised. Almost by definition a genuine asylum seeker had something to worry about in the country he or she was in and probably was not allowed to have a passport. They would therefore need forged travel documents in the first place to <Col N="1161" /> escape the persecution they were afraid of. If they arrived here with forged travel documents it appears that the combination of this and a subsequent section would mean they would automatically commit an offence. These subsections need to be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with forgery for the purposes of establishing what actions constitute forgery. It is necessary to state what items or instruments are capable of being forged and Part 4 therefore defines what is meant by an instrument. Under Part 4 a person will be guilty of an offence if he or she makes or uses such a false instrument or possesses or controls a false instrument or a machine or implement for making a false instrument.</P>
      <P>The amendment would delete references to passports and other documents which permit entry to the State or which permit a person to remain in the State. We cannot agree to the amendment as in the first place it would mean there would be no offence of forging a passport or abusing or possessing a forged passport, which is not acceptable. In any event, there is nothing new in what is contained in section 24. Forgery of passports and public documents is already an offence under the Forgery Act, 1913 and the Official Secrets Act, 1963. If the present Bill was not consolidating the Forgery Act and the relevant provisions of the Official Secrets Act, the forgery or uttering a forged passport would still be an offence. There is nothing new in including passports and other such documents in the list of documents set out in section 24.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that offences related to forgery are specific in this section. It will not be an offence to possess a false instrument, such as a forged passport, where there is lawful authority or excuse for its possession. Any reasonable interpretation of the provision means that a person with a well founded fear of persecution would have an excuse for possessing the false document. Accordingly, a person in possession of a false passport who can show that he or she fled another country in fear of persecution would have an acceptable excuse.</P>
      <P>The amendment is motivated by concerns about persons arriving in the State in possession of false travel documents. Under section 9(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996, a person who makes an application for asylum at the frontiers of the State must be given leave to land in the State by immigration officers. This requirement is absolute and applies regardless of whether the person in question has valid documentation, no documentation or forged or fraudulently obtained documentation. It is simply not possible for an immigration officer to refuse an asylum applicant leave to land, regardless of the circumstances. It is incorrect, therefore, to suggest that the inclusion of the documents in the list in section 24 somehow targets asylum seekers. The list set out in the section is intended to cover the fullest possible extent of documents of value worth forging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" />A passport is a valuable document, but the amendment seeks to exclude passports from the section of the Bill dealing with forgery. Is it suggested that a person caught with a number, sometimes a large number, of forged passports should not be guilty of an offence or that a person in possession of only a forged Irish passport should be penalised? Either of these propositions would render a nonsense of the law. It should also be borne in mind that the recent United Nations Resolution 1371, passed in the wake of terrorist atrocities in the United States on 11 September, obliges states to take measures to prevent counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of identity papers and travel documents. I cannot, therefore, support this amendment.</P>

      <P>We should examine all the things that happen in our society, including forgery. I accept the Minister of State's case, but to protect An Post's postage stamps from forgery, as proposed in section 24, is to give the company an unfair advantage over its competitors, which do not have such protection. To classify postage stamps with genuinely important documents harks back to a world in which the post office, whether the Royal Mail or An Post, provided a unique service. The idea that such institutions are worthy of special protection is an anomaly. A different world is suggested by the notion that one could be given ten years in jail for forging a postage stamp. Many of the items listed in this section belong to another era and are no longer the stuff of serious forgery. They could be removed from legislation at a future stage.</P>

The quality of reprographic equipment now available is so good that, with a little work on a home scanner, I could produce a £20 note that would be accepted in any public house late at night. Legislation needs to <Col N="1163" /> keep pace with the quality of scanners, although I do not know how it can be done. Oireachtas paper is precious and Members should be careful of it, as it can be abused. It could be scanned to produce paper of such high quality that it would be impossible to tell it was not the real thing.

The Bill does not contain specifications in relation to the gender or age of those being searched.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 42, subsection (1), between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(iv)&nbsp;order an inquiry into the resources of the convicted person (and in particular into any financial accounts, held by such convicted person, or held by another on his or her behalf) and upon being satisfied that such resources are sufficient to discharge a sum not exceeding the value of the first mentioned property, order that a sum not exceeding the value of such property be paid from such resources of the convicted person <Col N="1164" /> as the Court shall direct, to the person entitled to the first mentioned property.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the provisions of section 56 relate specifically to the taking of property from the possession of a person when arrested. We need to go a step further so the convicted person's general assets can be examined. If they have the resources, there should be a provision to restore the property to the person entitled to it. Refining and restricting the provision discriminates against the victim. That is not wise and I would ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 56 replaces a similar provision in the Larceny Act, 1916, concerning the restitution of property following prosecution. The section also permits that a sum of money taken out of the possession of the accused when arrested, and representing the value of the stolen property, be paid by the convicted person to the owner of the stolen property.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the court will embark on an inquiry into the resources of the convicted person to ascertain the financial resources available to him or her. If these resources exceed the value of the stolen property then restitution will be ordered to an amount equal to that value.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the intention of the amendment. No one wishes victims to suffer further by being unable to recover property or the proceeds of the sale of that property, nor to see anyone benefiting from crime. However, the amendment is unnecessary since the provision for the payment of compensation by a convicted person to the victim is already contained in section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993. That section permits the court, following conviction, to make an order requiring the person to pay compensation in respect of any personal injury or loss resulting from the offence to anyone who has suffered such injury or loss. This provision includes the victim of the theft.</P>
      <P>The effect of section 56, taken with the provisions of the 1993 Act, is that a victim who has not recovered an amount at least equal to the value of the property can still seek compensation for the difference under the 1993 Act. I hope the Senator will accept that the amendment is unnecessary because of the provisions of section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's comments. However, would she consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage to include reference to the 1993 Act for the purposes of restitution? That would sit easily within this section. The Bill incorporates a wide variety of criminal acts and the inclusion of a reference to the 1993 Act in this section would be appropriate. The Minister of State should consider such a reference as this Bill will be seen as the relevant statute regarding all of these issues. Since this section deals with restitution the Minister of State <Col N="1165" /> should include in it all relevant statutory references. Will she consider such an amendment?</P>

      <P>This Bill covers restitution and the amount of compensation. However, the 1993 Act deals not just with compensation for loss of property, but wider issues such as compensation in the case of injury incurred during that loss. It is preferable not to cross-reference or change the 1993 Act, but to add this Bill to its provisions so a victim can access either legislation, or both. That is a preferable approach.</P>

Section 57(1) states, &ldquo;In a trial on indictment of an offence under this Act, the trial judge may order that copies of any or all of the following documents shall be given to the jury.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 57(3) refers to a situation in which a trial judge has made an order regarding an affidavit mentioned in section 57(1)(<i>g</i>), namely, an affidavit by an accountant summarising in a form which is likely to be comprehended by the jury, any transactions by the accused. This would involve the giving of an affidavit by an accountant to the jury to help it understand what is going on.</P>
      <P>No one disputes this provision, but the affidavit does not appear to be open to challenge by the defence. In other words, the affidavit becomes the document. My amendment proposes that any person who is summoned as an expert witness under this section should be tendered as a witness by the prosecution if so required by, or on behalf of, a defendant. The objective of this provision is to allow for the provider of such an affidavit to be cross-examined by the defence.</P>
      <P>If this provision is not accepted there is no guarantee that the affidavit will be correct, even though it may be an honest endeavour on the part of the individual. The process of cross-examination is not only used to find dishonesty, but also to find errors. Cross-examination is the process by which the meanings of words, contradictory phrases, etc., in otherwise honest statements, are highlighted. My amendment would require that the provider of an affidavit would be open to cross-examination by the defence where it so wishes.</P>

      <P>This amendment refers to the <Col N="1166" /> section of the Bill which deals with the provision of information to juries to assist them in their deliberations. Section 57 seeks to address the growing complexity of fraud trials by making evidence available to juries in as clear a manner as possible. It implements a recommendation of the Government's advisory committee on fraud and the Law Reform Commission. The committee on court practice and procedure also considered that the trial judge should be empowered to order the provision of documents to the jury.</P>
      <P>Section 57(3) provides that where the judge has ordered that an affidavit by an accountant be given to a jury, the accountant will be summoned as an expert witness by the prosecution and may be required by the trial judge, in an appropriate case, to give evidence regarding any relevant accountancy procedures and principles. The effect of this provision is that the accountant who has sworn the affidavit will be summoned as a witness by the prosecution. The provision in section 57(3)(<i>a</i>) is mandatory and this will give the defendant an opportunity to cross-examine the accountant about relevant matters.</P>
      <P>The amendment would not add to this provision as it stipulates that the accountant will be tendered as prosecution witness if the defendant so requires. Does this mean that, contrary to section 57(3)(<i>a</i>), the accountant would only be required to attend as a witness where the defendant so wishes? Unless I misread the amendment, this would mean that the accountant would not otherwise be required to attend. If I accepted the amendment I would conclude that section 57(3)(<i>a</i>) is unnecessary and that the issue of the accountant's attendance should be a matter solely for the defendant. In practical terms it appears that a defendant would be likely to insist on such an attendance in almost all cases.</P>
      <P>The amendment would give rise to confusion. Section 57(3)(<i>a</i>) provides that, where an accountant has sworn an affidavit in accordance with section 57(1)(<i>g</i>), and the judge decides that it should be given to the jury to assist it in its deliberations, the accountant shall be summoned by the prosecution to attend the trial as a witness. In that context it would be open to the defendant to cross-examine the witness.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 44, lines 28 to 40 to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)&nbsp;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;It shall be an offence to commit fraud in relation to a firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" />(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;In this section &lsquo;fraud' in relation to a firm means:</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;Dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for any person, or of causing loss to the firm, inducing the firm to act or refrain from acting.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;Intentional misrepresentation materially affecting financial statements of a firm.</P>
    <P>(iii)&nbsp;Dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for any person, or of causing loss to the firm.</P>
    <P>(I)&nbsp;Destroying defacing, concealing, falsifying or altering any financial statements, account or any document made or required for any accounting purpose; or</P>
    <P>(II)&nbsp;failing to make or complete any financial statements, account or any such document; or</P>
    <P>(III)&nbsp;in furnishing information for any purpose producing or making use of any account, or any such document, which to the knowledge of the person furnishing such information is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular; or</P>
    <P>(IV)&nbsp;the suppressing or omitting the effective material transactions from the firm's books of account; or</P>
    <P>(V)&nbsp;recording in the firm's books of account material transactions without substance.</P>
    <P>(iv)&nbsp;Dishonestly appropriating property of the firm with the consent of the firm.</P>
    <P>(v)&nbsp;Intention misapplication of an accounting policy or policies so that the financial statements do not comply in all material respects with the requirements of company law and accounting standards.</P>
    <P>(vi)&nbsp;The use of the firm for any of the fraudulent purposes referred to in &lsquo;(i)' to &lsquo;(v)' above.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;For the purpose of the section a person shall be treated as falsifying financial statements, and or other documents if he or she makes or incurs in making therein an entry which is or may be misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular or,</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;omits or concurs in omitting a material particular therefrom.</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;If, having regard solely to information obtained in the course of an audit of the financial statements an auditor has reasonable grounds to believe that a fraud in relation to <Col N="1168" /> the firm may have been commtted, the auditor shall:</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;Except in the circumstances outlined in (3) below, communicate in writing particulars of the possible fraud to the firm without undue delay and request the firm to:</P>
    <P>(I)&nbsp;take such action as is necessary for the purpose of rectifying the matter; and</P>
    <P>(II)&nbsp;notify the director and a member of An Garda Síochána of the information upon which the auditor has based the notification.</P>
    <P>(A)&nbsp;If the auditor has reasonable grounds to believe that the firm has failed to notify the director and a member of An Garda Síochána within seven days of the auditor communicating in writing particulars of the possible fraud to the firm, the auditor shall forward a copy of that   communication to the director and a member of An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp;If, having regard solely to information obtained in the course of the audit of the financial statements, an auditor has reasonable grounds to believe that a firm is being used or may have been used for a fraudulent purpose or that a director or directors of the firm in that capacity may have defrauded the firm, its creditors or other persons, the auditor shall communicate particulars of the possible fraud to the director and a member of An Garda Síochána without undue delay.</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;The application to notify the director and a member of An Garda Síochána in paragraphs <i>(d)</i> and<i> (e) </i>shall not apply if the effect of the possible fraud is minor or otherwise immaterial.</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>)&nbsp;In this subsection, subparagraphs (i) to (v) &lsquo;Auditor' means an auditor to the firm appointed in accordance with section 160 of the Companies Act, 1963, and &lsquo;the Director' means the Director of Corporate Enforcement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I propose the deletion of subsection 59(2). This subsection places a huge onus on accountants. The subsection refers to offences which may have been committed by the firm concerned or in relation to the affairs of a firm by a partner. It requests practitioners to make an assessment as to whether something is happening and to make a judgment on that. This is a huge task over and above the normal professional demands on accountants. Nowhere in the subsection or elsewhere in the Bill is there a clear definition of fraud. My proposed new subsection would give such a definition.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine this amendment <Col N="1169" /> with a view to accepting it in total. It is important that the amendment be discussed in detail. Because of the guillotine motion, there was not sufficient time to discuss it adequately in the Dáil and it is important that it receives a proper airing here.</P>
    <P>The present subsection is extremely vague and impractical. It places an onus on accountants to have a knowledge of criminal law which is not within their normal competence. It requests accountants to do something which they do not have the competence to do. This is unfair and it is wrong to place such a statutory requirement on them. It is neither practical nor realistic. The accountancy profession could not operate in an open and business like fashion if a demand such as this was hanging around its neck.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes a framework which is similar to that recommended in the 1993 report of the Government's advisory committee on fraud and follows the approach taken in that report. It is also similar to what is currently in place in many EU member states and is similar to the framework in the 1997 Taxation (Consolidation) Act. What is proposed in the amendment is already familiar in taxation law, is similar to practice in other member states and was recommended in 1993. It has all the ingredients for success. I encourage the Minister to accept it and to include it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I realise that officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have had discussions with representatives of the accountancy profession and that there is an understanding of the difficulties faced by accountants. I ask the Minister to acknowledge these practical difficulties. It is important that a reasonable approach be adopted. The current requirements are not reasonable. It is unreasonable to expect an accountant to have detailed knowledge of criminal law or to be aware of circumstances which would indicate that the criminal law has been breached. That would be like asking Senator O'Donovan, or indeed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the course of their legal practices to be aware of practical details of accountancy matters. The subsection leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to recognise the intent of the amendment. It is intended to be helpful and to strengthen the Bill. The amendment is operable whereas section 59(2) is not. There is a case for accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment would entail a substantial change to the intention behind section 59. The section places an obligation on certain persons to report to the Garda where the accounts of a firm indicate that an offence under the legislation may have been committed by the firm or by a director, manager, etc. Where the person makes such a report in <Col N="1170" /> good faith it will not be treated as a breach of any statutory or other duty of confidentiality which the person owed to the firm.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with the reporting of a criminal offence, such as offences under the Bill involving dishonesty. The amendment seeks to deal with fraud in relation to a firm and it defines fraud for that purpose. A significant part of the definition repeats the provisions set out in section 10, which is concerned with false accounting. There is a concern that such an approach is more likely to lead to confusion rather than clarify this issue.</P>
      <P>The amendment also deals with matters such as the preparation of financial statements, which are more appropriately dealt with by the Companies Acts. In the amendment the obligation on certain persons to report instances of fraud in relation to a firm involves a number of stages beginning with a report to the firm and a request that it take certain action to rectify the matter, followed by a report to the appropriate authority, including the Garda. Only if the firm fails to take this action will the person inform the appropriate authorities. The amendment also provide that a person may report to the appropriate authorities where he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that a firm has been used for a fraudulent purpose.</P>
      <P>While it is clear the amendment recognises that certain persons, such as auditors, should have certain responsibilities where they come across indications that the business of the firm is being conducted in a manner which is fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate, it appears to go beyond what is required in the Bill, which is mainly concerned with offences of dishonesty. Section 59 requires that auditors should report indications of dishonesty by a firm or certain persons within it. Where an offence may have been committed, it is a matter for the Garda to investigate. Therefore, it is logical that any indication that an offence may be committed by the firm or by certain persons within it should be reported to the Garda. We consider that a direct report should be made to the Garda, who should undertake any investigation.</P>
      <P>I accept that any breach of a statutory duty by firms should be reported to the appropriate authorities and I am sure appropriate mechanisms provide for this. However, section 59 is concerned with the offence of dishonesty by a firm and the way to deal with it is to require the auditor to report directly to the Garda. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the amendment. There are two approaches to this issue and we consider that a direct report to the Garda is the most appropriate one.</P>

      <P>I am dissatisfied with the Minister's response. I hoped she would have been more constructive and taken on board what was <Col N="1171" /> recommended. Section 59(2) places an onus on a person almost to make a value judgment on the company. It expects the person to define the <i>mens rea, </i>the state of mind or intent of the firm or practitioners within the firm. How will it be clearly defined when a practitioner will conclude that an offence may have been committed by the firm, or by a partner in the case of a corporate or incorporated body? There is no definition to address this aspect.</P>
      <P>The section is weak because of the lack of clear and specific guidelines. It fails to provide a clear direction to practitioners and places a huge onus on their shoulders while not stipulating what they must do. It is unfair and out of order to request a practitioner to make that kind of judgment. People may consider that their company, firm or partnership is engaged in suspect activities but it places too much of an onus on them to approach the Garda. They should be first expected to confront their partners or colleagues. It would then be for the firm, company or partnership to fulfil its responsibilities. Failing that the individual could act.</P>
      <P>The amendment is in line with the recommendations of the advisory committee on fraud published in 1993 and is similar to what prevails in other EU member states. I urge the Minister to accept it because it would strengthen rather than weaken the Bill. I am sure he and his officials, who will have discussed this aspect with the accountancy bodies, see merit in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Senator Taylor-Quinn's point of view. We are concerned here with external auditors, not staff within the firm. The provisions affect those involved in external audits who encounter acts which they believe may constitute an offence. Senator Taylor-Quinn suggests that auditors should in the first instance report directly to the firm but that would mean their involvement in investigations into matters which, given that they are potentially criminal offences, should more appropriately be undertaken by the Garda. The auditors, who are not employees, do not need to be convinced that a crime has been committed. Rather than becoming the investigators and reporting their concerns to the firm, which may or may not report the matter to the Garda, they should in the first instance report to the Garda. In any event, the matter would have to be reported to the Garda by the auditors. It is clearly a different way of proceeding, one which stipulates that a number of stages must be gone through. For example, an external auditor would have to approach the firm and indicate that they were unhappy because they believe a criminal offence has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, a case of either adding those stages to the process or, in the event of a serious criminal offence being committed, obliging the <Col N="1172" /> external auditor to approach the Garda directly in order to allow members of the force to investigate the matter. I hope that makes the position clear. I accept the Senator's concern about whether an accountant or employee of the firm would be obliged to take action, but that will not be the case. The external auditor will be obliged to approach the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister of State is referring to cases where external auditors are brought in to audit the books of a firm. However, the section says that an offence &ldquo;may have been committed&rdquo;, which is not a definitive statement. In my opinion there is a need to define the position more clearly. The section also includes the phrase &ldquo;such an offence may have been committed in relation to its affairs by a partner of the firm&rdquo;, which means that the position is quite nebulous; it is not clear or specific. I accept that external auditors are brought in to audit the accounts of firms. However, there is a need to be more specific and definite if we are going to include this provision in statute law. What is being introduced in subsection (2) is quite draconian and because there is no definition it can be interpreted in a variety of ways. That is dangerous. I request the Minister of State to be more open to my proposal.</P>
      <P>The section states that a relevant person is &ldquo;a person who audits the accounts of a firm or . . .  who otherwise with a view to reward assists or advises a firm in the preparation or delivery of any information, or of any declaration, return, account or other document, which the person knows will be, or is likely to be, used for the purpose of keeping or auditing the accounts of the firm&rdquo;. In one sense, the language is quite specific in terms of the persons to whom the section will apply. I ask the Minister of State to take the amendment on board.</P>

      <P>It is good that we are having this debate because it might clarify matters for people who have expressed their concerns about this issue with Senator Taylor-Quinn and officials of my Department. I draw the Senator's attention to paragraph (<i>d</i>) of her amendment which states:</P>
      <P>If, having regard solely to information obtained in the course of an audit of the financial statements an auditor has reasonable grounds to believe that a fraud in relation to the firm may have been committed . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used here and in the section as it stands because no one expects the auditor to do the work of the Garda Síochána or to be in a position to be sure that a crime has been committed. Use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is important because it would be unfair of us to expect an auditor to carry out the entire investigation and to be certain that a crime has been committed. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; allows <Col N="1173" /> protection for the auditor in this regard. It is merely a question of whether, if a crime may have been committed, one goes directly to the Garda or goes through the various stages outlined by the Senator. We submit that it would be better, from the point of view of everyone involved, if the auditor approached the Garda directly if he or she suspects that a criminal offence has been committed in order that the matter can be investigated by members of the force. Gardaí are experts in investigating crime and it would not be fair to ask an auditor to investigate a crime. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used because auditors may not be <Col N="1174" /> certain that a crime has been committed and it is important that it be retained.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is making a valiant attempt to sway me but I am not convinced by her argument. In my opinion, section 59(2), which states that &ldquo;a relevant person shall, notwithstanding any professional obligation of privilege or confidentiality, report that fact to a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;, is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 8, to delete &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a long discussion on section 9 on Committee Stage, in which I attempted to persuade the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who was here at that stage that the section was poorly worded. I have no objection to what is in the section but, as it reads now, a person who dishonestly operates or causes to be operated a computer within the State with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, is guilty of an offence. My argument was that, at the very least, it made it an offence to dishonestly use a computer, or to dishonestly use a computer to make a gain for oneself or to cause loss to somebody else.</P>
      <P>The simplest way to achieve the objective that the Bill sets out to achieve is to remove the word &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; from the first line and to rewrite the section to read as follows: &ldquo;A person who, whether within or outside the State, operates or causes to be operated a computer within the State with the intention of dishonestly making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of dishonestly causing loss to another, is guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  That would get rid of the anomaly of turning something trivial, that is, dishonestly using somebody's computer, into a criminal offence but would leave the intent of ensuring that nobody uses a computer for dishonest purposes, which is an entirely different matter. As I said on Committee Stage, there are thousands of computers at my place of work which, I suspect, are technically used dishonestly, given the very clear definition of &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; in this Bill. It refers to a claim of right made in good faith. On many occasions, students may not have a claim of right to use a computer and, accordingly, they would use it dishonestly. However, that is not what the section is about and that is why I suggest the amendments.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Ryan's amendment. I agree that, with his suggested change, section 9(1) makes a lot more common sense and it actually strengthens the intent of the section. It provides much greater clarity, is much more specific and fits in much easier with the interpretation of &ldquo;dishonestly&rdquo; in section 2 of the Bill. This should be taken on board.</P>
      <P>I did not contribute to the earlier debate on this but the provision proposed by Senator Ryan would read:</P>
      <P>A person who, whether within or outside the State, operates or causes to be operated a computer within the State with the intention of dishonestly making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of dishonestly causing loss to another, is guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>It is specific and clear and should be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>We had an opportunity to discuss this issue when the Members were voting. It is not a trivial offence to dishonestly use somebody's computer if the use of that computer is to make a gain for oneself or cause a loss to another. If somebody goes into another person's office and uses their computer to make a gain or cause a loss, and millions of pounds can be moved very quickly, the offence is the dishonest use of the computer to make that gain.</P>
      <P>We all have computers in our offices. The issue is not the use of the machine but to dishonestly use the machine for dishonest purposes. With regard to the point about making a gain honestly, if one honestly uses the machine to make a gain, that is fine but there is dishonest use of the machine to make a gain and it is the connection of the two that is relevant. One is not authorised to use the machine in one's office or anybody else's office dishonestly. The dishonest use of the machine to make a gain is an offence.</P>

      <P>We are back where we started. The Minister is wrong. The issue is not making a gain or a loss, it is making a dishonest gain or a dishonest loss. One can play casinos on computers now. One can gamble via computers. Let us say I use a computer which I do not have the authority to use, spend £100 on my credit card with Paddy Power Bookmakers and I gain because I win and he loses. Under the section I have committed a criminal offence of considerable proportions because I have dishonestly used somebody's computer. However, the intent of the section is to <Col N="1177" /> deal with people who use computers to do dishonest things.</P>
      <P>The issue is clear to me and Senator Taylor-Quinn. They are different concepts. A student in any of our third level institutions, where there are thousands of computers, can do something legitimate on a computer but of which the college disapproves. It might be buying pornography, of which I disapprove. That is not what the section is about but those students will be classified as committing the same type of offence as somebody who is involved in computer fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not disagree with the principle of the section but it is poorly drafted. After the embarrassment the Houses of the Oireachtas suffered in the High Court, we ought to be extremely careful <Col N="1178" /> about the language we use and its structure because it matters later. I am disappointed that what I believe to be a constructive suggestion is not being accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not lightly refusing to accept the amendment. We checked it with the Parliamentary Counsel. The Senators should also note that, on the previous page, sections 6 and 7 both begin with the phrase, &ldquo;A person who dishonestly. . . &rdquo;. The same phrase is used in section 9. Section 6 refers to making a gain or causing a loss while section 9 deals with the use of a computer to do that. Making a gain or causing a loss is actually covered in section 6.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to rehearse too much of what we discussed on section 20, least of all to provoke the wrath of my seconder, but we came upon an issue which deserves to be addressed. Section 20 states: &ldquo;The provisions of this Part relating to property which has been stolen apply . . . (<i>b</i>) to stealing outside the State if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen,&rdquo;. My concern was, and still is, that definitions of ownership of property are far from <Col N="1179" /> universal or consistent. The issue I raised, which provoked considerable agitation, was that in some societies, not just in societies in the middle of civil war, women are regarded as the property of their husbands and, therefore, it would be conceivable that somebody who perhaps married or developed a relationship with somebody who was married in one of these societies and came home here could be, and would have to be, prosecuted under Irish law for theft. That was the more extreme example and I do not want to go back to that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of debate, it is always useful to use good examples to illustrate the point and that is what I am doing.</P>
      <P>The second example is much more serious. In many societies women in general, least of all married women, have no rights to own property. Anything in their possession is the property of the husband. Therefore, if they arrived here with only their own clothes and whatever money they had, they would, technically, be guilty of the offence of theft under this section as it stands because what they did would be an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen. In the country from which they came, it would have been an offence and in this country, therefore, it would be an offence according to this Bill. That is wrong. We should apply our standards to what constitutes illegal and legal behaviour.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 suggest that the section should be rewritten slightly to achieve exactly what the Minister of State said we wanted to achieve, that is, to change the position where somebody could commit an offence in one jurisdiction, come here and not be prosecuted for that offence. That would be wrong. People could steal property in one jurisdiction, sell it, bring the proceeds here and not be prosecuted for theft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggested amendment No. 4 is that section 20(1)(<i>b</i>) would read as follows: &ldquo;to stealing outside the State if the stealing would have constituted an offence in the State at the time when the property was stolen&rdquo;. In other words, anybody who committed an offence of stealing in any other jurisdiction which would have been an offence in this State would be guilty of an offence and would be capable of being pursued by the law as distinct from the present situation where anybody who commits an offence of theft as defined in Zimbabwe, Libya and Saudi Arabia, for instance, could be prosecuted here. These are countries and this applies to all of them. My amended version would mean that they would <Col N="1180" /> only be capable of being prosecuted if what they did was an offence in this State.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. If the amendment was accepted, section 20(1)(<i>b</i>) would read: &ldquo;to stealing outside the State if the stealing would have constituted an offence in the State at the time the property was stolen.&rdquo; To me, that would make eminent common sense. In relation to the other details in promoting the case, I do not think the Senator gave me any convincing arguments in that respect. The amendment is, however, prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not an offence under our law, we will not prosecute and I will endeavour to explain that. I draw Senators' attention to the fact that under the Married Women's Status Act, a woman in our country is entitled to own her own property so that makes the position clearly different from that of a woman in another country who is not entitled to own her own property. The other point I want to make in regard to the woman owning her own property is that where she steals property that is deemed to be her own &ndash; in other words, her own clothes &ndash; in this country, she will be deemed to have owned that property. If she steals property deemed to be that of her husband &ndash; for example, money from his bank account or whatever &ndash; we may prosecute her but we would not prosecute if she stole and brought property to this country which was deemed to be her own. It must be an offence in this country as in the other country.</P>
      <P>We are both trying to achieve the same thing here in terms of the wording. We are both saying &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; and it has been asked where does it say that is clearly an offence in that state and in this State. That is the issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go through the wording Senator Taylor-Quinn read out and will take first the words proposed to be removed. There is a difficulty with removing the words &ldquo;where and&rdquo;. The subsection reads &ldquo;to stealing outside the State if the stealing constitutes an offence where&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;where&rdquo; refers to the other state. If one removes the word &ldquo;where&rdquo;, one is taking out the offence in the other state. That is one concern we have. The second concern is that there is no requirement to add the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; because this Bill is <Col N="1181" /> the cross-reference to it happening in this State. The Bill deals with the fact that it is an offence in this State. This section proposes to bring in the offence in this State at the same time. If we were to accept the amendment, it would do the opposite by taking out the word &ldquo;where&rdquo; pertaining to the other state and duplicate &ldquo;in this state&rdquo;. The English sounds great, but the legal English covers what we are trying to cover, which is that it has to be an offence in this State and the other state.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do indeed. I am intrigued by the idea that the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, could say to me that a section says &ldquo;the provisions of this Part relating to property which has been stolen apply . . . to stealing outside the State&rdquo;, that that will continue, and then tell me that it does not apply to stealing outside the State if we take out the word &ldquo;where&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to constitute an offence in the other state. It is not just the stealing that is relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely the point we are making. Stealing is defined in this legislation. To leave the definition of what constitutes stealing to the other jurisdiction is to leave us open to peculiar anomalies. I say this at the risk of provoking Senator Taylor-Quinn's wrath.</P>

      <P>I have considerable experience in dealing with legislation and that is the most peculiar interpretation I have seen in legislation in my time in this House. What we are discussing deals specifically with extra-territorial offences, not offences within the State. This Bill applies to the State, in which case it should not deal with extra-territorial offences. One cannot have it both ways. If it deals with extra-territorial offences, it is based on what is an offence either here or in the other jurisdiction. Section 20(1)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;if the stealing constituted an offence where and at the time when the property was stolen&rdquo;. That means that it does not constitute an offence here but where the property was stolen.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement and, in particular, notes the budgetary response to the taxation and other commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF).</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing Senators to discuss the Minister's Budget Statement in this House on each of the last three occasions. It has been indicated to me that it may not be a great idea for this House to discuss the budget at this time, as attention is, understandably, focused on the Dáil. It is crucially important, however, that Senators put their views on the record of the House, rather than looking for an opportunity to do so on the Order of Business tomorrow morning. It should be recognised that merely an initial response can be given at this point, as the Budget Statement has been given in the last hour or so. The statements I make represent my initial reaction to the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's decision to reassign the surplus reserves of the Central Bank to the national finances is a positive move, in the best interests of Irish taxpayers. I have raised the quaintly described surplus revenues of the Central Bank on many occasions during the past ten years. The Minister's decision represents the best way to address the matter. I have no doubt that the economic purists and virgins of this country, such as Moore McDowell, are unhappy with anything which is not written in college textbooks. In this House and at meetings, I have pleaded with the <Col N="1183" /><Col N="1184" /> Minister to show this kind of creative thinking. Similarly, I have often asked the Minister not to renege on his commitment to the national development plan and to making progress on the requirements of the PPF. While more could have been done in the budget to this end, I recognise that he has managed to put money that was unusable to good use. I agree with the decision to demonstrate good housekeeping by continuing to invest in the pension reserve, which is important. I wish to move on to the main issues.</P>
    <P>As president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I believe the issue of income tax is a central plank of the financial aspects of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. A commitment was made that workers would, in the round, receive tax benefits over the three years of the PPF amounting to between 9.5% and 10%. When I spoke on the budget last year, gains had been made of between 4% and 6%, bringing us half way to our target. Speaking in this House recently, I said it was crucially important for workers who voted for the PPF to see further progress in the budget. It would be an important step regardless of how it could be achieved, I said, if we were to retain trust and confidence in the process of national partnership. Considering that about 5% or 6% of the tax gains remained to be achieved, the least we sought this year was a further 2% to 4%. I acknowledge that at least 2% has been given to the group I have mentioned and in some cases a net tax gain of 3.5% will result from today's budget. The ICTU admits that the Minister has covered half the distance and it hopes that the remaining half will be covered in the third PPF budget next year. I recognise that it is a positive development.</P>
    <P>Like the curate's egg, the budget is good in parts, as evidenced by its social welfare provisions. There have been improvements in social welfare payments and the Government listened to much of the case put forward by the ICTU in its pre-budget discussions with the Minister. However, what has been delivered and for what did we look?</P>
    <P>We asked that the lowest payment, employment assistance, be increased to a minimum of £100 from the current level of £83 or £84. The Minister has increased it to £94.50 which does not meet our request, but it goes a long way towards it. The other increases work out at about £8 per week for various payments and allowances and this is also progress.</P>
    <P>However, we have been trying to establish a link between social welfare payments and the average industrial wage to create a certain ratio which could be worked on from year to year, even if only as an objective at this stage. The Minister has not done so and that is a reflection of the current finances. We are disappointed in this regard, as will be those who deal with people who are dependent on social welfare payments. <Col N="1185" /> The Minister's decision in this regard will also be regretted by trade unions which operate in areas in which many people are dependent on social welfare. Teachers in disadvantaged areas feel strongly that progress in this area, while welcome, should be made more permanent through a linkage with the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed by the Minister's decision to increase VAT to 21%, a move for which he gave no justification. This measure is disappointing at a time when we are trying to improve consumer confidence. VAT is being increased to a level which was originally introduced as an emergency measure many years ago. The Minister of State may correct me on this point, but it is like the emergency which never ended. This measure could damage consumer confidence. Senator Quinn, who will second the motion, will support me on this point even though he may disagree with some of my other comments. This move may prove to be a mistake given that we are trying to retain competitiveness, create wealth, ensure that the economy moves forward and maintain confidence.</P>
    <P>I also regret that the Minister crumbled so cravenly in front of the IBEC and business lobby on the issue of employers' PRSI. I sought odds on the fact that the Minister was not for turning on this issue. He will claim that there is still no limit. However, the reality is that he has given back &euro;347 million to the business community which could be better used on something sensible like primary education or even the roads in Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have spent this money in some other way, rather than putting it back into IBEC's claws.</P>
      <P>It is important to state that it was a good idea to sensibly use the surplus reserves in the Central Bank. The Government was perfectly entitled to do so, despite what some commentators might suggest. If Mr. Duisenberg has reservations about this measure he can stuff himself. I am delighted that the Government can solidly show its fingers to Commissioner Solbes and Mr. Duisenberg as they cannot plead European directives or law or illegality on this issue. We are doing what we want to do with our money in the interests of our people and for the betterment of taxpayers and citizens. I welcome this measure which was a creative use of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall impact of the tax measures which give £500 million back to taxpayers was no less than we could have expected. We sought such provisions and the Minister has just done enough to keep us quiet on this side of the House. He has <Col N="1186" /> gone half way towards the PPF commitments and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowances will be welcomed, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Teachers working in such areas constantly raise with me the pressure on families at that time of year and this positive improvement will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I did not have time to study all of the budget's capital spending provisions, but I examined the measures regarding education. There is an increase of &euro;36 million in spending on primary school buildings, but this is not enough. I acknowledge that it is a step in the right direction, but there are serious problems on the ground. The Minister of State must take this issue back to the Department and ensure that money is scraped together during the year. This money is not for anyone's pocket. It is not a case of teachers or boards of management looking for money. It concerns the structures within which children learn, teachers teach and parents leave their children. At the very least we can surely demand that conditions in primary schools are no less satisfactory and comfortable than we require under law for crèches and other places in which children are looked after and where they are secure and safe.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on the budget. I welcome the measures regarding the Central Bank and acknowledge the improvements in personal taxation as being another step in the right direction which take us half way towards to the PPF commitments. I regret that social welfare payments have not been linked to the average industrial wage, but recognise the significant step forward in this regard. The provisions regarding school buildings and education are not sufficient, but are a move forward. We should not increase VAT and the Minister of State should revisit this decision before the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister bowed the knee to IBEC and the business community. Of what is he afraid? Could he not let them pay their taxes? They are getting a Christmas windfall which they could have done without.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to second the motion and I support Senator O'Toole's expression of thanks to the Leader for allowing this debate to take place. I do not always congratulate Senator O'Toole, but I do so regarding the wording of the motion which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement and, in particular, notes the budgetary response to the taxation and other commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The Senator tabled the motion four days ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for a number of reasons. He takes the long-term view <Col N="1187" /> on many occasions. I went to school and played rugby in Newbridge close to where the Minister comes from. We played rugby against many teams, but the real cute guys were the Kildare people. As they came towards one with the ball they would dummy one way and the other and one was left not knowing where the ball was. I felt a bit like that listening to the Minister's Budget Statement. He seemed to go one way and then the other, and then one realised the ball was back in his hands again.</P>
    <P>I will consider whether the Minister achieved his budget objectives and not just in the context of this year's budget. I think this is the first time a Minister has introduced five annual budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry did the four in a row so the Minister beat it by one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget sought to develop our infrastructure, to improve public services and promote equity, to encourage enterprise and investment and to do so in a way which sustains fiscal policy. Did the Minister achieve that? I return to the metaphor of the rugby ball. When I heard the Minister say at the very beginning that he was not going to borrow, I said, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;. Then I got suspicious because he announced that because of the euro changeover the Central Bank had about &euro;700 million to spare. It appeared that the Minister was about to dip into the once-off windfall. He then announced that he was putting that money into the national pension fund and the ball was back in the right place again. I say well done to the Minister. I was suspicious of him but I have had to relax my suspicion because he has done a worthwhile thing.</P>
      <P>I look at the budget from a business point of view, although I am not here representing business. Senator O'Toole looks at it from a different aspect. My first question is, &ldquo;Is the budget pro-business?&rdquo;  I am stunned at the effect on businesses of the move to current year payment of tax rather than what obtained before. I have no doubt this is a sensible thing to do and I do not blame the Minister for doing it. However, it has a huge effect on the cash flow of many companies. In many cases the question is not whether or not a company is making a profit but whether there is enough cash to pay the bank. This measure will benefit the State in the coming year to the tune of &euro;792 million. Individual companies will have to pay tax before the year is out and before they know how much profit they have made and they will be liable for a penalty if they do not do so. If this will mean an increased income to the Exchequer of &euro;792 million, it will certainly have an effect on companies. I do not know how to balance that against the fact that corporation tax is coming down to 16% and soon, I hope, to 12.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" />The effect of this measure, mentioned in just a couple of lines in the Budget Statement, will be huge in future years. The Minister has said the change will be made over five years, at 20% per year. This is a cash-flow benefit to the State of &euro;4 billion and it will have to come from businesses which are competing in the marketplace and hoping to achieve success and maintain the fight against inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wrong last year to make a deal with partners, whether with farmers, trade unions or businesses, and then steal a march by taking away the cap on employers' PRSI. Perhaps the cap should not have been there in the first place; I do not disagree with Senator O'Toole on this point. However one cannot introduce such a measure on the sly. This was a sleight of hand which should not have happened. The Minister has not given way, and Senator O'Toole is pleased about that. He has done something, but his gesture will cost the State &euro;347 in PRSI reduction. This sounds generous until one compares it with the &euro;792 million which businesses will have to pay. I welcome the Minister's gesture but it does not make up for the mistake he made last year.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister investing in the future? I have to say he is. In this case he has scored some tries and even converted some of them. I applaud his extension of the BES and seed capital schemes. It is interesting that he has responded to the needs of the shipping industry by introducing the special shipping tonnage tax.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to see that the Minister has reversed the measures recommended in the Bacon reports. The reports' recommendations to facilitate the establishment of more homes, at least in the greater Dublin area, has been reversed. I say, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister for re-introducing interest relief on rental properties. This was necessary because I understand almost no houses are being sold in Dublin and therefore no houses will be built if we are not very careful. The Minister is responding to current needs. He is responding not only with regard to rental property but also with the urban and rural renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that replacing the 1% VAT is a mistake. One of the biggest challenges facing the country, and not just business, is inflation. Having removed 1% last year, the Minister now says he was never very confident about doing that and he has put it back on again.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the many other benefits in the budget. Have the Minister's five budgets taken us in the right direction? They have gone some way. He has done the right thing in many ways. I would have preferred to see the Minister making a much bigger impact on infrastructural improvement and on improving the lot of the disadvantaged. The Minister has a long way to go in <Col N="1189" /> these areas but perhaps he will have another five years in which to do that.</P>
    <P>This budget is the Minister's last effort before an election and he asks for another five years. Let us see what the public think of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important motion.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on an excellent fifth budget. The Department of Financce, under the Minister, has brought a sense of fair play to the people of Ireland. The budget protects the national interest as well as the lives and livelihoods of the people. The national development plan is in place and at the same time we have massive increases in spending on health, education and social welfare. The budget also contains measures to help the construction industry. The various components of the budget set down a series of supports and back-ups to see the country through the year 2002 and to leave behind some of the bad memories of 2001.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has attempted to reverse the trend in the construction industry, which seemed to have fallen asunder in the past couple of months and which is so important to every village and town. I am particularly pleased that the Minister has extended the rural renewal tax designation scheme to the end of 2004. Interest relief on rental income has been restored and there have been necessary changes in stamp duty. These are massive boosts to the construction industry and I compliment the Minister on them.</P>
      <P>The rural renewal scheme is of vital importance to a large area of disadvantage. The counties of Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Mayo and Sligo have seen a new enthusiasm as a result of investment under this scheme. It is appropriate that it has been extended for a further two years. Interest relief on rental income and the changes in stamp duty are a top-up to that.</P>
      <P>The way the Minister has looked after the elderly is an indication of the caring attitude of the Government. At a time when there seems to be a shortage in the public finances, an increase of £10 per week is being granted to old age pensioners. In 1997 the new Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised to raise the old age pension to £100 per week. I am pleased to see the contributory old age pension being raised to £116 per week and the non-contributory pension to £105 per week. This is above and beyond the commitment given by the Government four and a half years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to note that child benefit, for so long the Cinderella of successive Governments, is being increased significantly. The addition of £25 for the first and second child brings the monthly <Col N="1190" /> payment to £92 and the addition of £30 per month for the third and subsequent children brings the monthly payment to £116. It is a recognition by the Minister of the needs of families with children. A family with four children will rightly receive £417 per month in child benefit. The Government has demonstrated its resolve in this area. Other areas of social welfare have also been addressed. There are increases in the family income supplement and the back to school footwear schemes and guidelines for the carer's allowance have been extended.</P>
    <P>No Government has done more than this to reduce the tax burden. While the Minister has looked after every section of the community he has excelled himself today by ensuring that those on low income will not pay income tax on the first £165 of their weekly income. It means that 90% of the minimum wage will be exempt from income tax. It also means that just short of 700,000 wage earners will be outside the income tax net. It is a credit to the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Those aged over 65 years who are or have been in the tax net are aggrieved because they considered they had made their contribution to this country. They will not pay any tax on incomes of &euro;13,000 or less. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I was pleased when in his previous budget the Minister reduced VAT from 21% to 20% but I was unhappy that it was not passed on. The public did not benefit. The Minister has increased the rate to 21%. The extra funding will be well spent on health and education.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been a breath of fresh air in terms of the country's finances. Many extraordinary statements have been made over the past weeks suggesting the country would have to borrow and that money had been squandered. In response, it is only necessary to note the vast improvements of the past five years. Despite the extraordinarily difficult year as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis, the subsequent downturn in tourism and the events of 11 September, the Minister has been able to introduce a budget with a projected surplus while providing big increases in social welfare, tax relief and health and education, all of which will benefit the public.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government. The public will respond positively to the budget. Already the response in the media has been positive. I compliment the Minister of State and I thank Senator O'Toole for affording the House the opportunity to debate the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's speech this afternoon one would have to ask where all the money has gone. Instead of using the unparalleled opportunities afforded by the fastest growing economy in the world to govern wisely, regrettably he has displayed incompetence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget Statement last year the Minister <Col N="1191" /> projected a budget surplus of 3.8% of GDP, equivalent to approximately &euro;3.8 billion. Today the surplus is expected to be &euro;170 million. However, even that is a fraud. The Minister is robbing the social insurance fund of &euro;635 million. Since the public owns this fund, this money is not real revenue but an accounting trick. He is also cashing once-off benefits from the Central Bank to the extent of &euro;610 million. Again, the public owns this money, it is not real revenue but an accounting trick. The Minister is also taking &euro;500 million from the capital service redemption fund, another accounting trick. When his accounting tricks are excluded, the Exchequer surplus of &euro;170 million becomes a deficit of &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister said one of his objectives is to sustain fiscal policy. However, an examination of budget projections for next year illustrates he is using funny money this year. On a no policy change the Minister is forecasting a deficit next year of &euro;3 billion. This will put us in danger of exceeding the EU's 3% deficit limit. The table summarising the current capital and revenue budget set out in the Minster's Budget Statement illustrates the projected deficit for next year and the following year.</P>
    <P>Despite the years of prosperity, over 120,000 people are on housing lists looking for social housing. The Taoiseach's statement yesterday indicated that only half the Government's target in this area will be met. At a time of greatest need activity in the housing sector has been driven down. Capital expenditure should be used to support the economy when it is weak, yet such expenditure is down 12% compared with last year. Expenditure on tourism is down over 40% even though it must cope with the disastrous consequences of the foot and mouth disease crisis and the loss of the American market following the terrible tragedy of 11 September. Last year, just as the high-tech sector faced its deepest downturn the Minister abolished the employers' ceiling on PRSI, increasing the wage cost of high earners by over 5%. At least today the Minister had the good grace to admit that mistake and take some measures to address it.</P>
    <P>The Government has poisoned the future of privatisation through the botched privatisation of Telecom Éireann. By selling the company at a time when the telecommunications bubble was at its height the Government ensured that over 500,000 citizens lost out when the share price dropped. Today the Minister had the opportunity to offer them some recompense but nothing was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>Rather than using the opportunities presented by the fastest growing economy <Col N="1192" /> in the world to right some of the great wrongs in our society, the Minister squandered the opportunity to help those in need of medical cards by raising the threshold for exemption. It is crazy that a person earning a little over £100 per week is obliged to pay almost £30 when visiting the doctor.</P>
      <P>The Minister also gave a commitment last year to remove from the tax net those on the minimum wage.</P>

I warned him against scoring an own goal on that issue, but I believe he has now done so. If I were to ask the employees of Aer Lingus and Gateway or the ordinary shareholders in Eircom if they are in a win-win situation, they would answer &ldquo;No&rdquo;. They will inform Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators at the general election that they have lost out to a major extent. They Minister has not scored one own goal, he has scored three of them.</P>

The Senator said, somewhat forlornly, that the Seanad does not seem to obtain the media coverage it deserves when it holds this debate on budget day. That may be true, but it is singularly important that the debate should be held. I have always found this debate to be extremely worthwhile and lively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may come as a surprise to some that 26 June of this year marked the fourth anniversary of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government entering office. I am proud that over this period we have provided this country with good Government and have overseen the most sustained and significant development of the economy. It is appropriate today to remind the House of some of the achievements so far during our tenure of office. When the Government took office on 26 June 1997, it did so on the basis of a programme <Col N="1193" /> of commitments. I will now list just some of the promises we made and what we have delivered in the last four budgets.</P>
    <P>We promised to create more jobs and tackle long-term unemployment. More than 300.000 new jobs have been created and unemployment, including long-term unemployment, is at an all time low.</P>
    <P>We promised to reduce personal tax and to encourage people to take up work. More than £3 billion in tax reductions has been delivered in the last four budgets. The standard rate of tax has been cut from 26% to 20% and the higher rate from 48% to 42%. This has meant a real increase in disposable income for everybody. More than 300,000 workers have been taken out of the tax net altogether. Such a development would have been undreamt of a number of years ago. Furthermore, the introduction of tax credits has made the income tax system more equitable.</P>
    <P>We promised to develop a quality health service and we have nearly doubled the allocation for the health sector. We now have more than 4,000 additional doctors, nurses and other health care professionals. Waiting lists are down 25% and 90,000 more hospital treatments are being carried out. We know more needs to be done and for that reason we have put a comprehensive health strategy in place for the next ten years to deliver a world-class service.</P>
    <P>We promised major investment in education. The Government has a proven record in providing for significant extra investment in education. We increased net current spending by over £1 billion between 1997 and 2001 &ndash; a cumulative increase of over 50%. In addition, the Government has provided for a major increase in capital funding for building and refurbishing schools. This funding has almost quadrupled since 1997. Class sizes in primary and secondary schools are at their lowest and there are 20,000 more third level places</P>
    <P>We promised to build an inclusive society. We increased expenditure on social welfare by over £1.5 billion at a time when the numbers of unemployed people were dropping substantially. The bulk of this money has, in a real sense, been directed at social inclusion. Child benefit rates have increased dramatically and the announcements by the Minister earlier fulfil the commitment he gave last year. This comes about, perhaps, against people's expectations. Even before the increases announced today, we had more than met our commitment to bring the rate of old age pension to at least £100 per week. We have, in fact, well exceeded that target.</P>
    <P>There are many more developments to which I could refer but I will not do so. Before I move on I can assure the House that the Government will continue to focus on the need to sustain economic growth and prosperity and, at the same time, <Col N="1194" /> ensure equality and a caring society for all our people.</P>
    <P>The budget has been prepared on the basis of much slower growth next year than we have experienced in recent years. We must accept the reality that the economic environment has changed and that a cautious and prudent budgetary policy is the only option. Even before the tragic events of 11 September, the major economies of the world had already experienced a sharp downturn. Our economy is in good shape and should be well placed to benefit from the international recovery. We need to position ourselves to take full advantage of the recovery when it comes.</P>
    <P>Members will have heard what my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has said on the subject of Exchequer borrowing. I am sure the House will agree that we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. We need to proceed with care in these uncertain times. Now, more than ever, we must also ensure value for money in public expenditure. Nevertheless, our objectives in the budget focus on safeguarding the vulnerable. improving public services, promoting equity, developing our infrastructure and encouraging investment and enterprise.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator O'Toole's comments about what the Minister is doing with the Central Bank's surplus and the reserve fund. These will be used in a real sense to benefit the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I must inform the Senator that the commitment to ensure that over £1 billion was placed in the social fund for the betterment of the elderly was honoured without the Minister having to borrow to do so. That is an extraordinary achievement and has rightly been welcomed by Senators O'Toole, Quinn and others.</P>
      <P>Social inclusion has always been at the heart of the Government's policies. We will continue to protect the less well off in our society. Available resources will be concentrated on the development of a quality health care service, improved social welfare provision and the continuing development of our economy through further capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy announced last month by the Minister for Health and Children is a ten year plan that will deliver a quality health service for all. The strategy represents a blueprint for the development of the health services over the next decade, with particular emphasis on improving the quality of service delivery. The budget includes additional Exchequer funding of &euro;425 million, bringing gross health expenditure to nearly &euro;8.2 billion next year. The increase will go towards additional beds for acute hospitals, the setting up of a treatment purchase fund to add to the range of service delivery options, funding for <Col N="1195" /> the disabled and older people and the development of certain GP initiatives.</P>
    <P>Now that the funds are being put in place, we must ensure they are used to best effect. I welcome the Minister's initiative in establishing an independent commission on financial management and control systems with a remit to examine, evaluate and make recommendations on relevant systems, practices and procedures throughout the health service. I salute the broad welcome given to the health strategy by health practitioners. This reflects the fact that they had a major input into the strategy and it belies statements by some Opposition Members that the strategy could be produced overnight. I accept that the strategy took a number of years to draw up, but it has been well thought out and will allow every man, woman and child to have confidence in what the future holds. The health strategy is additional to the huge improvements that have already been made in the health service. I am proud to belong to the Government that introduced those improvements.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases will amount to &euro;1.1 billion in a full year. They will be paid, in most cases, with effect from 1 January. Recipients will receive a lump sum in February where payment is delayed for administrative reasons. It should be remembered that before we took office those dependent on social welfare had to wait over five months from budget time for any increase. What changed times we live in.</P>
    <P>The full personal rate of old age and related pensions will increase by at least a further £10 per week. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to £116 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to over £105 per week. With the proposed increase in the qualified adult payment, a contributory old age pensioner couple, both aged over 66 years, will receive over £205 per week next year. Under this Government, the personal rate of old age contributory pension will have increased by over £38 per week while a couple, both over 66 years, will receive over £72 extra per week. This demonstrates our commitment to support our older citizens.</P>
    <P>Full rate social welfare recipients will receive an extra £8 per week. The rate of qualified allowances is also being increased by over £8 per week. This will mean a rise of more than £16 per week for most couples on social welfare. Since 1997, those dependent on social welfare will be better off by over £26 per week for a single person and £48 per week for a couple. Recipients of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance will benefit by more than £9.50. This brings the payment rate for these schemes to the level which applies to most other recipients under 66 years.</P>
    <P>The widow's contributory pension for those aged 66 or over will rise by £12 to £114 per week. <Col N="1196" /> This will narrow the gap with the old age contributory pension. The widowed parent grant will be almost doubled to about £1,970 with effect from today. It is generally accepted that direct financial support is a very effective way to tackle child poverty. Last year, we gave a commitment to provide an extra £1 billion in increased child benefit over a three-year period. We delivered phase 1 this year. Child benefit rates will, next year, be increased by a further £25 per month for the first and second children to £92.62 and by £30 per month for third and subsequent children to £1I6. Since 1997, child benefit for first and second children has increased by £62.60 per month and £77 for third and subsequent children. No previous Government has provided such support to parents. By way of illustration, a family with four children will receive over £417 per month next year in child benefit. These significant increases are being made to support parents, whatever their choice of child care arrangements.</P>
    <P>Parents will also benefit from a rise in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. The rate will increase to over £94 per child. This will provide assistance to over 70.000 children aged 12 years and over. As of today the means test will be eased, allowing another 8,000 children to benefit.</P>
    <P>Recipients of the fuel allowance will receive an extra £2.09 per week, bringing the total payment under this scheme to over £7 per week. Other measures include a further easing of the income disregards for the carer's allowance to benefit about 3,400 new carers and 2,300 existing ones; annual respite care grant up to £500; a 20% increase in the number of free units under the free electricity allowance; a relaxation in the qualification criteria for the free telephone allowance; the extension of the free travel companion pass to invalidity pensioners; an increase in the income thresholds for family income supplement to bring the average payments to recipients to around £59 per week.</P>
    <P>I hope this budget slays, once and for all, the lie that the current Minister for Finance does not care for the young and aged. No Minister for Finance &ndash; as far back as I can remember &ndash; has done more for disadvantaged people in this country than the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has done over the past five years.</P>

      <P>An additional &euro;3 million is being provided for the appointment of an extra 350 teachers at first level and 200 teachers at second level from the commencement of the next school year. An additional &euro;10 million is being provided for a range of measures in the education sector to assist pupils with disabilities and to provide improved services in the special needs education area. The Minister for Education and Science will announce the details at a later date. An additional &euro;250,000 is being provided for a pilot disability awareness programme for second level transition year students.</P>
      <P>Net capital spending, which includes infrastructure spending, has increased from &euro;1.9 billion in 1997 to nearly &euro;49 billion this year. Even with such a high level of investment in our infrastructure more is needed to meet the growing needs of the economy. Last month the Minister provided significantly increased capital allocations in 2002 for roads, public transport, water, housing, and education. Today he announced a further &euro;550 million for capital spending. This increase will be targeted at the key priority areas in the national development plan: &euro;36 million for primary school building; &euro;19 million for secondary school building; &euro;146 million for local authority and social housing; &euro;100 million for national road improvements; &euro;38 million for water and sewerage services; &euro;16 million for waste management; &euro;44 million for public transport and &euro;19 million for telecommunications infrastructure. This is all extra capital spending announced in the budget today, in addition to the provisions announced in the Estimates last month.</P>
      <P>I was particularly pleased to hear Senator O'Toole, who is so close to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, welcoming what this Government has done in fulfilling its commitments. He illustrated that the programme outlined in the Estimates and budget shows an absolute commitment to the national development plan.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate that our tourism industry has been badly hit by the tragic events in New York last September and is heading into a tough year. Funding of &euro;6.35 million annually is being provided to Bord Fáilte for a five year period for marketing in the areas of product, cultural and regional activities. An extra &euro;1.27 million is being provided to support efforts to attract major sporting events with tourism potential for Ireland. Funding of &euro;3.5 million is being provided to Tourism Ireland for international marketing and to meet incremental pay and overhead costs arising from start-up.</P>
      <P>Additional funding is being provided to the fishery harbours programme for the development and upgrading of fishery harbours and also to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, for the sea fisheries development programme. This will cost &euro;2.5 million in 2002.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1198" />Workers will receive &euro;634 million in income tax reductions with effect from 1 January. Next year will see more low-income earners taken out of the tax net altogether. A substantial number of those on middle-incomes will move from the top rate of tax to the standard rate. As the Minister said last year, we want to move the income tax entry point towards the level of the minimum wage. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness made it clear that it was an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners to make this happen over time. Further progress next year will see an increase in the basic personal tax credit by &euro;123 to &euro;1,520 and the PAYE tax credit by &euro;152 to &euro;660. This will bring the entry point to the tax net for a single person to £165 or &euro;209 per week and take 68,000 low-income earners out of the tax net altogether. The corresponding entry point when we took office was £77 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The entry point now stands at £165 per week. That is extraordinary. The single standard rate band will also increase by &euro;2,605 to &euro;28,000 with relevant changes to the married bands as set out in the summary of budget measures. This will take 57,000 taxpayers from the higher rate of income tax in 2002. When we came into office the income exemption limits for those aged 65 and over were as low as £4,600 per annum for a single person and £9,200 for a married coupled. We have raised the limits substantially. We propose to bring them to over £10,000 and £20,000 respectively. The new limits will be &euro;13,000 and &euro;26,000. This will remove over 11,000 elderly taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
      <P>The employment of a carer allowance can be claimed at an individual's marginal rate of tax where a person is employed to care for a family member who is incapacitated. The amount that can be claimed under this relief is being increased from &euro;12,700 per annum to &euro;30,000 per annum. This increase will help people to care for their relatives at home and it is a substantial commitment in relation to carers.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to restore the standard rate of VAT to 21% from 1 March 2002. In addition, the VAT-inclusive excise duty on petrol and diesel will be increased by 5p per litre from midnight tonight. The VAT-inclusive excise duty on cigarettes will be raised by 10p per packet of 20 &ndash; as a heavy smoker, I am very pleased it is not increased by &euro;1, as people were suggesting &ndash; with <i>pro rata</i> increases in other tobacco products, also from midnight tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator might say that. However, in the overall budget, I believe the Minister has hit the nail on the head. In fairness, with the increases he has brought in, the money will be well spent on social services. That is the reason for those increases. Many would like all of us to stop smoking and I would also love to do so &ndash; but perhaps another day.</P>
      <P>Excise duty on cider and perry will also be raised to the same level as that on beer, in order to better align the duty rates by reference to the alcoholic content of the product. The overall impact on the consumer price index of the increases in VAT and excise duties is estimated at 0.9%.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 March 2002, the top rate of employers' PRSI will be reduced from 12% to 10.75% at a full year cost of &euro;347 million. The standard rate of corporation tax on trading profits will fall to 16% from 1 January 2002 and to 12.5% the following year. Under the existing system, tax is paid well after the end of the accounting year. The Minister has decided that, over the next five years, companies will move to a situation in which their main corporation tax payments will be made on a current year basis. This system is common in other OECD countries. This change will yield a large cash-flow benefit to the Exchequer in each of those years which will be &euro;792 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>Interest relief, as a deductible expense in calculating tax on rental income from residential property, will be restored with effect from 1 January 2002. I believe everybody will welcome that. The Minister has also decided that investors in new and second-hand residential property will pay the same rates of stamp duty as owner occupiers generally. These measures will encourage investors back into the property market and help to secure the future supply of housing to meet accommodation needs.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme and the seed capital scheme are being renewed for a further period of two years. It is proposed to increase the existing company limit for the business expansion scheme to &euro;750,000. In the case of the seed capital scheme, investors will be allowed, subject to the annual investment limit of &euro;31,750, to spread their investment over six years rather than the current five years. This means that the amount on which they can get a refund of tax will increase from &euro;158,750 to &euro;190,500. In the case of the designated BES funds, because of the short time available, any money raised by them up to 31 January 2002, provided it is invested before 31 December 2002, will be deemed to have been raised in the tax year 2001. This will enable individual investors to claim tax relief on their investment in the short 2001 tax year or the 2002 tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to further stimulate investment and enterprise, the Minister has decided to extend the deadline for eligible projects under the urban and rural renewal schemes, the capital reliefs for student housing and the park and ride and multi-storey carpark schemes. These schemes will be <Col N="1200" /> extended to the end of 2004 in most cases. I hope that these extensions will enable more projects to be completed, including some in my constituency of Waterford. It will be helpful throughout the country. We are all being asked about these schemes, many of which are held up in the planning process. This is a tremendous boost for local government, in terms of projects being undertaken by the private sector and strongly supported by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The betting tax rate will be reduced from 5% to 2% from 1 May next. This measure is being introduced to prevent jobs and revenue in that sector from moving offshore. I am sure that will be welcomed by those who follow horseracing.</P>

      <P>It is a welcome move anyhow. On the environmental side, we are all aware of the damaging effect, particularly in urban areas, of sulphur emissions. In order to encourage a switch to low &ndash; sulphur diesel a new, higher rate for diesel with high sulphur content will be introduced. The higher rate will apply from 1 March 2002 to allow for disposal of stocks and will be 6 cent per litre higher than the excise rate for low sulphur diesel.</P>
      <P>The scheme of relief for the donation of heritage items provides for a payment on account of tax of an amount equal to the value of a heritage item donated to the national collections, provided certain conditions are met. The heritage item must be worth at least &euro;95,250 and the value of items approved for donation under the scheme in any one year cannot exceed &euro;3.8 million. Given the importance of this scheme in encouraging donations of important items to the national collections, it is proposed to increase the single item threshold to &euro;100,000 and the annual limit to &euro;6 million. Auctioneers fees incurred in purchasing a heritage item, subject to the annual limit, will also be allowed for the purpose of this scheme</P>
      <P>On farmer taxation, stock relief will be adjusted to help farmers affected by foot and mouth disease with re-stocking. The current two year period during which farmers can opt to defer book profits that have arisen from compensation received in respect of the compulsory disposal of livestock under a disease eradication scheme approved by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will be extended to four years. The corresponding two year re-stocking period during which such farmers can qualify for 100 per cent stock relief is also to be extended to four years. The four year periods in respect of these reliefs will apply in respect of such disposals arising from 21 February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2001, provides for capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals. In order to qualify for the allowances, the hospital had to be operated by a body with charitable status for tax purposes. This <Col N="1201" /> condition is now being removed. Furthermore, the minimum requirement of 100 in-patient beds is being reduced to 70. This scheme is subject to clearance by the European Commission from an EU state aids rules perspective. Discussions are ongoing with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The motion before this House refers to the budgetary response to the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The partnership process has served this country over the years. I am sure Senators will agree that the balanced approach taken in this budget is the appropriate response to difficult circumstances and is consistent with our agreement with the social partners, who recognise the reality of the current economic situation just as well as we do.</P>
    <P>The last four years has been a period of continuous success for this country. Looking ahead, I have no doubt the Irish economy is basically in good health and that, with careful stewardship, our success story can continue. That success is founded on the basis of sound budgetary decisions as outlined in today's budget and its predecessors. It is also founded on the fact that this Government has delivered and will continue to deliver on its promises to the benefit of all of our citizens. The electorate will have an opportunity next year to deliver their verdict on our stewardship and I am confident of that verdict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleagues, Senators O'Toole and Quinn, on putting down this motion. This has become an annual event and I thank the Minister of State for treating it as seriously as he has done. It is a pity the Seanad is not entrusted with Exchequer Bills. That seems an unnecessary limitation and it also affects our performance on committees. For example, there was a meeting of the foreign affairs committee yesterday but, because it was dealing with budgetary matters relevant to that committee, Senators were excluded. As a member of that committee, I find that amazing. I attend all the meetings and, despite the fact that the committee had been discussing the Middle East, I could not take part, because of this constitutional bar.</P>
      <P>I welcome this budget. All comments I have heard on the radio have been favourable, though some regarded it as somewhat patchy and wanted a bit more. By and large, it is a judicious budget. With regard to what has been described as creative accounting &ndash; thank God for it. That is what I like &ndash; a bit of creative accounting. It is really imaginative, good and useful to take a little from our hoard. Do those who oppose this want us to borrow on the international market and expose the country to further debt? I consider that a lunatic proposal. What alternative has the Minister? I congratulate him on balancing the books without exposing us to further borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very glad it is now quite clear the election will be on 16 May. That could not be more suitable to me. I thank the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. Bloomsday will fall right in the middle of the election campaign for the <Col N="1202" /> Seanad, giving me an opportunity for a little publicity. While most others are far from the airwaves, I will be wearing my funny hat and telling the voters I am still alive.</P>
    <P>I welcome this but I am Oliver Twist. We have something but I want to ask the Minister for more, particularly in the case of social welfare benefits. I believe they should be directly linked to the average industrial wage. It is a target for which we must aim. I received a number of submissions on the budget and I hope to put some of their principal suggestions on the record. They come from the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Conference of Religious in Ireland, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Carers Association and others. All have one thing in common, the growing disparity between the richest elements in society and the poorest. In the next budget we will have to face this problem and reduce the inequalities in this country. Inequality is the cause of all our troubles.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has prudently provided for pensions. I have an interest in this because I am getting older every minute like everyone else. The age profile of our population will change and that is something we must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record some of the ideas of the National Women's Council of Ireland, although the Minister has probably already been made privy to them. The council's document starts by saying that the richest one third of families benefited five times more than the poorest. This House debated part-time workers a few days ago and women are the core element of that group. Women returning to paid employment, which is a desirable objective, need support in education, retraining and so forth. There is also the issue of escalating child care costs and the health exposure of women. I am glad the Minister has gone some way in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is the issue of the vulnerable people in the asylum seekers category about which the council offers specific suggestions. With regard to family friendly policies, the National Women's Council of Ireland suggests paid parental leave and the introduction of a social insurance payment for parental leave at the rate of the existing maternity benefit payment. It also refers to paid paternity leave with a modest request for five days such leave. It is good for children to have both parents with them and it is good for the parents too. I welcome the increase in child benefit but the council suggests that the payment should be £25 per week. The current payment is about half that amount.</P>
    <P>The council suggests, with regard to health services for women, the establishment of a free national breast and cervical screening programme for all teenage girls and women and the allocation of resources to the reduction of hospital waiting lists. A certain measure of the road has been travelled in that regard. The council recommends the extension of the medical card to all dependent children under 18 years of age and that medical card eligibility levels should be set so that the <Col N="1203" /> earnings of those on the national minimum wage fall within eligibility thresholds. It finally recommends that members of the Traveller community should have medical card eligibility for five years after returning to employment. This is worth considering in view of the vulnerability and social position of members of that community.</P>
    <P>The submission deals with the issue of asylum seekers through a series of suggestions. I will not outline them because the Minister probably has the document. However, I should mention the tragic case of a child who was scalded to death because of the substandard accommodation in which the parents found themselves.</P>
    <P>The Carers Association points out that less than one in six carers receives a carer's allowance, which is currently £88.50 per week, even though each carer saves the State at least £300 per week. There are 50,000 full-time family carers in Ireland caring for people 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are 70,000 more caring at home for at least 40 hours per week. There are 35,000 children in Ireland with severe disabilities, more than 30,000 people with dementia and more than 10,000 people who are disabled as a result of strokes. Most of these people are looked after by carers. The carers are a saving for the State and we should support them as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The association recommends that all carers should receive the respite care grant and that it should be substantially increased, greater than the increase provided. There should be more than one grant which should be paid at full rate for each cared for person. It recommends payment after the death of the cared for person in recognition of the difficult circumstances for the carer and that respite grants be paid if the qualifying date for the grant is within six weeks of the death of the cared for person. That is a humane and obvious suggestion.</P>
    <P>CORI made a number of points in its submission. Again, it pointed to the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the fact that although we now have a <i>per capita</i> income above the European Union average, our infrastructure and social provision are well below that level. I believe it is most important that we invest in our roads and transport infrastructure. I wish to hear more about the underground railway for Dublin. That must be included in the infrastructure programme and a start must be made on it. After the traffic chaos yesterday everybody has now come around to that point of view. It was voted through by all sides of this House and, as I have said time and again, it is the only thing for technical reasons that will resolve the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency made a number of key points in its submission. It seeks the indexing of welfare payments and taxes in line with wage growth, a weekly welfare increase of 10.8%, an equivalent rise in tax credits and bands, additional increases to households on the lowest welfare rates bringing the adult personal rate to £98 per week and the qualified adult dependant <Col N="1204" /> rate to £68.60, an adequate rate of child income support by increasing child benefits further, making the tax system more equitable by abolishing the employee PRSI threshold and using the resources to further increase PAYE tax credits to £510.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to mention two special projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not. Before I conclude I wish to make a special plea for two groups. The first is Carmichael House with which I have a personal connection. I have been involved in it for some years. It was established in 1988 and looks after 43 member groups and a further 250 organisations. The centre is in difficulty because of the condition of its building and the provision of funding. It has four requests of the Minister. It seeks ongoing core funding for the administration, which is £120,000 for 2002, three year core funding for its training and support service, which amounts to £60,000 for 2002, pilot funding for the information and communications technology support unit, which totals £40,000 for 2002, and an immediate capital grant of £1,059,000 to refurbish Carmichael House. The roof is the leading danger. It is economical to support the centre, given the number of people who are supported by this extraordinary organisation.</P>
      <P>To bring my contribution to a shuddering halt, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who is a softie at heart, promised a little capital funding for the Irish Seal Sanctuary, and I urge him to deliver on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's budget is the culmination of five years of exceptionally good and intelligent government on the part of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. It gives coherence to a five year strategy and is the culmination of four good budgets delivered previously.</P>
      <P>The economic policies followed by this two-party Government have delivered an unprecedented growth in employment, achieved huge reductions in unemployment and record improvements in social welfare. The Government has transformed the country from mass unemployment, with all its despair and its ugly economic and social effects, to virtual full employment. This has happened as a direct result of the sound economic and budgetary policies brought forward and carried through in the budget under consideration today.</P>
      <P>One of my few disappointments arising from the budget is that the Minister did not impose a &euro;1 increase on the price of cigarettes. I was deeply disappointed by that. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, can put that in his pipe and smoke it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's budget consolidates the changes and reforms that the Progressive Democrats Party has promoted with its partners in Government. It is a good budget for the young and the old. At its <Col N="1205" /> inception the Government said it would increase the old age pension to £100 per week, and it has exceeded that target in today's announcement. In addition, as a result of the taxation measures, a total of 11,000 pensioners who are paying tax have been removed from the tax net. It is a good budget for older people.</P>
    <P>A point the Minister should take note of for next year is that the fuel allowance, at £7 per week, was a bit mean. As we set out five years ago to bring the weekly allowance up to £100, we should set out in the next budget to bring the fuel allowance up to the cost of one bag of coal, which is currently about £9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the average. Of course, there is variation from place to place but that is only a matter of pennies. As a principle, we should seek to make the fuel allowance the average cost of one bag of coal. Every pensioner would appreciate that and it should be an objective for future budgets.</P>
      <P>This budget makes provision for carers, and a provision under the health strategy is to free up beds to enable the waiting lists to be cut. That is a provision that will benefit older people more than any other section of society. It is mainly older people who wait years to get hip replacements and hip operations. They suffer severely as a result. The main beneficiaries of the treatment purchase fund of &euro;30 million will be older people and sick people. This is a good budget for our senior citizens and that is important. A country that does not pay tribute to and care for its senior citizens, those who built the foundations of the State, is not worth its salt. This Government has proved over five budgets to be very caring towards it senior citizens and I praise it highly for that. I am glad that my party has been a part of this endeavour.</P>
      <P>It is a balanced budget. All the predictions that led up to it, and all the fears that the changing economic circumstances would leave the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in such a position that he would not be able to make provisions across the board were proved wrong. He has brought in a skilful and well thought out budget, on which he is to be complimented. The taxation measures in today's budget will keep us competitive and will not inhibit the creation of increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That we should not only have tax reduction policies was always the aim of my party. The Progressive Democrats Party has an inherent belief that people are entitled to keep at least some of the money that they earn, but we were also acutely aware of the impact that high taxation was having in the effort to keep labour costs down and keep this country competitive. I am glad that the taxation policies of the last four years have <Col N="1206" /> been carried through and built upon in this budget.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the widening gap between rich and poor. I, like everybody else, want to see that gap narrowing. The increased child benefit will go a great way towards helping to do that. The most intensive poverty is among children, where there are large families on very low incomes or on no earned income at all. Child benefit will go a long way to alleviate such poverty.</P>
    <P>We made reference on today's Order of Business to the recently published OECD report on educational attainment in Ireland. My heart was gladdened by the survey of 500,000 15 year olds from across the industrialised world. One of the findings of the study, carried out by a body with high-status, the OECD, was that children from areas that were deemed disadvantaged in socio-economic terms were doing just as well in literacy, maths and science attainment. That is a good thing. If young people can be given a good education, they have a start in life and an opportunity to compete on an equal footing with children from other areas whose families have much higher incomes.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that, under the capital allocations, the Minister for Finance saw fit to give £1.5 million towards the refurbishment of Cork Opera House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

I welcome that and I look forward to the day when that figure will be 100% of those on the minimum wage. Some £6 billion is to be spent on health. Unless we are very bad managers, we should be able to bring about radical, significant and far-reaching changes in the health services.</P>
      <P>However, there is a sickness in this country and I do not know how we will address it. That sickness is amnesia among the Opposition parties. They forget the appalling budgets they brought in while in power. They are suffering from severe amnesia.</P>

Unless the Minister and the relevant Department address the fundamentals regarding the black of hole in health, I am afraid the moneys provided will not see us out of the difficulties we are in in that regard.</P>
      <P>The budget shows an Exchequer surplus of &euro;170 million and, of course, this year we have to make the mental adjustment to euros from pounds. Someone in this House already referred to it as a fraud but at a minimum, there are serious questions to be asked regarding that supposed surplus. The Minister is robbing the social insurance kitty by taking &euro;635 million. The point has already been made that the public owns the social insurance fund so it is not real revenue. That is one of these alleged accounting tricks. He is cashing in once-off benefits from the Central Bank of &euro;610 million. Again, these are public funds and not real revenue &ndash; another accounting trick. He is taking &euro;500 million from the capital services redemption fund &ndash; again, not real revenue&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy enough with the situation.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make in this regard &ndash; I am sure the Chair and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will appreciate it &ndash; is that when we get through the smoke and mirrors, all the presentation touches and the cosmetics, this so-called budget surplus of &euro;170 million will become a deficit of &euro;1,575 million, or &euro;1.6 billion. That is the situation which I, as a layman, see from what I have been given and what I have heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of very important U-turns in this budget and admissions of past errors and mistakes on the part of the Government and I very much welcome some of them. This increase <Col N="1209" /> of 1% in the standard rate of VAT is a hugely retrograde step. The Minister started to move in the right direction on that last year but now he is undoing all the good. When will we get in line with the rest of Europe in regard to the proper rate of VAT? As regards interest relief on residential property, the Minister had to &ndash; I think wisely and properly &ndash; undo the Bacon mistakes. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>As regards reducing the top rate of employers PRSI, what the Minister has done there to alleviate the storm and the criticism is totally inadequate. The basic personal tax credit increased by &euro;123. I do not think that will amount to £5 per week. I will wait for the accountant opposite to tell me but I do not know if that is even £5 per week. That is nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is a noted accountant and I have great respect for him as an accountant, if I may say so. I do not know what he is going to offer me this evening but that is another question.</P>
      <P>The tax relief for the low paid is simply paltry and no one given what we have been through could say it is enough. The entry point to the tax system has been raised to £165 which is only 90% of the minimum wage. Everyone believed that, at a minimum, the Minister would have taken every low paid person out of the tax net. He should have gone that extra 10% to ensure every low paid person was taken out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned about those who have contributed so much to society &ndash; people on pensions. We are not caring enough of our senior citizens who have contributed all their lives to this society and who have paid their taxes down through the years. The limits provided for them are not sufficient.</P>

    <P>On the deadlines for urban and rural renewal schemes, I would like to see the details because there are still many dilapidated areas in towns <Col N="1210" /> and cities throughout the country. In fairness, some of this may not have been the Government's fault. I would like to see the details of these schemes and I plead with the Minister to ensure the very dilapidated areas in some towns, which were not dealt with and which should have been, are included in these schemes. As I said, we do not have the details of what is included but I plead that all such areas are included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has done not only today but in the four previous budgets he brought before the House. All week commentators made statements about how he was going to provide from the PRSI fund and from Central Bank reserves but I think he out flanked them today and shocked them with the basis on which he has delivered from where he is going to get the funding. He has been a fantastic asset to this country since he became Minister for Finance. He has pushed through radical change, one change after another, in the tax system. He has simplified the same system with revolutionary measures and he has left an indelible mark on this economy and on political life in this country.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt in saying he has been the best Minister for Finance we have ever had and I doubt if we will ever be able to match him again. His record over his first four budgets in which he delivered all of the programme he put together with our coalition partners and all that was in the election manifesto of our party when we stood at the last general election were achieved in last year's budget. I was slightly worried that in this year's budget we would fall short on the basis of the downturn in the economy but the Minister has given the answers today. When it comes to the important things in relation to taxation and social welfare, the things that affect the ordinary people, it might be worth remembering that he reduced the lower rate of tax from 26% to 20% and the higher rate from 48% to 42% over his first four budgets. He promised £100 for the non-contributory old age pension and today he has increased that in his fifth budget to £116.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been a downturn in the economy, overall it has not affected what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, set out to do when he became Minister. That is certainly the case this year. It should be remembered that he took brave decisions in reducing the rates of inheritance tax and capital gains tax to 20%. He also improved the thresholds so that partners rather than married couples had the same protection. Families <Col N="1211" /> gained from the innovative measures he took concerning capital taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister replaced the allowance system with a tax credit system. He has done many things. Having listened to one of the commentators on the television before coming into the House, it seems that comments always have to be negative or against what the Minister has done. They ignore all the good points. The term &ldquo;creative accounting&rdquo; was used to describe some of the things the Minister did today. As I said during Senator Coghlan's speech, I see no point in having deposits in the bank if they cannot be used. That is what the Minister has done today. He has acquired £480 million from central bank funds because of impending changes due to the euro changeover. He has taken £500 million out of the social welfare fund. People forget to think he has over £5 billion in the pensions reserve fund. The funding today is probably the money that is going into that fund. He is only taking it out of one deposit account and putting it into another.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to raise approximately £600 million in cash flow that will affect companies because of the change in the preliminary tax date. One must remember that individual taxpayers who are self-employed have to pay their tax half way through the current tax year. PAYE employees have to pay the tax on a monthly or weekly basis as they are being paid. I see no great reason to crib on the part of businesses given that the Minister has reduced corporation tax rates from rates that were as high as 48% a number of years ago. In two years' time, they will be down to 12.5%. Therefore, I see no great difficulty for these companies which will be paying their tax, eventually in five years' time, one month before the year ends.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister established the pension fund reserve. There have been no tax cuts this year in respect of the tax rates. He has delivered £500 million in tax cuts. As far as I can remember, that may be the amount he delivered the first year he was Minister for Finance. It was heralded as a fantastic achievement. Yet, in a year when our economy has taken such a drastic downturn, the Minister has come up with £500 million again. During his term in government, he has given just slightly under £4 billion in tax cuts to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always ignored bureaucratic advice and has always been his own man. I can remember him when we were both secondary students in a boarding school. He is exactly the same today as he was then, a man with his own views who is always prepared to honour them. That was proven where the capital taxes cut is concerned. He not only gave benefit and freed up assets, but he trebled the income to the State by <Col N="1212" /> that decision. He has been a genuine policy maker.</P>
    <P>The success of the economy has been reflected in the giving of tax cuts rather than the increase in public spending. The current tax system provides for work incentives, unlike the system that pertained four or five years ago, which was an anti-work system.</P>
    <P>People are complaining that the Minister has not changed the entry point to the tax system to £183 per week for people on the minimum wage. However, he has reached £165. As was explained earlier, that figure was only £77 in 1997.</P>
    <P>I could cover so much but I will keep it for another day. It will save me having to prepare for future discussions. I have one or two points concerning what the Minister referred to in the small print. I welcome the tax relief for investment by individuals and sporting bodies for capital programmes. That will be a tremendous help to local communities and people will be prepared to invest their money. I welcome particularly the huge increase in the income limit for employing carers. I welcome the extension in the farm restocking deferred profits scheme from two to four years. I also welcome the extension of the rural renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the social welfare increases &ndash; £10 for contributory old age pensioners, £12 for widows and £8 for ordinary social welfare recipients. The Minister has eased the income disregards concerning the carer's allowance. I welcome the extra &euro;1 million he is providing for funding of TG4.</P>
    <P>There were fears that there would be cutbacks in the national development plan in respect of infrastructural projects. I welcome the increased funding, particularly the increased funding of £100 million for national roads. I spoke to the Minister last week in relation to the N56, the secondary road that runs to west Donegal, which was going to lose its place on the map again. I am encouraged by the Minister's decision to increase the funding.</P>
    <P>I will raise all the other points I have after Christmas when we are in the House again.</P>

    <P>I got a present in my mail as I was coming up to the House, a diary from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Mini<Col N="1213" /> ster for Social, Community and Family Affairs is a well-meaning man, but I suppose there is something symbolic about the fact that a diary from his Department contains in the back a wine vintage chart. This seems to be a long way from what it should be about. People like myself, who have done well out of this Government in the past five years, want to say that they did not want the Government's munificence. There are many people like me in this State who know that the price of our comparative affluence is misery on a scale that this country has never seen before. Housing is worse than it was five years ago. The health services are worse than they were five years ago. Education is underfunded by comparison with what was needed. Child care is worse than it was five years ago, as is public transport and road transport. These are facts.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party with 77 Deputies has been driven by the Progressive Democrats, which has four Deputies, for four and a half years in a direction that is against the better interests of the people who vote for the Fianna Fáil Party. Those who vote for the Fianna Fáil Party need good public services, a good health care system and local authority and social housing, but they did not get them. The Government has broken its commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, producing about half the number of houses it promised. It has failed to deliver on every issue of social well-being because it was driven by a minority party of four Members, with an ally in the Minister for Finance, to fund extraordinarily excessively generous tax cuts for the very rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax cuts, from the bottom up, benefit the very rich. There was a determination to cut the top rate of tax and a predominant focus on mak<Col N="1215" /> ing the very rich much richer. Let us not have this nonsense about the capital gains tax cut producing increased revenue. The capital gains tax cut coincided with the extraordinary explosion of capital gains that was happening before the tax cut. It was extra cream for an already grossly overfed cat. It was not done because it was necessary or useful, but because it was ideologically driven.</P>
    <P>I have said repeatedly that I am a pragmatist.

      <P>If one listened to the radio, one would have heard something about which we will hear more in coming years. A lady spoke about people living longer because they survived cancer, particularly breast cancer and colon cancer. We are beginning to see the changes arising from the investment and management of the health services. We are seeing the difference because people are living longer and have a better quality of life. Cancer care is being provided and there is no shortage of money going into health care. To say the health services are worse is an easy vote-getting headline, but it is a disgrace. The health services are continually developing. Nurses are developing with set job plans, development courses and better education. Junior doctors are improving and the whole delivery of service has improved hugely.</P>
      <P>The OECD report on education was mentioned this morning. Where did that put the children of an education system which has supposedly worsened? We were second to Finland in the report and better than America and Britain. How has our education worsened? Four years ago where would we have seen a class of six children suffering from autism in an ordinary primary school benefiting from caring assistance, teaching assistance and individualised education programmes? Where would that have happened? How can the Senator say education has become worse? It is easy to talk in headlines but when we look at the details, we see where the difference has been made.</P>
      <P>It is claimed that child care has not been improved. A family of four children will take home over £490 per month from next May. That is tax free and not means tested. To earn that money at the top rate of tax, I would have to earn an additional salary of £8,000 to £9,000. How can the Senator say provision has not been made for child care? That money goes to the home of every family in the country with a child and most of the time it goes directly to the mother. It is not means tested and it is often the only individual source of income that parent has to support their children. It hits where it is needed most and it is reducing the levels of child poverty.</P>
      <P>In relation to medical cards, people say everyone has a job and everything is much better, but they do not have medical cards any more. Is it not great that people do not need medical cards any more? If I needed a medical card four or five years ago but I got a job and did not need a medical card as I was paying for health care myself, I would be proud.</P>

      <P>&mdash;one can provide for oneself. We are moving away from a dependent society. An additional 4,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are working in the health care industry. The amount of relief that can be claimed when employing a carer makes a huge difference to people. The level has been increased from &euro;12,700 to &euro;30,000. That means someone can employ a person to work at home. This is a new way of looking at helping people to stay at home and it relieves pressure on our hospitals. It ensures that those who could not get care at home and were taking up acute beds can be moved home and cared for there. The Government recognises this and it is putting in place the structures that will allow that to happen.</P>
      <P>Respite grants have been increased to £500. Has the Senator ever seen the face of a mother who has received a summer respite cheque for £500 from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, to pay for a week's care for the child while she gets a break? It makes a huge difference. Where was the £500 four years ago? I do not think it existed.</P>
      <P>Senators have asked what the Minister for Finance has done about the rental sector. He has listened to the difficulties of those trying to rent houses, who need rent allowance and find it difficult to locate properties. Having listened to arguments about the disappearance of investors from the marketplace, the Minister reduced stamp duty so that investors will return and is allowing interest tax relief. He listened to the points that were made to him, recognised the problems and is facilitating the rejuvenation and regeneration of the construction industry. This will mean more jobs which will be highly paid. The Minister is attracting foreign investment, which had been going to places like Spain, Florida and Portugal in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has brought in the initiatives that were recommended in the Bacon report. The time has come to review plans and make changes, now that the economy has changed. We know the Minister is smart because he is not afraid to review matters annually. Now that financial matters are a little tighter, he is looking for areas where extra revenue can be generated.

      <P>The Senator's comments about expenditure cannot disguise the fact that the health service has not improved. The Government has spoken about its wonderful ten year programme, but it is easy to make promises for ten years. The budget is a series of promises and nothing else. In terms of Government expenditure, referred to by Senator Cox, one cannot say that the Minister robbed Peter to pay Paul as both Peter and Paul are being robbed. When we <Col N="1219" /> look for funds in a few years' time, they will not be there.</P>
      <P>This budget is an attempt to get the Government, which has proven itself to be inept, back into power after the election. I ask Senators to show me evidence of improvements as regards infrastructure. It takes as long to get from one part of this country to another as it did 20 years ago. The Government has said that infrastructure has been put in place, but it should talk to those trying to drive trucks from Galway to Dublin or from Cork to Limerick, who can testify to the problems. The cost of such journeys will increase as a result of the Minister for Finance's decision to increase petrol and diesel by 5p per litre. I would not have been believed ten years ago if I had said that one would pay an extra 25p per gallon of petrol in 2001, but it has happened as a result of today's announcement.</P>
      <P>The Government has overseen the best opportunities this country has had to establish infrastructure and decent health and education services, but it has failed. The Government tries to claim credit for everything, to the extent that one would think it is trying to claim credit for the reduction in the number of people with cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the matters Senator Ryan and I wish to raise are minor in comparison with the budget, but I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is here to respond to them. I am concerned about the companies that have been licensed to dispose of waste, including hazardous and domestic waste. There <Col N="1220" /> have been alarming media reports that many waste disposal companies have not operated in accordance with the licences they were granted. Some abuses have been serious, as we have discovered that thousands of tonnes of dangerous waste have been dumped in quarries in County Wicklow. Streams and rivers in the area have been contaminated.</P>
      <P>A waste disposal company, which trades as Dublin Waste, has offices in my constituency in Sheriff Street and in East Wall. The company is not a good neighbour to the communities in those areas and there have been difficulties with the operation of the yard at the company's headquarters. As if that was not bad enough, Dublin Waste has been convicted of six charges of misconduct, five of which it pleaded guilty to. The problem is that the company seems to be able to get a waste disposal licence despite its convictions. It is a serious matter that a company has been convicted of abuses and illegal activities, but the penalties that have been imposed, of about £1,500, are very low. The company has made a profit of hundreds of thousands of pounds from its policy of illegally dumping waste. The taxpayer pays for the collection of waste from hospitals and local authorities, but Dublin Waste and other companies that collect the waste have engaged in illegal activity.</P>
      <P>I want to know what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who is responsible for this area, proposes to do about the company. I heard him trumpeting on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that he will do great things in relation to waste management, but what action does he intend to take? When will he ensure that we have a meaningful and properly supervised waste management programme, operated by companies within the law, to the satisfaction of communities? What does the Minister intend to do about companies that are clearly abusing their licences? Does he intend to revoke the licences? Will he tell local authorities that any company which has been convicted in the courts should not be given a licence? Will he assert himself as Minister of State or just go on morning radio programmes, make a few comments to the media and leave it at that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for raising this matter. Functions regarding waste regulation and its enforcement have been assigned under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to local authorities and to the Environmental Protection Agency concerning the licensing of major waste activities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function regarding these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, Senator Costello will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific circumstances of any company, or on any particular case that could be the subject of enforcement action, including <Col N="1221" /> legal proceedings by the competent regulatory authorities.</P>
    <P>To facilitate effective enforcement, environmental authorities have significant powers to enter and inspect lands and premises and to board vehicles. There are severe penalties available in respect of illegal dumping. A person guilty of such an offence would be liable, upon conviction on indictment, to a fine of up to £10 million and/or up to ten years imprisonment. Even on summary prosecution, significant penalties can arise. Yesterday a contractor was fined and jailed for a total of 18 months in respect of three offences under the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>A landowner who is complicit in unauthorised dumping could be liable to prosecution in addition to the person disposing of the waste on the land, and could be required to properly dispose of the wastes concerned and undertake any necessary environmental remediation. In the event of default, a local authority can act directly and recover the costs involved from the person concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to unauthorised dumping generally, I share the widespread concern at recent developments. Such activity is illegal and grossly irresponsible. Local authorities must deploy the necessary resources to ensure that they effectively oversee waste movements and activities within their functional areas and take determined action, utilising the significant powers and remedies available to them to counter unauthorised activity.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State, I am taking a number of steps to support local authority efforts in this regard. The introduction of the proposed landfill levy will generate significant revenues and I intend to direct much of this funding to support local authority enforcement initiatives in respect of unauthorised waste activities. I am anxious that where a local authority uncovers evidence of systematic and large scale dumping, the matter should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be prosecuted as a serious offence rather than being dealt with as a summary offence. To that end, my Department has consulted with the DPP's office to prepare guidance for local authorities regarding relevant procedures and the preparation of evidence. In addition, my Department has formally requested the Criminal Assets Bureau to consider whether, in the public interest, it should investigate the possibility of systematic and illegal profiteering being involved in unauthorised waste dumping.</P>
    <P>Recent regulations on the permitting of commercial waste collectors will also facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping. Permitting authorities will be entitled to refuse to grant a permit to an applicant found guilty of specified waste offences, including unauthorised dumping, and may revoke a permit that is granted.</P>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied that the relevant public bodies fully appreciate the seriousness of this problem, that recent cases will be rigorously pur<Col N="1222" /> sued and that effective action will be taken against those responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not in the House. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, must know much about this issue and I am glad he is present.</P>
      <P>I work in the Cork Institute of Technology so there is a degree of special pleading involved in this matter. The institute is remarkably successful. No one in the region disputes the significant contribution made by graduates of the institute to the pharmaceutical and electronic industries, to business generally and to economic development in the Cork region.</P>
      <P>The institute has attracted good students and, therefore, produces good graduates. It has expanded and now has probably twice as many students as five or six years ago. However, the institute faces a growing crisis due to the fact that 50% of its students live in prefabricated or temporary on or off-site accommodation. That is a huge proportion of students.</P>
      <P>This situation has developed because of an extraordinary delay in the provision of necessary infrastructural developments. In 1996 approval was granted for a building to house the tourism and catering faculties. In 1997 approval was given for another building to house administration. In 1998 formal approval was given for an apprentice building, a student centre and a high-technology skills building. These approvals span the period beginning when Niamh Breathnach was Minister up to the last Minister, Deputy Martin. However, almost six years after the first project was approved not one of these building projects has commenced.</P>
      <P>The institute made decisions regarding student numbers and new courses on the assumption of a building programme which has not materialised. As a consequence, the institute is grossly over-crowded, temporary prefabricated accommodation proliferates and large areas are wasteland on which weeds grow when cars are not parked on them because nothing else can be done as they are designated as spaces on which building is supposed to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Shortall, tabled a question on this issue in the Dáil and received an incredibly misleading answer which effectively suggested that things could happen if the CIT would only produce final proposals. Two final proposals have been sitting in the Department for almost eight months yet nothing has been done. At an earlier stage, all of the proposals were in the Department for months before the necessary approval was given to proceed to the next stage. Two buildings are awaiting approval which is not forthcoming and two further buildings cannot proceed until an application for planning permission is lodged. However, planning permission will not be granted by Cork Corporation until a <Col N="1223" /> car park is built, yet the Department refuses to, or will not commit itself to, provide the funding for that car park. This means that two buildings are held up because of a refusal to provide car parking facilities, two are held up because the Department will not make up its mind and, in the process, a fine educational institution which is necessary for the development of the Cork region is becoming a dump to which students will not go.</P>
    <P>Guidance councillors will testify that second level students who visit the institute would rather go somewhere else which looks better. This is not the fault of the institute. The staff are superb and there are excellent students. The problem is that the Department of Education and Science is sitting on a major proposal which it encouraged, but it seems reluctant to fund the buildings which students need.</P>
    <P>This is a community of almost 8,000 people who are being shoe-horned into buildings which are singularly unsuitable. It is time the Government announced that the funding it promised over five years ago is to be made available.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the Department of Education and Science's plans to develop the Bishopstown campus of the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Ireland's development in recent years can be attributed in no small way to our young and well educated workforce. It is important to acknowledge and celebrate our achievements, but we must also work to ensure that the current and future generations of students are helped as much as possible to develop to their full potential. In recognition of this, the Government is committed to developing third level education institutes to world class standards. A total of £5.35 billion will be spent on education as part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Of this, £1.6 billion will be spent on buildings and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though recent world and local events have significantly impacted on market confidence and Exchequer revenues, I categorically restate the Government's commitment to investing in tertiary education, including Cork Institute of Technology. The NDP represents the single largest commitment ever to education infrastructure. <Col N="1224" /> This investment will continue because future graduates will shape and form our future.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has given approval for the architectural design of a tourism and catering building, an administration building, a student centre, an apprentice building and an advanced technology building, to allow Cork Institute of Technology develop as a major player in third level education. These buildings, once complete, will represent a huge investment on the Department's behalf in the future development of Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator accepts that such a large-scale development takes considerable time to plan and design. Cork Institute of Technology has appointed a number of design teams which are assisting the institute to plan and design these buildings. As yet, the design of any of these projects is not sufficiently complete to enable the projects to commence construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials in the Department of Education and Science are very anxious that these projects proceed as quickly as possible through architectural planning and are in regular contact with the institute with regard to their progression. A decision on when each of the projects concerned will proceed to construction will be taken once architectural design has been completed.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator again for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to respond to the House.</P>
