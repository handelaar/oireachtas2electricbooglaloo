      <P>I have received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the plans he has, in co-operation with the Mid-Western Health Board, to increase the number of beds in Ennis General Hospital and to update the hospital with additional medical staff and facilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline his policy on the future of neo-natal care in the Rotunda Hospital and Temple Street Hospital, the timetable and budgetary provision for the redevelopment of Temple Street and the construction of a new neo-natal unit in the Rotunda.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage, to be taken at 2 p.m.; No. 3, statements on the position post Nice referendum, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes and this item to conclude when the list of speakers offering is exhausted; and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>

      <P>Last night we agreed to come back to No. 2 at 2 p.m. today. I slightly regret the debate was not adjourned <i>sine die</i>. We accept the Order of Business but the Leader indicated he would seek advice on this matter and it would be sensible to adjourn the Bill <i>sine die</i> and come back to it at a later date.</P>

      <P>It would be in everybody's best interest to have a cooling down period in regard to this desperate legislation and to deal with it in the autumn or some other time.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of weeks various Ministers have spoken about the need to have confidence in the market and the way it works. During that period some appalling indiscretions have been committed in the auctioneering industry. I have no interest in being negative about the general body of auctioneers but when a case arises where an auctioneer, who is supposed to be the honest broker in a sale, emerges as the buyer unknown to the seller, serious questions are raised. It is also completely wrong that reputable auctioneering firms plant people in the crowd at an auction in order to bump up the prices at the expense of buyers who have borrowed to the hilt to purchase a house or that they publish guide prices which bear no resemblance to the sale price. The Government should conduct an investigation into these practices in the interest of protecting the reputation of honest auctioneers and I would like the appropriate Minister to come to the House and explain the Government's relationship with the auctioneering industry with a view to dealing with these issues.</P>

      <P>I will be guided by your ruling, a Chathaoirligh, but I understand a new Order of Business is before us today and we are entitled to make decisions on it as we see fit. Therefore, it is quite appropriate if we wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. Am I in order to do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1, that No. 2 be deleted. I proposed a similar amendment yesterday because the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2001, is riddled with suspect constitutional issues relating to opinion polls and other matters. Senator Ross has highlighted a loophole that none of us suspected. If my amendment is not accepted, will the Leader distribute to all Senators the advice he sought from the Department of the Environment and Local Government last night in regard to the particular matter raised? The advice should be circulated prior to the debate at 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the matter has been in abeyance for more than 12 hours, we should also be provided with the Attorney General's advice. It is an insult to the House to be tripping along through business from A to B while the Department does not know what it is doing. It is seeking advice but the House is not getting the benefit of the same <Col N="1384" /> advice. Is it intended to supply the information sought by the Minister to all Senators in advance of the debate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senator's call for an investigation by the relevant Minister into the activities of some auctioneers. We are all aware of circumstances where auctioneers act as buyers and sellers which leads to difficult situations. Some people think the practice must be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not having a debate on auctioneering practices on the Order of Business. The Senator has supported Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on the matter and for the Minister to be invited to the House to outline policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave a commitment some time ago to debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas the report on the investigation into the murder of Mrs. Nolan in Galway. The report was published last Friday and it emerged that the authorities in the Department were warned by the local community and advised by local gardaí and the governor of the prison that the perpetrator of the crime was a danger to the community at large. It was evident that the advice was not heeded or responded to but that if it had been, Mrs. Nolan would not have been murdered. There is an onus on the Minister to come to the House. I ask the Leader to provide time today for the Minister to discuss the report in detail because it raises serious questions which the Minister and his Department must answer.</P>
      <P>I refer to the resignations of the chairman and chief executive of Bord Fáilte within two weeks of each other. It is remarkable that the two top men in the tourism board would resign within such a short period. There must be something serious happening in that organisation and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation should come to the House to give us an explanation.</P>

      <P>At a time when the media have come in for considerable criticism, I welcome the coverage of the Taoiseach's victory in court yesterday in today's newspapers. The same depth of coverage was given to the outcome of the case as was given to it when it arose first. Will the Leader schedule a debate early in the new session on the media and their relationship with politics? Yesterday Senator Manning referred to the necessity for a healthy tension between the media and politics, with which I agree, but there are signs that such tension could be becoming unhealthy. In the cold light of day the start of a new term would be an appropriate time for such a debate and I ask the Leader to facilitate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to water quality in the River Shannon which has been much discussed in the House and about which there is much concern. The Lough Ree and Lough Derg monitoring authority issued a report earlier which indicated that 25% of water discharged into the River Shannon from its various tributaries is polluted. I would like the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, although it is obviously too late for us to debate it before we rise for the summer. I am anxious that the Leader should express the concern of the Seanad to the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is particularly worrying that local authorities in areas through which the Shannon runs are being blamed more than any other group. Water treatment facilities in various towns have been allocated millions of pounds by the EU and the State for the improvement of water quality in tributaries of the Shannon. We have had long debates about this serious issue in the House and I am anxious that our concerns be conveyed to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I also wish to propose a change on the Order of Business that No. 2 be returned to committee. The point made in the Seanad was that more debate is needed, as was proven when Senator Ross discovered a loophole last night.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Glennon's call for a debate on the media, which is very timely. The relationship between the media and public representatives is like a Punch and Judy show. It gives great entertainment but it does not serve the body politic in any positive way. It gives no service to the community at large.</P>
      <P>We welcome the fact that the Taoiseach's character was formally vindicated yesterday when a notorious libel case was resolved. All genuine and fair minded people expected this would happen, but the Taoiseach's character was on hold for many people since the allegations were made. Given the widespread publicity to the groundless allegations, it is important that responsibility is brought to bear, which is why I support Senator Glennon's call. I hope the Leader will accede to the request.</P>

      <P>Many important decisions will be taken in the House today regarding the future of local government. I ask the Leader, in the autumn session, to provide for a debate in this House on the state of repair of roads and housing estates throughout the country. In the interim, the Leader should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make funding available for the repair of such roads. The buck is being passed because, although promises are made when plans are drawn up, nobody seems to be responsible for the roads in new housing estates. Formal arrangements have to be made as those living in the houses are suffering. I hope the Leader will take the matter in hand.</P>

      <P>The Leader should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what will be done about those who collect for charity and who intimidate people throughout the city centre. I realise I said that I would not raise this matter again, but the <i>Sunday Independent </i>addressed this matter again at the weekend, mentioning Concern and Fight for Sight. The article stated that less than 50% of the money collected goes to the charities in question, which are professionally organised and intimidating. I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I thank the Chair for its indulgence.</P>

Like Senator Costello this morning, I called yesterday for the advice of the Attorney General to be made available to the House before we proceed further. It will be interesting to see what happens at 2 o'clock, as it may well be that the Attorney General has further advice, although we do not know what his previous advice was. I will not be surprised if the Government proposes the Adjournment <i>sine die</i>.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator O'Toole that conflict of practice engaged in by some auctioneers should not be tolerated and should be outlawed.</P>

      <P>I support the comments of Senators Glennon and Ó Murchú in relation to yesterday's court proceedings. The Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad, Senator Manning, was called to give certain evidence. We are approaching the summer recess if the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, concludes today and I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach, the staff of the House and the media.

With regard to the item concerning the Nice Treaty, it is a <Col N="1389" /> great pity we have restricted ourselves to an hour and a half and that the debate is taking place so long after the decision. We should have had the debate much sooner and should have apportioned a more appropriate amount of time. The debate will occupy just a portion of the Government's Private Members' time. It is indicative of the way in which the major parties treat Private Members' Business, with flaccid motions and statements.</P>

      <P>It looks as if the principal parties have virtually no interest in this aspect of our business. I agree it would be useful, as Senator Glennon has said, to have a debate on the media but we should temper any criticisms with due praise. The coverage by RTÉ has been consistently criticised in the House and there are certain aspects of it that are not yet completely satisfactory. It is worth putting on the record, however, that there has been a new development. Recently, I have noticed on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; that the editors take an amendment, give the Minister's response and then follow the argument on the amendment by coming back to the individual Member. That makes it considerably more interesting. We should record the fact that we are aware of this and would like to see this practice continue in the broadcasting of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The wisest thing we could do is take time to read the advice of the Attorney General and Professor Hogan. We should give the media a chance to be heard by the appropriate Oireachtas committee, discuss all these issues and listen to the academics. The suppression of academic research in private is an extraordinary thing in a democracy. The idea that academics cannot carry out sustained research in the week before a general election to find out how public opinion is operating is a profound breach of the standards of democracy.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to attend the House in the next session for a debate on future investment in the IT and broadband sector under the national development plan? In that way we will be able to see what plans the Government has for balanced regional development in future, as well as assessing how such current development is progressing.

      <P>I would not have to raise the role and power of the National Roads Authority if we had the debate which I have sought consistently for months, as have many other Senators. It may be too late to have such a debate in October. I am appalled by the consultative arrangements for the proposed national route from Nenagh to Limerick. Hundreds of people made a simple and realistic request for an extension of two weeks to respond to two proposed routes which have caused fear and dread among local representatives in Tipperary and Limerick. Everybody was happy to grant the extension but the NRA stepped in and said &ldquo;No, you can have a week&rdquo;, when people are on holidays. I wonder what powers the National Roads Authority has. Can we have a debate on the authority's role because it is going far beyond what I thought it was? I would expect to have such a debate when we resume in October.</P>

      <P>When schools break up for the holidays, teachers often give homework. The Leader should provide some goals and objectives to the Government during the coming months. One concerns road safety. In the past week, I had the experience of being stopped at the DART on three occasions. While I do not think there is a <Col N="1392" /> northside-southside bias, on the southside the stop lasted for 50 seconds, while on the northside it was for eight and nine minutes, respectively. Road rage may be a valid explanation for road deaths and I could see road rage developing among drivers who were kept waiting for seven or eight minutes. I do not understand who is in charge of this matter, although I assume it is Iarnród Éireann or CIE. Week after week, we read about road deaths, so I would like to see something done. One small step would be to reduce the possibility of road rage.</P>
      <P>During the summer recess, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform re-examine the Charities Bill? I was stunned to discover that 50% of the amount one contributes to some charities may be paid in commission. If so, a solution must be found, perhaps similar to the health warning on cigarette packets, stating how much the collector receives in commission. Those are two tasks for the Government over the next few months.</P>

After this matter was raised on the Adjournment debate in both Houses, a meeting was organised for last Saturday at which the Minister gave a commitment that no decision would be finalised until the board met next Friday and that the sea-harvesters' product would be transported to the Galway plant. Despite that, the management notified the harvesters yesterday that no more seaweed would be collected from Friday, but did not mention transporting the product to Galway, leaving them in limbo. After 30 years' service, all they received was &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; at the end of the letter, which is not good enough. I ask the Leader to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters. First, I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the possible delay of the roads programme under the national development plan, resulting from the impasse between farmers and the National Roads Authority. This serious matter requires attention at the highest level. Farmers are entitled to compensation but the roads programme, which is the biggest in the history of the State, must proceed. I ask the Leader to consult the Minister about a compensation package which would allow the NRA to carry out the roads programme early next year.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on water quality, particularly that in the Shannon basin. The Minister must recognise that the two main problems are the lack of pump out facilities for the Shannon boating industry, an issue I raised often, and the use of phosphates, which should be banned from household cleaning solutions and artificial fertilisers. It is unfair to blame local authorities and farmers since large chemical companies contribute most to water deterioration by including phosphates in these products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Coogan, O'Toole, Costello, Burke, Keogh, Ryan and Norris spoke on No. 2. The Government will relay information to me at 1.45 p.m. on the matter that was adjourned last night. The Minister will answer in the House the points raised by the Senators, particularly Senator Ross. We appreciate and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for his hard work yesterday. He was in the House for over 13 hours, encompassing 15 votes that took up three hours 45 minutes, because of the long and serious debate.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Farrell and Coghlan called for a debate on auctioneering. Auctioneers give great service to the country and are held in high esteem by the business community. If some break the rules and betray trust, I hope that their association deals with that speedily. Senator Farrell's views are born of experience. There can be a debate in autumn on auctioneering and all matters concerning the sale of land, including those involving other professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will convey to the Minister Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Nolan. She also made a statement about the chairman and chief executive of Bord Fáilte. We are fortunate in having these two great men working on the country's behalf during good and difficult times. I wish <Col N="1394" /> them well. This is an opportunity for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to put his stamp on change.</P>
    <P>Senators Glennon, Chambers, Ó Murchú, Rory Kiely, Farrell and Cosgrave called for a debate on the media. Senator Glennon seeks one on the role of the media and the profession of politics. We debated this many times in recent years and should do so again. There should be a commission on media standards and the decline in truth in the news. In this context, I reiterate Senator Cosgrave's comments about Senator Manning's role as a witness in the case on the allegations against the Taoiseach. I commend his decency, honesty and integrity in giving forthright evidence before the court because of the damage that such wildcat allegations could do to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I join Senators in asking what is to be done in relation to these dreadful allegations. All one has is one's character and integrity. Public life is about trust. We are fortunate to have a wonderful Taoiseach who works himself to the bone morning, noon and night with commitment. It must have been very difficult for a man of integrity when such an allegation is made and carried in the media. Perhaps in future such allegations will be checked out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Senators Connor and Finneran called for a debate on water quality, particularly in the Shannon. I will pass those views on to the Minister. Last week we had statements on water quality and the time allocated was not taken up.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh called for repairs to roads in housing estates. The Local Government Bill is in the House and that issue might be highlighted under an appropriate section. The point could have been made on Second Stage which was taken yesterday.</P>
    <P>I have passed Senator Lanigan's views on to the Minister regarding people collecting money, particularly those who are organised and who get aggressive in approaching potential donors. We must be very careful and watchful in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with Senator Farrell's expression of good wishes to the Taoiseach, Tony Blair and everyone associated with the current talks. There is nothing more important for both Governments then the peace talks. We all hope and pray they are successful and wish them well in the hope that the Good Friday Agreement will be enhanced even further and that everybody will give a little to finalise the various loose ends.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Senator Norris that there is no time limit on the debate on the Nice treaty referendum. I said that spokespersons would have ten minutes and other Senators would have seven minutes. The debate will be open ended.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers raised investment in the IT sector, particularly through broadband, and I will pass his views on to the Minister for Public Enterprise. I intend to leave time for a debate on this early in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman called for a debate on the NRA. We have had many such debates in the <Col N="1395" /> House. The first Private Members' debate was on the NRA, and I recall at least three further debates. I understand that the farming organisations and their leaders have been meeting with the NRA and are working very hard to find a formula. Everybody wants to see farmers getting their fair share, and as Senator Finneran said, we also want to see the national development plan being implemented. I hope progress can be made and that common sense will prevail.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of road safety and road rage. A very decent effort has been made in addressing the number of terrible deaths on our roads over recent years. I understand that the numbers being killed on the roads are in decline, for which we are very thankful. I will also pass the views of the Senator regarding the charities legislation on to the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner referred to a problem in Donegal and I will pass his views on to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources after the Order of Business. Regarding the matter raised by Senator Keogh, I have given an assurance that we will have a debate on disabilities and I hope the relevant legislation will be before the House in the autumn.</P>
    <P>If this is the last day of the session, which can only be decided on how business progresses today, I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach for the great work he has done in the House during the session, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk for the kindness and courtesy shown to us, the leaders of the groups in the House and the Whips, particularly the hard work<Col N="1396" /> ing Government Whip. We are very grateful to the ushers, the gardaí and the press, including Jimmy Walsh who covers proceedings in the House and George Devlin from RTÉ. I also thank the sound engineers for the great improvement in sound and the parliamentary reporters who record everything that happens in the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Leader of the House to the ranks of the Labour Party; he is agreeing to everything.</P>
      <P>I have a standing objection on the matter of commencement in this section. I raise this on every piece of legislation that I deal with. There is no reason a time frame for commencement should not be inserted. It is a further unnecessary handing over of power by the Oireachtas to the Executive. Unfortunately it is a power that has been upheld by the courts. I recall the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, which was not enacted for 20 years and was eventually replaced by the current mental health legislation. There are areas of local government legislation which have never been enacted.</P>
      <P>It is wrong in principle that legislation passed by the Oireachtas can be postponed indefinitely by the fiat of Government. I think there should be a commencement date, even if it is two or three years away. Otherwise it leaves us to the lethargy of the bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Government for acknowledging that Kilkenny is a city and that it retains its city status. There was much debate on this issue and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government gave a guarantee at the outset that the status of Kilkenny would not change. The change in this Bill has enhanced the status of Kilkenny as a city. Modern legislation had not recognised this until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The elimination of archaic terminology in the section is something of which we have to be cognisant. Confusing variations between different laws applying to different types of authorities will be removed. The less conflict there is in language and in the use of language, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, promised the then mayor of Kilkenny, councillor Paul Cuddihy, that he would give Kilkenny city status. He has not honoured that. Kilkenny has had a city charter since 1689. The Minister has completely reneged on the commitment he gave to Mr. Cuddihy. Towns such as Sligo, Drogheda, Clonmel, Wexford and Kilkenny, have sought city status. The Minister should, in view of the commitment he gave to the mayor of Kilkenny, honour the commitment and give city and borough status to those five towns which are cities in all but name. I am sure that the Minister meant to confer full city status to Kilkenny when he gave the commitment and I am sure he still intends to do that. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to confirm that this can now be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Lanigan's compliments to the Minister. There was concern expressed by the borough corporation. Kilkenny, being the &ldquo;Marble City&rdquo;, was anxious to retain its status and the Minister has accommodated that.</P>
      <P>There is an issue which this section deals with but has not really been addressed. The designation of all urban authorities &ndash; including town commissioners, urban district councils and borough corporations &ndash; as borough councils, has given them all a similar status in name. The urbanisation of society is not reflected in the Bill and I fear that the powers are very much concentrated with the county councils. If there was a move to the lowest common denominator, the urban district and borough councils could be reduced to the level of town commissioners. That would be a retrograde step. There is nothing in the Bill that states that their powers will be less, but I am concerned about the common designation in that whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sad part of this is that this would not be in the Bill at all if the Minister did not mention the point of not allowing Kilkenny to be a city. Kilkenny has a character of its own and it is a credit to our society that we have places like it. Unfortunately Kilkenny and places such as Sligo and Drogheda, despite their great traditions, do not get the recognition they deserve. We should not be afraid to broaden our minds and ensure that other places be defined as cities. Let us consider what is happening in Dublin. It would be wrong to give an impression that other <Col N="1400" /> cities are the same. Dublin is grid-locked. Kilkenny is less that an hour and a half away, Drogheda is an hour away, Sligo is two and a half hours away by motorway, but we are not allowing these people to decide for themselves.</P>
      <P>Until now our cities have been defined as Waterford, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Belfast and Dublin. We should not be afraid to allow the people of our major towns to decide for themselves if they want to be recognised as cities. That should be in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Lanigan I welcome the recognition of Kilkenny in this Bill, but it would have been there had the relevant Minister not cast doubts over its status. There would have been no definition of cities, towns or boroughs. It is only because a delegation of councillors, under the leadership of the mayor, Paul Cuddihy, came to see the Minister that this was included in the Bill. That cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>The provision as originally drafted was unfortunate and wrong. That said, we should not be afraid to say that, under this part of the Bill or future regulations relevant to it, we should consider the idea of other places being designated cities, such as Sligo and Drogheda. Galway is the only city on the west coast &ndash; Limerick is in the Munster region. I do not see why Sligo should not be granted full city status; likewise Kilkenny, which is in the middle of the country. It is unfortunate these places are not designated cities because they are large urban areas and fine places and we should not be afraid to recognise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One should seek a definition of what is meant by a city. My original understanding was that it contained a cathedral and a university and that these were the major issues in defining a city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good and I thank the Senator for that information but I already knew it. Times have changed since that concept of a city was first devised. Most large towns in Ireland have institutes of technology which often confer degrees equivalent to those of a university. Therefore, one can redefine the term &ldquo;city&rdquo;. We should not hang on to old English definitions. It is time we redefined what we want our country to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan said much hot air had been generated, but that is not true. People in Kilkenny were very upset and Councillor Cuddihy, who represented the council and the people of Kilkenny, was adamant the title of city would be retained for Kilkenny. He received support from this side of the House, we raised the issue and the Minister agreed to re-examine it. We thought he might do the same for Drogheda, Sligo, Dundalk and Clonmel. Perhaps the Minister of State, while he may not have freedom of <Col N="1401" /> movement on this issue, will make our views known to the Minister so that he might see the light and support it if he can. All we ask for is recognition. We recognise the value, history and traditions Kilkenny has for the country and it is only right it retains the title of city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Kilkenny has retained its city status. I come from the neighbouring county of Waterford and know a great deal about Kilkenny and its heritage and history. I would have been very concerned had it been demoted in status.</P>
      <P>This has presented an opportunity to air this issue and make a decision on the requirements for qualification for city status. I am glad Kilkenny has retained its status because it always reflected a history of culture and education. It is also becoming a focus for decentralisation with much movement from the cities in its direction. It is good news that it has retained its city status and I appreciate the fact that the Minister took it into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the correct decision of the Minister to allow Kilkenny retain its description as a city, there is a fundamental issue of organisational efficiency. There will be large towns which will not be able to run their affairs in the way a city can because they will have the more circumscribed powers of a town council rather than the more extensive powers of a city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only read the Bill and I do not intend to argue with local authority members about this. However, a clear distinction is made between the fact that a city council has jurisdiction throughout its administrative area while a town council has such powers as the Bill grants it. I will not argue about this. However, it appears there is a difference between a town and a city which is more than just the title. It is about the authority of the county council in whose jurisdiction the city is located. I could be wrong but that is how I understand it.</P>
      <P>There is a question of why titles were not given. I would have preferred every local authority, especially urban ones, to have a mayor, not a chairman or anything else, because I like the title. There is an issue of local ceremony involved. The mayor is confined to a certain number of places listed in Chapter 1 of Schedule 5 or 6 and only those. I do not understand why every local authority and large town cannot have a mayor. There is a lack of understanding of the way the country will change or else there is an acceptance it will not change and we will end up with a massive megalopolis on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to achieve balanced development, places such as Sligo and Tralee must become cities. It is worth remembering that Galway city 25 years ago had a population much smaller than a dozen towns in the country have now. We now <Col N="1402" /> have a situation where we refuse to call places cities which are larger than most cities in the country were 25 years ago. There is a lack of logic. I do not want to delay the House on this. I wish Kilkenny well because it is a lovely place, although I wish it did not dominate Leinster hurling so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We had best not open up a debate on hurling between Kilkenny and Wexford. Perhaps it would be useful to Members were I to comment on this. I welcome the supportive comments about what the Minister has done for Kilkenny. I share the views about the special nature and character of the city which is unique. While we all feel those places with which we are intimate are unique, Kilkenny is special.</P>
      <P>A range of official amendments relating to the question of boroughs and to the historical position of Kilkenny were made to the Bill during its passage through the other House. The substantive sections in this regard are this section and section 11. These will continue the term &ldquo;borough&rdquo; in local government law and allow the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; to be used for Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The Bill as published used the term &ldquo;town&rdquo; to apply to all towns in line with everyday language and &ldquo;town council&rdquo; to apply to all 80 town based local authorities. Section 10 deals with local government areas and section 11 with the local authorities for the areas concerned. Under section 10, local government areas are known as counties, cities and towns. The use of the term &ldquo;town&rdquo; was a cause of concern for a number of authorities known as boroughs. These are Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford. There were concerns that this change in terminology represented a diminution in status. Perhaps I should give some background as to where these proposals originated.</P>
      <P>There was a specific proposal in the White Paper published by the previous Government that modern terminology would be applied to local government and that the terms &ldquo;city&rdquo;, &ldquo;county&rdquo; and &ldquo;town&rdquo; should be used in modern law. This was recommended in the Barrington report in 1990 and by the commission on town local government in 1996. There was never any question of diminution in status. What was involved was using language which might have more meaning to the layman. Very few people refer to borough centres or borough people, rather to town centres and town people. In some of these towns, the tourism literature refers to town rather than borough. Kilkenny is the exception. When private sector enterprise in these towns advertises, it tends to use the term &ldquo;town&rdquo;, and that is the term in use in everyday language. The issue is the use of everyday language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister, as part of a wide consultation exercise, met the five mayors of the authorities concerned and, in light of their concerns, undertook to provide that the five towns concerned would continue to be boroughs for the purpose of local government law, and their local <Col N="1403" /> authorities will in future be titled as borough councils. The series of official amendments in the other House to sections 10 and 11 and a number of related amendments were designed to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new section 10(3) is that what are currently boroughs will continue to be known as boroughs and all other towns which are currently styled as urban district councils or town commissioners will in future be styled as towns. Therefore, the special historical position of Kilkenny was dealt with by way of an additional subsection (7) to section 10. A new section 11(4)(<i>b</i>) inserted by way of amendment in the Dáil provides that the local authorities for the boroughs created under section 10 will be known as borough councils and the local authorities for the other towns will be known as town councils. References in the Act to a town council will, where necessary, be read as including both town councils and borough councils.</P>
    <P>New provisions to recognise the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; to describe Kilkenny in line with long-established historical and municipal practice were brought in. Kilkenny was reconstituted as a borough corporation under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1840, as were Clonmel, Drogheda and Sligo. Section 2 of the 1840 Act specifically provided that Kilkenny is a borough which is still the current legal position in local government law. Traditionally, however, Kilkenny had been referred to as a city and this has its roots in local usage, deriving from a 17th century charter. It has not been a city in terms of local government law for at least 160 years.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the Bill as published specifically provides that local charters can continue for ceremonial or related purposes, thereby safeguarding local tradition and practice. There was, therefore, no difficulty in Kilkenny continuing with this long-established tradition. However, Kilkenny Corporation indicated that it was concerned that the existing provisions in the Bill would not maintain the <i>status quo</i> in addition to concerns with the other boroughs that the term &ldquo;town&rdquo; was some form of diminution of status. In view of these concerns the Minister indicated that he would include a provision in the Bill to specifically recognise the traditional usage of the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; to describe Kilkenny. For the first time ever in the Local Government Act the unique position of Kilkenny is being recognised in local government law.</P>
    <P>The Minister honoured in full his commitment on Kilkenny and delivered on what the deputation from Kilkenny sought. It was never intended that Kilkenny would be a city such as Dublin or Cork. All Kilkenny wanted was to be allowed to continue to use the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; in recognition of its ancient tradition. The deputation expressed its satisfaction to the Minister on his proposal.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister of State with great interest. I believe that the people of Kilkenny probably felt their city would be called a city. Schedule 7 of the Bill refers to Kilkenny and other towns as town councils with 12 members. Therefore, it appears that Kilkenny will still be referred to as a town with 12 members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for retaining the special status Kilkenny has always had. As the Minister of State rightly said, since 1840 Kilkenny was not given the status as a city under the Local Government Acts. Historically Kilkenny has had a reputation as a city. It was the first city in the country in which the Parliament sat at one stage. While I do not wish to take away from the work done by Mayor Cuddihy, the impetus for the retention of Kilkenny's city status came from the public in Kilkenny. We should thank KCR, the local radio station, and the people of Kilkenny for the great work they did in keeping up the fight for the retention of the status of Kilkenny as a city. While we are getting no more than our due, we are very thankful that the historical status of Kilkenny as a city will be retained. It is a small city but one of historical importance and of which we are very proud. Anyone who has ever visited the city is proud of what has happened there.</P>
      <P>Local government has played an important part down through the years in the extension of facilities. Kilkenny was the first city in Ireland to put a permanent ban on plastic signs over shop fronts. Deputy McGuinness's father proposed that plastic signs should not be allowed in Kilkenny and those who had signs up removed them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister of State is saying. The Bill provides that each local authority will have a uniform legislative foundation &ndash; members of local authorities are titled councillor. Subsection (6) provides that a local authority has jurisdiction in its administrative area in respect of the functions vested in it by this or any other enactment. We should not be afraid to say that we need other cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan is correct that Kilkenny is a classic place. It is a credit to us. The local authorities have done an enormous job. The city <Col N="1405" /> already had a lot of character, given its castle and grounds, but unfortunately in recent years a car park has been built which does not do justice to the rest of the city, of which Senator Lanigan is aware.</P>
    <P>I would like to see other places getting the same recognition as Kilkenny. Sligo deserves such recognition. The Bill should include other towns on the west coast and further north because these people should be looking to the future. Kilkenny could easily have been left behind if the Minister got away with what he was proposing. Whether Senator Lanigan likes it, the Minister was prepared to say that Kilkenny was not a city.</P>

      <P>The Minister should seek to create more cities because Dublin is too big. Senator Ryan referred to Tralee which is a fine town in Kerry. Like Kilkenny, it is an area which no one wants to leave. We should not be afraid to say that Sligo should be designated a city because it is as big as Kilkenny. The same applies to Drogheda. The country should be pushing to designate these towns as cities and areas of excellence. Kilkenny is an excellent tourism region because it has great character. Killarney, Tralee and Limerick are great places and Galway has a character of its own &ndash; this has only been built up in the past five or ten years. Galway is a beautiful city. The price of property in Galway is as high as it is in Dublin. Sligo should be allowed to do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Cregan on the very fine case he made for Sligo to be designated a city, and so it should be. The Minister proposed to delete the term &ldquo;borough&rdquo; from Sligo, Clonmel, Drogheda, Wexford and Kilkenny. If the Minister is prepared to recognise the special historical position of Kilkenny, why can he not recognise the special historical position of the others and give them the status of city? As Senator Burke pointed out, the Minister is undermining this by declaring in the Schedule that they can only be called &ldquo;town councils&rdquo;. Is it the case now that Kilkenny can call its soccer club Kilkenny City, but the elected representatives cannot be regarded as members of a city council but as members of a town council, irrespective of the special recognition of Kilkenny as a city? The legislation has recognised the continued use of the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; in relation to Kilkenny. This is an anomaly. I am sure Senator Lanigan would concur with the view that the city fathers of Kilkenny should be entitled to call themselves a city council.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the implications of it in terms of representation, but the legislation allows Kilkenny to be described as a city and the soccer club has always been called Kilkenny City. However, the elected representatives cannot claim to represent a city, merely a town. That is <Col N="1406" /> an anomaly in the legislation. We could argue a similar case for the other four boroughs. The lords mayor of Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford together successfully lobbied the Minister and they should all be treated the same now. Why should one be singled out as being of special historical significance and not the others? I think Sligo is entitled to it.</P>

      <P>There are two arguments here. One is about the titles and the other is that we are talking about towns which could become towns of development. Some of the larger cities are bursting at the seams and it would be appropriate and proper planning if such towns were developed. It would enhance their role it they were given the title of city and it would encourage development if they could use the title of city. Senator Costello has pointed out the anomaly in the legislation regarding Kilkenny. Even if the others could use the title of city in their official letterheading, they would have a head start in terms of encouraging development.</P>

      <P>There is a bigger omission in this Bill. I will defer to my local authority colleagues here. There are places that have neither town nor city status, huge urban areas such as Newbridge, Dingle or Roscrea. Senator O'Meara informs me that Roscrea is actually bigger than Templemore but Templemore has an urban district council and Roscrea does not have any local council. There is more than just symbolism about this; it is a question of focus. I assumed that there was going to be a degree of rationalisation and I discover that all the peculiar anomalies are going to be dressed up in something that is called a town council. Large urban areas, some of them as big as Kilkenny, places that are going to be called borough corporations will have no local government at all. That is a recipe for a lack of accountability by the bureaucrats who will be deciding what is best for towns where there are no elected representatives.</P>

      <P>As a man of record himself, I am sure the Senator will agree that it is very important to see what it had to say. As Senator Coogan rightly said, we are dealing with broader issues also. That Government did recommend that the titles county, city and town councils be <Col N="1407" /> used in place of the present terms which it said had little meaning for the citizens. There is agreement between the present Government and that Government.</P>
      <P>The most important part of the Bill is the special reference to Kilkenny. Section 10 (7) states: &ldquo;This section is without prejudice to the continued use of the description city in relation to Kilkenny, to the extent that that description was used before the establishment day and is not otherwise inconsistent with the Act.&rdquo; That is a very good example of the Minister responding to representations from Members of whatever parties and from members of the public. This is a major issue which we all followed very carefully and with great interest. The truth is that when the other four boroughs met the Minister, they sought to retain borough status and this has been done.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform Senator Ryan that there is a later section that allows a town which does not have a local authority to establish one so his concerns will be addressed in that section.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for cities which in local government law are currently called county boroughs with city councils. They are Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Each has its own city council and is entirely separate from the county with its own council organisation, offices, manager and finances. A city council is equivalent to a county council and is responsible for the full range of local authority functions. There is a total of 34 such county or city councils. In line with the policy set out in the document on local government by the previous Government, there are no proposals to provide for further fragmentation of counties to create additional city authorities and a system which is neither organisationally nor financially sustainable. Scotland, with a population of five million has four city authorities while Wales has two. The Minister responded to a particular situation in Kilkenny and I believe he was correct. I hope my responses have been of help in this debate.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 12, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&ndash;A member of a local authority who is employed in any office or employment shall be entitled to such unpaid leave from the office or employment in question as is necessary to enable him or her to attend meetings of the authority or committees thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for support of this is self-evident. I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is not <Col N="1408" /> present because I could refer to something with which he is familiar as he was a member of a local authority. This may be an anecdotal reference but I remember one elected representative who wished to take time off from work. His pay was deducted and a substitute was paid in his place and was paid more than he was receiving per hour. It was costing him both in time and in money to be a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>This amendment is very reasonable. We should find a structure by which to pay local authority members for unpaid leave during time off. I realise one cannot be clocking in and out but in the institutes of technology there is a system whereby eight days are allocated if one is a public representative. The eight days do not have to be taken in a block, there is flexibility. I ask that the same apply in the private sector, State bodies and semi-State bodies. A person who gives of his or her time &ndash; local authorities demand more and more &ndash; should not lose out as a result of making a commitment to public service. It is a simple request and I ask that the Minister take it on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty with accepting amendments because of the need to get the Bill through but this is an amendment of which I am strongly in favour. LAMA put the matter to the Minister a long while ago and in the negotiations for the PPF the Minister and the Government put it to the social partners. It had the support of the ICTU but the IBEC had strong reservations. We asked that it would be taken up subsequently.</P>
      <P>The point made by Senator Coogan is definitely valid. The whole democratic process needs people from all walks of life to participate in it and if we value our democracy we must ensure that it is accessible to everybody. Those employed in certain positions find it difficult if their employers do not facilitate them. There should be a statutory provision for that right. Indeed, the three representative associations are of one mind on this and made a submission to the Minister. If there is anything the Minister can do to push that and get agreement, it is highly desirable that he do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to allow anybody elected to public office to attend to their duties is self-evident. If they cannot do what they are elected to do because their employer will not allow them leave it is a contradiction. What does local democracy mean in those circumstances? If we have any respect for local democracy &ndash; we have enshrined its importance in the Constitution &ndash; surely there is an onus on us to ensure that those elected by the people to represent them get at least the minimum. That minimum is unpaid leave to allow them to turn up at meetings where decisions are made and where they carry out their duties. I cannot see how anybody could object to this. We all know of instances where members have pleaded with the representative bodies because they were unable to attend meetings as <Col N="1409" /> the employer was not prepared to let them leave work on an unpaid basis.</P>
      <P>This is another example of rushing through legislation at the end of a term. This amendment is so patently necessary that I am sure if the Bill did not have to go through today and the Dáil was sitting next week it would be accepted. It has been said that the IBEC has reservations about it, but the IBEC has reservations about everything to do with employees. That goes without saying.</P>

      <P>Remember that we are talking about representative democracy. This is a basic tenet of that and the only way we can ensure it is to enshrine it as a statutory entitlement. The amendment in the name of Senator Coogan and the Labour Party group is essential if we are to do that. I do not know if the Minister can take it on board at this point or if he can indicate whether an amendment will be introduced in the autumn. I suspect by the way things are looking that he will not take it on board now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's amendment. Nobody should be penalised for having to carry out their functions as a democratically elected public representative. I do not know whether the Minister will accept the amendment or whether he can introduce some measure at a different stage but no one should be penalised. The private and the public sectors are involved in this and I have seen how people were not facilitated on numerous occasions, particularly in the public sector. Whether they were teaching or in other jobs their bosses would not allow them sufficient time off to attend meetings, and that is completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great empathy with this amendment. Many councillors from the length and breath of the State have come to me since the last local elections to point out the problems they have getting time off to attend to their public duties. We are talking about local democracy and reflecting needs. If agreement has been made with your employer that you are running for local government it should follow that you would be allowed time off to attend to your public duties. It may not be constitutional and an employer does not have to give time off but in terms of goodwill and civic duty I ask the Minister to sit down with the IBEC under the PPF to see if a solution can be arrived at. That would facilitate those who put their names forward, are elected and want to honour commitments to their job and their public service. I call on employers, through the IBEC, to sit down and negotiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It even happens in the public service. When I was a teacher I had to rearrange my timetable in such a way as to ensure I accommodated attendance at council meetings. The goodwill of the principal of the school allowed that but it should <Col N="1410" /> not necessarily be so. This is not about the IBEC alone. It should be of concern to all of us that anyone who puts his or her name forward to serve the public is respected accordingly. There should be goodwill in relation to that and I ask the Minister to reinforce these points again. It cannot be part of this Bill because it may not work constitutionally but there should be goodwill. That is the way we should go forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I would like the Minister to listen to the comments from all sides of the House in support of it. In speaking on it we represent the strongest desires of local authority members and recognise the far more onerous role an elected member now has. That was pointed out on numerous occasions, particularly on Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The legislation has been described as reforming but I do not accept that. There is no doubt that it recognises the changing role of local government, its increased importance and the increased importance of elected members. If we are to recognise the critical role of the person who has been democratically elected, particularly those who are trying to hold down a job, we must facilitate them and support them as much as possible. This has been recognised finally in the legislation by the provision of an allowance for elected members. It appears it is probably just as important to recognise that people who are members of local authorities should be given the right to unpaid leave from their employment to attend the meetings, where necessary, to accommodate their role as elected members.</P>
      <P>This is very much in the spirit of this legislation. In that context I appeal to the Minister to listen to the views of the Members of this House who represent members of local authorities throughout the country from all political parties. I also ask him to recognise that the role has become more onerous and that it involves far more time than it did previously.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on Monday night, I spoke to one of the members of my county council who is a member of the Minister of State's party. He is the chairman of an SPC and a member of the VEC as well as being a member of the county council, and he told me that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday were all taken up. He can only do this work because he is self-employed. It is not surprising then he said that he hoped we would pass this Bill this week because he needs to be paid for what he is doing. As a self-employed person, his work is undoubtedly suffering. His situation is not unusual. One can say that he has chosen to do that, but increasingly we need people to serve and we cannot afford to narrow the pool of people available to run for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As all members of political parties will be aware, when the local elections come around one is on the look-out for people who might stand but a considerable number of people must say &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they would not be able to get time off <Col N="1411" /> from work to attend meetings. If this is written into the legislation, it would certainly help that particular process and would fundamentally shore up the democratic function. I appeal to the Minister of State to take this amendment on board. He should see it is very much in the spirit of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made strongly. I mean no disrespect to city councillors, county councillors or urban councillors, but the best people are not coming forward in public life in Ireland. That is obvious. One must look at how to address this problem. Senator O'Meara made a strong case for particular people who are involved in public life on a full-time basis. In the city council of which I am a member, there are people who do not have full-time jobs who can give more of their time to the work of the council than people in employment. While the amendment states that a member of a local authority shall be entitled to such unpaid leave from &ldquo;the office or employment in question&rdquo;, I would prefer if instead it stated, &ldquo;from his or her place of work&rdquo;. Otherwise one is defining it in terms of the type of work done by one person rather than another.</P>
      <P>If we are saying that members of local authorities need to be paid, which they do, and if we are to get the best people to come into public life, we need to recognise the amount of time they put into it. Until ten years ago Cork City Council met at 7.30 p.m. on Monday nights and, therefore, it was not difficult to attend the meetings. Nowadays the meetings take place at 5.30 p.m. because the administrative staff said, correctly, that there was no reason they should be there all night and they wanted to get home to their families. They now wish to hold the meetings at 2.30 p.m. That would mean that a person would be gone from his or her place of work for a whole day and one wonders how a person can answer that call.</P>
      <P>It is not easy for the employers either and we do not want to be critical of them. A great deal of leeway is given by employers to people in public life but it is not easy to facilitate such people, particularly when they work in the private sector. In the public sector, particularly if one is a teacher, one can find a way around the difficulty but in the private sector it is not so easy. That is why we are not getting people to come forward. It is just a question of costs. We should not be afraid to look at this and to try to find a way around it. We must ask whether the problem can be solved by providing a tax allowance and whether the employer can be compensated in this way also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are saying that a person should not lose out financially if he or she must attend meetings, how does one define a meeting? How can one tell whether a meeting is necessary? Should the provision be confined to meetings of the local authority, as set out in the amendment, or should <Col N="1412" /> it include committees therein? A problem could arise where people could leave work to go to a community meeting or a political meeting which would not be relevant to the work of the local authority. We also must look at that issue and decide what is the best way around this problem. The best way is to decide, with the help of the IBEC and the trades unions, that if a person is elected to a qualifying local authority, certain conditions prevail. I ask the Minister of State to look into that matter.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot allow a situation where a person can get time off work to go to every meeting. For instance, there are three or four city councillors in Cork who would go to a meeting even if it were held on Christmas Day or St. Stephen's Day. Other people want to be with their families but, unfortunately, if they are at the meeting, the rest of us must be at the meeting too. In addition, some of these councillors are not in employment and would prefer not to be employed. Some of them may be on disability benefit and if they receive a local authority salary, they will not qualify for their disability benefits. The Minister of State must take that into consideration also. That, however, is a matter which will arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The House understands exactly what I mean. Some people can go to meetings at any hour of the day. Others, who would have a greater interest and would have much more to give, cannot go to meetings because of their employment. This is a serious problem. That is why I agree with Senator O'Meara that we are not getting the best people to come forward for public life. We should not be afraid to look at this and decide to create an environment in which the best people come forward. I ask the Minister of State to look at that. There should be something in the regulations stating that a member of a local authority should be entitled to some such benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this Bill is passed quickly. This is an important amendment which should be revisited. The amendment highlights an important difficulty. I can speak from experience, having been a member of a local authority for more than 25 years. At present, no employer would employ a member of a local authority simply because of the amount of time off he or she would need to attend to local authority business. This issue must be looked at in that light.</P>
      <P>One must look at providing time off to enable local authorities to hold meetings at suitable times. This is not just in order to facilitate the members. Local authorities must look at the difficulties encountered by their staff. Many employers prefer people to be missing on Fridays or to do their local authority business before work begins and they do not want people taking time off in the middle of the week. That is why this must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of allowance involved, which we will come to later in the Bill, is another issue which <Col N="1413" /> must be looked at. If an employer is allowing an employee time off, he or she must be sure about what is involved. If a provision is not inserted here or if the Bill is not revisited, there will be a difficulty. One hopes to get the best available people to serve at local authority level. A large majority who would have a lot to contribute will be unable to put their names forward to be members of local authorities if we do not afford them the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>This issue can be revisited. I am sure the Minister has overseen the passage of many Bills in the past, particularly in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but there have always been sections in Bills that required revisiting. Section 12 is such a section. However, I oppose the amendment on the grounds that we must get this Bill passed immediately because of the benefits it affords to local authority members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter under discussion is very important, as has been established by the clear views of the Senators who have spoken. I, as a former member of a local authority, am very much aware of the issues and examples that have been raised. Members of local authorities find it difficult to combine the pressures of membership with the pressures of working life.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde is correct in saying the Minister has considered the insertion of a statutory requirement to provide for time off from work for members of local authorities. As Senator Ormonde said, the Minister was examining the constitutionality of the matter and he was advised that there is a constitutional difficulty with regard to private employers. It is unlikely that employers could be compelled to release staff.</P>
      <P>I know most public sector employees, such as the ESB, Bord na Móna, and Bord Gáis, allow councillors leave to attend meetings. Civil servants are also entitled to special leave with pay. Eircom and An Post also have special arrangements. There have to be limitations with regard to employees in general.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that many councillors have had to work part-time and job share because of their commitments. The Minister believes that the best way forward, as stated by Senator Ormonde and others, is to proceed under the PPF. I know the Minister intends to follow up the matter with all the relevant parties &ndash; the social partners, employers unions, and others. I can assure the Senators that I will convey the views of all parties to the Minister so we can expedite the process. That is the best offer I can give today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Minister of State with a special responsibility for labour affairs, I know there are many similar employment related issues that have not been dealt with adequately by representatives of employers. IBEC and ICTU were mentioned earlier. There have been many issues addressed <Col N="1414" /> in terms of employment entitlements and I hope this issue could be addressed in a similar fashion. We are talking about the Government's efforts to create family friendly workplaces to make it easier for people to combine work and family responsibilities. From the context of this debate, and from my having worked as a member of a local authority, we should also try to combine working life with home life alongside our commitments to public engagements and our democratic duties.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan was correct in stating that, further on in the Bill, salaries are dealt with &ndash; an issue very much a part of the current debate. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment because the Minister has concerns about its constitutionality, but I will convey the strong cross-party views I have heard to him, views with which I sympathise. As Minister of State with a responsibility for labour affairs, I have encountered similar matters that have been dealt with in a similar fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the amendment, if taken <i>en bloc</i>, could be open to abuse by some employees. What we are seeking is a minimal contract with employees that will guarantee that for important meetings, for example, one would have unpaid leave. It is a simple request. I am satisfied that the Minister of State will convey this to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and ask him to reflect on it. If he can do it through social partnership, I will accept that.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify a matter raised by Senator Cregan concerning the wording of the amendment. The term &ldquo;office&rdquo; means one's employment title, not a physical office. I am sure the Senator will forgive me for drawing attention to this because the term was somewhat ambiguous.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 12, as the Minister is well aware, the registers of electors are compiled usually in November and a certain date in January or February. Unless one is on the register of electors, one is not entitled to vote &ndash; unless one can be included on the supplementary register. One is not entitled to be placed on the register unless one has reached 18 years on or before the day the register is being compiled. Therefore, if a local election is being held in May or June, a person is entitled to stand for election and be elected, perhaps as a mayor of a city or a county councillor. However, he may not be entitled to be on the register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should consider revising that section so it will state that people who are eligible will be eligible to stand for election if they are eligible to be on the register. Otherwise the <Col N="1415" /> compilation of the register of electors will have to be carried out differently. If a person is not eligible to be on the register, he could still be entitled to stand for election. I hope the Minister of State understands what I have said.</P>

      <P>A related anomaly that must be brought to the attention of the Minister and his Department concerns the supplementary register and an 18 year old applying to be on that register later in the year. If he is not 18 by 31 January, he cannot apply to be on the supplementary register. This is inherently unfair. I want this issue to be addressed.</P>

      <P>When re-examining the issue, it must be clarified to the point of establishing who qualifies and when they qualify. The register should be up to date and the public should not be confused. Before the Bill becomes law, the Minister will have a golden opportunity to provide clarification, perhaps by regulation. Then everybody will be at ease.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was raised by a member of the LAMA executive. We considered it valid and subsequently included it in the joint submission to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, from the three associations. Section 13 spells out the areas of disqualification from membership and deals, in particular, with specific convictions covering fraudulent dealings affecting the local authority of which the person is or intends to be a member, corrupt practice or acting when disqualified. Our proposal was to include a conviction relating to the sale or distribution of illicit drugs in that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong argument that people involved in the illicit drug business could get involved in community activities and find themselves as members of local authorities. I have no knowledge that it has happened but there may be anecdotal evidence that it has. Obviously that would be wrong because illegal drug use is endemic, particularly in urban areas. These people can ingratiate themselves with the local community and get into positions of authority and status, through which they gain access to people in the community. A very strong case was made for disqualifying people with convictions in that area. One does not want to interfere with the democratic process but in <Col N="1417" /> areas of great sensitivity, notably where young people are concerned, all possible steps should be taken. I ask that this be looked at in this or in future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Walsh has already touched on a point raised by the GCCC, LAMA and the AMAI. I will not go back over it as it is a reasonable request. However, section 13 prevents certain groups from standing for election for local government, including Ministers, Ministers of State, MEPs, members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and certain convicted criminals. Unfortunately, the public probably regards it as very appropriate to group that lot together in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there seems to be a full stop between local authority staff and convicted criminals. I am not sure why it is there.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that local authority staff members should be disbarred from becoming members of local government. They are adequately, or perhaps even better, qualified for the job than many others who apply to stand for local government. I do not see how their membership would infringe on local government. I ask the Minister of State to justify disqualifying local government staff from standing for election. Very often they have a wealth of experience to bring to local government. They are being excluded without foundation.</P>

      <P>I echo the points made so far and will reflect the views of the general council. As a member of that body I have already heard this debate many times at meetings. I agree with Senator Coogan's point about grouping together civil servants and those convicted of certain offences. I ask the Minister of State to clarify that.</P>
      <P>We are sensitive about having people with convictions in our midst. I would feel very ill at ease having such people on the same ticket. It is a sensitive area because we cannot curb democracy. However, we need some qualification criteria for election candidates.</P>
      <P>I am surprised local authority staff have been placed under the umbrella of disqualified groups. It covers a wide range of people, some of whom are not employed full time. Will it apply to part time staff? I am aware of the need not to obstruct democracy but we do need to adopt a clear position on people with convictions for certain offences. I ask the Minister of State to clarify that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the comments of the other Senators. I ask the Minister of State to clarify section 1(1)(k) on page 28 which states that a person can be disbarred for failing &ldquo;to pay any sum or any portion of any sum charged or surcharged, by an auditor of the accounts of any local authority, upon or against that person&rdquo;. <Col N="1418" /> Could that lead to a person who had failed to pay his or her rates or refuse charges at the end of a financial year being disqualified from standing for election to a local authority? Does it include parking tickets? I note it states &ldquo;of any local authority&rdquo;. Councillors are a breed of people who travel widely in many jurisdictions. They could have a parking fine from any local authority. A £50 parking fine might appear in the auditor's report of a local authority. Would this automatically bar them from being a member of that local authority? </P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State when will the curtain come down on having those sums charged by the local authority auditor? Is it 31 December, the end of the financial year or some other date? Everyone knew where they stood under the old system. If one did not pay one's rates on the final day, one was automatically disbarred from being a member of the local authority. Recently, however, we had a case of a local authority changing the rules. This has led to an ongoing case between a member of the local authority and a town clerk. Will the Minister of State spell out the position on the issue? It is a very serious matter when a person with a £50 parking fine from any local authority is automatically barred from being a member of his or her own local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many questions to be dealt with. Section 13 provides for disqualification where a person is actually serving a prison sentence and covers a person convicted of a drugs offence, but only where he or she is serving a prison sentence of more than six months. This also raises the question of whether convicted individuals who have duly served their punishment should be further penalised by such a disqualification or whether that should be a matter for the electorate. The Bill does, however, provide for disqualification on the grounds of conviction for specified offences. These include corrupt practice and fraudulent dealings with the local authority, which have in common that they entail wrongdoing affecting the local authority.</P>
      <P>On Senator Burke's point, it would only apply on conviction for an offence. The integrity of the local authority system could be called into question if a person convicted of such behaviour were allowed to be a member. At the same time, the law recognises that persons should not be penalised <i>ad infinitum</i> and such disqualifications operate for a period of five years from the date of conviction. If we move from including only offences against local authorities to more behavioural crimes, the question arises whether we should include other serious crimes such as murder. On balance, the Minister prefers to leave section 13 as it stands and to let this matter regarding conviction for serious offences be considered in a more comprehensive way in the context of similar changes to Dáil disqualification in future electoral legislation. There is an issue here which needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> On the question of staff, my understanding is that junior grades in local authorities could stand for election. It would be difficult to envisage a manager or county planner being a member of the local authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has not clarified that matter sufficiently. Can a member of a local authority be disqualified from membership if he is convicted in court of the charge of not paying a parking fine or car tax? This is very strong. I do not understand subsection (1)(k) which says a member will be disqualified if he &ldquo;fails to pay an sum or any portion of any sum charged or surcharged, by an auditor of the accounts of any local authority, upon or against that person&rdquo;.</P>

If a member of the city council in Cork is convicted of a parking fine in Dublin, does not pay the parking fine of £50 and does not appeal, would he lose his seat on the Cork City Council? That is what the Bill says. Is the Minister of State saying such a person must appeal? I understand that subsection (2)(a) says that the disqualification arises &ldquo;where no appeal is taken, on the expiration of the time limit for an appeal&rdquo;. The average person does not appeal a parking fine charge. What is the definition of a conviction?</P>

      <P>It does not. It substantiates what I am saying. If a member does not pay a conviction charge, which could be £50, £100 or even £20, he could be disqualified for five years. This is very weak. Paragraph (k) must be re-examined to ensure that members are not being wronged unnecessarily. Senator Burke is right. If a member does not pay a conviction charge in another court he can be suspended for five years. Subsection (2)(b) substantiates this point. There is no need for this provision. It would mean that only people who do not drive would stand for election to a local authority.</P>

      <P>There is much ambiguity in this section. An auditor of a local authority compiles accounts at the end of the year. Subsection (1)(k) refers to a member who &ldquo;fails to pay any sum or any portion of any sum charged or surcharged by an auditor of the accounts of any local authority, upon or against that person&rdquo;. Does that mean that if a member has not paid his refuse collection charge, in part or completely, when the auditor is compiling the accounts at the end of the year he will be barred from the council? That is what the subsection appears to mean. If so, it should be spelt out clearly. People would like to know where they stand. Must members have paid their rates and charges by a given date? Can the Minister of State specify that date? This was the position but it was changed in the last Local Government Act which stated that members are not automatically disqualified if they have not paid their rates by the end of the year.

      <P>The Minister of State has pointed out that this Bill does not change the present position. Subsection (1)(k) refers to a sum charged by an auditor. This means that a member will not only have received a bill from the council but he will also have received a reminder from the auditor. There is also provision for an appeal to the Minister. A person who deliberately does not pay local authority charges because he is taking part in a campaign should be disqualified from membership of the council. Why should the rest of the public pay while a member of the council does not? We should pay our charges.</P>

The auditor will remind him of his over<Col N="1421" /> sight and there is then provision for an appeal to the Minister if the members disputes the charge. There are protections there to avoid genuine cases of people being affected by it. However, a person who wants to play both sides against the middle by claiming his council expenses on the one hand and on the other hand refusing to pay the local authority should be disqualified.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Walsh. I know there are two different arguments going on here. However, somebody who makes a campaign around non-payment of service or water charges and refuses to pay those charges should not be allowed to get a salary or expenses. One solution is to make all deductions at source, which would save considerable difficulty. However, I know of one person who through no fault of their own simply forgot to pay and the manager showed a degree of leniency by writing a letter to the individual. Perhaps there could be a stage between the auditor and the Minister where the manager writes to the individual and tells him that if it is not paid within a particular time, he is jeopardising his seat and offers to make deductions from his expenses. I think these things can be worked out.</P>

      <P>Senator Walsh is right and many Senators have seen the link between subsection (1)<i>(k)</i> and subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(i) and (2)(<i>a</i>)(ii). The bottom line is that there is the right of appeal to the Minister and the High Court. Senators have rightly made the distinction between the person who deliberately refuses to pay charges as part of a campaign and somebody who inadvertently may not have paid. The question of the surcharge is definitely linked there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 29, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>14.&ndash;(1)Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>, a person who is a member of either House of the Oireachtas shall be disqualified from being elected, or co-opted to, or from being a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>(2) This section comes into operation and applies with respect to the local elections to be held in the year 2004 and thereafter.</P>
      <P>(3) In respect of local elections to be held in the year 2004 and thereafter, <i>section 13(1)(e)</i> shall be read as if it referred to a member of Dáil Éireann or of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This extremely important aspect of the Bill, which was mooted three years ago, was spoken about by the Minister two years ago and printed in May 2000. One of the major points of the Bill was the <Col N="1422" /> dual mandate. On behalf of my party, I stated clearly here that we were in favour of the removal of the dual mandate. Everybody here knows that for practical reasons, it is virtually impossible to serve fully as a local authority member and a Senator or Deputy. The demands have increased dramatically over the years. Members may be members of SPCs, area committees, county or city development boards, regional authorities, tenants' settlement committees, housing committees etc. Even though the Minister thought the effect of the SPCs would be to reduce the number of meetings, they have actually increased them.</P>
    <P>In my own case, most of our meetings are held on Mondays and I can attend, but if another meeting is held on a Wednesday, I simply cannot attend, and that is not right. It means that another local authority member is carrying the weight for me. If I cannot be on certain committees, other local authority members have to be on extra committees. From the practical point of view alone, local authority members should not be in the Seanad or Dáil. I know the Minister strongly believes that. A few days before this section was removed from the Bill, he said on radio that he wanted the section retained. From his point of view, he was strongly in favour of the removal of the dual mandate, but suddenly because of events in his party he changed. The difficulty was not with the four Independent Deputies but in his own party, as became clear afterwards. It is regrettable that the Members had to do that because the other amendments proposed by me would have ensured that elected Members to both Houses would at the same time know what is going on at local authorities and have some input without being sitting members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure the decision the Minister has made is one that does not sit very well with him or with a number of his Cabinet colleagues. However, it was a pragmatic reaction to the fear of people losing their seats. I hope that it was not related to losing out on double jobbing and getting extra money. I feel very strongly about this. If the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, were here he would find great difficulty in refusing this amendment in spite of the fact that the Cabinet decision has been the other way. Senator Walsh should know this and he should be nodding his head at this stage. He is finding it hard to restrain himself.</P>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said, without this, the Bill becomes washed out. I am calling on the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to request that this be reversed from the practical point of view that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be members of local authorities. They cannot function properly doing both jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's amendment. This has been a very controversial element of the legislation. The manner in which it was flagged by the Minister in the very early stage when he published the Bill, the fact that he <Col N="1423" /> announced it as a core value within the legislation and that ultimately he was forced to climb down due to the political exigencies of maintaining the support of Independent Members of the Dáil has made this even more controversial.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan has pointed to his own case and I could do the same. Since 1999, I have been a Member of the Seanad as well as being a member of north Tipperary county council and Nenagh Urban District Council. I sometimes wonder which day of the week it is. It is simply not possible to do everything effectively and it comes to the stage where I wonder if I am doing anything effectively. This afternoon I am forced to miss a meeting of the joint library committee of north and south Tipperary due to being here. I am happy to be here, but I would like to be at that meeting as well.</P>
      <P>I discussed this with some people at the meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Carlow at the weekend. At the heart of the issue is a conflict between the national picture and the local interest. We need to find a way to recognise the two. As Members of the Seanad or Dáil we should be able to maintain contact with and have a function in local issues. The fear of a number of people is that being a Member of the Oireachtas alone cuts them off from access to information, decisions and especially the influence with members of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The motorway schemes are very topical currently. Unfortunately as councillors, we have very little if any input into this issue, but at least we have access to our road engineers, the design offices etc. As a Deputy or Senator in a particular area we would want to maintain that level of access. I know the Minister has attempted to meet that concern in the legislation by ensuring that the Member of the Oireachtas gets copies of documentation and other information, but in practice it is not the same.</P>
      <P>However, we have to make the choice between being an effective local representative as a county councillor or urban councillor and being an effective Member of the Oireachtas. Either on its own is demanding but together they are excessively demanding. The Minister was on the right track in attempting to abolish the dual mandate and I commend Senator Coogan on bringing forward his amendment, which we are happy to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can fully renew local government if we retain the dual mandate in its current form. There will always be conflict between the national and the local, and we will simply not allow the centrality of local representatives to prosper. Being a member of a county council is a major political responsibility. Those elected have a major responsibility to the electorate and should not need to be a Member of the Oireachtas. We know about the controversy and the decision arrived at by the Government. I do not blame the Minister as we know from media reports that he was forced into an effective humiliating climb-down by political necessity. <Col N="1424" /> When the history of this Bill and of local government is written, this will stand out as a major chapter and will be seen not just as a U-turn but a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Coogan's statement that deletion of the provision to get rid of the dual mandate has eroded the entire effect of the Bill. There are many good provisions in the Bill. Obviously this was a pivotal part of the Bill as far as the Minister was concerned. The separation of local government and national Government would be to the benefit of both. The time involved and the difficulty in doing both jobs illustrates in itself the need for separation.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried extremely hard to maintain the provision in the Bill and was prepared to compromise in achieving that. In the end he accepted that the support of the Independent Deputies on various issues should be recognised and that they are an important component of the Government. He respected the fact that this was the first occasion on which an impasse was reached on an issue. However, all political parties are on record as supporting the abolition of the dual mandate, and I cannot see it surviving after 2004.</P>
      <P>While I am totally in favour of abolition, I have some sympathy for the arguments made by some of those opposed to its abolition. For example, I am aware of a Member who lost his Dáil seat and who worked at great personal expense to regain it, who says that but for the fact that he was a member of a local authority, which gave him an entree to continue his political work, he would not have regained his seat. That person is an exceptionally good Deputy. When the current structure is being changed, account should be taken of the common interests between local government and central Government, ensuring Members of the Oireachtas are kept fully informed and are supportive in terms of the important issues faced by local government. Access to information and all local government data will be essential. I urge that we do not lose sight of the objective. It will mean cutting a deal and getting the agreement of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan said opposition to the abolition of the dual mandate came from within our party, but there was opposition in each of the main parties.</P>

Currently, they do not have such authority. I have been a member of a local authority for the past 22 years and if we want to build a toilet in Cork city we have to apply to the Minister. Members of the Oireachtas should act as hawks in terms of local authorities. We allocate the money and represent the people. Members of the Oireachtas should oversee expenditure by local authorities and ensure money is spent correctly. We should not have to attend every meeting or try to get to a meeting because a light is needed on a particular corner. I cannot play my role as a legislator if I must ensure a light is put in a particular place. There are no local authority meetings in Cork city or county which are not attended by the ten Members of the Oireachtas who are also local authority members. These Members of the Oireachtas who are also members of local authorities have a huge workload, and it is not fair. It is more strenuous on Deputies than Senators.</P>
      <P>We should make block allocations of money to authorities and they should have the right to do what they want with it. Currently a local authority might get £200,000 for roads, £1.3 million for housing, £1.4 million for the environment and other grants for other schemes. The philosophy is to apply for everything. However, they should get a block allocation so they can do what they feel is best for their area. For example, if Sligo wants to become a city, the local authority should be allowed work on that itself. Members of the Oireachtas should act as hawks to ensure money is spent correctly, and if this is not being done it should be raised in the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas should have this power.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection that I have to attend every meeting of the city or county council to ensure I am seen there. Yet there could be something happening here which I cannot attend. A Member on the other side has admitted that the majority of people on both sides of the House agree with the abolition of the dual mandate, but it still cannot get through. That is a sad reflection on public life, but that is how politics works at national level and I understand that the Government must hold on to power. I am frightened that those seeking to maintain the dual mandate are so blinkered. Why would the electorate want to elect such people to Parliament given that they are only thinking on a local level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people in Kerry South were told an allocation of £32 million per year was being made to the local authority to do what it wanted, we would see the work being done, with Members of the Oireachtas ensuring the money was spent correctly and not on one particular area or group. Such an approach is not novel but can be found in countries throughout Europe. The Scandinavian countries work that way. Oireachtas Members <Col N="1426" /> would then have the authority &ndash; a person gets elected at local level, but at national level the representative must ensure that money is allocated to the regions.</P>
    <P>The country should be regionalised. It should not be a question of a particular constituency, town or street. The development plan for Cork city and county is an example of that. The sad part is that the same thing did not happen in the Dublin region. Our tunnel was planned in 1974 and opened in 1999, some 25 years later.</P>
    <P>When one sees what happened in particular areas, within local and national politics, it is a sad reflection on the rest of us. We do not want that to continue. We should say that a person is in one job and has authority for that. If money is being allocated in a block-grant manner, rather than allocating £5 million for housing and £3 million for roads, I would allocate a total of £8 million to an authority and if they feel they need to put most of it into roads for that particular year, then so be it.</P>
    <P>The hawks are the Oireachtas Members, both in the Seanad and Dáil. They can come back and ask the Minister what is going on in a particular place, and that is as it should be. Senator Coogan is perfectly right &ndash; the sad part about this is that there was general agreement and yet it did not happen.</P>

      <P>I understand where Senator Coogan is coming from, but I would hate to think that this Bill was being undermined and that the core of the Bill was the particular section that had to be deleted. There are wide-ranging areas in this Bill and I compliment the Minister on this aspect of the approach to the reform of local government.</P>
      <P>I could not agree more with all of the points that have been made today in regard to the dual mandate. I have the same dilemma as everybody else, in that I am a member of a local authority. I have not attended any of my Tuesday meetings for several months because of my role in this House. I love local authority work but I am not doing a good job &ndash; neither am I doing a good job in here, because I am divided between two camps. I want to be everywhere and do the best job I can and reflect the views of the public at every meeting I attend, but it is becoming physically impossible to attend my meetings, concentrate and be effective. As I said last night, we have got so &ldquo;committee-ited&rdquo;&ndash; it was a good term and I will keep using it &ndash; in our council chambers, we have so many meetings to attend and so much documentation to assimilate that a back-up team is necessary. Then one has to make a contribution on a particular subject. It is just not possible to do it any more.</P>
      <P>That is one of the reasons I was saddened to see this aspect of the Bill deleted &ndash; for the moment. I hope that it will come back in again. I think it will and that this is just a temporary blip in the aspirations towards the abolition of the dual mandate. It has to come, that is life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> As Senator Dino Cregan said, we can be the hawks out there looking after it in here. We will be clear about it as we have the requisite experience &ndash; I have been on the council for 17 years and know its every function. I want to be in here to do the job so that the other job can be effective, but I cannot do two things. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and I grew up together in politics in the same constituency and he knows that when he started off in 1979 it was possible to do both jobs, because the workload was not comparable to what it is today.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that there should be only one job and that it should be done well. I am not good at being all over the place. I appreciate what Senator Coogan has said but that is not relevant now and I hope that in future it will be revisited and will come to pass. Senator Coogan should be aware that we all empathise with him in this amendment but do not agree that the whole Bill will become irrelevant if this is deleted. This is fine legislation. We have been here since this morning teasing it out line by line and that is how we should treat every Bill that comes before us. It is great that so many of us have expressed our views&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as straight with the Senators as they have been with me. This is a coalition Government which is supported by four Independents and we all know the rules in such an arrangement. The Independent Members were implacably opposed to the ending of the dual mandate and if the Government had persisted it would have resulted in the withdrawal of their support, with obvious consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coalition Governments are not new in the European context and there are a variety of parties working together where the essence of the system is compromise. It is a relatively new feature in Irish politics, even since I have come here, and I have been here for some time. The Government decided not to go ahead with the ban on the dual mandate for those reasons. There are sound altruistic reasons for doing so. It will be said that I am biased, but most objective commentators would say that the policies we are pursuing on social and economic areas have been very solid over the last four years. In my own Department <Col N="1428" /> of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working with the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, we have implemented many enlightened policies and seen phenomenal growth rates. There have been reductions in taxation, good employment policies and social legislation has been put in place.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point that the electorate in sending Independent candidates into the Oireachtas should be conscious of the fact that compromise may have to be made by larger parties in Government in future when they are endeavouring to implement policies in the national interest. That is a point that is sometimes missed by the electorate. In reading the predictions for the next election it appears we are going to have a Dáil with an increased number of Independents. That is their choice, but in this case the Government could not do what it wanted to do. People might call that cruel politics but politics has been described as a cruel trade. That is the nature of the political background to this.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill is significant legislation. We have to move on and ensure that other elements of our local government reform programme proceed. The provision in question constitutes less than a quarter of 1% of the text of the Bill. It is quite a substantive text. It is our job to move forward with implementing the remaining 99.75% to ensure that the Government's programme on local government renewal can be carried out, that is the issue of local government legislation and the broader one of government reform.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what others have said, in particular Senator Walsh, that it is open to all parties who are in favour of banning the dual mandate to adopt and implement a policy on it. That point is sometimes missed. The option remains for parties or individuals to withdraw from local authority positions. The elimination of the dual mandate is established party policy of all the major parties. I agree with eliminating the dual mandate. We should be conscious that there is an option for parties to pursue that approach.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members for their contributions. I have tried to be honest with them about the explanation for this measure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and I understand the politics of it, having been involved in politics for more than 23 years. Recognition does not seem to be given to the contribution that could be made by former Members who have lost their seats. Senator Walsh made that point. Prominent Members of the Dáil and the Seanad have lost their seats. A structure in the form of committees or one committee should be put in place to enable former Members of the Oireachtas who have loss their seats or retired to participate in politics in an advisory capacity. Irrespective of who those people are or from which side of the House they came, we are losing out on the possible contributions of people who have had a major involvement in public life over the years. Some structure should be established in Parliament to enable those former elder Members of the Houses who may have retired but who are still very active to contribute. They could contribute to committees or to one particular committee, as in the case of former Taoisigh who are members of the Council of State and advise the President. It would be of no harm to provide for that and that would ensure that the contribution of those people would not be lost to the nation.</P>

      <P>The point made by Senator Cregan makes a good deal of sense. All of us have had experience of people of the calibre of whom he spoke. Often they may have lost their seats through no fault of their own, perhaps due to a redrawing of their areas. They would have built up a great deal of experience over the years. While this might sound a radical proposal and I am sure the Senator is proposing it for the long term, it would serve the community well that those people would be kept on board. Without revisiting the debate at this time, all of us are fully aware of the contributions that have been made by local authority members in general, but we should not ignore those people. I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Cregan. I hope that in the long term the Minister, in his imaginative way, will find an opportunity to provide for this.</P>
      <P>We are told by many people that voluntary effort in the community is disappearing and that it is difficult to find people to undertake tasks on a voluntary basis as they did in the past. Former Members of these Houses were very civic minded and they are still prepared to be part of that voluntary movement. Facilitating their participation would present a great opportunity to use their contributions as a lever to upgrade the voluntary input into the community in the future.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minster of State's Second Stage contribution that one of the amendments which was agreed in the Dáil at the suggestion of some of the representative organisations was to clarify the position regarding the holding of membership of more than one authority. I seek clarity on that. I presume one could not be a member of two county councils at the same time, but that one could be a member of a county council and an urban district council. Am I right in that? Could one be a member of Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator O'Meara in thanking the Minister for accepting an amendment tabled arising on foot of a joint submission by the three associations. There is merit in it. It would be incongruous if people were in different wards of the same authority or were members of two county councils and were in a position to nominate their own people to replace them. This is a good move. I understand this section will enable people who have a dual mandate at local level to continue to hold membership of a county council and a urban district council. The Minister of State might clarify that.</P>

      <P>Section 14 provides that no councillor can hold membership of more than one local authority with the exception of being a member of both a county council and town council. Dual membership of a county council and town council is a feature of our local government system. That can have positive spin off effects for greater co-operation and linkages between town and county. The prohibition in this section relates to membership. There is no prohibition on standing for election. In the event of a person being elected to more than one local authority, he or she would have to opt for one authority only and the resulting vacancy would be filled as a casual vacancy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 33, lines 12 to 20, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Each county or city council shall have one member for every 4,000 persons ordinarily resident in its functional area and each town council shall have one member for each 1,000 such persons, subject to a minimum number of members of 21 in the case of a county council, 15 in the case of a city council and 12 in the case of a town council.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 21 and the amendment thereto relate to the number of members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the question of local democracy. I believe in the extension of local democracy as far as possible. If a town wants to have a council it should be allowed to, within reason. The qualification in this Bill to have a town council is too high. I will use Tipperary North as an example. There are urban councils in Nenagh, Thurles and Templemore, but none in Roscrea. The population of Roscrea is substantially larger than that of Templemore. There is a fine community council in Roscrea and it has sought a statutory town council, but this Bill does not allow it to have one. If we were starting at year zero, no town in north Tipperary would qualify for a town council under the population rule in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I get the feeling that I do not have the full attention of the House. I would much prefer that this would be dealt with when we have completed more pressing business.</P>

      <P>In the course of our discussion of the Bill on Report Stage, there were motions on the Order Paper to recommit the entire Bill. The reason for that was that the Bill should be dealt with as a Dáil Bill, as that House has amended it. Senator O'Toole produced two Bills here yesterday, a Seanad one and a Dáil one. The Seanad Bill was previously before this House and the <Col N="1433" /> Dáil Bill is now before the House. The Bill has been amended in other areas, not just this one. We have raised major questions about the framing of this legislation. We spoke of how flawed the legislation was and how we had not been given the Attorney General's advice on the Bill. There are other constitutional matters regarding regulations being made by the Minister. There are further constitutional matters about someone aged 20 being elected to Dáil Éireann.

It now appears that they do not have this support. Yesterday I highlighted one part of the contribution of Deputy Olivia Mitchell which at one stage proposed that there be a 14 day ban on the collecting and publication of opinion polls before an election day.

The amendment concerned the taking and publishing of opinion polls within seven days of polling day.

The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, having established the support of the main Opposition parties to the amendment, said he would accept it in principle subject to the parliamentary counsel examining the text of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the matter today and, having regard to the change of attitude on the part of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to section 59, which they originally supported, has decided not to proceed with the measure. The Government proceeded initially on the basis of all-party support for the prohibition. As this is no longer forthcoming, an amendment will be proposed to delete section 59.</P>
      <P>This is the type of measure the Government will only feel comfortable with if there is all-party consensus, and that is clearly not the case. The facts of the matter still stand and perhaps if that consensus were to re-emerge, the measure could be re-examined. We will not have it said on a sensitive matter such as this that we imposed our will without having the agreed position, consensus and support of other parties.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct the Minister and ask him how he came by such information because he obviously has not listened to what we have said on this side of the House. What Senator Manning and I said yesterday and have continued to say about the Bill is that the Attorney General's advice should be made public. We have asked that the Bill be debated fully. It was guillotined in the other House and an attempt was made to rush it through the Seanad. We thought it had not received the attention it deserved. Only for the fact that Senator Ross spotted another flaw in the Bill, we would not be here today and the legislation would have been bullied through again.</P>
      <P>This is the reality. The Bill is flawed. The evidence we needed was produced by a Member of the House in the short time we had to examine the Bill. It should have been examined in detail. If there is one flaw, are there others? We would not be here today if, yesterday morning, I had not asked that the Bill be recommitted for further examination and that the Attorney General's advice be produced and given to us.</P>
      <P>To say we have done an about-face is incorrect. The Minister should show me the evidence because the record of the House does not show it. The Government is trying to get off the hook because it produced a flawed Bill. It should not try to put the blame on others. Instead, it should thank the Chamber for the fact that it was capable of examining a Bill and finding it flawed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Members on the Government side. I understand why they are slightly tetchy. We must be honest about this. The Bill was introduced because the Government thought it would be easy to pass it with the consent of the Opposition. It was introduced as a knee-jerk reaction to the Tipperary by-election where both major parties believed opinion polls worked against them. The Government felt this was an ideal opportunity to suppress information from the electorate with the support of the Opposition. The Minister is right in one thing he said, which is that it is harder to keep information from the electorate if one does not have the support of the Opposition. Perhaps that is an issue on which he should consult other democratically elected representatives.</P>
      <P>This is an appalling Bill and among the most diabolical, patronising and insulting legislation I have seen in many years in this House. On top of that, when the Government and the Opposition realised public opinion was running so strongly against them, they looked for a way out and they got it last night, not through any great skill on the Independent benches but because the Bill was passed by the other House in such a hurry that no one there had time to consider or examine it. It was drafted in such a hurry that it was flawed not just in its conception but in its detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been absurd if this Bill had been passed in its current form because it would have been negated on polling day. The Minister knows that and the Government had three options this morning. It had the option it has taken, which is to drop the measure, which is humiliating for any Government. I am glad it has taken that option. It had the option of ramming it through the House with its numbers, its original intention, which would have meant opinion polls would be published in every newspaper and broadcast on every radio station on polling day, and that would <Col N="1436" /> have made the Government look utterly ridiculous. It also had the option of amending the Bill. It could have amended it in terms of forbidding polls on polling day as well, but then it would have faced political problems in the other House when it returned in October.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic. The Government has taken the short-term, sensible political decision because of a great embarrassment to it, but I congratulate it on doing this because the original measure was close to a form of censorship and tyranny. If it had been accepted, we would not have known what was coming next and what other information would have been banned during general elections.</P>
    <P>The jury is still out on the principle that opinion polls affect people's judgment. No one will ever be able to prove that. They probably make some difference to people, but there are other matters which make a great deal more difference to people's judgments in elections, such as election promises by both parties which are more honoured in the breach. Are they to be banned as well or are they to be allowed? Are people to be asked to vote on the puff and not the facts? Real and solid information would have been withheld because it was embarrassing to politicians and lies and fantasies would have been fed to the people because it suited politicians. This was a dangerous Bill and I congratulate the Government on withdrawing this aspect of it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's U-turn on this highly controversial section which will soon no longer be part of the legislation. We in the Seanad have shown the value of the House in the work we have done. We have done excellent work this week. I am glad the Government has listened to the points made on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The failure of this section has nothing to do with the failure of a consensus on the matter but with the fact that the measure has shown itself not only to be highly unpopular and controversial but also fundamentally flawed and wrong. When it clearly emerged after many hours of debate yesterday that there were serious flaws in this element of the legislation, it finally dawned on the Government that it needed to do something about it. In doing that, it was presented with a problem. Last night, when it was indicated to us that further advice would be forthcoming on section 59, especially concerning the loophole identified by Senator Ross regarding polling on election day, I said it was my suspicion that the Government would put forward some measure to close that loophole because, if it did not, the obvious next step would be that the Bill would have to go back to the other House for further consideration. The implications of that are such that the Government would prefer to drop the measure rather than reopen a debate in the Dáil or delay the implementation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I must declare a couple of interests. I am a director of Independent Newspapers and I write in the newspapers about elections and so on. I do not believe it makes the smallest difference to the outcome of elections, nor do I aspire to do so. I voted against this measure yesterday on a technical point. I believed the section, which was inserted at a late stage, should have been more fully discussed. Amendments are amendments to what has been before us before and not something fundamentally new which has been brought in. I thought of describing it as the &ldquo;quare bungle rye amendment, smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly&rdquo;. What was in the basket was the product of an illegitimate union. However, there is much to be said for the substance of the measure. I congratulate the Minister and I do not impute motives to him or to the Government for the action taken. I am pleased they have taken such action which is entirely sensible.</P>
      <P>I do not speak for anyone in the newspaper industry nor have I discussed the issue with anyone. When the issue is being remitted for further consideration, the Minister might consider talking to the newspaper industry. He might find it possible to get some degree of consensus because this is a subject on which there is a fair amount of debate. Like other Senators, I have seen no evidence that links opinion polls with specific outcomes of elections. There is certainly more than anecdotal evidence to link them with apathy and low turnout but it would be helpful if the Minister spoke to people about the issue. He might find it easier to reach a consensus in that way. The Minister might also consider the practicalities of the situation as presented and how the modern media work. I could just as easily write my articles in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>. I could have the editor of the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> run polls and I could write them every day. Colleagues in UTV could do likewise, plus there is the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the issue of substance, there are very important practical issues which could now be dealt with. I am pleased that time has been allowed for further discussion on the matter when feelings might not run so high. A lot of silly things have been said on both sides. I was of the view that it was a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and I am pleased we are finished with <Col N="1438" /> the matter for the moment. I thank the Minister and congratulate him on the action taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made from this side of the House and rejected vigorously from the Government benches has now been clearly justified. It was a First Amendment issue. It was a question of freedom of speech, therefore, it was very important that it was debated.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on his quite extraordinary triumph from the backbenches of the Seanad. It appears that nothing could better display the relevance, importance and significance of this Chamber in Irish political life than the fact that without this Chamber this eventuality would not have occurred. I would also like to say &ndash; this is probably slightly gloating &ndash; that without the contribution of the Independent Senators the same thing would be true. If anyone wanted a demonstration of the value of this House, or the value of the Independent representation within it, what occurred here last night is the classic justification for it.</P>
      <P>While travelling back on the plane from abroad I was reading headlines and editorials on the issue. There was a lot of exercising of minds and passion from the newspapers. Having done the newspapers and the Irish public such a favour, it behoves those same newspapers to acknowledge this with the same vigour with which they pursued the issue in a situation where it appeared nothing whatever could be done. Many of those newspapers decry the Seanad, question its relevance and call for its abolition. I hope those calls will now be muted in light of the service done by this House. Perhaps in articles, after due consideration, they will look through the debate in this House which surrounded Senator Ross's amendment, consider the arguments made and do justice to the work engaged in here yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Government's performance yesterday was pretty poor. It did not appear to be in command of the situation. This is not entirely surprising and it was manifest by what was said both by the Leader of the House and others. They openly acknowledged that this was a fumbled ball and something they picked up from Fine Gael and Labour. I understand such an amendment was previously discussed in Cabinet and the Government decided against it. When the amendment was tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell they thought all their Christmases had come at once and they decided to run with it. They checked with Fine Gael and the Labour Party and were told that everything was all right. That suggests a complete lack of intellectual rigour. They did not examine the amendment in detail before happily presenting it to this House. What Senator Ross has done, with the assistance of colleagues on the backbenches, is to demonstrate that one cannot because of the presence of this House get away with that kind of intellectual laziness. I hope we will not see this happen again because it is not a very pretty sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> The measure was pushed through the Dáil without debate in the teeth of advice given by present and past Attorneys General, leading legal opinion and luminaries. The advice was all brushed aside and this anti-democratic push would have succeeded except for the work we did here last night. This is a very important day for the Seanad and for democracy. I hope what was done here last night and today will be fully reported and that this Upper Chamber will get the due credit it deserves. I again congratulate my colleague, Senator Ross. I am very pleased he afforded me the privilege of giving him my vigorous support in this matter last night. It was worth missing the first night of the Gate Theatre.</P>

      <P>As Senator Coogan said, we consistently sought the advice of the Attorney General on this matter but it was not made available to us. In fact, it was denied us. I presume that the Attorney General advised the Government appropriately on this matter and that his advice was in line with that of his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Justice John Murray, who as Attorney General in 1991 advised the then Government when this matter was first mooted. Mr. Pádraig Flynn was Minister for the Environment at the time. The advice was that this matter was extremely doubtful constitutionally and if the Government had persisted the President would undoubtedly have summoned the Council of State, the matter would have been referred to the Supreme Court for a test, and the likelihood based on this Attorney General's advice in line with his predecessor, is that it would have gone down and the Government made to look extremely silly. I ask the Minister if he will confirm to the House that this is so.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that the situation has been so all along. All parties acted in a very honourable manner in this regard. There were no kudos or any advantages for any party in the new legislation. That is why it was possible for them to support it. The two-pronged approach to the debate in regard to this section has been quite different. One has been totally on technical grounds and the other on the grounds of principle. The two do not necessarily coalesce in this debate. If the debate is on technical grounds then the principle is still all right. If it is on the grounds of principle then it would suggest that some of the parties have actually changed their view. One of the reasons for that change might relate to the <Col N="1440" /> very idea of polls or opinion polls in their own right.</P>
      <P>One need only look back at the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme of last Monday night. That was not a scientific poll incidentally and related to this Bill. The poll question was whether the President should refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for a decision. That was not a very good way of conducting business because it could also be seen as trying to exert influence on the President and on the Council of State. This would be a very bad development particularly if one is approaching this debate in a non-partisan way. The result of that poll has entered into this debate subsequently and particularly with reference to the section which we are now debating.</P>
      <P>One important possibility arises from the decision which has now been taken and Senator Norris touched on it indirectly. It remains to be seen if there will be a generous response from the media. I will go one step further than the formula put forward by Senator Norris as to how the media might demonstrate this generosity. It comes back to the principle rather than the technicality. If there is still merit in the principle, and I genuinely believe that all the people and all the parties were honourably reflecting what they believed to be the position on the ground, even the dogs in the street had expressed that very same view. Senator Ross may be correct in saying that the jury is still out, but it does not alter the fact that there is a strongly held belief that the media, through the publication of such polls, is exerting undue influence.</P>
      <P>Here is an opportunity now for the media to have a self-imposed moratorium for that same number of days. That would get over the question of the principle which suggests that it is interference with freedom of speech because the media would be controlling their own destiny in this regard. It would also get over the technicality because it would not be necessary to have any legislation at all. It is interesting that on the Order of Business this morning once again we asked for a debate on the media. Its relationship with public representatives is believed to be somewhat jaundiced at the moment for whatever reason. For the welfare of the country, it is time to make an effort to find a more healthy relationship between the media and those in public life.</P>
      <P>I issue the challenge to the media in view of the generosity of the Government on this occasion. I accept that this was in response to the astuteness of the other Members of this House and I accept that this House has again demonstrated its importance as a section of the Oireachtas. I issue the challenge now to the media that, if they believe it is exerting an undue influence on the democratic process, they would now respond and impose a moratorium of their own. I would have great confidence and faith in the media in the future if they were to do that.</P>

      <P>We should not get carried away in terms of the relationship between the media <Col N="1441" /> and politicians. It is no worse than that between the media and the legal profession or the media and the teaching profession or the media and the trade union system. Every group has a problem with the media. I recognise that this was the House doing its business yesterday. I certainly will be delighted to vote this section should not stand part of the Bill. This proposal as it is written undermines the democratic process, offends the Constitution and is contemptuous of the electorate. That is a reality. What we saw here yesterday were six or seven hours of solid parliamentary work. The issues raised were dealt with in an unacceptable manner by the Government side. I do not mean that in a personal way but it was utterly frustrating to put forward point after point for hours yesterday and not to have them dealt with or responded to in a way that made any sense. At one stage last night I said that I would not leave until I at least saw some comprehension of the issues we were raising.</P>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to those who have congratulated Senator Ross on finding this loophole in the Bill and bringing it to light. It has been seen as the straw that broke the camel's back. I understand there were people on the other side of the House who were as uneasy and unhappy with the section as we were. There is something wrong with the system when there is no method to articulate the voice of people over there within their own parties. I congratulate the Leader of the House for recognising when the House was burning down around him that it was time to call the fire brigade as he did at a particular moment last night. It was an important call and that should not go unrecognised.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a technical point about why I did not support Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business. Long years of experience have told me that delays are dangerous; I do not like the idea of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory; I believe that the issue must be dealt with. I believe that Article 20 of the Constitution requires the House to deal with Seanad Bills which are amended in the Dáil and which return here in a different way than the Dáil treats Dáil Bills which are amended in the Seanad. Article 20 is very clear on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this because there are technical issues here. We worked on the basis of our Standing Orders. Article 15 of our Constitution requires us to have our Standing Orders to do our business. We are doing our business here now on that basis. Standing Order 103 requires us to deal only with the amendments that are made in the Dáil. I still believe strongly that we are conducting our business unconstitutionally and I will write formally to the Cathaoirleach asking him to raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in order to seek legal advice. That will take this out of the realms of <Col N="1442" /> confrontational politics and deal with it. My advice from legal sources is that we will be moving in a different way.</P>
      <P>Not only was this legislation flawed technically but it was constitutionally wrong in the way that it undermined the right to free speech. Its language was pretty flawed and seemed to me to be cobbled together by a couple of guys who had pints on a Saturday night and saw a good idea on television which they decided to turn into legislation on Monday morning. That is the way it struck us on this side of the House. There was no sophistication in its approach. It probably criminalised canvassers, civics classes in schools &ndash; certainly academics &ndash; and many more. It could not have been right, even if action was never taken against those people.</P>
      <P>We should now re-address the question of a voluntary code. The National Newspapers of Ireland have had much to say about this and it is right that we call their bluff, as has been said by a number of Senators here. We should ask how a voluntary code can deal with the issues section 59 attempted to deal with. They will come forward, not with a voluntary code covering a seven day moratorium, but something that will cover a certain number of days before the vote. What we are now proposing to delete from the Bill could be dealt with through such code.</P>
      <P>This is a reflection of the importance of a democracy with two Houses, which allows legislation to be modified and reassessed. It allows us to learn the lesson of all lessons whereby we pull back from the brink on time. There were other occasions when we did not, as with the rod licence legislation when flaws were pointed out in this House.</P>
      <P>The Government has done a good day's work and I am not particularly worried about the reasons it did what it did. On this occasion the end result justifies their decision. It is a good day for democracy, for legislation, the Constitution and the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The writing was on the wall for a long time that this was a deeply flawed Bill and that it was unconstitutional. For the Minister to say consensus was not forthcoming is a travesty of the facts. There was never consensus among the parties on section 59 and the Minister knew that all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House suspended activities last night so that the Government could get advice. The Government certainly did not consult with the Opposition parties on that advice. They were not looking for consensus; they were looking for a way out. I have still not seen that advice. <Col N="1443" /> Perhaps the Minister might circulate it to us. Why can the Opposition not have sight of it? To say that consensus was no longer forthcoming is far to much to expect any right-minded person to accept.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear where the Labour Party has stood on this issue all along. There have been various snide remarks made to the effect that the Labour Party was supportive of a ban on opinion polls. Labour Party policy has always been that there should be no such ban. When the Fine Gael amendment was proposed in the Dáil, which was substantially different from this particular one, we supported it according to normal practice. We would support the Independents with an amendment we might not fully agree with. You take the ball on the hop and do things as part of the Opposition. The Labour Party leader stated the party position loudly and clearly. This was seen as an infringement of civil rights, an infringement of the right to information and a muzzling of the electorate. That was set out by the Labour Party without even knowing an amendment had been before the other House. The party has shown good leadership. It is the type of leadership there should be whereby a party leader makes a stand.</P>
    <P>It is a good day for this House and a good day for public opinion. Public opinion is the real reason the Government has done a U-turn. It realised that it was totally opposed. We saw the opinion poll on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; showing that 83% were against the ban. The witch hunt of the media by certain sections of the House is wrong. The media are not the culprits here. The culprit is the Government. It tried to railroad through a draconian section in the legislation which would have muzzled any comment in the last seven or eight days of an election. It was attempted on the spurious grounds that polls unduly influence the electorate. There is no evidence of that, nor did the Government put forward any. Over the entire debate no facts, figures or statistical information were presented to back up its position.</P>
    <P>Through section 59 the Government tried to put in place a trinity of issues it wants to see enacted before the next election. Corporate donations are in place, as are increased spending limits in constituencies. It also tried to muzzle the availability of information to which the public is entitled. The Minister is shaking his head.</P>

      <P>Why did the Government proceed with it and why is the only information we are getting today that consensus was not forthcoming? There were eight hours of debate yesterday during which consensus was not forthcoming. Senator Ross hit on a specific and blatant flaw that clearly meant that if the legislation was passed here, signed by the President and went to <Col N="1444" /> the Supreme Court, it would be dismissed. The Government was left with no choice as the only alternative was to ram through a blatantly flawed Bill. Anybody could see it would have been knocked by the Supreme Court and that would have led the Government into a greater mess than it is in already. It could only do the inevitable.</P>
      <P>The legislation will now have to wait until the autumn to be enacted. Will the Government come back with further amendments? Will the Dáil get the chance to debate the Bill again? A guillotine was imposed there when this Bill was being debated on Report Stage. What does this mean in terms of how we conduct our business? On the last two days this House sits, the Government expects that anything can be put through and the Dáil can go into recess without any thought that it could possibly be recalled. It is an insult to this House to treat it thus. We have been taken for granted for far too long and I am delighted that the Seanad has stood up and been counted. In the future the Government will think twice before it allows the other House to go into recess while it brings important legislation before the Seanad having no intention of accepting any amendments. I hope that this is the end of that.</P>

      <P>As someone who debated the opposite side of the argument with Senator Ross for much of yesterday, I do not wish to be churlish and I congratulate him on identifying the anomaly with regard to polling day. I acknowledged at the time that there was an anomaly in not including polling day in the ban, but polls, particularly exit polls, should not have been covered by that.</P>
      <P>It also would be only fair to recognise, as Senator O'Toole did, the part played by Senator Cassidy. He showed why he is Leader of the House, by taking the initiative when he saw the difficulty in that section and by making contact with the Minister and with officials. Following consultation, it was agreed to suspend the House and that gave time to look at the matter.</P>
      <P>The comment was made yesterday and again today that the Bill was flawed in concept. Personally, I disagree with that. Members on the other side acknowledged during the debate that opinion polls have an effect on the outcome of an election. As the Minister and others pointed out previously, because of our proportional representation system a small shift in opinion can affect not only who wins seats but also the overall outcome of the election. Therefore, there is merit in this matter being further considered.</P>
      <P>I never accepted that it is a matter of freedom of speech. A free press is fundamental to any democratic society and it is important that nothing is done to inhibit or curtail it, but I do not think the banning of opinion polls would achieve that. Equally, with freedom comes responsibility. The media have responsibility to be more balanced, measured and fair in their comments. That is all I ask for. We should be open to criticism but some of the over-the-top and hyped criticism does nothing to enhance the democratic process and the arguments of fair comment.</P>
      <P>In one of his more colourful contributions yesterday, Senator Ross drew an analogy between Fine Gael and the unmarried father who left his partner holding the baby. The baby is now an orphan and to some extent I regret that. There is some merit in ensuring that the baby does not continue in that role. Senator Maurice Hayes in his contribution advocated a period of consultation with all the interested parties and that would be a sensible route to follow. Through that consultation, in a balanced way we may achieve a good outcome from what has been a controversial issue.</P>

It was <Col N="1446" /> unfair of the Minister to say that. There certainly would have been no consensus here if Senator Ross had not found this flaw in the amendment to the Bill.</P>
      <P>We have asked consistently for the Attorney General's advice on this matter. We now know that his advice was available to the Cabinet. It should be circulated here because it would benefit everybody, especially as this is now being recommitted to the Dáil. Was advice given to the Department or to the relevant Minister on this matter?</P>
      <P>What is the position on this section? The Bill cannot be enacted until it goes back to the Dáil. If that is the case, does it mean that the Bill is on hold until it comes back from Dáil Éireann? Will the Cathaoirleach clarify the position in that regard?</P>

      <P>There is a form of management called ready, fire, aim. It is not a very clever form of management but I suggest that in the past week we have seen evidence of that form of management by the Government. To pass legislation without debate in the Dáil is sinful enough in itself, but it is much worse to pass legislation and then not give proper attention to the 68 amendments tabled in the Seanad. The Government did not reply in most cases to those amendments. Senator O'Toole has touched on at least one or two of them which were worthy enough to suggest that this was a sloppy Bill.</P>
      <P>I am in my ninth year in this House and one of the questions I have raised time and again is whether we can avoid enacting hastily drafted legislation which is not given detailed investigation by this House. Every now and then we are told that legislation is important and the Government wants to get it through. This comes down to the ends justifying the means.</P>
      <P>This was one of those occasions when the Government said it had to get this Bill through. It decided to put it through the Dáil without discussion and to get it through here without serious discussion. As a result these 68 amendments would not get the necessary attention.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the view that the reason this may not become law is that there is a constitutional difficulty with it. There may be such a difficulty, but the reason this is not getting through is that Senator Ross discovered one particular flaw in it. I congratulate the Leader of the House for being astute enough last night to say that he realised this is a flawed Bill, but he said that after about eight hours of debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take into account what has been said today. One outcome is that we are not sure whether there should be a ban on public opinion polls in the run up to an election. If there is to be such a ban, let us make sure it is done in a sens<Col N="1447" /> ible, logical, rational way following thorough investigation.</P>
    <P>Let me take two instances which cropped up yesterday. Some 15 years ago France introduced a ban on public opinion polls in the eight days prior to an election and then discovered that this did not work well. It was discovered that the radio stations based in Luxembourg and the newspapers published in Belgium were carrying such opinion polls. Then it was discovered that on radio a newspaper in Geneva was inviting the French public to look at the results of its opinion polls on the Internet. The French have decided to look again at this matter to see if they can find a better formula. We could have carried out such an investigation in the past week if we had not been in such a rush. Senator Maurice Hayes pointed out that the newspapers in Germany have reached a consensus not to publish public opinion polls in the few days before the election, although I am not certain how that operates. These are some examples of how thorough work could have made this at least a way of finding a solution to a worrying problem.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the House, the Government and the Minister of State in attendance for admitting that the matter has been considered and that they are not going to proceed with it. In the case of Senator Ross, the point he noticed and drew to our attention would have made a mockery of the legislation. It would have been an embarrassment. Let us avoid the policy of hastily rushing through legislation in the future.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to ask these questions. I wonder if there will ever be a debate in <Col N="1448" /> the Dáil concerning the deletion of this section. The rushing through of legislation happens all the time in this House, as with our debate on the Local Government Bill until 1.30 this morning. It does not do justice to anybody. It obviously happened in the Dáil, wherein this matter could have been debated. I am sure many issues could have been addressed there from which we could have learned. Now we are left with a Bill that may never be discussed again. The electors still do not know anything more. Suddenly this matter is no longer an issue because they do not want it.</P>
      <P>In the final session of the House, we find that everything is rushed through. This is frustrating because Seanad Éireann is being taken for granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní thógfaidh mé mórán ama. We must restrain our flights of fantasy. What has happened today has proven that politics has worked in the way it is meant to work, that is, there are two Houses of the Oireachtas the functions of which are to make Government accountable, directly or indirectly. A major problem pertaining to this Bill is that one House of the Oireachtas has adjourned for three months. Therefore, the taking of sensible amendments becomes and issue of national importance because it means a three month delay in the passage of legislation.</P>
      <P>A matter as important as the one under discussion should not have been rushed through one House and could not have been rushed through this House. We ended up with a welcome set of circumstances, which is somewhat humiliating for the Government. It is not something I wish to dwell on.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Labour Party is not included in the consensus because my party leader did not agree to this. We did not agree on Report Stage, during which we sought to have the Bill recommitted to have a proper debate. Obviously we do not count in the consensus, so perhaps Fianna Fáil has new parties in mind for coalition partners that exclude us.</P>
      <P>Many comments of the media have been misinterpreted. We do not do a good job in this House of illustrating that changes like this happen all the time. They do not necessarily happen in a style warranting dramatic headlines, but legislation is changed in both Houses of the Oireachtas all the time. Most of the time, nobody notices. The issue of opinion polls caught people's imagination because it partly affected what the media regarded as their own interests. This is the function of democracy. When legislation is rushed through, as was this Bill, it is said, perhaps by the Government or the bureaucracy, that parliamentary activity is only a gloss and that only the Government is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has occurred illustrates that there is no infallibility in Government, nor is there infallibility in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. However, I have never met a parliamentary counsel, although I have spent 20 years hearing about their wisdom. They should <Col N="1449" /> be brought before an Oireachtas committee to explain themselves because they are responsible for more violence against the English language, among other things, than anybody else I know. They are responsible for further massacres on the Irish language. Some of their Irish is very convoluted, particularly in constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>I regret that Fianna Fáil will be able to continue with its much loved focus groups because they would have banned them for the week before an election under their own amendment. They would have had to disband those groups when they would be needed most &ndash; just before an election.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;I&rdquo;s of the Cathaoirleach are eloquent. However the issue of opinion polls was dealt with, it would have been a travesty in a free society to inhibit academic research in the period of an election. What happens in the public mind during an election is a major part of our sociological and political understanding. If one cannot ban the taking of opinion polls during elections what is the point in banning their publication.</P>
      <P>The point Senator Quinn made was that they would be published elsewhere and that the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> would have a wonderful time selling newspapers and advertising its website with opinion polls that could not be published here. Therefore, just like my party, I conclude that the banning of the taking of polls is impossible and the banning of their publication is profoundly illiberal. There was never a good argument for it.</P>
      <P>The reason we are so excited is that a Bill that could have been amended in two minutes and sent back to the Dáil and approved in two minutes will now have to be shelved for three months until Dáil Éireann resumes in plenary session.</P>

      <P>On the issue of opinion polls, my views run against popular sentiment. This is a great day for the media. They are currently run<Col N="1450" /> ning the country and have been for many years. We hear nonsense about public outrage over opinion polls. One would think that the public invented opinion polls and that they are part of the democratic institutions of the State. They have nothing to do with democracy. They are designed to sell newspapers. The media have whipped up emotion among the general public with regard to the issue. Any members of the public who have been asked for an opinion regard opinion polls as a nuisance. We could be wallowing today in the displeasure of the Government, but we should focus on the fact that we have been frustrated. It should have been amended and sent back to the other House and the legislation should have proceeded as first envisaged. I deplore the breakdown of consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>The important point that emerged from Senator Feargal Quinn's contribution on what has happened abroad is that newspapers are setting the agenda on this in other countries. They are also setting the agenda here. I have been around long enough to see what is happening. The merits or demerits of this section of the Bill aside, if the Government had opted to go it alone on this issue, it would have been viciously savaged by the media. It is a bad day for democracy. Opinion polls have nothing to do with democracy, they are a nuisance designed for one thing only &ndash; to sell newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. Since I became Leader of this House, my view has been that all legislation has to make good and common sense. Last night was a judgment call. I thank Senators O'Toole, Walsh and Quinn for their kind remarks in relation to Senator Ross's proposal. It would not have made good sense to allow opinion polls in the seven days prior to the election and ban them on the day of the election. Regarding the kudos in the House, this would have gone through last night were it not for my judgment call.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for his kind comments as well. Let us be fair. There is no time limit or guillotine on any legislation in this House and there will not be one for as long as I am Leader. We are proceeding in the correct manner. This is the Upper House of the Oireachtas and we have demonstrated that in recent days. We sat for 13 hours and 20 minutes and spent 3 hours and 44 minutes exercising our democratic duty during 15 votes yesterday. That is what we are here to do under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I want to take up the point made by Senator Maurice Hayes in his excellent contribution. He is someone who understands both the political and media side of life and is very privileged to command the respect of the media. Perhaps there could be a meeting of minds between the Government, the Opposition and Senator Hayes which would progress this general consensus without scoring political points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a change of heart on the Opposition side between Committee Stage in the Dáil and <Col N="1451" /> the Seanad. No one was scoring political points. When all-party consensus did not emerge, the Government decided not to run with the measure.</P>
    <P>The number of Independents in the Dáil is in double figures and 624 votes, all of which were number fives, sixes or sevens, decided the last five Dáil seats. That constitutes a change of Government and is the reason this legislation is so important. People have to be allowed freely to elect the Government. I can tell the House who I gave my number one to in every election since I started voting at 21 years of age.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Leader of the House on the action he took last night. I also compliment Senator Ross for his diligence. Perhaps some Senators should show a little more <Col N="1452" /> humility. We got it wrong although our intentions and concerns were possibly right.</P>
      <P>When one does not bring to fruition what one sets out to do, one must at least admit to a certain degree of misjudgment along the road. I am happy to do that, but would have preferred if the Fine Gael and Labour spokespersons had done the same during the debate. I do not want to impute anything but the most honourable intentions on the part of anybody here. However, to suggest that there was no consensus among the major parties would be misleading.</P>
      <P>A contribution from the Fine Gael front bench spokesperson in the Dáil, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, was as follows:</P>
      <P>The practice of publishing opinion polls very close to an election is undermining the whole voting process by seeking to second guess what the public is going to do. There is no doubt that predictions can be self-fulfilling and to that extent distort the process of an election. Even if the people are submitted to several opinion polls, there has to be some point in the run up to an election when they are left to make up their own minds and to decide for themselves without the benefit of being told how other people are voting. That is the critical thing.</P>
      <P>I consider that a very genuine contribution and one which the Deputy obviously believes in. Deputy Gilmore in a recent contribution said:</P>
      <P>I recall some years ago there was a Government proposal to have a moratorium on opinions seven days prior to an election or a referendum. I recall supporting that proposal at the time and being subjected to a rather critical editorial in a newspaper as a result.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of that contribution he said:</P>
      <P>In the last critical week of an election, the opinion pollsters should stay out of the ring and leave it to the contestants and the electorate. I support the proposal made by Deputy Olivia Mitchell. There will be screams of anguish, particularly from sections of the media which undertake opinion polling, but this needs to be viewed as protecting the independence and integrity of the electoral process rather than providing an opportunity for good copy, which of course opinion polls are.</P>
      <P>We should, perhaps facetiously, take at least one lesson from this, which is that the Government should not take advice from Fine Gael on these matters.</P>

      <P>There have been significant contributions to the debate. Many Senators have said the jury is out on this matter. Having watched elections in other countries in which the results of exit polls are publicised while the count is still proceeding and seats still have to be filled, I <Col N="1453" /> believe we have to ask ourselves if that is the way we should do business. There is an opportunity to hold a debate on how to resolve these matters in a fair and equitable way. We are not closing off the debate, nor are we saying we possess all the wisdom on this matter. We do not. It is fair to say that I have some experience in this. I have never known an opinion poll which was within four or five points of my support, although at times I would have preferred if I had.</P>
      <P>There is an unresolved question mark over this matter. In concert with the major parties, we set out to deal with it in a particular way. There are other ways of dealing with it. Suggestions have been made by Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú regarding the reaction of the media and the freedom with responsibility which is necessary if we are to have ongoing debate on matters such as this.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this provision is a knee-jerk reaction to the Tipperary South by-election. This proposal was made by Fine Gael who won the by-election easily, so it could not have been a knee-jerk reaction.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House beyond saying there is a basic concern which is unresolved. There is space and time for reflection on how matters like this are to be dealt with. In sensitive areas such as this it is important that we have the widest possible consensus. In this I include our eminent Independent Senators and Members of the Dáil. They have their rights and views and we must distil those views in a way which produces the best possible result.</P>
      <P>People love to call these actions U-turns. When clear evidence has shown there is another road that can be travelled, a different way of doing things and a need for further reflection and consensus, I hope we can all be open to a change of mind and can make that change in the most comprehensive and sensible way. People may wish to call that a U-turn but it would be extraordinary if no one changed his mind in the face of evidence put in front of him or when new thinking emerged, or if he did not wish to listen to other advice.</P>
      <P>I thank the Seanad, the Leader of the House, Senator Ross and others who have contributed to the debate. I found it interesting. It was done without acrimony. We move forward from today. Nothing has been done which damages our democracy or takes from us the ability to make changes in the future.</P>

      <P>The Dáil made two amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, passed by the Seanad on 21 June 2001. We have dealt with the second of these and I now address this amendment.</P>
      <P>The first amendment, which was made to section 50, provides for a range of changes to the Electoral Act, 1997. The amendment inserted the following words in subsection (1)<i>(a) </i>of section 18 of the 1997 Act: &ldquo;The general conduct and management of the parties' affairs and the lawful pursuit by it of any of its objectives and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Electoral Act, 1997, provides that qualified parties who receive State funding under Part 3 of the Electoral Act, 1997, shall, subject to guidelines issued by the Public Offices Commission, apply the funds for any or all the following: the general administration of the party; research, education and training; policy formation; and co-ordination of activities of the branches and members of the party.</P>
      <P>The payments made to the parties are deemed to include provision in respect of promotion of participation by women and young people in political activity. Under subsection (2) of section 18, the payments under Part 3 of the 1997 Act cannot be used for payment of election expenses or in furthering a particular outcome at a referendum. The proposed amendment is intended to remove any doubt that the four items of expenditure I have listed include the cost of the general conduct, management or other activities of a political party, other than the election expenditure of the party. I ask the House to support the amendment, which ensures a broader interpretation while maintaining strict limitations.</P>

Now that this particular clause has been deleted, I thank the Minister for sending this most welcome message to the Seanad. I thank the Leader of the House for the very mature way he dealt with it last night and all those who contributed to the debate. It was not acrimonious last night, but there were some pretty healthy tensions here when the arguments were being made.</P>
      <P>A mistake had obviously been made and in the end we got the best result for everybody. Even though we needed a day off to think about it the Seanad worked and the mistake was remedied successfully here. I thank the Government in particular for taking that decision and acknowledging the mistake. As the Minister says we all make about the same number of mistakes in life; about 50% of the time what we do is wrong. I thank him very much for remedying this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; I am very happy in my new position. Senator Ross deserves all the plaudits he has received. I do not know how we will get him back down to earth again after all this praise; he is not used it and it will not do him any good at all.</P>
      <P>However, that is what happens regularly in these Houses. There is a presumption that parliamentary scrutiny is a luxury that we could do without or that it is an unnecessary intrusion on efficiency, but that is not the case. It is the essence of how legislation can be improved and it does not matter who is in Government. The atmosphere in which Bills are discussed depends on the good sense of Ministers. It is not a question of the Opposition getting its own way; it is a question of Ministers addressing the issues, as I have said on several occasions.</P>
      <P>I think I am more relieved than regretful that I was not here to participate in the marathon. However, I am glad that good sense prevailed. There are few more sensible Ministers in this Government than the person sitting in front of us now. I think it has something to do with his experience as a Member of the Seanad. It probably teaches us all a little bit about humility. Speaking from personal experience, winning and losing elections are very good for humility.</P>
      <P>I am very glad with this outcome, but just because Seanad Éireann amends something on 11 July, it should not necessarily mean a three month delay in completing the passage of legislation. There should be a way for us to deal with it in a reasonable timeframe.</P>

We were also assisted this afternoon by the graciousness of the Minister which is quite characteristic of him and we in this House appreciate that.</P>
      <P>There is one little remaining area of controversy between the Minister and the Fine Gael benches over whether there has been a U-turn. Senator Coogan suggested that if it was not a U-turn, it was a bend. In my usual mild way can I suggest a compromise? Could we call it a &ldquo;U-bend&rdquo; which in plumbing is a little device that catches and removes noxious material from the system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence, on Northern Ireland related business, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the situation following the Nice referendum and to outline to the House the Government's views on the way forward. It is appropriate that Seanad Éireann is again addressing the vital issue of Ireland's participation in the European Union. It indicates a welcome recognition of the significance at this important juncture of sustained and active engagement by Ireland in the life and work of the Union. It also highlights the important role of our parliamentary institutions in promoting public discussion on these critical issues. The timing of this debate, coming some weeks after the referendum, is also helpful in allowing us to take stock, on a more considered basis, of where matters now stand, and of where we should go from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the widespread disappointment felt both by other member states and by the applicant states, there is among our partners, both current and potential, absolute respect for the decision <Col N="1458" /> taken by the Irish people. There is no questioning on any side of our right to take the decision we did or of our right to maintain that decision if we so choose.</P>
    <P>There has been a dishonest and disreputable campaign to suggest that the decision is being treated with contempt and, equally false, that the Government has adopted a craven, apologetic posture in its dealings with other member states on this issue. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>In meetings at Luxembourg and at the European Council in Gothenburg, which were scheduled long before the date set for the referendum, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained the factors which contributed to the result and indicated very clearly that time would be needed to reflect on the implications of what had occurred. They were quite clear that there would be no quick fixes; and this was fully acknowledged by all our partners. Of course, aware of the potential damage to the political and economic interests of the State, the Government was at pains to emphasise, in particular to the candidate countries, that the result of the referendum should not be seen as a verdict on enlargement. In the aftermath of the referendum this point has been emphasised strongly by all sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Government makes no apology for doing everything possible to protect Ireland's bilateral relationship with this important group of countries. Ireland already has major economic and trade links with the candidate states, with significant growth potential as these countries absorb the benefits of membership. As a small, open economy we depend on trade and investment for our prosperity, and need to ensure that our bilateral relations are handled in a manner conducive to strengthening our ability to compete successfully in markets both now and in the future. This was a major preoccupation of our diplomacy in the period following the referendum. I suggest that no Government concerned with protecting the national interest could have acted otherwise.</P>
    <P>This period of discussion and explanation, involving close contact with partners and applicant states as well as with representatives of the European Union institutions, has facilitated a deeper analysis of the current situation from which certain conclusions can be drawn. First, it is clear that enlargement must proceed and that delay is not an option. Second, it is the unanimous view of the member states and the applicant countries that the changes provided for in the Treaty of Nice are essential to the functioning of an enlarged Union. The candidate states are grateful for our assurances that we wish them well. They now want us to give them the means to realise their objective. Third, the governments of the other member states are not prepared to reopen a treaty agreed with such difficulty and, indeed, for example, given the protracted negotiations prior to the eventually satisfactory outcome on taxation, it is by no means clear that <Col N="1459" /> any such development would be in our interest. Fourth, the treaty will not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 15 member states. Fifth, the outcome of the referendum revealed quite clearly that there is a range of concerns with regard to our engagement with the European Union, many of them unrelated to the content of the Treaty of Nice which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the Government has determined that what is now required is a period of reflection and analysis on all matters pertaining to our participation in the European Union. The primary vehicle for this process will be the National Forum on Europe. The Government had intended such a body would be established to facilitate preparation for the debate on the future of Europe which will form the centrepiece for the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. The concerns highlighted by the referendum campaign give an added urgency to the project and it is therefore intended to move quickly to establish the forum. The Government is obviously keen to go forward in this area on the basis of the widest possible measure of agreement.</P>
    <P>Drawing on the support which has been expressed for the broad approach followed by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, the Government has begun a round of consultations with Opposition parties on matters including on the terms of reference and composition of the forum. Without anticipating the outcome of these contacts, which are ongoing, the Government is convinced that the forum represents an exciting opportunity to undertake a comprehensive analysis of what the European Union has meant to Ireland, to examine the issues raised by the historic enlargement now in prospect and, against that background, to develop ideas and strategies for the future development of the Union in a manner which will meet the needs of all its members.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real measure of the success of the forum will be the extent to which it succeeds in engaging with the wider public. It is time to demystify the debate on Europe. Europe belongs to its people. It is time the Irish people felt themselves to be at the centre of that debate, and that is the challenge for the forum. It will, of course, be for the forum itself to decide its working methods. However, I very much hope, following the example of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it will emphasise the importance of hearing the views of a wide cross section of Irish opinion, from all sections of the community and all parts of the country. It will be important also to hear the views of other member states and candidate countries, including those who are involved in the front line of preparing the accession countries for membership. I hope the forum will not confine its activities to Dublin but will also take steps to bring the forum to centres outside the capital. For its part the Government will, of course, ensure the resources necessary for <Col N="1460" /> the smooth functioning of the forum are available as required.</P>
    <P>The task of bringing the Union closer to the citizens has, of course, other dimensions. That is why the Government has indicated it is prepared to examine very carefully how best the arrangements for Oireachtas monitoring of European Union business can be improved. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has had very useful discussions on this topic with representatives of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs. Moreover, in response to a recently tabled Private Members' Bill in the Dáil, the Government has indicated a very positive disposition on the principle of greater parliamentary scrutiny and participation.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that we move forward in this area on a basis which strengthens oversight without impairing the capacity of our representatives to negotiate effectively in the Council. It is recognised on all sides that we have to get this balance right. Accordingly, detailed consultations involving the Ministers most affected and the Office of the Attorney General are now under way. When these have been concluded, there will be further consultations with the Opposition. The Government will in due course bring forward considered proposals in this area with the aim of strengthening the capacity of the Oireachtas to exercise its responsibilities while maintaining the flexibility necessary in the realm of international negotiations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this and other changes is to facilitate a deeper understanding by the public of the full significance of our membership of the Union. I believe the debate which is now getting under way will bring home to people the vital role which the European Union has played and continues to play in the economic and social development of the country. It has not only expanded trade but has been a key factor in making Ireland an attractive location for foreign investment. Jobs and prosperity at home require exports and markets overseas. That is why enlargement, with the prospect of a market of over 500 million people, is of such vital importance to an economy like ours and why any perception among the candidate countries that Ireland is blocking enlargement directly threatens Irish jobs and Irish livelihoods.</P>
    <P>A key factor for international mobile investment in deciding to locate in Ireland is our full participation in the European Union. It is essential that we continue to send a strong message of our commitment to the further development of the Union and of our determination to remain at the heart of the business of the Union. Any uncertainty in this regard undermines our national efforts to create an environment conducive to growth and employment. It is essential to our continuing economic well being that this is not allowed happen. I am confident the forum will make a valuable contribution in helping to highlight these realities and will ensure the Irish <Col N="1461" /> people decide our future relationship with the Union on an accurate and informed basis.</P>
    <P>The Government is very open to suggestions on ways we can improve understanding in the Oireachtas and in the public at large of what the EU's role is and should be in the world. What contribution can and should Ireland make in that regard? Enhancing Ireland's national role in the development and conduct of EU foreign and security policy has certainly been a priority for the Government. This has also been reflected in the read across to our membership of the UN Security Council. Our participation in the European Union common foreign and security policy provides us with a tool and vehicle to pursue Irish foreign policy objectives. We participate fully and positively, exercising influence on global issues such as human rights, disarmament, peace and stability. We have been very active in the elaboration of the EU's policies in areas such as the Middle East, Africa and East Timor.</P>
    <P>Among the concerns voiced during the debate on the Treaty of Nice were that the EU was becoming a super state with ambitions to throw its weight around on the international stage. Some, on the other hand, have criticised the EU for failing to live up to its obligations in the wider world and for failing to contribute more effectively to conflict prevention and crisis management. We need to explore these concerns and criticisms in depth. It is important that we foster a much better public understanding of the EU's role in the world and how EU foreign and security policy is negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>It was the Amsterdam Treaty, as approved by the Irish people in a referendum in 1998, which defined the operational focus of the EU on tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management in Europe. This role for the Union takes account of the changing and complex nature of peacekeeping, as has been recognised by the UN among others. The changes include additional tasks such as humanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights and civilian police work.</P>
    <P>Let me take this opportunity to clarify some aspects of Ireland's involvement in this area. The EU's approach does not in any way undermine or diminish the Government's commitment to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping. Developments within the Union and the UN in this area have proceeded in concert and will continue to do so. This point has been made clear by both sides on numerous occasions, including by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and EU Foreign Ministers when they met last May. The close co-operation between the two organisations was reflected in formal conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>The deployment of Irish personnel and resources in any overseas mission will only be considered by the Government where a UN mandate is already in place. The Government is open to having this position clarified further. As part of ongoing efforts to dispel fears and anxieties which arose in the lead-up to the referendum, we are <Col N="1462" /> examining what steps can be taken to allay people's concerns.</P>
    <P>As with all aspects of our involvement in the activities of the European Union, but particularly where we have such an extensive history of involvement in UN peacekeeping activity, it is essential that the issues are debated thoroughly on the basis of the facts. We should not proceed on the basis of scare-mongering or on unfounded perceptions of what the EU is doing in this field.</P>
    <P>The debate about security and defence should not be seen as a theoretical discussion &ndash; recent history in the Balkans and Africa has shown that the international community did not always have the necessary capability and resources to tackle real problems with enormous humanitarian implications. It is in the context of the appalling tragedies in the former Yugoslavia that our personnel are making a positive contribution on the ground. Many of our citizens have served in that region as monitors with the EU, the OSCE or as UN police. We have a duty not only to help pick up the pieces but to do our best to ensure that it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>The current rehabilitation efforts in the western Balkans clearly illustrate the way in which European Governments are working together to prevent conflict and maintain peace. It is heartening to see that new patterns of security co-operation involving former adversaries have emerged. This is the core of what European security and defence policy is all about. We should not turn our backs as though the horrific events which we witnessed in the Balkans region over the past decade had not taken place.</P>
    <P>The positive contribution we are making in the EU context is fully consistent with Ireland's tremendous record of involvement in UN peacekeeping operations over the past 40 years. I want to see Ireland continue to play its part in preventing conflict and to have a constructive role in international peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Ireland will do itself a great disservice if we do not make an appropriate contribution in keeping with our traditions and values. Let us be clear in what we are talking about and avoid confusion on Ireland's role in this area.</P>
    <P>There has been confusion regarding the description of the capabilities for the EU Headline Goal as a rapid reaction force. It is emphatically not a standing army, nor does it impinge on Ireland's policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed. The rapid reaction force is a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out humanitarian or crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>It is also important to highlight that European security and defence policy is not an exclusively military project. In parallel with developing its military capabilities for humanitarian and crisis management tasks, the EU is also developing its capabilities for civilian crisis management. Extensive work has been done by the outgoing Swedish EU Presidency to facilitate progress in this area, particularly in policing. A key objective is to carry <Col N="1463" /> forward work on enabling the EU to provide police in support of peacekeeping operations and to provide added value to existing UN arrangements for international police missions. The Garda has served with distinction from Bosnia to Western Sahara. It should be able to continue to provide its much sought after expertise in the EU context as well.</P>
    <P>The incoming Belgian Presidency has signalled its intention to carry forward the civilian dimension to security and defence policy. As well as facilitating work in the policing area, it hopes to make progress on a number of other priority areas in the civilian sphere, notably the rule of law, civilian administration and civil protection.</P>
    <P>We should not overlook the important developments in the field of conflict prevention. A key test will be to enhance the union's ability to prevent conflict. This was a prominent theme at the recent Gothenberg European Council. As the EU programme agreed in Gothenberg points out, the development of ESDP has, since the outset, been intended to strengthen the EU's capacity for action in the crucial field of conflict prevention. We will continue to prioritise conflict prevention in keeping with our well-known views and experience in this area.</P>
    <P>Critical to the success of the European Union has been its ability over more than four decades to adapt to changing circumstances. The carefully designed institutional balances, which give the union its unique character, have ensured that it operates effectively, while at the same time protecting the interests of all its members, including the smaller member states. I believe strongly that these balances must continue to serve as the foundation stones for an enlarging and developing union. It is precisely for this reason that I am convinced the Treaty of Nice merits our full support. I acknowledge that the people remain to be persuaded in this regard. I hope, as the process of reflection continues, that the electorate will come to recognise that Nice &ndash; the actual content of the treaty, not the wild claims made on its behalf &ndash; is part of a wider picture of Irish engagement with an evolving Europe in a fast-changing global environment. The case for being a full participant in that process, rather than serving as an ineffectual bystander, is overwhelming. I am confident that the people, having reflected carefully on the issues, will come to the same conclusion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, to the House. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is unavailable but I appreciate that he is engaged in important business abroad. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was the only Cabinet Minister who made any serious input or campaigned in any effective way to try to secure a positive outcome to the Nice treaty. The Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has put on record that the Government will consult the world and its <Col N="1464" /> mother. The reality is that the Government failed dismally to secure success on the Nice treaty. Its campaign was a non-campaign and nothing was done to ensure that the referendum was passed.</P>
      <P>Since the referendum at least six Ministers have put forward various views in regard to what should and should not have happened. The Government is completely divided on the issue of Europe. The Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, is a possible exception because of his responsibility in the area of defence, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As far as the rest of them are concerned, they have disgraced us at European level among our fellow member states.</P>
      <P>The Minister came in here today to tell us what we have already heard from the Taoiseach, that the Government is going to set up a forum. This is an abdication of political responsibility by the Government, which is incapable of getting out and communicating with the grassroots what the Nice treaty is about. The forum that is to be established will be put together in consultation with the Opposition. How much consultation has actually taken place between the Government and Opposition since the defeat of the Nice treaty?</P>

      <P>Last week we had the embarrassing spectacle of the Taoiseach going to Gothenberg and Luxembourg and apologising to the member states, having castigated the voters here for rejecting the treaty. The electorate was democratically entitled to vote as it saw fit, and it deemed fit to vote down this treaty. Only one third of the electorate chose to vote at all, whereas two thirds of the electorate vote in most elections, implying that another third of the electorate who usually vote chose not to do so on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Government put forward all sort of arguments and explanations as to why the treaty was rejected. It was rejected because the Government failed to conduct a campaign to ensure that referendum was successful. It is a simple as that. The reality is that the Cabinet is divided on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years various directives have emanated from Europe. They have come directly into Departments and are laid in the Library, but we do not know about them until they are implemented on the ground in our relative constituencies. Many people across the country are most unhappy with the offhand directives that have emanated from Europe to which they are subjected. People across the country repeatedly get communications from various Departments informing them that they cannot do this or that because Brussels says so. The people have spoken on this. They have said that they want to take control back into their country and they do not <Col N="1465" /> want to be controlled from Brussels to the extent that they are being.</P>
    <P>There is another issue of fundamental importance which we have previously discussed here. I welcome the major EU funding we have received, but let us be specific about where it was invested. Research shows that a disproportionate amount of EU funding, Cohesion Funding and social funding, was invested in the eastern part of the country. Commissioners have been repeatedly brought to the most deprived and disadvantaged areas of the west and on the strength of what they saw decisions were made on funding for this country. When it came to spending that money, it was confined in Merrion Square and dished out from there into selective areas. Many people have not benefited from any direct spin-off from the EU funding.</P>

      <P>Some of the people in those areas deliberately stayed at home on this occasion and some of them who would normally vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in such a referendum voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at the number of people who were dissatisfied with the arrangement to have a rotating Commissioner once full enlargement takes place. They felt that, irrespective of enlargement, it would give rise to serious problems if we were not to have a Commissioner permanently at the table. We will have a Commissioner until enlargement takes place and then a rotation system will apply. People are highly fearful of that and are not prepared to accept it. The Government is living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes that the establishment of this forum and consultation with the parties, various social partners and all the groups normally consulted will be adequate or sufficient to secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the Nice treaty. If it thinks the type of campaign that needs to be conducted at a political level can be done by way of the forum, it is going nowhere and not alone will it not secure a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the next referendum, but the treaty will be defeated even more roundly that on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time we discussed this issue I criticised the Government for the undue haste with which it was proceeding because at that stage most of us in this House, not to mention the public at large, did not understand the details of the Nice treaty. Given the short space of time left to engage in a campaign and the fact that a serious <Col N="1466" /> campaign was not undertaken, there could not but have been a negative result.</P>
    <P>A spin has been put on the result from those for and against the treaty that it was not a vote against enlargement. That is true to a point, but it is not 100% true. A number of people, particularly people in the farming community, are fearful of the effects enlargement would have on their production and market capacities. They are fearful of competition particularly from Poland and other applicant countries, yet nothing has been done to allay their fears. That must be addressed in the course of the next referendum.</P>
    <P>I am surprised by points the Minister made about member states not being prepared to renegotiate, yet the instruments that need to be reformed, as proposed in the Nice treaty, have to proceed in order to accommodate expansion. How does the European Union intend to expand if the Nice treaty is not passed here? It will be difficult for the Government to get the treaty passed here. The Minister believes this debate will charge ahead and that the people will come on board. It will not be quite that simple. It is no harm there has been a slight hiccup on the European road because there is a sense of remove, remoteness and almost a sense that it is only the preserve of a certain few Eurocrats who understand this and that the rest of the population are not in a position to analyse, understand or relate to the Union in general because it is complicated and far removed from the ordinary person's preserve. That situation and perception among the public need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that this will not in any way undermine or diminish the Government's commitment to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping. I wish the Government every success with that, particularly in providing assistance for humanitarian causes in Europe and elsewhere. That is extremely vital.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government does not abdicate its political responsibility to this forum. The Nice treaty will be won only if a proper political campaign is undertaken and there is a serious campaign on the ground. All the politicians of the parties who are in favour of it need to actively canvass for it and explain at all levels what this is all about. There is a major task to be undertaken and it is important that the Government recognises that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. One of the major issues addressed by the people of Ireland in recent months was whether to accept the Nice treaty and they decided not to accept it as it was presented to them. Nothing can be done about that. That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn gave an analysis of what has happened over the past number of months. She gave an analysis of the fear and greed of the public, fear of change, fear of expansion and fear that certain elements of our society might be hampered by having to bring in people who are at a lower economic status than we are while for<Col N="1467" /> getting our economic position 20 years ago. Certain people decided to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they do not want to give up any part of what they have. The greed element was large. I will not give out about the people who were greedy enough to say they had got what they wanted from Europe and were not prepared to give a little to people who are at a lower economic level than Ireland was when it joined the EEC. There were huge elements of fear and greed in the vote. About 90% of the organisations in the country called for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>A majority of the minority who cast their votes voted against the Treaty of Nice. So be it. No one can disagree with or change that decision. There is no changing a decision made by the people in a referendum. How do we get by the impasse which has been created? To take an extreme view, it could be said that the Nice treaty is finished and we must return to the Treaty of Amsterdam. That treaty says that the Union can be expanded by five member states. It does not allow for 12 new members. That expansion can be done quite logically.</P>
    <P>Where does this leave the countries of eastern Europe who are begging to join the EU? There were many people in the applicant countries who suggested that there were flaws in the way they were to join. It was said that there would be a seven year moratorium on the movement of labour from applicant countries to the rest of the EU. This country is crying out for labour in certain areas. I do not speak of labour in a derogatory sense; it is an element of work. Whether that work is at a high or low level, we are crying out for people. We have an opportunity in this expansion to bring in workers who would be welcomed here and could contribute to Irish society.</P>
    <P>There is a need for us to realise that we live in a privileged society. There is no point pretending that there are people in the country who have not benefited from the Celtic tiger. Every member of society has benefited from the fact that Ireland is a member of the EU and has enjoyed the benefits of that. Some people have said we were better at begging than others. It was not that we were better at begging; we were better at presenting our case and maximising everything that was available from Europe. That is not using a begging bowl. That is using our innate ability to get what is available and then to use it to the benefit not only of Ireland but of Europe. The Irish experience is being used as a model for the use of EU funds across Europe where countries are trying to emulate our prosperity, and trying to raise the incomes of the low paid or those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The people of eastern Europe have suffered for many years under different regimes. Many people suggest that the people of eastern Europe were repressed only since the formation of the Soviet Union. The people were repressed before there was a Soviet Union. In Russia they were repressed by the megalomania of the Tsars. Else<Col N="1468" /> where they were repressed by the Austro-Hungarian empire. It is like people who talk about China and its evolution out of communism. In 1948 China was not a communist state. Before that the people lived in a series of feudal kingdoms where they were repressed, enslaved and killed. We should not blame communism for all that was wrong in eastern Europe. The problems existed before communism, but communism expanded and the expansionist policies of the USSR became a problem.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that some of the reasons that eastern European countries want to join the EU is as a protection from the potential of Russia seeking expansion in the future. They are equally afraid of a united Germany becoming an expansionist power. They seek protection and that is one of the reasons many of them want to join NATO as well the EU.</P>
    <P>The people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; now say that they did not vote against expansion but for other reasons. It is an absolute fact the fear and greed were what contributed to various elements in Irish society voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Quite a number in rural communities, the farming community in particular, did not vote. If they had they would have voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but they stayed at home. By staying at home they did not vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but they did not give satisfaction to anybody.</P>
    <P>Irish people are no longer asked when they travel abroad which part of Ireland they are from. They are not asked if the war is going on in their county, if they are from the North or the South, or if they are British or Irish. The question now is how Ireland got out of its economic depression. We give facile answers to that, such as that education brought us out and therefore education can bring other countries out. It is a reasonable argument but it does not hold in Africa. We started from a reasonable base. The economic base was low, but it was not as low as it is in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? I am not sure how the forum will work. Will it produce a formula which will allow the privilege of bringing in applicant states without dealing with the problems of abortion, the loss of neutrality and not joining a rapid reaction force? If we are to be genuine about this we must say that we voted against expansion and there were a huge number of reasons for that. As regards the rapid reaction force, no Irish mother will have to put her son or daughter in the front line in any conflict unless it is sponsored by the United Nations, passed by the Oireachtas, or it is on humanitarian or conflict relief basis. If someone tells a mother that her son will be taken into the Army and killed, it is difficult to overcome that argument. It is not a real argument.</P>
    <P>We have had a positive input to the European Union in recent years and it has had a positive influence on Irish society. We entered the then European Economic Community, warts and all, and that is how we will have to continue. We must first cater for deprived areas in our country and <Col N="1469" /> the EU can assist in this regard. We must then ensure people in the aspirant countries who want a better life are accommodated by us, however that may be done. Instead of criticising what happened and who did or did not do something in the referendum, we must get away from the fear and greed syndrome and move towards ensuring everyone in Europe has the right to live in peace, harmony and a relative amount of prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight the extreme difficulty in which this country finds itself following the result of the referendum on the Nice treaty. I will set out from where I am coming. I voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for a number of reasons. The first was that I considered the terms of the treaty, although far from ideal, were a reasonable and fair compromise between the conflicting interests which came together at Nice, and I still hold that view. The deal negotiated by the Government, while not achieving its aims in full, was nevertheless broadly in line with the position it had set out clearly in the other House and elsewhere during the months in the lead-up to the Nice meeting. I still hold that view. On this basis, I decided to back the Government's judgment by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I took this decision on the basis of a further critical assumption which, in the event, proved to be unfounded. I believed the Government would campaign vigorously to convince the electorate of the wisdom of what it had negotiated and to educate the people exactly on the motives and issues. Instead of this, either through laziness or complacency, the Government lost control of the referendum process. The decision to have a quick campaign rebounded on it as did its decision to engage in a campaign so low key that it was practically invisible. It emerged that people who did not understand the issues were more likely to vote against or abstain than go along with the Government on the basis of trust as has happened before. By the time the Government realised what was happening, it was too late to do anything about it. It was hoist with its own petard by a campaign that was too rushed, insufficiently thought out and too dependent on assumptions about the electorate which have long since stopped being true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Government through its ineptitude that caused the loss of the referendum. The scale of that ineptitude gives rise to concerns about whether the Government has the vision and ability to take us out of the mess we are in. We are in a mess because the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, not because they opposed the Nice treaty but because of concerns they had about the way Europe is developing. They were concerned about the democratic deficit in the EU which has tended to widen as time goes by, about higher tax and the Minister being ticked off because he had not increased tax when Europe thought he should, and about the way decision making is mainly left to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. Some of them were also concerned about the slippery <Col N="1470" /> manner in which our neutrality appears to have been compromised, a point to which we have already referred. Others merely expressed their anger at not having had the opportunity to vote on Ireland's entry into Partnership for Peace, something we sought in this House on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>A great deal of ink has been spilled on analysing the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote since 7 June. What is common to all the reasons advanced is that they have little to do with the Treaty of Nice. This is the nub of the problem we face. Asking the people to vote again on the Treaty of Nice risks receiving a very dusty answer, especially since our partners have made it explicit that the treaty will not be changed or renegotiated. Given that the nature of the treaty does not allow for any national opt-outs from any of the provisions, the people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the previous occasion will argue once again on a broader platform than that of the treaty. What will be different the next time is that they will tend to gather a great deal of support for the contention that the future of Europe, not the Treaty of Nice, is the issue. Senator Lanigan referred to this.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, if the Government tries to focus the debate narrowly on the Treaty of Nice, it will fail to address a real and growing concern among the electorate which is beginning to ask where exactly Europe is going. The &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote has had the effect of bringing that question to the fore and we ignore it at our peril. The debate in the European context has moved on to a wider issue. From the viewpoint of the Nice referendum, it is perhaps unfortunate that leaders in France and Germany staked out their positions in this wider debate before the preliminary issues had been dealt with. We cannot turn the clock back now that we are in this position. The wider debate has already begun and we are merely sticking our heads in the sand if we try to postpone consideration of it.</P>
    <P>If policies were completely logical and rational, it would make some sense to set up the wider debate and, in due course, vote on it while, in the meantime, clearing the technicalities out of the way by ratifying the Nice treaty. That is what we could do but politics is not like that. The truth is that we cannot compel people to vote on our terms. Voting in a referendum is almost like a jury coming to a decision in a courtroom. When it retires to consider its verdict, no one can control the reasons it comes to a certain decision. I see no prospect at this stage of separating the issues of the Nice treaty from the wider issues of the future of Europe. It could have been done if the Government had done its job properly. Having failed the first time, there is no prospect of getting it right the next time.</P>
    <P>What is the way out? The forum proposed is a good idea. However, the Government is making a mistake if it believes it can limit discussions on that to the Nice treaty. That is not what people want and, if they do not get what they want from the forum, it will have no impact on a future vote. <Col N="1471" /> Another good idea are the reforms which have been proposed to improve the oversight carried out by the Oireachtas on EU matters generally and especially on forthcoming legislation. It is not Europe's fault but ours that we have been so remiss in this matter for the 30 years since we joined Europe. The mistakes of 30 years are not undone in just 18 months. Even if the Oireachtas put the best oversight system in the Union in place, I cannot see it having much immediate impact on public opinion. We should certainly do it, but we should not be so foolish as to think it will produce instant results.</P>
    <P>This problem must be tackled at a European rather than at a national level. We created the problem and got ourselves into this mess, but I am not sure it can be solved within the framework of the Irish political process. The only way out may be to do the unthinkable by abandoning the Nice treaty and moving on to the next stage of European integration. Such a doomsday scenario may appear unthinkable at this stage but it may not be so when we fully consider the alternatives.</P>
    <P>We must ensure we do not lose this opportunity to get ourselves out of the problem with which we are faced. I welcome the debate on the issue and, if we listen carefully to what is being said, we might be able to find some way out of this problem. I congratulate previous speakers on drawing attention to the problems and I thank the Minister for his concern. However, if we are to solve this problem we must do something about it immediately.</P>

      <P>Indeed it is. He is a very gracious and decent man. It is a rather curious coincidence that he is dealing with two Government failures. This is not an issue on which I am inclined to gloat but the impact of this period for statements has been diluted by what is the real news of the day, that is, the withdrawal by consent of the House of section 59 of the Electoral Bill. Let us be under no illusion that we will have a major impact on informing public opinion but we can at least exchange our views among ourselves.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what my colleague and friend, Senator Lanigan, had to say. While he began by saying that he would not blackguard voters for what they had done, he proceeded to list the reasons they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. He characterised them as fear, greed and selfishness. I am not sure that was an accurate analysis of why the people voted the way they did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I was responding to Senator Taylor-Quinn. My analysis was that she was talking about fear and greed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1472" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It appeared to me that the Senator was endorsing some of what she said. I am quite sure the record will show that. However, it does not matter.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that is the case because there were a number of reasons people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. One was that we were promised a referendum on the Partnership for Peace &ndash; I do not wish to go over that point because I did so during the earlier debate &ndash; and the Government then spat in the face of the electorate and said it would not have a referendum on the issue, despite the very strong language used by the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern. If one snatches a bone from the electorate, the next time one puts a hand near them they will bite, and they are perfectly right to do so.</P>
      <P>I am very happy with the result of the Nice referendum because the Irish people in their wisdom did exactly what I did. They voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to abolish capital punishment completely, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the International Criminal Court and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty. I did so with some reluctance but I also advised people when asked and in my newspaper column that this is how I would vote, and I gave my reasons.</P>
      <P>I would like to scotch one or two matters. First, I did not vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because of greed or a lack of generosity. Second, I was not opposed to the enlargement process. The record of the House will show that I made that abundantly clear every time I spoke on the issue. I said I felt enlargement was not just a good thing politically and morally but it was also in the interests of this country in creating a wider market and was a glorious opportunity. It is very important that this message goes out to our fellow Europeans who are applicant members that there was no intention on behalf of the majority of people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to exclude them, to be selfish or to wish to prevent their entry. We must get that point across. If people on the other side of the argument continue to characterise those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; as greedy, selfish and wishing to keep out these people, they are actually damaging our image externally. I want to make it abundantly clear that I am fully in favour of the enlargement process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear during the debate on the Amsterdam and Maastrict treaties that I felt our neutrality was in danger, that there was an incremental process going on and that we were being imperceptibly drawn into military entanglements. This was denied on the other side of the House. I wish they had been more honest and said they were getting involved in a series of military entanglements and were prepared to justify it. I wish they had said they were prepared to put an end to neutrality because it was a convenient fiction of the past, that it had worked for them on practical grounds and they were now getting rid of it. I wish they had been as forthright as that. I put it on the record during earlier debates that as well as many of our potential allies in the Europe Union, the very brains in Washington who frame the various proposals <Col N="1473" /> such as the rapid reaction force, the Partnership for Peace and so on were in no doubt whatsoever, and unambiguously stated, that this was a progressive move in the direction of military entanglement. That is inevitable once one becomes involved in the process because the whole European process is organic.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from a booklet which emerged from the Institute for European Affairs which states:</P>
    <P>The process of integration is incremental, proceeding in discrete steps. Foundations with limited objectives are laid and then built on successively in the light of experience. What begins as a modest experiment in cooperation grows into established procedures for jointly managing issues of common concern. This may lack elegance as a way of doing things, but it arguably has the merit of working in practice.</P>
    <P>When one transfers that from the general into the particular and looks at the whole military apparatus, it is clear there is an impact of this principle on the military aspect. The Amsterdam Treaty states that the common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence should the European Council so decide. That in itself was a shift from the eventual framing in the earlier treaty to the progressive framing. Even on a previous occasion I was able to clearly demonstrate that what we warned about was about to happen.</P>
    <P>In order to resolve this problem, I suggested that we should adopt something similar to the Danish protocol. I see the Minister shaking his head but before he asks if I know they are members of NATO, of course I do. I was simply showing that whatever the motives, the separate countries had the right, and one had actually succeeded, to include this protocol in the treaty. Therefore, it is not technically impossible. Leave out the question of motives and whether they were in NATO, the Danes at least showed it could be done, whatever their reasons. The protocol stated:</P>
    <P>With regard to measures adopted by the Council in the field of Articles J.3(1) and J.7 of the Treaty of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and the implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications, but will not prevent the development of closer cooperation between member States in this area. Therefore Denmark shall not participate in their adoption. Denmark shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing of the operational expenditure arising from such measures.</P>
    <P>In the recent debate on the Treaty of Nice, I proposed such an amendment so that before the referendum this protocol would be included. That <Col N="1474" /> would have won the referendum for the Government. However, the Government ignored the advice of this House at its peril. Here was another instance where our advice was ignored. I have no doubt that if such a protocol had been included, I would have campaigned very vigorously for the referendum.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons for my concern in this area is that it is perfectly obvious to anyone who does a detailed analysis that the further we get involved in military matters with the European Union, the Western European Union, the Partnership for Peace, the rapid reaction force and so on, it is parallelled in every instance with a draining away of resources and commitments to the United Nations. Some people on the other side accept that and say that the United Nations is about as limp and as ineffective as the League of Nations. It will continue to be so as long as Ireland with the other States withdraws its support. We should use this opportunity to put our muscle back again behind the United Nations.</P>
    <P>If we do stand apart in this way from the majority of our European colleagues, that will give us a very important and secure practical position on the world stage in relation to the other non-aligned countries which constitute the majority of the world community. We would have a moral presence and be seen as a bridgehead. That is something that in the tradition of the late Frank Aiken, Ireland as a country should endorse and exploit.</P>
    <P>We must go forward with the Nice treaty if we possibly can. That will necessitate another referendum. I urge the Government not to put another referendum to the people which will be voted down again. The Government might take what I hesitate to describe as an opinion poll on this matter and find out with a bit of market research whether, if the referendum proposals were amended in the method I have suggested, the Irish people would pass the Nice treaty. I hope this is what will happen and I look forward to campaigning with the Government and the Opposition so that a revised referendum proposal would be put before the people and successfully passed.</P>

I have considerable regard for the political nose of Fianna Fáil and its ability to read public opinion. Given that, I had a clear view from a week before the referendum that the result was going to be extremely tight. I would not have bet on it being defeated but I knew that it was going to be tight. The opinion polls gave that impression and they were well outside any proposed time limits for opinion polls, incidentally. They showed that there was a shift in public opinion. The opinion poll was wrong because it had forecast a proportionately higher turnout of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; voters than of &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters. That collapsed <Col N="1475" /> in the period up to the election. As I said the member of the Government was quite surprised at the outcome. I am not sure what that indicates, either a lack of awareness of public opinion or a lack of interest in the issue because that person was not directly involved in the campaign.</P>
      <P>We cannot be uninterested in the European project. There is no point in reiterating statements that the rapid reaction force is not an army when the President of the Commission or other people tell us that it is. It is not a standing army but it is an armed force capable of using armed force for which the former leader of Fine Gael honestly stated could in some cases amount to war; making war to impose order in an unstable country is what he said. That may or may not be a desirable thing. When our troops participated in the Congo nearly 50 years ago, it was essentially as much peace making as peacekeeping. It was not a pacified country they visited which is why we had the tragedy of Niemba. It was a country which was still in a state of disorder and we were there to make peace. Many people have reservations about the agenda behind that.</P>
      <P>We must address a number of things about the Nice treaty issue. There were genuine fears on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side. People can have genuine fears which are groundless; I know people who are terrified of the dark and are genuinely frightened. That does not mean that they are correct in their fear. People can have genuine fears of flying but that does not mean they are right. People's fears need to be addressed whether we believe they are real or not. Just telling somebody that air travel is safe will not make a person who is terrified feel one bit safer.</P>
      <P>Some of the issues from the conservative right, the Catholic right, are beginning to look more and more peculiar as the Pope tells them that they were wrong. This is an issue they should resolve for themselves. They seem to believe that they have a political insight into the nature of the European project which is superior to that of perhaps the most sophisticated diplomatic service in the entire world, the Vatican diplomatic service. They should examine it.</P>
      <P>The exponents of the so called pro life movement are kicking up a stink about the possibility of a second referendum on Nice even as in between those press releases they issue the tenth press release of the week looking for a third referendum on abortion. I find their position more than a little inconsistent. I am not madly keen on a second referendum on Nice. It took the best part of 12 or 15 years to have a second referendum on divorce. We took that long to work our way through it. That said, those fears deserve and need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were not the only reason the treaty was defeated. There is a complacency in the people who are part of the project. There is a section of Irish society &ndash; the top two or three people in every institution in Ireland who spend perhaps two or three days every month in Brussels or in <Col N="1476" /> some institution connected with Brussels; one part of their conscious selves is entirely Europeanised and there is nothing wrong with that &ndash; but these people are forgetting that for the rest of the population that is not the way the world looks. We must get those people to realise that it is still a democratic project based on the will of the people. All across Europe, however difficult it might be, not just in Ireland but all of the countries in Europe, are going to have to refashion their own people's acceptance of and enthusiasm for the European project.</P>
    <P>You can only go so far ahead of your people. Political leadership is important but you cannot leave your people behind. That is not democracy. The declining enthusiasm in this country is of a particularly threatening form. I refer in particular to some of the speeches from the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste. The Tánaiste has made a considerable case for our need to be not contaminated by what she sees as the job destroying climate of high taxes and regulation that she seems to think characterises many of the other countries in Europe. So has the Minister for Finance, but perhaps not so colourfully.</P>
    <P>I want all the people who say that to answer this: we have got £20 billion, depending on who you believe, from the European Union because of our underdevelopment, either in agricultural or in structural and regional funding. I do not know how much money has been spent on regional development and on regional aid; it could be £300 billion or maybe £500 billion. That money did not come out of some benevolent fund. That came because of the fact that these high tax countries in Europe paid taxes which their governments then transferred to us. What some people in Ireland, including two senior members of the Government, are saying is that now we got the benefits of high tax Europe, we are going to stay away from the same high tax Europe that had the political outlook, the political culture and the fiscal infrastructure to be able to give resources on that scale to enable some sort of gesture of social solidarity to work across the entirety of the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is not just a disagreement about levels of tax. There is a fundamental ideological difference between the perspective of the dominant forces in the present Government and the perspective that has driven most of the countries of Europe &ndash; apart from Britain &ndash; for the last 45 years. Are we now saying that we want to create a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>, after we have creamed off the generosity, and keep ourselves separate from the culture which was generous to us? That is a different issue to that of showing a lack of generosity to the applicant countries. It is a statement about us. We have taken the munificence and we are not prepared to share our affluence in a similar fashion. That is what every assertion of the alleged wrongness of the European model is about.</P>
    <P>I will not waste the minute left to me on the outbursts of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, <Col N="1477" /> Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív. They are not worth taking seriously. The idea of a defender of our cultural uniqueness not being able to speak a sentence of our first language intrigues me. Given the family history, to become a defender of our culture without being able to speak our language is absolutely impossible to take seriously.</P>
    <P>If the rapid reaction force is only what it was set out to be, I have no problem with it. So far that is all it is. If the force were required to do no more than is set out, Mr. Solana's coup in the European Parliament in July last year would not have been necessary. He gathered a cloak of secrecy around all his actions. He said he would only attend a joint meeting of the Oireactas Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs provided the meeting met in private session. The Joint Committee on European Affairs would not meet him in private so there was no meeting. If he thinks that is the way to win popular understanding and acceptance of something as fundamental as this he does not understand democracy.</P>
    <P>There are other issues. I am glad the Government accepts the Labour Party position on the forum and the Labour Party Bill on European Affairs. Maybe in the not too distant future the Government will accept our position on health care. If the Government adopts the sensible policies of this party we will have made real progress externally and internally. The issue of defence in Europe will not be resolved through a protocol for Ireland. The issue is the militarisation of Europe not neutrality.</P>
    <P>Our neutrality is not threatened in the immediate future. I doubt our opting out through a protocol similar to that the Danes have will do anything to reduce the militarisation of Europe. The case can be made that our opting out would make that more likely. There would be one less neutral, non-aligned state to ask questions. I put this question to AFRI when they came before the Joint Committee on European Affairs. They did not have a plausible answer as to why Europe would be better off in terms of the principle of opposition to militarisation if we were out of the loop. That is the argument for staying involved and arguing, which is not the same as saying we are prepared for Europe to become another super power. I have never been persuaded that large armies make the world more secure nor am I persuaded that one more will. There is an issue to be worked out and it needs to be confronted honestly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity &ndash; however late &ndash; to say a few words on the Nice treaty. I speak as someone who supported the treaty, who actively sought support for it and who regrets its rejection. Much as I do, I accept that fact and think we should move forward. The treaty has to be revisited and it is the way in <Col N="1478" /> which that should be done that I want to discuss here.</P>
      <P>As with many decisions that are taken, there is no one reason the treaty was rejected. There was a combination of reasons and a coincidence of interests among the most unlikely groups which coalesced to provide an articulate &ldquo;No&rdquo; voice. There was no &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; lobby as such. Different groups supported a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote but there was not a co-ordinated campaign as there was on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.</P>
      <P>Having said that, one of the issues which arose in the course of the debate was the issue of the democratic deficit. I could deal with many others such as militarisation and neutrality but I want to deal in the time I have with that deficit. It is a serious issue because our cultural and historical baggage includes a commitment to the activity of voting and to democracy. The fact that Irish people went to the United States and took over the Democratic Party was not a coincidence. It happened because there was an opportunity to express themselves and to vote. Even though fewer than two-thirds of the population might vote in an election, were we to take the vote from them there would be 100% opposition. Those who do not vote are making a statement of their own.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can recall the time when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, went to the Intergovernmental Conference in Scotland seeking £8 billion he will know that Deputy Reynolds had the support of the whole country. We did not know what we were going to spend it on, we did not know how much money that really was but we were all behind him. It was a clear national objective. The biggest problem with the European project is that we do not have an Irish vision for Europe. I ask the Minister to bring that to the attention of the Government.</P>
      <P>There is a broad acceptance of integration towards which we are very positive. Successive Governments have been praiseworthy on that issue. There will be an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 which will make significant changes and we should be saying now what we expect to see coming from that. That is the sort of discussion I would like to see taking place in the forum. It may seem a contradiction in terms of the democratic deficit, but there should be deeper integration. The democratic deficit is created by the fact that we are too removed. We also need more political engagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem lies with the Commission, though not with its individual members. It is not so much the power they have but the fact that they are unelected. That has been said by a number of other speakers and I am sure it is a view the Minister shares. They are answerable only in name to the President and the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers goes over once or twice a month and tries to pick up the threads of what is going on while the minds of its members are on their jobs in their own countries. With the best <Col N="1479" /> will in the world Ministers do not have the time to do that work.</P>
    <P>We, the Irish people, do not know the Commissioners. We know the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith and though we might love him, hate him or be indifferent to him we know he is there. He is the man responsible for the numbers in the Defence Forces, an issue on which we can engage with him. We can agree with him or argue with him but the point is that there is engagement. That is not happening with the Commission. Romano Prodi is over there and we see him on television. Pedro Solbes Mira comes to Ireland and meets the people in the Central Bank. Nothing is happening for us. We need to see an engagement. We need to see them in Ireland not in Brussels. We need to see them talking to Deputies, not central bankers and not to Ministers who will have a <i>de facto</i> arrangement in the hierarchical structures of Europe where, quite correctly, they will have an input and be engaged.</P>
    <P>We need these people to engage with Senators and councillors to talk about issues which are real. The issues are easy to discern. Let us look at the ones Europe and Ireland have strong views on, issues we all have to deal with. Waste management policy would be a good starter. Car tax, excise duties and taxation policy for Europe are other issues it would be very easy to get movement on.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Nice negotiations was good. As a negotiator myself, I have to say that no one could have done better. It has nothing to do with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. What was delivered to Ireland during the negotiations on the Nice treaty could not have been improved upon. Anyone who tells me it could knows nothing about negotiations.</P>
    <P>The goal of having one Commissioner per state will not be achieved, and therefore, I ask the Minister to consider the following. The European Parliament is too large and too unwieldy to be all-powerful but it needs additional powers in specific areas. I cannot go into that now but we need to pick these specific areas. In addition, we need to take power from the all-powerful Commission and put it into the hands of politicians. There should be a second European house of parliament comprising two members elected from each EU member state by popular vote. It would be like the American Senate, where Maine, which has a population of a couple of million people, has two representatives, just as California and the other states. The power would be invested in two people elected in Ireland by popular poll with a universal franchise.</P>
    <P>This second house would address a number of issues. It would be where we would achieve equal status and parity of esteem. It would create political engagement. It would re-locate and re-root power in elected politicians. It would bring the bureaucrats closer to the people and take some of the power away from the Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> This is not the absolute answer to the democratic deficit. However, these are the kinds of issues which we should be talking about rather than have people treat the phrase democratic deficit as nothing more than words. Otherwise these words will become like the elephant test; they will not know what it is but they will know it when they see it. It is the old story of trying to make people engage with the minutiae of the issue and have real objectives. If we could move things forward in this way, then we would be making progress and Ireland would have a louder, clearer and more influential voice in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have dealt only with the democratic deficit. That is just one idea. In the course of the forum we can find many other discussion points on various other issues. I thank the Minister for his attention. I ask him to bring back to Cabinet the idea of having our vision for Europe and giving solutions to the people on possible ways of dealing with it, rather than letting the debate go all over the place with people who are anti-Europe for all sorts of reasons.</P>

    <P>SECTION 21.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 33, lines 12 to 20, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(1) Each county or city council shall have one member for every 4,000 persons ordinarily resident in its functional area and each town council shall have one member for each 1,000 such persons, subject to a minimum number of members of 21 in the case of a county council, 15 in the case of a city council and 12 in the case of a town council.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Senator O'Meara).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to alter the number of members of each local authority in the State. It proposes to provide one elected member for every 4,000 members of the population in each city and county and one for every 1,000 in each town. Under this proposal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will have 47 members as <Col N="1481" /> opposed to 28 at present. Dublin City Council will have 120 members, an increase of 68. This is hardly what the Senators want.</P>
      <P>The current position is that in general council population ratios between different cities and counties vary enormously. Each local authority operates within its own administrative area. The main priority is that a relevant council has sufficient members to carry out its functions effectively. To establish equality of representation across the State would be difficult, if not impossible. It would result in very substantial reductions in some local authorities as well as increases in membership of other local authorities.</P>
      <P>The question of an appropriate level of local representation is complex, affecting all local authorities, on which there are different public views. For example, should additional town representation be taken into account and to what extent should lower population ratios be allowed for large rural areas and higher population ratios for compact urbanised counties? Any move to consider comprehensively differences between local authorities in the State would be a major undertaking requiring detailed analysis. It could be implemented only over time, as recognised in the recent report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, to which Members of this House participated.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides a mechanism by which a local authority can itself apply for an alteration of its membership with a report by the Local Government Commission. This is a correct and sensible approach. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events, with the possibility of a Report Stage and a referral back to the Dáil, we could have a reasonable debate on the matter. Nobody wants a Dublin City Council with 120 members. The country would not survive it &ndash; RTÉ's tendency to be Raidió Teilifís Dublin would be overwhelmed.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara made the point that if these criteria were to apply to existing town councils, north Tipperary would not have a single town council. There needs to be an element of scale to recognise the population structure of the country. Of course one could have some sort of sliding scale that would establish a maximum number, but the real problem is at the bottom, not the top. A sensible level of delegated authority must be ensured which is not conditional on population numbers which most urban areas currently would not meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an amendment to this section in the Dáil which the Minister was not disposed to accept. Perhaps it does not need to be in legislation, but we should bear in mind that at local election time, when a number of elections are combined, there can be considerable confusion among the electorate. Particularly in urban areas, one could have an urban council ballot paper, a county council ballot paper and also a ballot paper for the directly elected chair. There could also be a ballot paper for a European election, which would mean four ballot papers having to be considered at once. To avoid confusion, this matter should be addressed as it could prevent people going to their polling stations. In practice, even though the amendment was not accepted, I would like to think that if there were four elections on the one day, despite the cost effectiveness of this, we should not add further referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 47, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) For a person to be nominated for the position of Mayor he or she must have served at least 5 years as an elected member of a local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important aspect of the Bill, particularly for local authority members. The majority of members who spoke at the GCCC, LAMA and AMAI, their three representative bodies, have been adamantly against the concept of directly elected mayors from the outset. The Minister agreed to a proposal by the General Council of County Councils and a similar one by LAMA that the person directly elected would have five years experience either in local government or at national level. It was very peculiar that this provision was suddenly removed when the Bill came before the Dáil. I am inclined to suspect &ndash; the Minister may accuse me of paranoia &ndash; that this <Col N="1483" /> was a sop to keep the councillors happy and distracted until the last minute.</P>
    <P>While I have no knowledge of the constitutional implications of such matters, I have always felt from a practical, common sense point of view that the concept of five years previous experience was a non-runner. However, the Minister must have thought otherwise since he allowed it to stay in the Bill until the last minute.</P>
    <P>The problem is very simple. Single issue candidates opposed to some proposal like incineration or entertainers or sports persons who enjoy a reputation will becoming directly elected mayors. They have an advantage in this form of election and will win through. Perhaps the Government thought it would have the advantage because it could turn out the greatest number of mayors. I advise the Minister to rethink this provision and remove it for the very simple reason I put forward on Second Stage, that is, that directly elected mayors are of no benefit to local democracy. There is no difference between such individuals and individuals selected by party groups.</P>
    <P>It is not always the largest group which ends up electing the mayor. A number of small groups very often come together. Democratically electing people to make a selection, in the same way as Deputy Michael Smith has been selected to become a Minister and the Taoiseach was given his role, is an example of true democracy taking its course. If the Government wants directly elected mayors, why does it not opt for direct elections for Taoiseach similar to presidential elections? I guarantee it is not inclined to do so. The Taoiseach, if he put his name forward, might even win it. Ultimately it is not sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>I believe someone looked at voting patterns around the country and concluded that Fianna Fáil would be the net beneficiary of this proposal. It will not work that way. We may get some good individuals. In my experience in a busy city, Galway, most of the occupational time of the mayor was taken up by honorary occasions such as attending dinners at night and official openings. I guarantee that these directly elected mayors will have had enough by the end of their first year. It is rare in modern times for a mayor seek re-election because of the demands of having to go out at night and the pressure on their families. If that is true for one year, what will it be like for five years? Nobody will want the job.</P>
    <P>I believe we will lose if this amendment is put to a vote. I therefore ask the Minister, if he intends to press the measure, at least to re-adjust this provision and reduce the term to three years. If he really wants to provide for directly elected mayors, he must take the simple step of giving them authority, responsibility and powers at least equivalent to those of a manager. The public could then see who is responsible for what. If they fail they will go after three years. I originally supported the concept, but only on condition that <Col N="1484" /> power and authority were handed over to elected representatives rather than an unelected body.</P>
    <P>This is a missed opportunity which could have heralded a revolution. It is time for adventurous thinking. We should look at experiences in Europe, where countries with directly elected mayors have not collapsed. They are also common in the United States. There is no reason we should not have them, provided they have authority and responsibility. Under this system we will get individuals who will be courted by managers &ndash; by no means stupid individuals &ndash; and kept on side, thus creating a division between the directly elected mayor and his council. Some local authorities will become virtually inoperable with people pushing against each other left, right and centre.</P>
    <P>The present system has worked well for 100 years. If the Minister cannot introduce the concept of a minimum five years experience or a three year maximum term, he should throw out the whole idea and let the system which has served us so well continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The associations discussed this matter among themselves and a suggestion was made to the Minister both privately and formally. The Minister was amenable to accepting that proposal, which required that the person who stood for the position of cathaoirleach of a county council or mayor of a city would be committed and strongly attached to local government. Like any position one might pursue, experience would count for something and the five year stipulation was included. I understand there were some legal difficulties with the proposal which is difficult to understand when one considers that the nominating bodies for various elections are controlled and designated. If the five years does not carry, there are perhaps other options to look at, for example, perhaps allowing only registered political parties as defined in the electoral Bill to nominate or insisting on a minimum number of councillors. The associations of local representatives will return to this issue.</P>
      <P>It is unfair of Senator Coogan to say the Minister somehow ran with this in the knowledge that it would be overturned. I know from talking to him that is not the case. Initially he checked if it was legally in order. The indications were that it was but in the last month or two he received indications that it was not in order. Something will have to be done. It would be invidious to arrive at a position in which someone succeeds in being elected cathaoirleach of a county council because of a specific controversy and subsequently pursues a single agenda. The whole success of the new system of local government will depend on the expertise, experience and commitment of the newly elected cathaoirligh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any difficulty with Senator Coogan's suggestion that the Taoiseach should be elected by general plebiscite. There is nothing <Col N="1485" /> wrong with that system &ndash; indeed it has some merits.</P>

I ask the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to convey to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, our disappointment at the non-acceptance of the amendment, which we understand is due to doubts about its legality. There are three years to run before this provision is implemented and, in the interim, something should be instilled in it to avoid the scenario I described arising, which would be very much to the detriment of local government and the intentions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the one area of the Bill about which I had reservations from day one.

Some such stipulation is necessary, even if the question of whether the measure is constitutional must be revisited.</P>
      <P>There is concern among all councillors that the person elected would have no interest in local democracy, might be interested in only one issue and would feather his or her own nest. A person could be elected on a single issue which was flavour of the month, regardless of his or her interest in local democracy. This would be an offence to local democracy and councillors would be very apprehensive should it happen.</P>
      <P>I have concerns about this provision. I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the need to revisit this aspect of the Bill and consider the insertion of such a stipulation within the next three years. I agree with the concept of giving whoever is elected mayor or cathaoirleach a direct mandate to take control of the local authority area. However, I see flaws in the proposal.</P>
      <P>If our aim is to take power from the manager and restore control to the elected members, why not re-emphasise the relationship between reserved and executive powers? Going outside the council to select a candidate who may not work, or even wish to work, with the councillors will not address that issue. At every recent meeting of the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members Association members have expressed concern that a provision be inserted to ensure the person selected to run would have experience of a local authority and empathy with local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> I empathise with Senator Coogan, the proposer of this amendment, but I am confident the Minister will revisit this issue and suggest we allow the matter to rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have reservations about this section. A directly elected mayor or cathaoirleach presents problems. Traditionally, the largest party or the largest amalgam of smaller parties on a council elected the mayor or chairman. The idea of the people directly electing the mayor is a good one but to elect such a person for five years imposes an onerous task on him or her. The cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am a member, does an almost full-time job. He works from early morning until late at night, seven days a week. No one could work at that pace for five years.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what powers would be accorded to the person concerned. I can see how a person might be elected to this position on a particular issue which might be at variance with the wishes of the councillors. Who would win out? A mayor needs the support of the councillors. What if his or her single issue was one such as water or waste charges on which he or she disagreed with the councillors? A pop star or sports personality who had no knowledge of local government or real interest in it might be elected mayor by popular acclaim and suddenly lose interest in the office with four years of his or her term to run.</P>
      <P>The section is fraught with difficulties. The original idea of directly electing a mayor and giving the people as much power as possible was good. I do not know how we can reverse this proposal once it has been passed but I am sure the Minister will give some leeway on this question and look at some aspects of the proposal again.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many councillors who have reservations about this proposal. These reservations are well known and have been articulated by many. I ask the Minister for Defence to bring our concerns to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government when he reports to him.</P>

      <P>As I do not wish to test the patience of the House, I will not repeat what has been said.</P>
      <P>One either believes in democracy or one does not. This House has a fairly exclusive electorate. Some of what I have heard about this debate, in this House and outside, reminds me of what would have been said in the last days of the British empire or the British raj. I am sure it was said that the peasants were not equipped to take over the running of their country and suspect the same argument was used in advance of Irish freedom and democracy. Events have shown that argument to be spurious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no half measures in this matter. It is correct that a mayor, cathaoirleach or chairman should be drawn from the people and have the democratic mandate which gives him or her authority. If, as the case may be, the candidate from <Col N="1487" /> the Monster Raving Loony Party, as Gaeilge, secures the chair of the county council, he or she will soon resign when he or she discovers the nature of the job. We must accept that risk if we believe in democracy.</P>
    <P>This debate has echoes of the previous debate on the Treaty of Nice. One of the difficulties in that debate was the lack of connection between the voters in the member countries and the institutions of the European Union. This has been at the heart of the problems associated with the failure to adopt the Nice treaty. I may be expressing a minority view but we cannot qualify democracy by deciding who shall be eligible to run for election. We cannot place restrictions on who the people decide they want to represent them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>I confess an ambivalence about this question because I may wish to run for lord mayor of Cork at some time in the future, but as I do not have five years experience on a local authority, Senator Coogan would have me excluded.</P>
      <P>One feels a consensus of wisdom in this House and one of the pieces of consensus wisdom I have acquired is the view that most people who are made Government Ministers on their first day in the Dáil do the job badly. There are exceptions, but the overwhelming experience is that most people who become Ministers immediately they are elected to the Dáil are not good advertisements for that route to Government. People learn from membership of the House.</P>
      <P>My principal reservation about this provision is that a person who did not have experience as a member of a local authority would be more open to manipulation by the permanent local government than someone who knew the system well and had allies among the elected members.</P>
      <P>On balance, I come down on Senator Coogan's side. I suspect my party would come down on his side also.</P>

    <P>There is a case for strengthening the admistrative skills and independence of an elected cathaoirleach. I believe in the principle of directly electing mayors or cathaoirligh. It would probably be preferable that they have some experience of local government before they are elected in the same way that generally Ministers do a bet<Col N="1488" /> ter job if they have some experience of the Dáil first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once this Bill goes through, under the enabling legislation, the Minister might give consideration to holding referenda in each of the local authority areas to determine if they wish to have elected mayors or directly elected chairs. The British model could be looked at. However the three polls that have taken place, admittedly in small local authority areas in Gloucestershire, Cheltenham and the north-east of England, have all returned overwhelmingly negative results. The electorates have rejected the concept of directly elected mayors and chairs. However it might go some way to addressing the very real objections that all of us who are in contact with councillors have found in different parts of the country. It is a little like the curate's egg; patchy and not unanimous. Some councillors have not exercised their minds about this to any great extent while there are others who have.</P>
      <P>Accepting that there will be directly elected mayors and chairs in local authorities throughout the country, I reiterate a recommendation I have made to the Minister for Environment and Local Government on at least two occasions during the wide-ranging consultative process in which he engaged prior to the introduction of this Bill. These positions need to be fully resourced. There should be the creation of the office of the cathaoirleach of a council and the office of the mayor. They should be given full administrative resources, otherwise, according to what the Bill states, we will create an office but not change in any significant regard the County Managers Act. We are therefore providing a title and a role as yet unspecified for directly elected mayors and chairpersons.</P>
      <P>It would enhance the office if the directly elected mayors and chairs were given the same expertise and administrative support services as are currently enjoyed by the executives of councils and local authorities in general. There will now be no pre-schooling or apprenticeship required by any citizen who wishes to stand for the office of chair or mayor. Surely it is not unreasonable to suggest that the person who takes on that office, if they do not have previous elective experience, should have at their disposal the full panoply of administrative skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in implementing this unique legislation, I would not like to think that this House would send out the message that we are somehow against the idea of any citizen having the right to stand. Councillors will agree, most of them in private I must admit, that they have no intrinsic objections to citizens generally exercising their rights in this regard. It happens in every other election. Why therefore should it not happen in the context of directly elected mayors and chairs? However because of the inherent dangers contained in this proposal, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure <Col N="1489" /> whoever is elected is given the full resources of what is available at local authority level.</P>

      <P>I was drawn unexpectedly into this by watching the monitor and hearing some of the remarks being made. When I came into the Chamber I heard my good friend, Senator Dardis, referring to the peasants and defending their rights. On a number of occasions he has raised this issue on which I absolutely support him. Peasants have nothing whatever to be ashamed of. Some of my best friends are peasants, even a few, I understand, in this very House.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the question of the direct election of mayors. Senator Mooney is perfectly right. If we regard the general public as fit to stand for election to either of these two Houses, then they should be allowed to stand for mayor. In my constituency, there is no requirement to have a degree of any kind or any education whatever. All that is required is to have eight or ten people in good standing on the electoral register to nominate someone and off they go. That is perfectly reasonable and fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work, but there is a distinction. If we are to have direct elections, they should be open and we should trust the good judgment of the electorate.</P>
      <P>It came as news to me about a year ago that this proposal was in the offing. I was made aware of it because the environmental correspondent of <i>The Irish Times </i>was going around saying that I was manoeuvring to have myself made Lord Mayor of Dublin and this was disastrous and should be stopped. I said that I had no intention of doing so and the message got back to him. He said in his latest book that I was denying it which was good because I would make up policy on the hoof. All the council was in a great flutter about this.</P>
      <P>I heard someone mention that five years was too long. I do not know whether they meant five years was too long an apprenticeship or the possibility of a mayor or cathaoirleach lasting five years was too long. If people think five years is too long for anything like this, they should also consider the Presidency. I have made this submission to the review group on the Constitution. Seven years is far too long to impose on a President, particularly in the light of the possibility of a second term bringing it up to 14 years. The French had seven years; they recently changed it to five.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of giving technical support and backup. That <Col N="1490" /> is a good point and very important. The definition of the functions of mayor also needs to be substantially altered because as it exists in Dublin the position of Lord Mayor is a formal chairman of debates and very largely ceremonial. I am not saying it is not valuable; it is. However in places like New York, Paris and Jerusalem, there is a directly elected mayor who has executive power. There is not much point in tinkering unless they also get executive power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's amendment. We need more debate about directly elected chairs and mayors. A number of Senators spoke about experience and there is a great fear that someone without experience might be elected to the detriment of the local authority. That could happen in many instances. The Minister has stated on many occasions that he wants to devolve more power to local authorities, in particular to directly elected chairpersons and mayors. However that is not reflected in this Bill. He does not seem to be giving any extra powers to a directly elected mayor or chairman.</P>
      <P>I could see a disadvantage in relation to funding for those elected to the local authority from an area where a person is standing for chair or mayor. A cap on the amount of funding allowed for directly elected mayors or chairs is not mentioned. A person seeking election as chair or a member of a local authority would have access to considerably more funding than a person contesting a seat in the same electoral area, putting him or her at a distinct disadvantage. Will the Minister elaborate on this provision and state if limits will be imposed on spending? An ordinary person seeking election to a local authority will be at a distinct disadvantage compared to somebody seeking election as a chair or mayor. Elections for mayors or chairs should be at a different time to elections to the local authority.</P>

      <P>If the Minister accepted the amendment there would be no need to speak on the section. Senator Coogan's amendment is very fair and it could get the Minister and the Government out of a spot. The public would like to see people who are well qualified getting these posts. On very few occasions is a councillor, elected for the first time, appointed chair or mayor, unless there is a struggle for power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly there is much support for the concept contained in Senator Coogan's amendment, which requires a directly elected mayor or chairman to have at least five years experience on a council. The Minister has great support for that concept, and when he addressed <Col N="1491" /> the association he was concerned to see if there was a mechanism through which consideration could be given to what the association was putting forward. Subsequently it emerged there were constitutional difficulties in doing so. When we reflect on that we realise that those standing for election to this House were not told they had to have a certain amount of experience in one place or another. A person who is 35 years of age or over has the option of standing for the presidency, while a person aged 21 years or over can stand in a Dáil election. Nowhere is there a written requirement to have experience in one place or another.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a change, which has not been broadly welcomed, but is novel and gives the post tremendous democratic legitimacy. On examining how this operates in other countries the Minister saw it was a way in which the strength of the council as distinct from the executive could be enhanced. It is fair to say that councillors who end their term as chairman after a year very often say it was only in the last few months of their term that they really got to grips with the job and understood what was necessary to do it. Therefore, there is an amount of sense in having a longer term and enhancing the power and ability of the council. This has to be done in concert between elected members and the executive.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the notion raised about a person simply walking into the job. A certain fear of democracy underpins this thinking. The electorate has the freedom to decide. Is it not saying a little about how one is doing one's job if one feels desperately threatened by somebody who can come from the outside without any experience and take over the roll? It may happen, but the Minister wants as far as is possible to monitor directly elected chairs and mayors and to return to the issue in mid term to see what review is necessary in the light of that experience. We must be prepared for change and embrace considerations and developments which have quite successfully taken place in other countries. We are now seeing the beginning of a change which will ultimately extend to greater powers being given to the chair as it evolves, and this is a move in that direction.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am unable to accept the amendment. While there is considerable sympathy for it the best we can offer is a stout-hearted commitment to review the position in mid term.</P>

      <P>I have asked in the context of a number of issues that legal opinion on such matters should be published so we can examine it. The reason the legal system is so beneficial to so many lawyers is that there are different opinions about different things &ndash; there are two sides to every story. If we had the opportunity to examine the legal opinion I have no doubt I would find somebody who would say my request is legitimate and constitutional. I again ask that legal opinion expressed by a Minister be made available on time to the House so a judgment can be made on it.</P>
      <P>Saying things will happen in the long term is like saying &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. We cannot wait for some time in the future; we can only deal with the legislation before us, and for that reason I will have to oppose the provision as it stands.</P>

There has been a gradual erosion of the power of local government over the past quarter of a century and this is a major initiative which can work to enhance local government. The fear is that people will be attracted to the posts who will not be inclined to enhance local government.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact one must be 35 years of age to stand for the presidency. Will the Minister examine the situation which pertains to the nomination of president. I cannot run for president unless I am nominated by a political party or a certain number of county councils. Perhaps within that framework a solution could be found to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that where a casual vacancy occurs in the office of a cathaoirleach and the remaining term of office is more than 12 months, a by-election will be held to fill the vacancy by direct election and if the remaining term is less than 12 months the members of the council will elect a cathaoirleach. That provision should be changed. Where such a casual vacancy arises, members of the council should elect a cathaoirleach. One or other arrangement should apply. There should not be provision for two arrangements. Where such a casual vacancy arises, I favour that members of the council should elect a cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>If provision for a directly elected chairman is part and parcel of the Bill, it would be incongruous to change it midstream. There is a logic to this section.

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I accept what the Minister and Senator Walsh said. The council will elect a cathaoirleach if the term of office remaining is less than 12 months.

      <P>In page 49, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) A local authority shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate access for members of the public and representatives of the media at local authority meetings.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with section 45 and this amendment is an attempt to strengthen it. It should be written in bold letters and large print that local authorities and committees thereof should meet in public wherever possible. It should only be a matter of exception that they do otherwise. The legislation should state that. In some of the surveys conducted in the past, one of the reasons that was given for not allowing public access to meetings, was that the room was not big enough or there was not space for them. It should be an obligation on local authorities to ensure that excuse cannot apply.</P>

      <P>Section 45 provides an unequivocal right for the public and the media to attend meetings of local authorities. There is only limited provision for the local authority to meet in committee. That is subject to safeguards, including special voting requirements and reasons to be given. An official amendment was made to section 54 on Committee Stage to permit access for the public and media to these meetings. The question of the dissemination of information about local authority meetings to the public, that <Col N="1495" /> they be informed when and where meetings take place, that they be given copies of the agenda etc. are dealt with comprehensively in paragraph 8 of Schedule 10 and more generally in section 127.</P>
      <P>An amendment was also brought forward on Report Stage to paragraph 8 of Schedule 10 to address the issue of the supply of notice and agendas to the media. It will now be open to local authorities to decide on ongoing arrangements as it considers appropriate. A number of local authorities already supply notice of meetings and agendas to the media as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the practicalities of facilitating the press and the public will be a matter for each local authority to decide in accordance with their standing orders. It is at the discretion of each authority to decide whether the public has the unequivocal right to attend and to promote openness and transparency. Not everything can be achieved overnight. The important point is that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>It is clear from my reply and the amendments which have been brought forward that there is a very comprehensive position regarding the right of the media and public to attend. There is the ongoing argument that local authorities should have the discretion to make their own decisions according to their standing orders. Each local authority is a little different in composition, geography, problems etc. and they may be better off to have discretion, within what is being proposed, to decide for themselves on the attendance of the public and the media. In essence it is a greater degree of local autonomy at local level.</P>

      <P>I love the way the Government justifies itself when it does not want to do something by talking about its commitment to local democracy. When it wants to do something it can put in place the most stringent measures and say that they are necessary for order and proper administration. I take it with a grain of salt and the Minister had his tongue firmly in cheek as he gave his reply.</P>
      <P>The problem is that one of the issues in section 45, that the local authority may regulate the right of members of the public and media representatives to be present, is that the local authority can take into account the amount of available space. There is no obligation on them to make space available. Previous surveys suggest that local authorities say that there is no space for the media or the public in the rooms where they hold their meetings. We should impose an obligation on them.</P>
      <P>I believe in local democracy. Local democracy carries with it certain undilutable obligations, one of which, as far as is practical and within well-defined limitations, is that meetings should be carried out in public.</P>

I have some empathy with what Senator Ryan said about authorities going into committee. Perhaps the Department of the Environment and Local Government will write to local authorities urging them that the discretion they have under this Bill should be used exceedingly sparingly. Going into committee to discuss the full estimates is not right. The councils should be given some direction in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise some points on the extent to which the media have access to the meetings of councils and their committees. I accept the point the Minister has made that, while it is possible to use the lack of availability of space as an excuse, there are very few premises in the country where space is an issue. If someone wants to be mischievous they could use that as an excuse but I do not foresee it happening in practice.</P>
      <P>The National Union of Journalists raised several queries in a letter to Senators dated 9 July &ndash; I assume other Senators also received it. One would have though the NUJ would have been accurate as to the section of the Bill it was talking about, but it was not. It raised the matter of the grounds on which the local authority can decide to exclude the media. This has been considered at some length by Kildare County Council. There was a vote on the issue and the Labour Party, some Independents, my Progressive Democrats colleague, councillor Timmy Conway, and I were in a minority in wishing to give the media access to committee meetings. Notwithstanding the fact that there should be grounds for exclusion on specific topics like housing allocation, for instance, where there are sensitive issues regarding individuals, I do not think the media would want to be present in that case. Nor should we subject them to the tedium of committee meetings, but if they choose to endure the tedium that is a matter for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which concerns me about the section is that it refers to &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; representatives. By whom are the media accredited? Are they accredited by the local authority, or is <Col N="1497" /> it assumed that the media representatives are accredited <i>de facto</i>? An accreditation system is another way of excluding people.</P>
    <P>How far down the system does the question of being present at a local authority go? Senator Walsh raised the point about the estimates and I agree with him. There should be access to such meetings. We discuss the estimates in public in Kildare. How far down the system does this extend? Does it go as far as area committees or just ordinary meetings of the council?</P>
    <P>The National Union of Journalists speaks of planning sub-committees. Sensitive issues can be involved concerning substantial inward investment where a major corporation may consider locating in the county and there is a necessity for confidentiality. I understand this. Much of the information would be available under the Freedom of Information Act subsequently. The NUJ should have some grounds for wanting journalists to attend most of the meetings it wishes them to attend. The union makes the point that it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served by discussing matters of public interest or taking decisions in private.</P>
    <P>The NUJ also makes the point that local authority meetings, including meetings of subsidiary bodies, should be held in public on the same basis as Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The procedure exists for the Houses to go into special committee and exclude the public for matters of significant import, although it has never been adopted in my 11 years as a Member. It is not an unusual procedure. The journalists have a point regarding access to meetings.</P>
    <P>Section 45(2) refers to &ldquo;a meeting&rdquo;. How far does this extend? What does &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; mean? Section 45(3) refers to the absence of the media being required or the local authority regarding it as a requirement because of the special nature of the meeting or other special reasons. How far does the term &ldquo;special reasons&rdquo; extend and where does it stop? I realise that is a difficult question for the Minister to answer but perhaps he might give us his views on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis has said almost everything I wanted to say but I wish to reiterate that we have a good template for deciding what should be done in secret, namely, the issues covered by the exclusions in the Freedom of Information Act, such as personal privacy or material which would be commercially sensitive in terms of decisions a local authority would make, for example, about competing tenders for the provision of goods or services where many of the commercial agencies, bodies or companies do not want the information disclosed, especially in advance of a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that much of what will be done in secret will become accessible to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. This section could be more strongly worded while leaving the correct right to have exceptional items discussed in private. Where there is a difficult <Col N="1498" /> issue, for example, a decision on the building of a ring road or a bridge across a river, such as one across the Barrow in my home town of Athy which is a matter of considerable controversy on which the local Labour Party representative, Deputy Wall, and I have slightly different opinions, the urban district council could make that decision in private, if it wanted to, to avoid people knowing what members said. Ultimately it would be revealed under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>It should not be possible to do things in private. We had dreadful debates in the House in the 1980s, especially on abortion and related matters. It would have suited some Members not to have had the debates in public because otherwise it meant they had to state opinions and explain their positions on explosive and sensitive issues. It would not have been excusable to do the simple thing of debating them in private. There may have been an attempt by someone to do so and the House unanimously decided not to go that route. I wish local authorities would make a similar decision, but I know they would not. That is the reason I am sorry this section is not more strongly worded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be practical about this. It would not be possible in primary legislation to name the circumstances which could conceivably arise in each local area in which a local authority could go into committee. The safeguard is that half the members of the full council must vote to go into committee.</P>
      <P>Sometimes trouble is caused by doing something different, experimental and far-seeing. This is the first Local Government Bill which specifically and unequivocally gives the right to the media and public to be present at council meetings. That is a positive change.</P>
      <P>Accreditation means a journalist's card or the equivalent. An amendment was made to section 52 covering other meetings below formal council meetings allowing the Minister to introduce regulations to assist councils to determine the type of meeting below formal meetings where the media and public would be present.</P>
      <P>This is the first time primary legislation gives an unequivocal right to the media and public to be present at council meetings. Absolute safeguards have been provided to restrict a council severely from going into committee for frivolous or vexatious reasons.</P>
      <P>I could be misinterpreted in saying this but I would like to have a certain degree of confidence in local councils to make a judgment. They are elected by the people to do a good job. In fairness, most of them set out to do this. We want primary legislation to assist, encourage and restrict, where necessary, but not determine every circumstance in which a council must or must not or may or may not do this or that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was raised by a colleague in the Labour Party who is a member of a local authority. Section 48(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii)(II) states that the term of office of a chairperson of a strategic policy committee &ldquo;shall not be less than 3 years.&rdquo; The point was made to me that, if a chairperson has a period of three years and is then reappointed for another three years, that is six years, which is not co-terminous with the period of office of a county council. It appears that the provision should state that it should be not less than three years and should come to an end when a local authority election is held. If a person is made chairperson for three years and reappointed for another three years, his or her period as chairperson stretches beyond the period of local elections.</P>

If a person is appointed for another three years after the first three, will he or she be automatically a member of the next council, will he or she be <i>ex-officio</i>, or how will he or she establish himself or herself?</P>
      <P>Another issue in the section relates to the effectiveness of strategic policy committees. Is there a mechanism other than the annual report to determine whether they are effective and meeting? I do not suggest a daily record should be kept of attendance but some measure should be made of the effectiveness of SPCs because I am aware of cases where the attendance was such that they had to be abandoned. These included unelected people to help make them feel part of the democratic system.</P>

If the Senator is the lord mayor of Cork city and operating SPCs, once the election take place he will no longer be working with some of the members.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Coogan, the way in which the provision is working will be surveyed and monitored. This is not just primary legislation which will lie flat. There will be ongoing research, monitoring and so on by the Minister of the day and the local authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the 1994 local elections the Minister extended the urban boundaries for voting purposes. At the time everyone believed there would be a corresponding extension in regard to authorities within that area. However, that has not happened because there has been a change of Government. There has been no extension to the boundaries of a number of urban council areas who applied for extensions for the purposes of controls rather than for the extension of the voting franchise.</P>
      <P>There is a major change in sections 57 to 60, inclusive, regarding urban councils or local authorities who seek extensions or alterations to their boundaries. In some instances it must be agreed between the urban council and the county council. If an urban council or county council reaches an agreement on an extension to an urban boundary, the Minister should sign the order and that should end the matter. That is what should have happened in regard to extensions sought heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation, if one applies for an extension to an urban boundary which is agreed by one or two local authorities, it will then go to a boundary commission who will carry out evaluations and make a recommendation to the Minister. The boundary commission is a group of people appointed by the Minister of the day. In this instance one or two local authorities who <Col N="1501" /> agree an extension or alteration to their boundary in good faith will then be at the behest of three, four or five unelected members, people who have been nominated by the Minister of the day, which is not good enough. If local authorities comply with all the regulations and a recommendation is sent to the Minister, that should be sufficient, rather than being at the behest of a number of people who could have a vested interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much that Senator Burke said. My urban authority has been endeavouring for almost a quarter of a century to get a boundary extension, which is almost impossible. If we believe in the principle of subsidiarity, it behoves us to have a system whereby local government is administered closest to the people. The Minister, Deputy Smith, is in a very good position to appreciate this aspect because he took an initiative in the past to allow urban authorities to extend their boundaries for the purposes of elections. The intention was that these boundaries would be extended, but in most cases that did not happen because very often county managers and county councillors opposed it.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable that housing estates should be divided in two, with one section coming under an urban authority and the other under a county council. Urban authorities should include the whole developmental area within their jurisdiction. This is important, given the current rate of construction of residential and industrial estates.</P>
      <P>There is another argument in regard to this aspect. The Bill does not enhance the role of urban authorities because the Minister arrived at a stage whereby the various committees recommended that the primary unit of local government should remain the county council, therefore nothing should be done to undermine the financial viability of the county council. It is unfair, on the one hand, to restrict urban authorities from extending their boundaries while, on the other, they do not have the financial ability to meet some of their commitments. If the boundaries were extended they would be able to do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in Part 8 of the Bill. For the first time it sets out a fairly definite process to be followed which, I hope, will lead to these boundaries being extended. I agree with Senator Burke &ndash; it was in a joint submission we made &ndash; that where two local authorities are in agreement, that should go through without the commission addressing it. Section 60 states that the commission must treat this aspect as a priority and make recommendations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I will be brief because I do not wish to make the same points as the other Senators. This aspect is epitomised in the Dublin area where there are huge problems in regard to the division of areas. The Bill spells out how agreement can be reached and how things can be co-ordinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> I have a problem in regard to the local government commission. I often wonder how they draw the lines. It seems like a line on the map and I am never sure whether they have got it absolutely right. The Minister will be familiar with this aspect given his experience as a former Minister for the Environment. I echo the points raised by the two Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government Commission is dealt with in section 2. The commission is independent. I can recall as Minister for the Environment when there was a review of boundaries. I would hate to think that the decisions on these matters would have to be taken by the local elected members in those areas. If Senators are pressing for that kind of decision, we will just have to dissolve the Seanad now and deal with the matter some other way. The import of what Senators are saying is that we should try to speed up the change in the boundaries where there is local agreement.</P>
      <P>The reason for the involvement of the Local Government Commission is not just on the question of boundaries. Assessments must be made in terms of economic viability. There can be very strong urban growth which if it were to have total control within its own boundary would have a very detrimental effect on a poor rural hinterland. These considerations must be taken into account. Where there is agreement between the two local authorities, the commission is expected and requested to deal with that very quickly.</P>
      <P>I remind Senator Burke that it is up to the local authority to make the application. An application was made by the authority in Killarney recently and that has been accepted. The initiative comes from the local authority, not from the Department.</P>

Several reminders have been sent from the local authority to the Minister. There is full agreement between the county council and the urban council on the issue. I agree with the Minister that in areas where there is agreement there is no need for the commission. The county council and the urban council always make clear what the financial implications are for either local authority. I do not see why the commission would have a different view. I fully agree with the Minister that those things should be speeded up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued strongly for the devolution of powers to local government. It is a matter of some regret that the devolution committee which was established seems to have gone into abeyance. I know there is resistance from various Departments to devolved powers to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and to local authorities. While that is understandable, it is regrettable. Local government has a remit in third level education but it should have a remit in all areas of education. The very valuable health committees should have been replaced by local authority elected members on the committees. The disbursement of lottery grants, local development and so on should be part of the remit of local government. I would also add policing. Who is better placed to discuss with local superintendents and local management of the Garda the problems in a given area than the elected members who are well aware and well informed by their constituents?</P>
      <P>There are enabling provisions in section 72, and also in sections 64 and 65, for the Minister to devolve powers. There are further developments, including the promotion of interest among young people in local government, the promotion of the Irish language and amenities, sports, recreation and heritage facilities. Many councils play their part in this. If we are serious about meaningful local government, somebody must grasp the nettle to devolve powers which are centralised and could be much more administratively delivered by control at local level. In that way there would be much more accountability to the public for whom the services are provided.</P>
      <P>I make a strong appeal to the Minister in this regard. I know that when he was Minister for Local Government he certainly played his part in trying to achieve this. Most people would acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is as good as any holder of that office. There needs to be a push not just by the Minister but by his colleagues in government. There are complaints about a range of public services, especially in health. Many of those complaints could be tackled and addressed locally by people with the local knowledge if we only took the decision to devolve powers to a lower tier of government.</P>

      <P>If leniency was shown to that side of the House I am sure you will extend it to this side of the House. We have seen the reverse of the devolution of authority. The authority of local authorities is being transferred to managers. The Waste Management Bill is a prime example. Local authority members must be trusted to carry out the functions. If distrust is shown they will react in the opposite way. Decisions are some<Col N="1504" /> times difficult for them to make and they take time to make, but they eventually arrive at a decision. If there are hard pills to swallow, they will do that.</P>
      <P>If this Bill makes changes regarding remuneration there will be more pressure on members to carry out those responsibilities. We should pay more than lip service. The functions of local authorities have been eroded. Alternative groups and boards were set up to manage the tourism industry and it might have made more sense to consider the local authority in that regard. It often provides the finance and facilities for tourism. We should be adventurous and imaginative and say that tourism should come within the remit of local government. We should also examine traffic management and take some step towards local community police. If this Bill is to have a purpose, it should examine these matters but I think the opportunity has been lost.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to speak on this because the local authority members know better than I do. It is a pity the Government reversed the decision of the previous Government to have local education committees. It was one of the first decisions of the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, on the grounds that they were bureaucratic and expensive. My view was then and still is that the way central bureaucracy defines efficiency inevitably means that it looks more efficient when it is in charge. This is because the waste is elsewhere. When the work is done locally, if there is waste, it is usually in the provision of a local and very useful local service.</P>
      <P>The issue of the powers of local government is one that seems to have been left for another day and that is a great pity. Senator Walsh made the point perfectly well that there is no area of Government which would not benefit from local input when it is being applied locally. The idea that there is somebody in Dublin who can make a better judgment on any local issue than local people properly advised with competent technical advice is nonsense.</P>
      <P>I remember a member of Dublin Corporation talking about the licensing of horse-drawn taxis on St. Stephen's Green and pointing out that they would have to apply to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for by-law approval. Who in the Department of the Environment and Local Government knows more about that than the members of Dublin Corporation? That is just one example and there are hundreds more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge reluctance to dispose of the myth that everything referred to the Department is dealt with by the Minister. I have heard city managers in Cork say that the most frustrating thing is to know that when you refer something to the Minister it will be decided on by an official who is less qualified, less well paid and manifestly less competent than the city manager who &ndash; in conjunction with the local authority &ndash; is not per<Col N="1505" /> mitted to exercise their authority. There is a fundamental problem here.</P>
    <P>The myth of centralisation has been a huge flaw of the political left for many years, particularly in Britain. It is interesting that Sweden, which is in many ways closest to a model social democracy, has a huge degree of devolution. Health care is under the control of local councils. Denmark, like other countries I know reasonably well, devolved great powers from central to local government over the last 25 or 30 years. Two countries with a strong, successful tradition of social democracy have gone in the opposite direction to the political left here. We have only begun. This has nothing to do with civil servants going to Thurles or anywhere else. It has to do with accepting as a myth the idea that the expert in Dublin somehow knows more than local people. That is the real issue. There is nobody in Dublin who can ensure that Athy Urban District Council or Kildare County Council will use their money better.</P>

      <P>Part of the problem for local government over recent years has been that it was by-passed by a number of initiatives in rural development and micro-enterprise. The fault is not always at the centre. We all agree that when it comes to the hard decisions there has been a strong reluctance to take them at local level. I reject the notion that power is being taken from the local authorities in the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. It is only taken from the local authority if it fails to fulfil its obligations in the management of waste. I have had the experience of devolving about 30 or 35 instruments to local authorities and a number of decisions to be taken under their auspices were sent back to the centre when it came to having to make a hard local decision.</P>
      <P>If Senators are going to make comparisons with Denmark and other countries they have to look at the finance raised in those countries at local level. Since many local councillors vote against raising the smallest amount of money for water charges, it is hard to believe they would want to be associated with what happens in Denmark where the local charges are so substantial. When added to the general tax system they give a phenomenal rate of tax. Having said that, the task force on local government and local development systems, the county and city boards, the Garda, the health boards and FÁS are coming together. You cannot possibly move from where we are in the historical terms of our education system and our legal infrastructure to make comparisons with other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to differ with Senators except where I have to but in my experience you never lose power while you are taking the decisions. You lose power when you do not take them. That is true at national and local level. In any organisation if you keep failing to take decisions you will lose power. If it is not taken away from you by primary legislation it will be taken away by the <Col N="1506" /> public. We need to get our thinking about local power straight. Local power means taking the easy decisions and taking the hard ones. The more those are taken collectively, the more power you will have. I am very interested in that. I agree completely with Senator Ryan that it is impossible for someone a distance away to be as good as somebody who is local, provided the person sitting locally takes the decision. However, if he or she does not it is a different matter.</P>

      <P>Tá saghas díomá orm faoin alt seo. Tá sé lag faoi úsáid agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. I do not for a second want to suggest that this is the fault of a particular party or Government. One of the faults in our national efforts to revive or sustain the language is that we often do not do the things we should. Mar shampla, section 63(1) provides:</P>
      <P>(1) A local authority may, in performing its functions, take such steps as it considers appropriate to encourage the use of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>B'fhearr liom i bhfad go mbeadh &ldquo;shall&rdquo; ansin agus ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil sé ann. Ní thuigim cén fáth gur cuireadh &ldquo;may&rdquo; isteach in ionad &ldquo;shall&rdquo; mar nuair a théann tú tríd an alt agus nuair a léann tú fo-alt (3) a leagann rialacha an Aire amach&ndash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> (2) (<i>a</i>) The Minister shall in accordance with this section issue, or arrange for the issue, to local authorities of guidelines.</P>
    <P>Then subsection (3) states that a local authority shall have regard to such guidance in the performance of its functions. However, all of that is subsidiary to the fact that whether they do anything or not is a matter of discretion. Go speisialta, is trua nach bhfuilim ábalta aon tagairt a fheiscint ann do na dualgaisí faoi leith gur chóir go mbeadh ag na h-údaráis áitiúil go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí ionta. I mo thuairim, ba chóir go mbeadh ceart ag ball ar bith d'údarás áitiúil a thoghtar do cheantar Gaeltachta, ba chomhair go mbeadh sé de cheart aige no aici gach gnó a dhéanamh as Gaeilge agus ba chóir go mbeadh sin de dhualgas ar na h-údaráis áitiúil.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong if a representative of a Gaeltacht area on the county councils of Kerry, Galway, Cork, Meath or Donegal were precluded from using only Irish to conduct all the business of that local authority.

      <P>This is a good provision but it could have been stronger if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; had been used instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I suggest that the Department might consider circulating all councils, pointing out that there is this particular provision and requesting that perhaps there would be at least one item on the agenda of every local authority where people could speak bilingually and use the language. We did that for a period at my local authority and then a chairman came along who disagreed with it because he did not have Irish, and it was dropped. That might be a way of doing it.

      <P>I welcome this section which deals with local archives. The wording in the subsection (2) is strong. It states that it is a function of the local authority to make arrangements, etc., for the custody of archives and for making them available to the public. Furthermore, I welcome that it states that the local authority may acquire archival material by purchase, donation or bequest.</P>
      <P>A few years ago at Kildare County Council I moved a motion seeking the establishment of a local archive in County Kildare. The reason I did that was the county offices were being renovated and I feared that some of the documents would be lost. The most valuable depository of the social history of a county is probably the county council records, documents and archives. It is important that these documents would be preserved and maintained for future generations.</P>
      <P>An archive is different from a museum. There have been calls for a county museum in Kildare but this is a different matter. I am pleased to say that provision has been made for the custody of the archives in the new arts and library centre at Newbridge, which was the millennium project of the county council. The single biggest difficulty is finding the space to store them and also the fact that a professional archivist, who is being shared with the regional authority, is involved in the management and custody of the archive.</P>

Given our unwillingness to issue directives to local authorities about meeting in public, I am intrigued by the fact that the Minister is retaining the power to direct local authorities not to make certain local archives available to the public. It seems contradictory, given our willingness to refrain from interfering with the local authority on the issue of meetings in public, to keep the power to tell them which local archives they cannot make public as distinct from advising them to do so.</P>

Seriously, I thank both Senators for their comments generally about this provision and, more importantly, what the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister have been doing to develop libraries and archives. There are record levels of funding and staffing being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of section 81 in the Bill. This system has been operating in most local authorities for many years. It would seem that this provision is a little more flexible than the old system in that subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>A road authority may provide assistance by way of carrying out of works, a financial contribution or otherwise towards the construction or improvement of a non-public road . . .</P>
      <P>That would seem to be a slight change from the old provision. Now a local authority would seem to be able to give a financial contribution if there were two or more people carrying out works on a road. Rather than have the local authority getting involved in it, it would be more beneficial if the local authority stated that it would give £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 to the applicants and let them carry out the work. That is the meaning I take from the provision and I hope that would be the case. If that were to happen, it would be a great system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue concerns section 81(4)(<i>a</i>), which states that assistance by a road authority shall be &ldquo;conditional on a prior written agreement by the parties concerned with the road auth<Col N="1510" /> ority and a financial contribution by such parties&rdquo;. Prior written agreement was necessary under the old system as well. In some cases, if all people concerned are not in agreement, one of them could stop work being done on a road. This would an injustice to those who would like the work to be carried out. I have seen this happen on several occasions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the type of roads for which we are now legislating, financial assistance can be given for their repair but one person can hold up a council's funding of a project or its carrying out of the work. That is wrong. Will the Minister intervene in cases where a local authority is in favour of granting financial assistance or carrying out work, but is hindered by those not in agreement? Will the Minister ensure work is carried out if the vast majority of people concerned are in agreement? It is unfortunate for people who live on bad roads who may have fallen out with their neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with what Senator Burke is saying. I am aware of the circumstances to which he is referring. It is a pity that they happen. In general, when there is agreement, there is flexibility. The Senator is referring to special cases in which the majority are in agreement, facilitating the council, and giving the written approbation, but in which there are one or two objectors. In those circumstances, there is a facility to make application to the Minister, who may decide to alter, if that is not too strong a word, the guidelines and regulations governing the scheme in question. The Minister can give authority to the council not to apply the full requirements of the scheme. It is hoped such cases will be exceptional because if there were too many people creating problems for those who were co-operating, those not co-operating would still receive the same benefits and have their roads repaired as well.</P>

I <Col N="1511" /> know many local authorities share services. For example, Galway Corporation shares fire and library services with the county council, which works quite well.</P>

Every time they asked when a meeting was to be held, they discovered it would not be held. That the sharing of services is not prohibited by the Bill is welcome, but it should be encouraged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Burke, has already remarked on the commission. I am always fearful that groups, regardless of how independent they are supposed to be, become independent from everybody. A previous amendment by the Labour Party, amendment No. 3, concerned the expansion of numbers of members of local authority. If one looks at Schedule 7, in page 197 of <Col N="1512" /> the Bill, Leitrim has 22 local authority members and Roscommon has 26. The population of those two counties is less that the population of Galway City, which has 15 representatives. In order to ensure balanced representation, the commission should ensure the numbers are proportional to the populations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this amendment comes under section 90, it is more related to section 23, which deals with local electoral areas, whereas section 90 lists the functions of the Local Government Commission, which must be carried out in accordance with certain sections such as section 23. This amendment concerns the review of local electoral areas to take account of population changes, which are identified by a census. It implies that the Local Government Commission could, on its own initiative, increase or decrease the total number of members of an authority.</P>
      <P>For the local elections of 1999, a comprehensive review of the local electoral areas throughout the State was carried out by the Electoral Area Boundary Commission, based on the results of the 1996 census. It was always the intention to review these areas when necessary. However, following careful consideration of similar concerns raised during the passing of the Bill through the Dáil, an official amendment was tabled to address some of the concerns. It provides that, in considering a request to the Local Government Commission to review local affairs, the Minister may take account of population changes highlighted by the most recent census. This, however, does not make it mandatory for the Minister to request the commission to carry out a review of the electoral area after a census. If there are not significant changes in population, a review would waste the commission's time.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Local Government Commission could, on its own initiative, increase or decrease the total number of members. The commission's function is to allocate the total membership of the local authority among whatever number of local electoral areas may be considered appropriate. Only a local authority itself can seek an increase in total membership under section 22.</P>
      <P>In view of the reasons I have outlined, particularly given that some of the Senators concerns have been met by way of amendment, I do not propose to accept this amendment. It is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authorities to make the applications for more members.</P>

      <P>In page 88, subsection (6)(a), line 26, after &ldquo;environment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the manager takes reasonable steps to obtain the prior consent of the Cathaoirleach and notifies the elected members forthwith.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to ensure some level of democratic participation. It refers to the power of a manager to incur additional expenditure &ldquo;where he or she is of the opinion that such additional expenditure is necessary to avert or minimise a threat to public health, public safety, property or the environment.&rdquo; We propose the insertion after &ldquo;environment&rdquo; of &ldquo;provided that the manager takes reasonable steps to obtain the prior consent of the Cathaoirleach and notifies the elected members forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The most immediate and striking reason for this is the number of occasions on which members of local authorities have told me about matters presented to them as a <i>fait accompli </i>before they knew anything about them amid considerable reluctance on the part of managers to tell them precisely the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> This reminds me of the extraordinary circumstances which developed in Cork some years ago when Deputy Martin, now a Government colleague of the Minister, was forced to threaten use of section 4 to enforce the right of the members of Cork Corporation to inspect a consultant's report on the landfill site on the Kinsale Road when officials refused to make it available. There is no direct parallel but it represents the alternative view that the system of local government is meant to be a partnership between professional management and elected representatives. The exigencies of speedy decision making should only extremely rarely be used to enable a county manager to avoid informing elected members about what is going on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to section 104 of the Bill, which provides for circumstances in which a local authority may exceed the budgetary provisions over and above those adopted at the annual budget meeting. In general, the manager is obliged to obtain authorisation from the elected council in order to exceed the budget provisions adopted. The only circumstances in which prior authorisation of the elected council is not expressly required by the manager in incurring additional expenditure are for reasons of emergencies or where expenditure arises solely due to additional funding becoming available. In my experience, funds of this nature generally become available at short notice and with a relatively short life span.</P>
      <P>I do not seem to be addressing Senator Ryan's problem. This section concerns funds becoming available towards the end of the year. These have a very short life span for use and the council should, therefore, press ahead to get the work done. In addition there are emergency circumstances. In my interpretation of the provisions, the case the Senator makes does not seem to apply.</P>

This is to prevent the manager from incurring additional expenditure &ldquo;where he or she is of the opinion that such additional expenditure is necessary to avert or minimise a threat to public health, public safety, property or the environment&rdquo;. One could not argue with that, but there ought to be some obligation on the manager to make reasonable efforts to communicate this fact with the elected cathaoirleach and the members. That is all, it simply aims to keep the dual function going. Members have told me that good managers are very good and bad managers tend to be extraordinarily minimalist using all the powers available to them. Listening to the comments of others it seems that, provided something is not explicitly stated in writing, many managers will take the option presenting the least difficulty, which is to tell people as little as possible. It is not a party political issue. Members of all parties have told me this. Members, in particular the cathaoirleach, ought to be told.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 93, subsection (10), line 35, after &ldquo;jurisdiction.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Local authority services may not be withheld from occupiers who are in default of payment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand this section caused some controversy in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on the issue of community initiatives. To be helpful, as the Minister knows is my wont, I propose a reasonable amendment, which is that, where a community initiative is agreed that includes a fund and a charge, there should be a firewall between the provision of local authority services and dealing with the debt. I will not argue about whether it is possible to take the money from someone as a debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section contains a reference to treating default of payment as a normal debt, which is how it should be. However, it should be made clear that a person who declines to pay his or her fair share of funding towards a community initiative should not be made a victim by being deprived of water or refuse services, in particular the former for which there is no longer a charge. It should be dealt with as a debt to be recovered <Col N="1516" /> in cash, not through the deprivation of other services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 110 which deals with community initiative schemes whereby funding for a specific community initiative may be raised. This concept was first mooted in the White Paper, Better Local Government, in 1996 to introduce a mechanism for local authorities to sponsor in partnership with local community or other groups discretionary development projects which would not otherwise proceed within available resources.</P>
      <P>There are strict rules set out to govern the setting up of such a scheme. The decision is at the discretion of the elected council, at least half of whose members must vote in favour of the resolution to introduce a contribution. Prior to its being voted on by the elected council, public notice must be given of the council's intention to consider adoption of a draft scheme to provide for the contribution in respect of a specific community initiative. The process allows maximum scope for public comment on any or all aspects of the proposed scheme, including the decision by the council to hold a plebiscite within the proposed area prior to deciding on the adoption of the scheme.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that default of payment under the contribution scheme will not result in local authority services being withheld. Section 110 does not provide for this and its provision cannot be used to overturn the duties of local authorities. Local authorities have statutory obligations under various statutes to provide a wide range of services within their functional area. The statutory obligation on authorities to provide these services is, in no way, diluted or removed in the event of default in payment of the community initiative contribution. The provisions of section 110 regarding default of payment relate only to the standard remedy available to local and other public agencies in such cases, that is to recover the contribution as a separate contract debt from a court or competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for the making of regulations in relation to the form of accounts. The simplification of local authority accounts is long overdue. The programme system which currently operates is outdated. Local authority accounts should be dealt with in a normal business manner showing income and expenditure, perhaps under different expenditure headings. We should move away from programme headings which have very little relevance to the current activities of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Any properly run small business has an annual budget and monthly accounts which relate to the budget. I ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to examine this system of accounting for local authorities. In my own local authority, despite criticism for a number of years, inept management has resulted in the 1997-98 abstract accounts being completed only recently. The 1999 accounts have not yet been done and will, I understand, show over-expenditure of approximately £250,000. This is appalling. People within the local government system are reasonably well paid. There should be checks and balances to ensure that proper financial controls are in place so that this kind of mess, which reflects on councillors and management, does not occur.</P>
      <P>Steps must be taken to streamline the accounting system and install the necessary disciplines which apply in any well-operated company.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)A Council may, by resolution, require that any executive functions be exercisable by it as reserved functions except functions relating to human resources, financial operations, urgent legal action and the granting of individual planning permissions.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>Section 131 sets out what are reserved functions. These are the major policy decisions which set out the parameters of local government operations. Section 149(6) provides that the executive functions, functions which are not reserved, must be performed in accordance with the policies determined by the elected council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would provide that any, or indeed all, executive functions could be declared to be reserved functions by resolution, with certain exceptions. This would have the effect of dis<Col N="1519" /> mantling the entire policy executive framework which is the current basis of local government law. It is not at all apparent that decisions on individual cases of enforcement action, housing allocations or similar matters would, at this stage, become reserved functions as would seem to be the case under this amendment. Quite the contrary approach was taken by the rainbow Government in its White Paper, Better Local Government, which proposed to maintain the current policy executive framework.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages a fuller role for the elected council so that it can reclaim its rightful place at the centre of policy making and maintain a proper overview of local authority operations with proper support and back-up. In those circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

It is provided that the manager shall prepare a corporate plan for the local authority and in consultation on this he shall bring the policy group together. In the smaller counties there will be four SPC chairpersons along with the cathaoirleach and there can be three additional people who are not members of the council. There could be nearly as many unelected people as elected people making recommendations on a policy group. This will dilute the contribution of the local elected councillors in preparing the corporate policy to be put in place by the manager in consultation with the policy group. I know it is up to the corporate policy group to bring those people on board, but the facility is there to bring in as many unelected people as elected people to make decisions on a corporate plan for a county.</P>

I welcome the provision for the establishment of a corporate policy group, made up of four or five councillors chaired by the full time chairman in the future. It is an ideal vehicle for the transfer of executive powers from the county manager to elected members and should be used as such. The director of services will report directly to the chairs of the SPCs who form this corporate policy group. This creates an <Col N="1520" /> opportunity to make a significant change and redress the imbalance that has come about over the past 50 years, whereby powers were assumed by managers, both by stealth and by other means and the councillors allowed that to happen. I hope the system being instituted here will be used by councillors and by the Department and the Minister for that purpose.</P>

      <P>The corporate policy group is a very important one. It totally up to the discretion of the council as to whether it invites non-elected members on to it. However if the council is to have more powers, that means it will be necessary to invite people from other disciplines to give a more cohesive result. If Mayo councillors think the goal posts are more likely to be in front of them when they kick the ball by leaving these substitutes on the sideline, then that is what they will do. If they think these substitutes will be better able to send it over the bar, they will bring them in. They need to find where the goal posts are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling that my amendment has a financial implication. My nomination to the Senate is from the General Council of County Councils and therefore I represent it. I do not apologise to anybody for doing the best I can on its behalf. The salary scale to be paid to county councillors has been discussed in great detail and I am sure will be in the media some time in the future.</P>
      <P>I have outlined, as have many other Members of this House, the amount of work involved in local government. A survey carried out by the General Council of County Councils showed an average of 33 hours per week. On Second Stage, I outlined the difficulties members have and the amount of time and commitment they have to give to the new bodies in which they are involved. These demand that whatever salary scale is put in place will recognise the contribution being made. It has been a public service up to this, but the demands of today's world are such that it will be difficult to get people to be members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>We spoke on other issues today where voluntary groups find it hard to get new volunteers. The amount of work involved in local politics is often greater than that in most voluntary groups. Therefore the onus is on the Minister to ensure that the payment reflects the amount of work being done.</P>
      <P>The minimum should be one third of a Senator's salary. That should also take into account the allowances that Members of these Houses obtain. It should be index linked to that so that we do not have to go back every few years to vote again. The sum I recommend as a minimum is not outrageous and is in fact very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to back payment, the Minister has stated in the House that he can only pay from the time the Bill was published, which was May 2000 &ndash; a long time ago. However the Minister also made a verbal contract with local authority members. That contract was made when he first offered the previous local authority members the <Col N="1522" /> opportunity to take gratuity and retire. The people who gave up their gratuity and continued in public service had every right to expect that from the date they were elected, they would be paid their salary. That is only correct. That was a verbal contract I believe the Minister intended to ensure would come about.</P>
    <P>If they are carrying out the work now what is the difference if they were carrying it out in 1999. These members deserve full payment back to that date. They also deserve, at the minimum, one third of a Senator's salary. In the past few months they have seen the salary scale of Deputies, Ministers and Senators increase quite dramatically.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provisions in this section. It is not the first time a Minister has recognised the voluntary work that councillors have done over the years. The Minister here tonight, Deputy Smith, was one of the first to do so when he brought in special allowances to recognise that people should be rewarded properly. While he came in for some criticism, the vast majority of councillors were pleased with the significant changes made during his term in office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government must be complimented. This proposition was put to him at a LAMA conference in October 1997, less than four years ago, and he deserves tremendous praise for accepting the proposition and now enshrining it in legislation. No figure is set in relation to it. The three representative associations have put forward their views that it should not be less than one third of a Senator's salary, as mentioned by Senator Coogan, and presumably service increments would also apply. We hope that when the AMAI, the GCCC and LAMA take up the invitation to which the Minister committed himself, namely, to discuss the issue following enactment of the Bill, we will be talking in terms of such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the inclusion of superannuation provisions. Many of us are aware of councillors who left local government through retirement or the fortunes of the ballot box and found themselves at a severe loss because of their local government service. It is appropriate that their local government service be recognised through superannuation. The detail will have to be worked out, but there is no reason the normal public service arrangements for superannuation should not apply <i>pro rata</i> to the salary of local councillors, and we hope that will happen. We <Col N="1523" /> applaud the Minister for including these enabling provisions which will resource councillors to meet their increasing commitments and workload under the new structures and enhance the working of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section. I am disappointed the amendment I put forward was ruled out of order. I appreciate why it was ruled out, but I tabled it to strengthen the Bill so payment could and would be made to local authority members. I am also disappointed that Senator Coogan's amendment has been ruled out of order, though again I appreciate why that is so. Regarding Senator Coogan's amendment, a firm commitment was given by the Minister that payment would be made to councillors from after the election in June 1999. I hope the Minister does not renege on this position.</P>
      <P>I also support what Senators Coogan and Walsh said in relation to the Minister meeting the AMAI, the GCCC and LAMA following enactment of the Bill on the issue of the salary. Everybody agrees the salary paid to councillors should reflect the work they do. Only members, their wives and families really appreciate the work done by local authority members. Their doors are always open and, as Senator Coogan said, there seems to be an estimate of 33 hours per week. Everybody, including the representative groups, agree that a salary in the region of one third of that of a Senator would be agreeable, and I support that position.</P>
      <P>A retrospection plan for pension purposes should be put in place for long-standing members who have served local authorities for years for no reward. More than 40 councillors lost their seats in the last elections and they walked away with nothing, which is very sad for them and their families. Some of them had given up their work to give a full-time commitment to local government and local politics, and at the end of the day they had nothing. It is only right that we reward people who have spent many years as members of local authorities with a pension which reflects that service.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section and think it is high time the people doing tremendous work are rewarded. At the end of the day, a salary equivalent to one third of that of a Senator will not be enough on which to live. I compliment the Minister on including this provision in the Bill.</P>

I am a member of the GCCC, I have listened to its views and I endorse calls that members be well paid. Up to now most councillors have felt they have worked on the cheap. They work hard and the workload is colossal in terms of the proliferation of committees, the <Col N="1524" /> amount of documentation one must assimilate and the number of meetings one must attend. No other job equals their workload from 8 a.m. until 12 midnight. It would be an insult to offer less than £15,000. We will get the best representatives who will be committed and who will give the best. Long service should also be reflected in terms of the pension scheme and gratuity, which should be index linked.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section and congratulate the Minister on facilitating it and making it worthwhile in terms of the future of local authorities and local democracy.</P>

      <P>I support what other Senators have said about remuneration and superannuation arrangements. Very many local authority members over the years were willing to give their services on a voluntary basis in the spirit of patriotism and public service, for which they should be congratulated. However, times have changed and it is reasonable for them to expect to be adequately remunerated for the job they do. In that context I strongly recommend that the Minister introduce a mechanism whereby there is an automatic increase in salary. For example, under the Buckley report, salaries automatically increase when a particular grade in the Civil Service receives an increase. A similar system which would depoliticise the decision to increase salaries, and which would link them to an independent system, should be given serious consideration to ensure there is no major row every year, or every two or five years when there is an entitlement to an increase, but that it will be made automatically through relativity with a group in the public service, or with Senators.</P>

      <P>I will not refer to all the work done by councillors as we have already discussed that, but it is important that the work is recognised. The Minister proved to be generous before. Sometimes he comes in for criticism which is mostly ill-deserved, but I think he will prove to be generous in the long run. I ask him if possible to backdate superannuation for those who have long service on county councils. At the last local elections a number of those who went forward did not take the hand-out offered. This should be recognised in future arrangements.</P>

      <P>Like all the Senators, I welcome the broad thrust of this section. I do not agree with what seems to be an established approach by Members of this House that the salary should be linked to one third of a Senator's salary. I am inclined to go for a higher figure closer to £15,000 <Col N="1525" /> for the reason that a significant number of local authority members are already in other occupations. This salary will be taxed, and if it is a second income it is possible that they may be on the higher rate of tax. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to widening the bands and increasing the allowances.</P>
      <P>It is coincidental that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Smith, is in this House because he was the first person to establish a proper and ordered pattern of allowances in the 1994 local government Bill. At the time he received considerable and justifiable praise for it. There was some criticism about the manner in which the bands were put together. With the exception of some minor improvements in 1998 by the current Minister, the allowances for postage and telephones, which is some £1,000 per year, has not been significantly increased. The then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, did not envisage the current dramatic increase in the number of meetings when he set the minimum number to be attended in order to be eligible for the travel allowance. The creation of special policy committees, area committees and all of the attendant sub-committees that have flowed from these initiatives mean that that some local councillors attend upwards of 120 meetings a year. This is well in excess of the bands that were initiated in 1994. I strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to widening the bands to take account of the higher number of meetings that councillors have to attend and also to give significant increases in the postage and telephone allowance.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify what the position will be in regard to the current allowances given to the cathaoiarligh of local authorities? In spite of the introduction of these allowances in 1994, my understanding from a letter from the Minister of the Environment and Local Government is that the Revenue Commissioners have been looking at this allowance with a somewhat jaundiced eye. They have not yet given up the fight as to whether or not it should be taxed. Once the legislation has been passed and the Minister and his officials enter into dialogue with the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance, then this old chestnut will re-appear. It is vital that the status of the existing allowance and any future allowances that are paid to local authority members be clarified so that they will not find themselves, in spite of the best efforts of the Minister, being, not so much worse off, but being less well off than they thought they would be. Let us be honest, we are all in favour of this and everybody is waiting for it to happen.</P>

      <P>I support this section and the points that have been made regarding it by Senator Walsh. I ask the Minister and his officials to take on board the point made by Senator Burke, in reference to long-serving members who lost out on the last occasion. In the interests of serving their areas or parties they were often for<Col N="1526" /> ced to stand against their will and having lost they were left with nothing.</P>
      <P>The whole scene has changed at local authority level. Currently no employer will take on a member of a local authority as they would be missing at least two days work per week if they were members of a sub-committee. That has to be taken into consideration when looking at the salary that will be given to local representatives. We all served for many years with practically no recompense in the interests of serving our local communities.</P>
      <P>We recognise the contribution made by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith. The introduction of expenses was the first move in the right direction, and one had to attend some 80% of meetings to qualify. To ensure that there would not be abuse of the system, a similar system should pertain even when salaries are introduced.</P>
      <P>We know that the Government will be generous but the points made by Senator Walsh in regard to superannuation and so on are very important. It is not just a case of what the councillors will get, it is also about looking after them properly in the long term. We welcome this section and a large number of local authority members who have worked for so long look forward to some remuneration for their work. It is particularly timely as local councillors will have an increased workload with more meetings.</P>

      <P>This is one area where the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is hurling out on his own. He is the first Minister for the Environment and Local Government ever to come seriously to grips with finding a legislative vehicle to give payment to local authority members. The rainbow Coalition had an opportunity in the White Paper in 1996 but decided for one reason or another not to recognise that role in the way that this Government is doing. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, grasped this nettle and will proceed to have discussions following the enactment of the legislation with the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on drafting regulations.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made this evening by all sides with regard to matters relating to pensions, the issue of retrospection and other matters which I will convey to him. It is an innovative step. The Minister has effected fundamental changes in quite a number of areas, regardless of the criticism he encountered. This is one area where I expect the criticism will be close to zero. I have no idea why almost every Senator in the House wants to contribute to this debate and I certainly would not have an IQ high enough to understand why they feel it necessary to decide the amounts that should be given, particularly when the amounts picked are even lower than the Minister might have in mind.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Manager will be appointed following selection by an interview board consisting of the Cathaoirleach, a representative of IBEC, a representative of the ICTU and a member of the Local Appointments Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is straightforward. There is an imagery abroad that the Local Appointments Commission is a masonic lodge and what goes on inside it happens in an enclave.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A variation of the amendment is that a full-time chairman should be on the board to select the manager. I have always held that view. I could not envisage any board of directors of a company charged with the proper and effective running of its business countenancing handing over the appointment of the most important person in the organisation to another body without retaining some control. Despite the opposition of the county managers association, there must be provision for the involvement of the new cathaoirleach in the selection process. There are many excellent managers, but equally the LAC has made many weird appointments to senior positions in local government. I do not invite the Minister to comment on that. If I were talking to him privately, I am sure we could concur on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fundamental to local authorities that a system is put in place whereby two or three nominations would be made by an expert panel and then a successful candidate would be selected by the corporate policy group or something like that. That process must involve councillors and at a minimum the cathaoirleach who should not have an observation role in this but a participatory one. Under the LAC, an outside chairman is appointed to chair such interview boards. I would <Col N="1528" /> like to think a mechanism will be found before 2004 to involve the cathaoirleach in that important process.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) The manager shall communicate to each member of the Local Authority, by electronic mail, or otherwise, a copy of each order made by him or her.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment. I discussed it previously with the Minister in the debate on the planning Act regarding the use of modern technology. A manager should communicate to each member of the local authority, by electronic mail or otherwise, a copy of each order made by him or her. This is a new age in which information is transmitted instantly. Nearly every local authority member now has a computer that is connected to the member's local authority and if not, each member should have one by this stage and should be trained in how to use it. This is a simple request.</P>
      <P>We spoke earlier about making the affairs of local authorities more open to the public. While I did not table an amendment on this, perhaps the agenda of the next local authority meeting and the minutes of the previous one could be put on the web to enable those who wish to find out the issues in local government to have direct access to them through this system.</P>

The position was not filled, the activities of the local authority were affected and in some instances the process ran on interminably because the people concerned were involved in interviews for other positions elsewhere and they were awaiting those results. This section is weighted too much in favour of the employee. Recognition should be given to the organisation and there should be a maximum period. I cannot ask that the Bill be amended at this stage, but I would like that to be taken on board by the Department and appropriate measures put in place in the future.</P>

      <P>It is right that there should be a declaration of interests and that the listed interests in section 175 would be included in such declarations and on the public register under section 172, but I have an objection to this because of an experience I had of a newspaper deciding to publish the full declaration. I do not think it is anybody's business other than that of <Col N="1530" /> the member. I can see a reason for it if a person has infringed in some way. Then a newspaper should be entitled to take up the story.</P>
      <P>To publish the full declaration for prurient reasons or to gain readership is an abuse. I do not know how this can be dealt with but I ask that it be looked at. From talking to people in business, I know that they do not want their business activities, the shares they own etc. plastered all over the papers.

      <P>Senator Walsh has already spoken about the list of things that one must declare. It all comes down to the ethics in public office legislation where one must make declarations and be as clean as possible. Some of these things are unworkable, for example, the gift from a friend or spouse. Suppose someone said that they wanted to have a team in a golf classic and it will cost £2,000 for a team of three, that is over £500 per individual. Maybe that person will want two good players because he wants to win. He may not be friends with them, although he might become friends if they win. We very often tie ourselves in knots regarding issues like this and make it impractical or impossible. If this continues to be redefined and made too tight, it will end up that people will not join local authorities or politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Senator. The essence of this has been to make everyone more accountable and to put a more transparent system in place. The ethics have evolved in recent years. There are circumstances where it can be intrusive. I have no doubt that it restricts and discourages many would-be public representatives from getting involved in public life. There is no way around that. These are issues which came before, and were accredited by, both Houses.</P>

      <P>The measures regarding ethics in section 175 and elsewhere are intrusive but there is no other choice. If there is an onus on senior public officials to declare their interests, it flows from that that there has to be a similar onus on public representatives. It can be extremely onerous. For instance, it is difficult to determine the value of the shareholdings in unit trusts. I have development land in County Kildare and as a member of the local authority it is appropriate and essential that everyone should know that.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the disposal of land. A request was made in a joint submission that the purchase of land would be included in this. I know there is an argument, which the Minister alluded to earlier, that because councils would be purchasing land for halting sites and other locally controversial projects the council might not apply itself to making the decision. The suggestion was that the manager would be empowered to make the deal &ndash; there is obviously a certain amount of confidentiality in making the deal &ndash; and then report to the council. That was ruled out for similar reasons.</P>
      <P>This should be looked at. If the council overruled what the manager was trying to do for a good cause, the manager could appeal to the Minister and the council could make its defence. It is fundamentally flawed that one man can spend millions of pounds in payment to another individual for land without it going through the accountability and decision-making process of the local authority. That is absolutely wrong. On the other hand, if he want to spend £1,000 on something else it must be a council decision.</P>

      <P>There is a number of issues here. There needs to be a certain amount of flexibility and discretion. There are circumstances, outlined by Senator Walsh, where it is necessary for the manager to keep certain matters fairly confidential because of the nature of the transaction. There is also the question of trying to keep some control on costs and prices. The more open and transparent the system is at early stages, the greater the likelihood of prices going up. We have experienced a lot of that. The flexibility in the legislation is required, as is the goodwill between the elected members and the county manager. I am conscious of what the Senator is trying to say and of the need to try to keep some control on prices. If the knowledge of what is needed is in <Col N="1532" /> the public domain at too early a stage it can lead to an increase in prices.</P>

      <P>This is an important section and amendment. On 9 January when Dublin Corporation failed to strike a rate and did not adopt the estimates, it was threatened by the Minister with dissolution. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the case, it is an abnormally heavy penalty to dissolve the local authority in the circumstances listed in the section. It is difficult to think of any circumstance in which an elected body of people should be dissolved. It is one thing for the Minister to make regulations to dissolve a board but another for him to dissolve a body of elected public representatives. The Constitution was amended in 1998 to give constitutional recognition to local authority elections and to specify the manner in which they would be conducted.</P>
      <P>Why should it be that the one method of penalising a local authority is dissolution? There is no warning and it happens on the first occasion. It is the only penalty exercised by the Minister. Why are there not other penalties? If a local authority does not agree with something or does not adopt an estimate or whatever, why is it not the next time it does not perform that function that there is a threat of dissolution? There is no threat at present, just an absolute dissolution with possible re-election or appointment of commissioners.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> It appears the Minister is undermining that element of democracy the Bill is supposed to enhance.

However, since 1942, only four local authorities have been removed with only one removal in the past 25 years. I do not know why Senators would get excited at 9 o'clock this evening on a matter which has happened once in 25 years. It will only happen where the council wilfully fails to discharge its important duties. There are many services to be provided. There is a budget to be passed, staff to be paid and different matters to be attended to.</P>
      <P>Dissolution can only be carried out after a public inquiry. There are one or two local authorities which might have been in trouble had this provision not been in place.

      <P>I compliment the Minister on this. This is an important measure and displays his commitment to enhancing the remit and role of local government. The transfer of Temple Bar Properties to Dublin City Council is the type of devolution which should happen from all sections and Departments to local government. We should welcome it as a positive step in that direction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the measure, even though there was not very much consultation with councillors in proposing the amendment. I gather it was an initiative of the city manager. The fact that the shareholding is being transferred to Dublin City Council after the work of Temple Bar Properties Limited has been completed indicates that the local authority is not capable of supervising work of this nature, that it must be given to a limited body and only when the work has been completed is the local authority capable of administering it. Given the setting up of the city and county development boards, we should be looking far more towards the local authority being in charge of developments of this nature than transferring them at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this is of significance but I wish to point out that the explanatory memorandum refers to the Abattoirs Act, 1998, while the Bill refers to the Abattoirs Act, 1988. I would like clarification of this.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that an interdepartmental group comprising of the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is considering the role now and in the future of the local authority veterinary services. There is a school of thought which believes that this function may be transferred from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and subsumed into the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I am concerned about the wording &ldquo;devolution of powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; because they play a major role in local authority functions. I would be extremely concerned at the slightest suggestion of taking from local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government the functional role of the veterinary services and subsuming them into the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>The local authority veterinary services provide the Food Safety Authority with the necessary expertise required to ensure the concerns of consumers in regard to food safety are adhered to. We must be very careful to maintain a distinct line at that level between the provision of services in regard to consumer safety and the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which is engaged in the promotion of food and so on.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to clarify why section 246 is included in the Bill. I also ask Seanad Éireann to support my call that the local authority veterinary services remain within the control of local authorities because they have played a useful role in the area of food safety. In the past two or three months the German international food chain, Lidl, was found to be importing into this country German beef sourced in Argentina. This was discovered by local authority veterinary officers. When an explanation was sought from the company, the documentation was found to be in both German and Italian which was designed to mislead. The local authority veterinary service which plays a good role should be linked with the Department of Health and Children in order to deal with the food safety aspect. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has a separate role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Member of the House appreciates the significance of having <Col N="1536" /> clean and wholesome food and ensuring it is traceable and so on. I gather that the Bill allows for part-time appointments. However, the reality is that the restrictions on high street slaughterhouses, so to speak, are to be welcomed. The number of establishments within any county operating outside the ambit of the large export factories which come under the control of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is so small as to make it sensible that in certain circumstances it should be a part-time appointment. I note that if an arrangement is reached with another local authority, that is a matter for the Minister. That is reasonable.</P>
      <P>This section is a sensible one and reflects the modern reality. The overall control of the large export plants is vested within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which has the veterinary inspectors on the site. This is a reasonable provision in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to Senator Dardis's point which is an accurate interpretation of the provisions in the section.</P>
      <P>On Senator Callanan's point, there is an interdepartmental committee on food safety control which embraces all the interested parties throughout the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, including the Food Safety Authority. There has been one meeting so far but the committee was restricted in its earlier work because of the foot and mouth threat. It now proposes to consult with the various authorities on the best means of moving forward. Therefore, no decisions have been taken as yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue relates to urban districts and town commissioners. Schedule 6 defines these authorities. In other words, Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 6, refers to former urban districts and Part 2 of Schedule 6 refer to town commissioners. This is a very significant matter in a county which is changing rapidly as is the case in Kildare. There is Newbridge Town Commission and an adjacent urban district council in Naas. The most recent projections envisage that the population of those three towns will be more than 100,000 by 2020. It is a growth triangle and is designated as such. There is demand for Newbridge to be designated an urban council because it is as big and significant as Naas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for coherence in regard to town councils. A difference still exists in relation to the levying of rates which will persist if I am correct in my interpretation of the Bill. We are con<Col N="1537" /> fronted by serious issues which will cause a lot of problems in the future. I am open to correction but I recall there has only been one case where a town commission has been upgraded to an urban district council in the history of the State. It is very difficult to achieve. In circumstances where population is growing very rapidly and towns are becoming cities, some consideration will be needed as to how we will manage that by way of local authority.</P>

It has town commission status and it is envisaged that in the next few years the population will grow to 28,000 or 30,000. I ask the Minister to include Mullingar in an upgrade from a town commission to a UDC.</P>

We have a recent OECD report which talks about the fragmentation of services, housing, planning and roads. This is not just a matter to be resolved only in the context of a particular growing area. It must be put into some national or regional context. There will be a rating Bill to follow on over the next number of years which will look at some of the old outdated laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change in designation of what were urban districts and town commissioners which will now permit them to use the designation of &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; and &ldquo;deputy mayor&rdquo;. This is in conformity with worldwide practice and it will considerably enhance the status of the person who is privileged to be elected by his or her peers as the first citizen of the town or within the town context. However, I cannot understand why this designation or this Schedule also extends to <Col N="1538" /> county councils. It permits by resolution the change of the current practice of referring to the cathaoirleach &ndash; and I would like to think that most local authorities use the genderless Irish language rather than the gendered English version of &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. There are an increasing number of women who are taking on the role of first citizen in their county councils. I encourage the widespread use of cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will give some indication why this designation would be permitted to be extended to county councils. This means in practice that by resolution, a county council can change the existing practice of referring to a chairperson or a cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach as the mayor of the county. This is totally against the traditional practice in this country. I fully support the concept of the mayor of towns and of the former urban councils and town commissions having the right under this legislation to refer to the first citizen as &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; but I cannot understand why it has been extended to county councils. I appreciate that it is voluntary and that it is a matter entirely for the councils concerned, but I am curious to know the reasoning behind it. I do not see that it is in keeping with our traditions.</P>

It is not his brief but it is obvious that he has a great command of the subject from his previous experience. Given that he came to it cold, he has done a remarkable job. I hope the Bill will have the desired effect.

      <P>Our thanks must go to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, whose experience as an excellent Minister for the Environment has given him a very good grasp of the topic. Everybody here will agree that he represented the Government tremendously today. He was very impressive in relation to this Bill and the previous one. I also pay tribute to the Minister and his departmental staff who have worked extremely hard. As I know we are not supposed to name them, I will just mention John Cullen, Kevin Cullen and Joe Allen, all of whom have made a tremendous contribution in drafting this legislation. The Minister was extremely appreciative of their help and support. The Opposition's amendments were first class. There was unanimity in relation to some of them which I am sure the Minister will take on board as local government evolves.</P>

This does not reflect on those who were here previously on this Bill. It is always worthwhile to have someone with an in depth knowledge of an area as it makes it easier for us and the person concerned. I also compliment the staff whom I met over a number of years as this Bill was coming to fruition. I had some little input to the General Council of County Councils. I would like the Minister to transmit my regards to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and say that though there are some issues on which we cannot reach agreement, there are others on which we have. I recognise his commitment to local government.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity of thanking the staff &ndash; on this my last speech before we break &ndash; for their help throughout the year.

As Senator Walsh said, it was a pity that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who has done so much hard work with his officials, was not here to see it through. We were very fortunate however to have the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, in attendance. Their commitment to the environment portfolio has been second to none. I thank everyone for their co-operation &ndash; the Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach and staff of the House.

There must be a certain amount of satisfaction on the part of Senators Walsh and Coogan. For many years they have fought for remuneration and recognition for councillors. I recognise this but they were not the only two involved. After the recess, Senator Coogan will have to find a new topic. For almost a year a regular feature of the Order of Business was a request by the Senator to be told by the Leader of the House when the Local Government Bill would come before us. I sound a word of warning, <Col N="1541" /> in jest, that the Senator will have to find a new topic.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of praising the Leader and he praising me. I was behind the scenes and know the work Senator Cassidy put into bringing this Bill to fruition.

If the Minister was here, he would be the first to acknowledge the contribution his officials have made, not just in terms of putting this Bill through the Dáil and Seanad, but in terms of the background work that went into its various parts. It was a phenomenal amount of work and we relied, with success, on an incredible amount of experience. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for his comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the provision of a proper health service at Ennis General Hospital. I raise it because there is a complete shortage of beds at the hospital. The reduction in the number of beds at the end of the 1980s, from 128 to 88, has meant that there is a serious inadequacy in the capacity of the health service in County Clare. It is very important that the Minister and his Department look at this issue and respond to a proposal put forward by the Mid-Western Health Board to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that the range of services being provided at Ennis General Hospital is improved. The installation of a CT scanner is needed. I ask the Minister to address this matter urgently. In addition there is a need to increase <Col N="1542" /> the medical staff within the hospital in order to expand the range of services available. Ennis is the most quickly expanding town in Ireland and one of the most quickly expanding towns in Europe. It is important to put in place the services required by an expanding population.</P>
    <P>We are very disappointed that, as a neighbour of County Limerick, we are the poor relation as far as the Mid-Western Health Board is concerned. If the Minister examines the funding provided for the health board and the amount from the budget allocated to County Clare, he will see that a disproportionately large amount is retained in County Limerick. A very small proportion is provided for the health service in County Clare.</P>
    <P>We in Clare are not prepared to accept continuing regionalisation to the detriment of Ennis General Hospital. There is a real need to focus strongly on ensuring that Ennis General Hospital is upgraded. There is a need to provide the hospital with a minimum of between 130 and 140 beds, to increase the medical and nursing staff to support that complement of beds and to put in place the necessary equipment to extend and expand the range of services.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister of State to address this as a matter of urgency. For too long we have been left in no man's land between Galway and Limerick and the people of Clare are no longer prepared to accept that. It is now coming to a critical point. The inadequacy of the response from the Mid-Western Health Board to both the Oireachtas Members and various delegations is no longer acceptable. The people of Clare are no longer prepared to accept the type of treatment which has been dished out. We want action. We want the provision of a proper service and are requesting the Minister to ensure that that is delivered.</P>
    <P>We also want a proper emergency medical treatment unit and additional MT units put in place in Scariff and Kilrush, with two emergency medical technicians in each of the ambulances concerned. This is particularly necessary in Kilrush during the summer when there is a large population in the town of Kilkee &ndash; up to 20,000 people on any given weekend. The ambulance service in that area is abysmal. The people trying to work in the ambulance service in Clare are totally under resourced. There is an inadequate number of ambulances available within the county.</P>
    <P>These are basic health services matters which must be addressed. The Mid-Western Health Board has at least told us in Clare that it has made a submission to the Department to have funding provided for an increase in the number of beds at Ennis General Hospital and for an upgrading of the hospital. We want the full support of the Department in ensuring that action will be taken sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Currently a certain amount of construction works are being undertaken at the hospital. This is the result of clearance of work which was actually commenced and directed by the then Mini<Col N="1543" /> ster for Health, Deputy Noonan, in 1996. This work is not yet complete, which is totally unacceptable and unsatisfactory. I request the Minister of State to view this as a matter of urgency, to bring it to the various sections in her Department and to have the funding channelled to Clare, whether it is coming directly from the Department or from the budget of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a serious examination of the management structures within the Mid-Western Health Board. Certain aspects need to be examined, particularly the sale of Our Lady's Hospital by the Mid-Western Health Board. That hospital, which was owned by the people of Clare, was handed over to the health board in 1973 for a nominal sum and was sold on to SFADCo, which, in turn, sold a portion of it back to Clare County Council. This was a development worthy of condemnation. In addition, the health board proceeded to spend sums far in excess of what it got for Our Lady's Hospital on purchasing other facilities which would not have half the capacity. There is a real need to have these matters clearly examined and for those who proceeded down that line to give a full account of why it was done in that manner. There are questions here to be answered and I hope the Minister will have them answered.</P>
    <P>I hope she also recognises that the capital assets of the Mid-Western Health Board in the Clare area have been substantially reduced by the sale of Our Lady's Hospital. This involved a substantial loss to the State over and above what could have been secured for the property concerned.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be answered and action needs to be taken. I request the Minister of State to undertake that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this issue. I am glad of the opportunity to inform the House of the current position on Ennis General Hospital. As the Senator will be aware, the provision of services at the hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance having regard to its overall priorities for the ongoing development of services in the region in the context of available funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has received in its determination for 2001 in excess of £308 million, which includes acute hospital service development funding of approximately £3.5 million. Under the national development plan, funding has been indicated to each health board for this year and each subsequent year of the plan. My Department is responsible for the overall strategic management and co-ordination of the NDP. Responsibility for the prioritisation and delivery of projects is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in this instance. Earlier this <Col N="1544" /> year, funding of £18.688 million was indicated to the Mid-Western Health Board for each care programme for 2001, excluding information and communications technology and research. This includes a figure of £7.293 million for capital development for acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The review is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The findings of the review will be submitted to Government in the near future. The question of the need to increase overall acute hospitals bed capacity in the Mid-Western Health Board, including Ennis General Hospital, will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future development of Ennis General hospital, the Minister has approved the establishment of a project team comprising officials from the Department, the Mid-Western Health Board and Ennis General Hospital staff to prepare a detailed brief for identified priority developments at the hospital. The work of the project team is ongoing. It is intended that the project team will produce a development brief for Ennis General Hospital which will present a clear definition of the Mid-Western Health Board's requirements for the development of the hospital. A design team will be appointed following agreement on the development brief by the project team.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts there is a need to enhance existing services on the Ennis General Hospital site to provide ease of access to the public to a cost effective service. It is important that the development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals, which serve defined catchment areas and which provide high quality hospital services, as well as providing for regional hospitals where more specialised services are available and which provide a broad range of regional specialties to the region they serve.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. There is a need for the Minister for Health and Children to state the policy on the future of neo-natal care in the Rotunda Hospital and Temple Street Hospital, and to indicate the timetable and budgetary provision for the redevelopment of Temple Street Hospital and the construction of a new neo-natal unit in the Rotunda Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> The Rotunda Hospital has been waiting five or six years for a new neo-natal unit. The existing one is in very bad condition. It is overcrowded and damp and the walls are peeling. These are totally unsatisfactory conditions for anybody, never mind expectant mothers and babies. The Rotunda Hospital had hoped the upgrading of this facility would have taken place years ago. The original cost envisaged was £2.5 million but the estimate has nearly trebled in the time in which it has been waiting for approval.</P>
    <P>While the Eastern Regional Health Authority has recognised the need for the new unit and has approved of it, and the Minister for Health and Children has approved of it, unfortunately the funding has not been forthcoming. The Rotunda Hospital has made a substantial contribution and has increased that contribution in recent months. While the Department seems to think it is not getting value for money, the Minister of State must recognise that in the context of an inner city location and current tendering costs, the Department will not get any facility cheaply. The tendering in the marketplace is being conducted in the normal cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>The Rotunda is the oldest maternity hospital in the world. Unless it is refurbished, it could lose its recognition as a training hospital for paediatrics. It is overcrowded. As well as requiring a new neonatal intensive care unit, bed accommodation needs to be upgraded. These facilities are part of one package. It is urgent that the problems of the Rotunda be addressed. It is recognised as one of the best paediatric training centres in the world.</P>
    <P>With regard to Temple Street hospital, there has been an overall plan for its redevelopment and refurbishment on the transferred site of the Mater Hospital. It is still in very poor condition, as are its facilities. There was talk of the transfer of the paediatric service to Crumlin hospital on the south side of the city, which would have been totally unacceptable. The main problem is the foot dragging in terms of proceeding with the development. It seems to have been put on the long finger and there is no progress on the ground in terms of mixing mortar. People have no sense that the new hospital will arise from the inadequate old building, which was a residential type building with many outoffices and structures built over the years to provide for extra services.</P>
    <P>It is felt on the north side of the city that neither the Rotunda nor Temple Street hospital is getting the attention it deserves. They are children's hospitals providing maternity care, neonatal care and child care. Will the Minister of State give a positive indication when funding will be forthcoming from her Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to address the issues raised by Senator Costello on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children with regard to the Rotunda and Temple Street hospitals. The Senator will know that the Minister approved a capital development programme for <Col N="1546" /> the Rotunda Hospital, which includes the amalgamation of the paediatric unit and the neo-natal intensive care unit into a new centralised department. The amalgamation of services is designed to facilitate improved service delivery to patients. The next stage of the project is being overseen by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I understand from the authority that the tender reports have been received by the hospital and are currently being considered by the ERHA.</P>
      <P>The Minister looks forward to the Rotunda project proceeding as soon as possible and is confident that it will enable the hospital to meet the increasing demand for services. The project will contribute to the enhancement of maternity services on the north side of Dublin. Indicative funding of £111 million has been allocated to the ERHA in 2001 under the national development plan, £67.4 million of which has been earmarked for general hospitals.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also sought clarification regarding the timetable and budgetary provision for the redevelopment of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. I am glad to have the opportunity to outline a number of recent developments at the hospital. First, the Department approved a capital allocation of £1.6 million in 1998 for a new accident and emergency department, work on which has since been completed. The new building became operational in the first week of April 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that additional day beds were commissioned in April this year. This development has facilitated an increase in day capacity at the hospital from 14 to 19 places and will allow for medical day care activity in addition to the existing surgical workload. The total cost associated with the construction, staffing and equipment of both departments was £2.7 million. I understand that both departments are now open and functioning well. The authority also advises that the hospital proposes to extend its old day ward to accommodate a new surgical ward. This ward will have some isolation facilities, which will add to the hospitals overall capacity.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children will be visiting the hospital in the coming weeks to see at first hand the improvement in patient facilities resulting from the significant investment in the hospital infrastructure which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello will also be aware that, within five to seven years, the hospital will relocate to the Mater Hospital campus. Funding in the region of £180 million at 1999 prices has been identified in the national development plan for the redevelopment of the Mater campus, to include expanded and improved facilities for the existing Mater Hospital and the building of a new children's hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The design brief has been completed and approved by the Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The main clinical areas to be provided in the children's hospital development will include a new neo-natal ward <Col N="1547" /> providing a 20 cot in-patient service for babies in the neo-natal period, i.e., the first six weeks after birth. The neo-natal unit will operate as a distinct section within the children's in-patient department. A number of steering groups are in place to plan for the development of facilities on the new site.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> It is evident that the investment programme which I have outlined for the Rotunda and Temple Street hospitals represents tangible evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to enhancing the existing hospital infrastructure.</P>
