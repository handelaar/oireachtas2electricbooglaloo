      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minster for Public Enterprise to ensure that Irish Rail does not reduce the amount of freight carried by the company, as such a reduction could have serious implications for road users.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint extra judges to address the increasing backlog of cases in our courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to examine ways of removing the anomaly that currently exists whereby higher education grant applications are refused approval and payment of such grants when a parent of such an applicant has won prize money in the national lottery.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that I say the following on behalf of the Houses. Last Friday, the death of our very esteemed former Member and Leader of the House, Eoin Ryan senior, occurred. Eoin was born in Dublin on 12 June 1920 at a time when his father and mother were actively engaged in the War of Independence. His father, Dr. Jim Ryan, was a founder member of Fianna Fáil and attended to James Connolly at the GPO in 1916 when he was a medical student.</P>
      <P>Eoin was educated at Presentation College, Bray, and later at Mount St. Joseph's College, Roscrea. He joined the Defence Forces during the emergency years and rose to the rank of captain between 1940 and 1943. He later returned to his studies at UCD, achieving a BA in economics and diploma in public administration. He went on to study at King's Inns and was called to the bar in 1945.</P>
      <P>Throughout this time, Eoin had an intense interest in politics although, unlike his father, who was a Minister for most of his 30 years in the Dáil, Eoin was reluctant to enter full-time politics. He preferred putting his views forward in the Seanad and the governing bodies of the party, where he served for many years on the national executive and as vice president of Fianna Fáil. Eoin was first elected to Seanad Éireann in 1957, winning a seat on the Labour panel, although he switched to the Industrial and Commercial panel in 1961. He continued to serve in the Upper House until 1978. For four of these years, from 1965 to 1969, his father was also a Senator serving in the House, after his retirement from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>During his long and distinguished career in the Seanad, Eoin served on numerous committees, including the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments from 1957 to 1959, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges from 1973 to 1981, the Dáil and Seanad Legislation of European Communities from 1973 to 1977, and the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies from 1978 to 1981, of which he was chairman. He was Leader of the Seanad from 1977 to 1981 and leader of the Fianna Fáil group from 1973 to 1977. During his life he displayed qualities of honesty, integrity, wisdom, humility and wonderful self-control. He was an excellent listener and, as a Senator, he set a great example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eoin was an ardent supporter of Ireland, playing a full role in European affairs, and he represented Ireland at the Council of Europe in the 1960s. He was also active in the Irish council of the European Movement and was its chairman in the crucial pre-EEC years, 1971 to 1973. In commercial life he will always be associated with the New Ireland Assurance Company of which he was chairman for many years. Other companies of which he was a director at various times included Jefferson Smurfit, Lyons Irish Holdings, the Ulster Investment Bank, PV Doyle Hotels, <Col N="1795" /> the Smith Group and Aran Energy. He also served as Governor of the Central Bank after his retirement from politics.</P>
    <P>Eoin Ryan's dedication to Fianna Fáil and its aims throughout his long and active life is legendary. As an officer of the party and friend and adviser to many taoisigh and Ministers, his importance to the Fianna Fáil organisation was far greater than his official role. I was privileged to enjoy his friendship and advice through the years. One would wonder how Eoin could give so much time to Joan and their children, his legal career, his political career, his business responsibilities as well as Northern Ireland, Europe and South Africa. He was a true democrat who passionately believed in human dignity, which he saw as a right every citizen of the world should have and he played an active and effective part in the anti-apartheid movement. In spite of his many activities he managed to give a great deal of time to the theatre, arts and to the poet, Paddy Kavanagh.</P>
    <P>We can truthfully say of Eoin Ryan that he was a man of great integrity, honesty, compassion and humility. He was a wonderful husband and an excellent father, a truly great Irishman who left a great legacy to the House. On behalf of all Members, the Fianna Fáil group which I lead, and on my own behalf, I extend our heartfelt sympathies and deep regret to his beloved wife Joan, to whom he was married for over 50 years, his sons James, Eoin and Mark, and his daughter Derbhail, as well as his brother Dr. Seamus Ó Riain and his sister Nuala Culligan, to his daughters-in-law and all his grandchildren and friends. Go ndéanadh Dia trocaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael would like to be associated with these expressions of sympathy. Senator Eoin Ryan spent 30 years as a Member of this House, many of those as Leader. He was everything a good Senator should be. He was thoughtful, well-informed and an expert in areas such as the law, insurance and business while also knowing a great deal about most other areas of life.</P>
      <P>Eoin Ryan took the House seriously and the House took him seriously. When he spoke, people listened and his words carried weight. It could even be said that he looked like what the ideal Senator should look like. He had a sense of presence and exuded gravitas and in his calm, thoughtful and fair-minded way, he was the part of a Senator. This was all achieved without his ever becoming pompous or taking himself too seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eoin came from a great political tradition. His father was one of the most effective Ministers in all the de Valera Cabinets and made the transition without difficulty into the Lemass era. He was probably the politician most trusted by Seán Lemass and the one whose judgment Lemass <Col N="1796" /> most respected. The Ryans were a Civil War family, with members on both sides of the political divide, but there was never any sense of bitterness or any attempt to exploit Civil War memories. On the contrary, theirs was a family of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Eoin Ryan was a man of great natural courtesy and impeccable good manners. He was a man of principle who was prepared to take the stand when many others bowed with the prevailing wind. Most of all, he was a decent man who served this House and Irish politics with distinction. I extend sympathy on behalf of Fine Gael to his wife, Joan, his son Eoin who served in this House, and the rest of his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was privileged to serve in this House with Eoin Ryan for a short time. While he will be remembered as a businessman and a barrister, it is as a politician that this House remembers him today.</P>
      <P>As Senators Cassidy and Manning have said, he should be remembered as a committed Senator. I know of no instance when he stated a wish to leave this House as he had a great commitment to it and did not wish to become a Member of the other House. We should admire his commitment which manifested itself in the good work he did here, including the pioneering of legislation. He was a rare creature insofar as he was almost non-partisan, despite the fact that he was leader of his party in this House. I wish to be as complimentary as possible when I say that it was difficult to see his partisanship as Leader of the Opposition here. He considered issues on their merits and was utterly fair when making judgments. I cannot remember a political row in which the late Senator Ryan was involved as he was a cut above the rest of us, to an extent.</P>
      <P>I remember him as a businessman. Senator Cassidy referred to the fact that New Ireland Assurance was successful under his chairmanship and the company was associated with Eoin Ryan more than anyone else at that time. He was also a director of the Smurfit Group.</P>
      <P>He showed enormous political courage on occasions, for example, by being a liberal within his party at a time when liberal ideas were not fashionable. When he was leader of Fianna Fáil in this House, he showed courage by taking a different line to that of his party on certain issues, which was a difficult thing to do. The affection and respect he had in the wider community meant that he could survive such a difficulty. On behalf of the Independent Senators, I would like to be associated with the words of sympathy to Eoin Ryan's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party in the Seanad would like to express its sympathy to the wife and family of the former Senator Eoin Ryan and to be associated with the expressions of sympathy that have been made here. The Leader of the <Col N="1797" /> House has rehearsed the extensive and comprehensive career of the late Senator, as a politician during 30 years in this House and as a lawyer. Above all other Senators, the remarks I have heard about Eoin Ryan have always been complimentary.</P>
      <P>Most politicians coming to the Oireachtas for a career in politics hope to serve in the other House, but the late Senator served in this House only, which shows the respect he had for the Seanad, to which he made a fine contribution. The Ryan family, including Eoin Ryan's father and sons, were involved in many of the events of the 20th century, including the War of Independence, the Civil War and the founding of the Fianna Fáil Party. The family has had considerable participation in Irish politics, business and the arts.</P>
      <P>I have often heard people refer to Eoin Ryan's broad mindedness, independence of thought and vision. He was a true democrat and he made an enormous contribution to Irish politics. I am glad that his son, Eoin, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, is continuing that tradition. He has embarked on the national drugs strategy which is the most comprehensive drugs policy ever developed. I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I wish to be associated with the tributes expressed by Members and to record our sympathy on the death of Eoin Ryan who was a person in the first rank of political and legal life. He came from a distinguished political family. The Leader has enumerated Eoin Ryan's many achievements. It is an achievement to sit as a Member of this House for 30 years, not to mention his time as Leader of the House and his other distinctions. It must be unique for a father and son to serve together on these benches. The late Eoin Ryan must also have been proud of his son's achievement on becoming a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The late Eoin Ryan was a man of grace and courtesy and he was a liberal in the best and traditional sense of the word. He was deeply committed to democracy and the diversity of ideas. He was also committed to the right of people to articulate their differences and resolve them by democratic means. He was a man of absolute integrity. For all these reasons his family deserve our sympathy. We express our sympathy to his wife, Joan, and his children, particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to join the tributes to the late Eoin Ryan. I served with him in the Houses of the Oireachtas between 1982 and 1987, but I knew him best for his political activities in Dublin South-East where I had many friendly tussles with his son, Eoin. I use the word <Col N="1798" />&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; deliberately because the late Eoin Ryan set high standards in politics and fair play and his family was always dignified in victory and defeat.</P>
      <P>The election of his son, Eoin, to Dáil Éireann in 1992 was a great source of joy to the late Eoin Ryan. It was a privilege to have known him and I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Joan, and to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join the genuine tributes and expressions of sympathy on the death of Dr. Eoin Ryan. The name Ryan has been synonymous with politics and public life in Wexford since the foundation of the State. Eoin's father, Dr. Jim Ryan, was involved in the War of Independence, but also played a pivotal role in laying the foundations of our democracy during his various Ministries. He also had the distinction of being the last Wexford Fianna Fáil politician to hold ministerial office when he served his last term as Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The late Eoin Ryan was a man of integrity and knowledge. He was also a gentleman whose wise counsel was sought and available to many. He derived particular satisfaction from the fact that his son followed in the family tradition and he was proud to see him hold ministerial office. I extend my sympathy to his wife, Joan, and to his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business, I would like to welcome back to the House as a Member of Seanad Éireann our new Senator, M. J. Nolan, who was today successfully elected by 116 votes to 92, to take the place vacated by the former Member of this House, now Deputy Tom Hayes.</P>
      <P>Senator Nolan originally became a Member of this House on 7 May 1982, which I remember well as I also became a Member of the House on that date. He served in Dáil Éireann from the November elections of 1982 until 1997. He follows in the footsteps of his father, the late Tom Nolan, who was a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1961 to 1965. From 1965 to 1982 he was a Member of the Dáil, during which time he served as a Minister of State and as Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Nolan is very welcome back to the House. During his time in the Dáil he served in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and he has been a member of Carlow County Council since 1979, of Carlow Urban District Council from 1984 to 1987 and of the South Eastern Health Board since 1985. I warmly congratulate <Col N="1799" /> Mr. Nolan, his wife and his family on his becoming, again, a Member of the Upper House. I wish him well and look forward to working in close harmony with him for the remainder of the term of this Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 3, Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 4, earlier signature motion to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 3; No. 1, Appropriation Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, earlier signature motion to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

I congratulate Senator Nolan on his election and I know he will make a good and positive contribution to this House. I also pay tribute to Councillor Michael Fitzgerald, who was defeated in this election. However, this was just an early morning gallop as he gets ready for the real race later next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank him for his very good gallop.</P>
      <P>The Leader continues to baffle us about the Order of Business. On what is either the last or the second last day of the session &ndash; the Leader did not make us any the wiser &ndash; the business is still coming in upside-down. The item we thought would be first is now second and the things we thought would be taken tomorrow are being taken today. Maybe the Leader can clarify what is happening, in his own inimitable way. Are we sitting tomorrow, as the Whip indicated? Last week the Whip went out and, lo and behold, a Pandora's box had opened up by the end of the week as new items of business jumped out almost on the hour. It was great fun here on Friday &ndash; those Senators who had to stay very late will agree with me on that &ndash; and tempers were a bit frayed. I compliment the Leader on his consistency in keeping us all in the dark about what he really intends to do. Maybe he could clarify some of those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" />When can we expect the appointment of the single financial regulator? It was promised by the Leader and, more importantly, by the Minister for Finance, that we would have it in early 2001 and then in the middle of 2001, but still there is no sign of it. If the House sits tomorrow could the Leader explain the situation? I refer also to the waste disposal crisis. There is clearly a problem in this regard. People who are earning an honest living now find themselves in great trouble. There is confusion as nobody seems to be in charge. Wicklow County Council seems to be making a hames of the whole thing. It is very important that the Minister intervenes in order that somebody is in charge of this.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if this is the last or second last day of the session. I pay tribute to the two Irish teams which played in the final of the inaugural Celtic league, a fact which speaks very well for Irish rugby. I pay particular tribute to the men of Leinster who showed they are the true champions in a thrilling match last Saturday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome Senator M. J. Nolan to the House. I do not know how much help he received from the benches on this side of the House, but we are happy to see him here. I echo Senator Manning's view that if there has to be another Fianna Fáil Member, then Senator Nolan is as good as they have got. I wish him well in his career.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business has become a type of magical mystery tour as the actual business we do bears no relation to what we set out to do. We are back to a position which existed some years ago before we tried to create some order. This House should order its business professionally and efficiently and that is not happening at the moment. Members of the House should know what items will be discussed tomorrow and the day after and should be able to prepare their speeches accordingly. I do not know how much people value their time but they should value it. This is no way to run the House.</P>
      <P>Judging from the Order of Business announced, all Stages of two significant Bills will be taken today. It looks like there will not be any business left for tomorrow as I understand the Private Members' business scheduled for tomorrow night will not be taken. The Cathaoirleach should take an interest in the ordering of business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling, it reflects badly on all of us. It cannot be a matter of any pride that we cannot order our business in an efficient, professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, we agreed on this side to take the Appropriation Bill in one day on the condition that it would be put back on the Order of Busi<Col N="1801" /> ness following the recess in order that the issues could be discussed at length. That was a very good way of approaching it and, on that basis, we would not have any difficulty with all Stages being taken.</P>
    <P>The proposal to take all Stages of both Bills in one day is one of which nobody here was aware and we cannot be expected to respond on the hoof to that. This is not good enough. On speaking to the Leader two minutes before we came in, we heard about the latest change to the Order of Business and now find that three minutes later it is all changed again. There is no point in acting in a co-operative manner. I appeal to the Leader to try and get things done in an orderly fashion for the next term in order that we can do our business better.</P>
    <P>The issue of children with special needs and this morning's Supreme Court judgment should be ordered for discussion as the provision of secure units for children with special needs has effectively been halted. I am not arguing with the Supreme Court's decision as it is not our business to do so. Mr. Justice Peter Kelly may well have crossed the line but, even if he did so, he also pointed out a real problem which is of huge concern to parents, teachers and communities in which there are no resources or supports for children such as those on which he focused.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader insist that the Minister gives us a full outline of the current position? I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, puts plenty of pressure on the Government to get things done. Some progress is being made but this issue is just another poor reflection on the way we look after the least well-off in society. I know that is a cliché, but surely a child with special needs must receive consideration.</P>

I know him to be a gentleman and am delighted to see him here.</P>
      <P>I join in expressing dissatisfaction with the Order of Business today. It is outrageous that the Leader of the House should order business for two days and then, apparently, attempt to encapsulate it into one day as well as reordering it so that No. 1 has now become No. 3. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that No. 1 be taken as No. 1, that we take only the Second Stage of No. 3 today and that we continue on to the other Stages tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" />Senator Manning asked when the financial regulator is to be appointed. In addition, I seek clarification of the role of the financial regulator in terms of regulating the banks. Bank of Ireland has closed 40 bank branches in the last 12 months and AIB has closed, I think, 70 branches over the last three or four years. We need to ask questions about that.</P>
    <P>Could we have silence on the Independent benches, a Chathaoirligh? It seems the Independents wish to continue their discussions after their spokesperson has spoken. Senators are entitled to some peace when speaking in the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to request, once again, that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government be invited to the House in relation to a matter which has been raised on a number of occasions. We had a debate on illegal dumping last week but the situation has now reached the ludicrous stage where 200 of the hauliers involved in illegal dumping are demonstrating outside the Houses of the Oireachtas because of the closure of some of the dumps and demanding that licences be issued. Prior to this, the impression was that there were no illegal dumps and that licences had been issued. The Minister should come to the House to explain this ludicrous situation.</P>

      <P>I join in welcoming Senator Nolan; it is good to see him here. In relation to Senator Manning's reference to the celebration of Leinster's famous victory over Munster at Lansdowne Road in the Celtic Cup, we should note that Senator Nolan plays a pivotal role in parliamentary life as the parliamentary scrum half and captain of the parliamentary team.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dumping issue, it would be appropriate to come to that as soon as possible in the next session. It is important to distinguish between the dumping of rubble and soil, which is the business of the protesting lorry drivers, and the dumping of hospital waste and other illegal substances. Those are two distinct activities and the dumping of soil under licence is obviously allowed to continue. Perhaps the protesters have some merit in their argument although the method they have chosen to highlight it may not be the most appropriate and I believe the gárdaí dealt with that this morning.</P>

      <P>I have always been a model of brevity in the House, I hope. I agree with other Senators in relation to the Order of Business. The Leader of the House should recognise that the <Col N="1803" /> value of this House has been the depth of analysis of issues which takes place here. If the Order of Business is changed minute by minute, there is no opportunity for proper research which is essential to the quality of debate in the House.</P>
      <P>On another issue, it is an ironic &ndash; and probably unintended &ndash; consequence of the deregulation of taxi drivers that wheelchair accessible taxis will eventually be no longer needed. One unfortunate aspect of that is people who need wheelchair access to public transport are not getting it, despite the fact that the Taoiseach gave a personal commitment to have a top class service put in place in terms of wheelchair accessible buses. I ask that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, or the Taoiseach fulfil the commitment they made to those people over 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I sought a debate on the fishing industry in the past two weeks. I wish to convey my congratulations to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on the excellent job he did in Brussels. The Minister was swimming against the tide and, in my view, he produced a phenomenal result for an industry in which 10,000 jobs were at risk. I am extremely impressed by the way he dealt with the difficult debate on reductions in fish quotas.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to a comment made by Senator Costello, which might have been misinterpreted. The slight buzz of conversation among Independent Members earlier was because we were seeking to reach agreement on supporting the excellent amendment to the Order of Business. Having reached that agreement, I have been directed by my colleagues to second the motion and I do so formally now.</P>
      <P>I was surprised not to receive a proposed wording for the Government's Private Members' time motion for tomorrow. We on this side of the House are usually chivvied if we do not submit the wording for such motions on the Thursday of the previous week. However, the Government seems to be able to sail along and produce motions whenever it feels like doing so.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make provision for a further debate on Sellafield? People are worried about dumping, but I am particularly concerned about the emanations from Sellafield. I ask the Leader to congratulate the Minister on having secured the support of the Norwegians. Our concerns are particularly appropriate at this point because of the failure of the British Government to notify the Irish authorities of a series of shutdowns of nuclear reactors. We are statutorily entitled to be notified about such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on the implications of the Supreme Court decision referring to Mr. Justice Peter Kelly's ruling on <Col N="1804" /> dysfunctional children? If nothing else, this House of the Oireachtas in particular should monitor the legislative and constitutional measures under which children are protected.</P>
    <P>A number of my constituents have inquired about the availability of the report of the constitutional review committee from 1996 &ndash; document No. TN 2632. This is not available from the Government Publications Sales Office or from the Taoiseach's office, which has responsibility for printing it. Would it be possible for the Leader to use his influence to discover how people who wish to examine this document can procure a copy of it?</P>

      <P>Since we will be sitting tomorrow, will the Leader make time available for an urgent debate on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations? A vote took place at the UN last week which went 12 to one in favour of sending United Nations monitors to the Middle East to oversee what is happening between the Palestinians and the Israelis. As a result of a veto by one member state, the vote was nullified. It is time this House debated the fact that the five permanent members of the Security Council are allowed to veto the wishes of the other 130 member states which voted Ireland on to the council.</P>

If the United States had not used its veto, I could guarantee that Great Britain, which did not vote, would have done so. I request an urgent debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that we are entering the Christmas season, the international community must be asked to help the people of Palestine &ndash; Israelis and Palestinians &ndash; to achieve peace. The gap between Sharon and shalom must be bridged.</P>

    <P>The recently published Irish Official Development Assistance Aid Programme 2001 &ndash; A Millennium Decision for Ireland &ndash; which deals with Ireland achieving the targets set by the United <Col N="1805" /> Nations states that we spent £201 million on development assistance in 2001. It is estimated that next year, we will spend £1 million a day in development assistance, yet that report has never been discussed in this House. If the Irish taxpayer is spending&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>Will the Leader also request the Taoiseach to come to this House tomorrow to explain the appointment by him of an international consultant as his aviation consultant and to outline whether he has confidence in the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke and Aer Rianta in aviation matters?

      <P>Will the Leader provide time early in the new year for a debate on education in view of the fact that the results being achieved in mathematics are so bad? Some people blame teachers and the fact that students are working part-time while others &ndash; I, too, believe this to be the cause &ndash; say it is because students are over-indulging in alcohol. I pay tribute to the teachers who worked long hours to ensure students did not suffer as a result of their recent strike action.</P>
      <P>I am also seeking a debate on the report received this morning from the Irish Insurance Federation which states that we will have to pay further increases as a result of the atrocities in New York. The insurance industry has, in the past, cited the fact that we have a small insurance base as the reason for our high insurance costs. We are now being told we will have to subsidise what happened in New York which is ridiculous. We must debate this issue. The report also points out that every insured person in this country pays an extra £120 to cover the cost of those not insured.</P>

    <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business. We should never take all <Col N="1806" /> Stages of a Bill in one day. If we are to make exceptions, it should be on the basis outlined by Senator O'Toole &ndash; that we agree to do so on condition that a debate on the matter takes place in the new year. It is wrong to change things at the last minute.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the statement by the deputy leader of Europol, the European police force, that a number of countries such as Macedonia and Kosovo plan to adopt the euro as their main official currency and the resultant dangers of counterfeiting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to raise the issue of the low grades being achieved in mathematics. We recently introduced legislation dealing with the implications of part-time work on students. Mathematics, as we all know, is a hierarchical subject. Students must be in school to receive the various gradings at different stages of mathematics. Coupled with that, there is a conflicting newspaper report which details the shortage of science teachers while at the same time suggesting that there is an excess of science teachers but no vacancies for them. Perhaps, in the new year, those two debates on teachers and mathematics and the impact on our schools and access to third level education could be taken together.</P>

Once again, we are in a situation where our function, which is to give as much consideration as possible to additional legislation, is being rapidly undermined. I protest again at that, although I am not sure that my protest is falling on anything but deaf ears. To use the phrase of the day, we are reduced to being the &ldquo;muck-shifters&rdquo; of the legislative process. I ask the Leader of the House to adopt a new year's resolution, even if we only have a few months in the new year, to treat this House with the respect it deserves.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House this week as a matter of urgency to tell Members how he intends to respond to what is a growing crisis in waste management and to outline if he is prepared to give the necessary resources to local authorities and to the EPA to deal with what is serious problem country-wide.</P>

      <P>I sought a debate following the initial leaks from the Ombudsman's report in Northern Ireland. It was agreed that we would wait for that debate until the report was published. It has been published and it is of great concern to me that certain interests are endeavouring to rubbish it by setting out to demonise a fine lady. They are doing so because Nuala O'Loan did her job without fear or favour in the interests of all on this island. It is worrying &ndash; her office has pointed this out &ndash; because, by being <Col N="1807" /> fingered in this manner, her life is being put in danger. We saw this happen in the case of solicitors Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. As democrats, we must be seen to defend, support and insulate those who give public service.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent by the State on litigation relating to vulnerable children.

      <P>I echo the sentiments of my colleagues in the context of the election to the House of our friend and colleague, Senator Nolan. I have a personal interest in his election in that both our late fathers, former Senator and Minister, Tom Nolan, and Senator Joe Mooney, came into the House on the same day in 1961. As a result, I have had a long and friendly association with the Nolan family. I am particularly happy that the sons of the next generation now serve together in this House.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate on a matter contained in a reply issued last week by the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, <Col N="1809" /> Deputy O'Donoghue. He stated that, of more than 2,700 asylum seekers granted asylum in the past 12 months, in excess of 2,300 were allowed to stay as a direct result of their babies being born here. We are unique in Europe and, I believe, the wider democratic world in this respect. In passing the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, we agreed to extend the concept of nationality to all those born on the island of Ireland in the context of extending an olive branch to our Unionist brethren on the other part of the island. Neither the people who proposed the Agreement nor the people who voted for it envisaged that, as a consequence of its endorsement, people from any part of the world who have no interest in and possibly no knowledge of Ireland, its culture and social mores can enter the country and deliberately have a baby<b></b>in order to obtain nationality, not only for themselves but also for their extended family. I choose my words very carefully because in this politically correct world one is immediately branded when one says anything about asylum seekers. I raise the specific issue of the concept of nationality arising from the Good Friday Agreement. The House has a role to play in discussing the matter.</P>

I also support Senator Keogh and Senator O'Toole in the call to the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to the House to debate this issue. That would give us an opportunity to compliment the Minister of State on increasing the number of places from 17 to 93 and on her commitment to further increase the number to 120, the total number of places required by the middle of next year. Such a debate would be useful and an acknowledgement of the Minister's excellent work in this area.</P>
      <P>I join in the welcome to my neighbour, Senator M. J. Nolan. Both his father and his brother Enda have given tremendous service in public life in the south east region, and I know Senator Nolan will continue to do that in his new position.</P>

      <P>I support the call from Senator Farrell and Senator Coghlan for a debate on the insurance industry, which could cover all aspects of the industry. Senator Manning congratulated Leinster on winning the rugby match last Saturday. I did not attend the match but I believe Leinster deserved to win, and I congratulate them. Will the Fine Gael Members say what is their preferred date for playing the all-Ireland next year, and if they will be playing in Croke Park?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of thanking you, a Chathaoirligh, and my fellow Members of the Seanad for the warm welcome extended to me. I also thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her staff for the efficient and courteous manner in which she conducted the by-election. I compliment Michael Fitzgerald on his campaign. It is obvious that my time in the Seanad will be short-lived, but I hope during that time I can make some contribution to the workings of the House.</P>
      <P>I also join the other Members of the House in their expressions of condolences to the family of the late Eoin Ryan. I had the pleasure of serving in this House with the late Eoin Ryan for a short period in 1982. He was an example to all of us and set standards to which all parliamentarians should aspire.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning and many other Senators made various points on the Social Welfare Bill and the Appropriation Bill. As Members will see, there is an early signature motion on the Order Paper in regard to the Appropriation Bill and I understood I had an agreement with the Leader of the main Opposition party to review progress at 6.30 p.m., if that is agreeable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning and Coghlan raised the question of a single financial regulator. Those <Col N="1812" /> points can be made to the Minister when he comes to the House to deal with the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning, Costello and Dardis called for a debate on waste, particularly soil waste and waste from building sites, with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government present. We are all concerned about the plight of those people who felt so strongly about this issue that they had to deliver a letter personally to the Department. Everyone was pleased with the way the Garda handled the situation today and that traffic in Dublin was not disrupted. I am glad that a common sense agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Norris, Keogh and Jim Walsh called for a debate on the Supreme Court decision on children with special needs. I welcome the 93 places now available and the 41 new places to be made available next year. I will request the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to come into the House early in the next session for a lengthy debate on that issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello's call for a debate on banking. Senator Coogan called for a debate on wheelchair accessible taxis, with my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, present. I will do everything possible to facilitate such a debate and I avail of this opportunity, on behalf of all Members of the House, to send best wishes to the Minister on her unfortunate accident.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Donovan, Chambers and Bonner offered their congratulations to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources on the difficult negotiations which took place at the highest level during a marathon session of the Council. Senator O'Donovan mentioned the ten thousands jobs. Those of us who know how important the fishing industry is certainly breathed a sigh of relief when we heard the outcome today. I will allow time for this issue to be debated in the House after the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris and Ross again called for a debate on Sellafield. All sides of the House are in total agreement on this issue and I have no difficulty leaving time for a debate. On the matter Senator Ross requested, I understood all these publications were in the Library. If they are not, the Senator can let me know after the Order of Business and I will endeavour to have the Library staff address the Senator's requirements. Senator Lanigan called for a debate on the role of the Security Council and particularly developments overseas. I have already given a commitment to have a debate in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn and other Senators referred to the recent murders. The appalling circumstances in which people have met their deaths are mind-boggling. It is hard to imagine this is happening in our country and I can only congratulate the Garda on being so attentive and alert. The extreme circumstances in which these incidents have taken place are very difficult, especially coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" />Senator Taylor-Quinn called for a debate on the aviation industry and I have no difficulty leaving time for a debate. Senators Farrell, Coghlan and Rory Kiely called for a debate on the insurance industry. I have already said I intend to have an all day debate on this issue at the earliest opportunity after the Christmas recess. I also take on board Senator Farrell's call in relation to alcohol abuse. It is a timely time of the year to raise this issue. No matter how little one drinks, I would advocate that one should not drive.</P>
    <P>I will certainly pass on Senator Quinn's views on the statement by the deputy leader of Europol and on counterfeiting to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the Minister for Finance as well. I understand from the Central Bank that the coming into force of the euro currency on 1 January 2002 lessens the potential for counterfeiting. I will certainly take on board the points the Senator has made and will pass them on to the Ministers. It would be timely to have a debate on how the changeover is progressing, perhaps during the second week of February after the 9 February deadline.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on education matters, including teachers and the shortage of science teachers, in particular. I have no <Col N="1814" /> difficulty leaving time for a debate. Senators Ó Murchú and Bonner called for a debate on the ombudsman's report. I have agreed that this will take place at the earliest opportunity. Senator Chambers called for a debate on broadband investment. That could be raised on the Appropriation Bill, 2001, as it is a financial matter. The Senator may be able to update us on the present position in relation to this matter. Senator Mooney called for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on asylum seekers and the concept of neutrality. I have no difficulty leaving time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>On No. 1, the Appropriation Bill, 2001, it is customary that we pass all Stages of that Bill. I assure Senators that in the first week back after the Christmas recess, I will allocate time for Senators who wish to make a contribution on this issue.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first of two Bills I intend to bring before the Seanad to implement the £850 million social welfare package announced in last week's budget. This is the second year running in which the social welfare package amounts to £850 million and the first time in many a year in which it has exceeded the income tax package. In the five years since this <Col N="1815" /> Government came into office Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. The Government has delivered on its commitment to ensure that social welfare recipients have benefited from economic growth.</P>
      <P>Over the lifetime of the Government contributory old age pensioners received increases of almost 50%, compared to 10% under the rainbow coalition. Non-contributory pensioners got increases of no less than 56% compared to 11% under the previous Government. Child benefit was increased by over £60 per month per child for the first two children compared to only £10 under the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The Government has massively increased spending on social welfare from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion in 2002 &ndash; an increase of almost two-thirds in just five years and over 20% on 2001. That gives the lie to some of the criticism from lobby groups.</P>
      <P>The recent budget has been welcomed by a wide range of groups. The Combat Poverty Agency commended the policy direction of increasing welfare payments in line with earnings. People with Disabilities in Ireland, the representative body for people with disabilities, welcomed the improvements for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitments in our action programme and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, all old age pensions have been increased by more than the rate of earnings growth over the period. When we came into office, the old age contributory pension stood at only 28% of average industrial earnings. We have increased that in each year to 31% in 2002 &ndash; well on the way towards the target set by the national pensions policy initiative of 34%.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses commitments set out in the Government Action Programme aimed at building an inclusive society, improves the living standards of everyone on social welfare and fulfils our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. With increases ranging from 9% to 11.8%, people dependent on social welfare will see real and significant increases in their incomes next year.</P>
      <P>These are the key provisions of the Bill. While in Government we have given pensioners weekly increases of £5, £6, £7 and £10 in both 2001 and 2002 compared to increases of between £1.50 and £3 given by the previous Government. The increases provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this Bill more than delivers on our commitments. Last year I gave a commitment to increase the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 to the full old age contributory pension. The special increase provided for in section 2 of the Bill of £12.04 will bring the new rate to £114.04, within £2 of the full old age contributory rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. <Col N="1816" /> Over the period from 1997, general social welfare increases have increased well ahead of inflation and indeed ahead of increases in gross average industrial earnings. In this budget, despite the difficult times caused by the world economic downturn and the resulting pressure on resources, we are giving very significant increases to those who are least well off. The increases being provided this year for people on the lowest payments are greater than last year and indeed much earlier. We are providing a general increase of £8 per week in respect of social welfare customers under pension and retirement age. In per centage terms, the £8 increase is between 7.4% to 9.4%, depending on the payment concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are providing a special increase of £9.56 for those on the lowest rates of social welfare rates, supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance. This brings the lowest social welfare rate up to £93.60. This increase of £9.56 is consistent with the majority recommendation of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group, which was established under the PPF and reported last September.</P>
    <P>There is considerable merit in raising all payments, as and when this is possible, with the objective of ensuring a reasonable relationship in due course between the average living standards in the community and the level of social welfare payments. Not only have we made substantial progress towards the PPF target of £100 for lowest social welfare payments, we have almost reached this target this year and I have no doubt that the target will be exceeded in the remaining budget in the period of the programme. This Bill is fully in keeping with our commitments under the PPF.</P>
    <P>We are also providing further very significant increases of £10 per week for qualified adults aged 66 and over and of pensioners with lesser amounts for those on reduced payments, a pensioner couple on a full social welfare payment will therefore get an increase of £20 per week. The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 has been increased from 72% of the old age contributory pension in 1997 to 77% in 2002 and now represents 85% of the old age non-contributory pension. As I promised last year this will be increased in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate to benefit women in the home who do not qualify for the contributory pension.</P>
    <P>There are also substantial increases for qualified adults under age 66. The qualified adult allowances are being increased by £8 and £9 per week. For example, a couple on the lowest rate of payment of supplementary welfare allowance will get a total increase of £17.50, bringing their weekly payment up to £155.60. If they have children obviously they will also benefit from the substantial increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" />It has been a source of some complaint in the past that social welfare increases used to come into effect later than budget tax changes. We were berated on all sides of the House that increases were announced in December and not delivered until much later &ndash; the second week in June when we came to office. It was also a source of complaint that tax changes came in much earlier than social welfare increases. Last year I brought forward the implementation date of social welfare weekly rate increases to the start of the tax year, 6 April. Now that the tax year has moved to the start of January I am bringing forward the budget increases in weekly rates of payment to 1 January. This means that in 2002 social welfare clients will be paid their increase for the full 52 weeks of the year compared to 29 weeks when we came into office in 1997. In the case of an old age contributory pensioner, this is equivalent to an extra 4.4% annual increase, quite apart from the actual increases.</P>
    <P>People receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases immediately in the first week of January. In the case of people on longer term payments such as pensions, because of the time needed to print and distribute pension books, pensioners will receive their increases somewhat later. Some 210,000 people, mainly widows and widowers, one parent families, invalidity pensioners and persons receiving carer's allowance, will receive a lump sum payment for six weeks of the budget increases on 14 February, obviously backdated to 1 January. This will be included in their new order books effective from that date. For example, a widow on a contributory pension over 66 years of age will receive a backdated payment of £72.24, &euro;92. A further 393,000 recipients, mainly old age and retirement pensioners and disability allowance recipients, who are due to get their new order books in April, will receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks' advance payment. For example, a pensioner couple over age 66 will receive a lump sum payment of £260 or &euro;330 on 15 February.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from January next by amounts ranging from £34.22 to £35.09 for all families on FIS. This will lead to a net gain of £16 per week in the average FIS family payment; I must correct that &ndash; it is &euro;34.22 to &euro;35.09. The increased payments will be paid in the first week in January.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for an increase in the earnings ceiling for employees' social insurance contributions and the income ceiling for payment of optional contributions. Section 6 provides for a reduction of 1.25% in the employers' higher rate of social insurance contribution. The earnings ceiling is being increased in line with projected increases in average industrial earnings in 2002, by 8% from £28,250 to &euro;38,740, <Col N="1818" /> with effect from the start of the income tax year in January. The employers' higher rate of social insurance contribution is being reduced from 11.3% to 10.05% from the beginning of March 2002, at a cost of &euro;237 million in 2002 and &euro;347 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a one-off transfer of &euro;635 million in the 2002 financial year from the social insurance fund to the central fund of the Exchequer. This measure has provoked considerable debate over the past week. It is important to remind Senators that the fund was established in 1953 and that for all but the past five of the intervening 48 years, income contributed to the fund was insufficient to meet demand. During the first 43 years of the fund's existence, the shortfall in income has been met from Exchequer funds; in other words, by the taxpayer. Since 1997, income to the social insurance fund has exceeded spending, a remarkable turnaround resulting from the Government's prudent management of the economy. The social insurance fund now enjoys an accumulated surplus of over £1 billion. It is projected that the surplus will increase cumulatively to about £3 billion in 2004. It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that part of this surplus should be returned to the source from which earlier shortfalls were met. The value in real terms of transfers in the opposite direction since 1953 exceeds £11 billion.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package in this year's budget equals last year's record amount of £850 million. As the public finances are so tight, it would not have been possible, if the transfer from the fund had not occurred, to achieve this level of spending without recourse to borrowing. In spite of the transfer, the social insurance fund will remain in a very healthy financial position. After the changes in this year's budget are taken into account, the projected accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of 2002 will be more than £960 million. It would not make any sense to have this money in the bank while borrowing to pay for social welfare improvements. Despite comments in the other House, the social insurance fund is the people's money and it is right that we should give it back to them. I do not doubt that the House agrees that the Government's prudent and successful management of the economy over the past four years has provided the foundation upon which the healthy state of the social insurance fund rests. It is appropriate that the taxpayer, who has contributed to much to the fund since its inception, should benefit in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, the first of two instalments, clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to looking after the needs of the elderly, widowed persons, carers, the unemployed and others who are dependent on our social welfare system. The Bill ensures that the £850 million package provided for in the budget <Col N="1819" /> will be directed to those most in need. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to the House. He seems to have become somewhat smug, however, as he praised himself far too much in his speech. I admit there are many good elements in this Bill. During the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, the Minister asked Deputy McGrath to clarify the nature of the yellow documents from which he was reading. I have two parts of the same important document. I am irritated when politicians claim, as the Minister has today, that they have displayed &ldquo;prudent management&rdquo; of the economy. One would hope that all Governments would be able to manage in a prudent manner.</P>
      <P>The fact that I will refer to statistics supplied by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul should not be seen as an indication that I am unable to compose my own script. The statistics are relevant as a contrast to the arguments made by the Minister in favour of his good budget. Ireland has the highest GDP growth rate of 28 OECD countries and has the best total productivity growth factor country in the EU. It is the second best of 20 OECD countries in terms of having a regulatory environment conducive to competitiveness and ranks fourth in the EU in terms of Government debt as a percentage of GDP. Ireland is fifth among 19 OECD countries for return of capital in the business sector and barriers to trade and investment here are lower than in 25 OECD countries. These statistics are worthy of merit and I congratulate all concerned.</P>
      <P>Equality and fairness are governing factors when determining social welfare policy and Ireland's statistics in this regard are unimpressive. Life expectancy and Government consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP are lower in Ireland than in any other EU country. Ireland ranks 14th of 20 OECD countries in terms of its literacy rates, according to the latest report. The cornerstone of my contribution today, however, is the fact that income equality in Ireland is better than only three other EU countries. Ireland is one of the worst countries in the European Union in terms of child poverty and is the sixth worst country in the EU in terms of early school leaving. I appreciate that the Minister's remit does not encompass all the issues I have raised but the reduction of social inadequacy must be addressed as the gap between those who have benefited from Ireland's economic success and those who have not is not being lessened by the Bill's provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many commentators have claimed that the Bill means the less well off will not benefit as much as those who are better-off and I believe there is a level of truth behind such a claim. I welcome the fact that social welfare recipients will receive higher benefits and allowances as a result of this <Col N="1820" /> Bill, but the increases do not match the growth in the salaries of income earners. I appreciate that the Minister is not a miracle worker, as I have said on each occasion that he has come to this House during the last four years.</P>

      <P>This is the fifth time the Minister and I have admired each other's policies. I admit that he has done exceptionally well and is an excellent Minister. Nobody is beyond reproach, however, as Solomon is not always Solomon and even Homer nods.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the effects of the Minister's social welfare proposals on the people I represent. The Minister is probably sick of hearing about the sale of the family silver, or the raid on the social insurance fund, but he is paid to get tired listening to us. I admire whoever wrote the Minister's speech, but I doubt it was the Minister. I began to wonder if the man or woman who wrote the speech is on the same planet as the rest of us when I saw the way in which such a negative was turned into a positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains my confusion, as I was not sure if the comments related to the matter about which I have been concerned. The Minister has been a little naughty in that, last year, he congratulated himself and pointed out my faulty thinking with regard to the invasion of any kind of fund which was for the nation's good. He stated that could never be done. We spoke in particular about pension increases and the Minister was most emphatic. He obviously had a change of heart or mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister saw the month of May looming &ndash; the World Cup takes place in June &ndash; and decided to deliver an election special. I like the way the provision is worded in the Minister's speech to the effect that the fund was in deficit for so long, but now it is so plentiful that we almost have to throw it away. That is dazzling, but I am not dazzled by it. This is not, and never could be, the right thing to do. If I was disbursing funds, I would bear in mind that this is the Social Welfare Bill and not a Bill designed for the aggrandisement of any political party. The Bill is supposed to help those who cannot help themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £8 increase per week is not sufficient; a £10 increase would have been better. Who makes the final decisions on who gets the money? Ministers and officials work for their own Departments, but the £8 provision is miserable. I thought the Minister was going to lower the eligibility threshold <Col N="1821" /> for the medical card. The drugs refund scheme is excellent, but £42 per month is a lot of money for those who are just about surviving on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the budget's provisions regarding rental accommodation which will release more units onto the market. However, the Government should hang its head in shame given the lack of consideration shown to those on lower incomes, particularly those who cannot obtain housing. I am older than the Minister, but I have never seen housing waiting lists as long as they are now. The last time such a situation prevailed was in the late 1950s when the Dublin housing action group was so frustrated that it took to the streets. Unfortunately, we are almost back to that situation. I do not approve of rent control, but I do not see how we can stand over a situation where rents for the most miserable accommodation are being increased without any intervention on the part of the Government. There must be some way of providing basic shelter for people. The Government has introduced many excellent innovations, but it will be remembered and damned for its handling of housing waiting lists and the homeless.</P>
    <P>I will not speak about the issue of health as I do not wish to stray from the legislation. However, I have never seen so many people unable to buy their own homes, or to rent or obtain a house from a local authority. Something is radically wrong. The Minister knows that the social housing provision never materialised. It was a dream which did not become a reality and shows no signs of doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the miserable £2 increase in the fuel allowance. The term &ldquo;fuel allowance&rdquo; seems archaic in this day and age when most homes have some form of heating system. Unfortunately, in my local authority area only 20% of houses built over the past 20 years have central heating. For many elderly people their only source of heat is an open fire. It is reprehensible that we have not provided such people with the money to install central heating. The Minister will be aware of a Norwegian study on the effects of heating on the health of the elderly. Every year about 2,000 elderly people die during cold weather, many because they have been so cold for so long. It is untenable that nothing has been done for such people.</P>
    <P>The section of the Minister's speech dealing with the timing of payments was beautifully phrased in that it made a delay seem beneficial. However, the only people who will benefit from this provision are those in the Government as the small lump sum payments will be made before the election in May. Some of the payments will be made on St. Valentine's Day which is appropriate as the Minister will be a combination of Santa Claus and St. Valentine. I do not know about St. Valentine, but we are still trying to figure out whether Santa Claus is a dream.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" />The budget could have done more for widows. It would not cost much to include them in the free telephone and television licence schemes. This should have been done in what was an embracing budget. The Minister was generous in several areas, but not regarding the basic issues. He has been genuinely busy and hard working over the past number of years, but some of us represent areas of deprivation or marginalisation in which more people are in receipt of the £8 per week increase than increased tax credits. The Minister does not seem to realise how bad the situation is. We see so much success that we have forgotten that some social welfare payments are shamefully inadequate. The Minister has not increased these payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have a high regard for each other. He only annoys me when he tries to pretend that he is whiter than white, when we all know there is a little grey in everyone. This is not a whiter than white Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows what I mean and that is the main thing. We have not served those whom the Department is supposed to serve. We have adequately served some of them, but we have grossly neglected others. I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the £2 per week increase in the fuel allowance. Such an increase would just about pay for ten cigarettes. I am not suggesting that smoking is good for one, as obviously it is not. However, £2 per week is not adequate.</P>
      <P>The problem is that in some cases houses are divided in the middle by a hallway so that the bedroom is always freezing due to its lack of a fireplace. Ridiculously, the water has boiled over and the boiler has burst. The only way the water can be kept hot is by keeping the fire going all day. It is ludicrous and I wish the Minister would take another look and find some way of dealing with it, although I appreciate that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, would actually allocate the money. Some people find it impossible to keep the fire going all day; £2 per week is just not good enough. There is no heart in that offer. It is disgracefully minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has shown thought and generosity in some of his other proposals and I wish that he would reconsider only these two issues. He will be pleased to hear that I have not put down any amendments. It is not that the exercise would be futile but that foregone conclusions sometimes change one's reasons for doing things. I am appalled that the family silver has been raided and I hope it will be replaced next year, although I doubt it. I hope the Minister has no intention of doing this more than once. I also ask the Minister <Col N="1823" /> to bring the £8 up to £10 for the sector I mentioned and to review the meagre fuel allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, although I understand that he may have to leave to attend a ministerial meeting. I welcome the Bill. It is a significant day, as we are bringing part of our Social Welfare Bill through the House before the end of the year due to the commencement of increased social welfare payments on 1 January, five months earlier than has previously occurred. The reason is that the Government and the Minister made a commitment to that effect. The lateness of the payment of social welfare changes announced in the budget has previously been a bone of contention. The reason we are here the week before Christmas to deal with this Bill is to ensure that the people most in need will receive their payments earlier than ever before. I welcome that change.</P>
      <P>By this time next week Santa Claus will have arrived, but Senator Ridge is old enough to be realistic. She should realise that Santa's sack can only carry so much. Every child in the country could write down a list of what he would like. We all did, but my mother always said that if I were too greedy he would bring me nothing. As an adult one must be realistic and recognise that although Santa Claus is always very good, regardless of what he brings, we all have our wishes and one must accept that change has come about that is better for most people in society.</P>
      <P>To be fair, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Government, despite the negativity prior to the budget, the slowdown in the economy and all the rumours, predictions and speculation from the media, have delivered to the less well off. We received a budget of £850 million, the same as last year. We must give credit where credit is due. There will always be people who may not gain to the same extent as others, but we have to acknowledge what has been done.</P>
      <P>I have congratulated the Government for moving the payments forward but I must also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his Department officials for the information which has been relayed to the general public over recent months about the transition to the euro. It is a difficult time in the Department, with payments being moved forward to 1 January and the euro changeover being dealt with at the same time. A remarkable job has been done by the Minister and the Department to ensure that people are well informed about their entitlements and that they receive them from 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ridge produced the age-old argument that the budget was unjust and that inequality is being extended. Some of the comments in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> after the budget finished off the myth about inequality. I am sure <Col N="1824" /> everybody would agree that this newspaper has not always been favourable to the Government. It was stated, on 12 December, that &ldquo;the impact of Budget 2002 is highly progressive, favouring those with the lowest incomes.&rdquo;  Another section of the same article stated that &ldquo;the balance of the budgetary package is tilted firmly away from tax reduction towards increased benefits, including child benefit.&rdquo;  A statement like that from <i>The Irish Times</i> is a backhanded compliment to the Government, which I accept wholeheartedly on its behalf.</P>
    <P>With this Bill the Government fulfils the commitment it made when it came into office and which was reinforced through An Action Programme for the Millennium and through the PPF. Before coming into office Fianna Fáil's manifesto indicated that it would deliver £100 a week to old age pensioners. This has now been far exceeded. In 1997, when we came into office, the contributory old age pension stood at only 28% of the average industrial wage. We have increased that, in 2002, to 31%, which is well on the way to the target of 34% set by the national pension policy initiative.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge referred to the free schemes and the extension of fuel allowance. I do not know who the Senator has been talking to but I know that at the other end of the country, rural people are looking forward to the increase in fuel allowance and appreciate its extension over recent years, particularly in last year's budget. It is often argued that the fuel allowance should be increased continuously but one must decide whether it is better to increase the fuel allowance or the old age pension. I feel that the general public and old age pensioners appreciate more the increase in their pensions throughout the year and see it as an added bonus to have the fuel allowance throughout the winter months. It is my opinion that this is the general feeling of the people I speak to.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the old age pension but it is worth repeating that since taking office the Government has, in its five budgets, increased the pension by £5, £6, £7 and £10 and once again by £10 this year. It does not take a mathematician to work out that this is £38 in five budgets compared to £7 in the three budgets of the rainbow coalition. I leave it to Senator Ridge to calculate that one for herself.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the spin the Opposition wish to put on it, the pensioners appreciate what has been done for them by the Government over the past four years. I referred very briefly to the free schemes and the fuel allowance. These type of improvements are often glossed over but to the elderly person they are extremely important and they are appreciated. I am glad we have been able to fulfil our commitment and hope the elderly will continue to be provided for as they deserve. Not only have old age pensioners benefited over the past four years but all other social welfare recipi<Col N="1825" /> ents have had increases well ahead of inflation. This year alone, the weekly increase of £8 is being provided for social welfare recipients under 66. Senator Ridge referred to inequality and quoted from a document we all received, but she did not indicate the initiatives which were welcomed by CORI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>She said the lack of distribution of resources was neither fair nor just. I take umbrage with that. I have no difficulty with the increases gained by social welfare recipients. This document gives an example of a working couple earning £40,000 and the increases they received as opposed to the increases a social welfare recipient received. I am not earning £40,000 but I do not have a problem with couples who are working hard and getting increases. I would not like to be part of a Government which says to working people that they deserve to get less than someone on social welfare. We all know the problems faced by people trying to look after families and purchase their own homes. They have to work hard and should be entitled to the same increases as somebody who does not work. When one looks at the figures the increases may not seem very good for people on social welfare but relatively speaking the increases in this budget were geared towards the less well-off.</P>
      <P>I regard the focus on the social insurance fund as a joke. Coming into the Christmas period we get into the silly season, but the debate on this in the other House capped all. What is the big deal. The social insurance fund has been in existence for 48 years and for the past five years what has been put into it has far exceeded spending. I am not a financial wizard but if I have a great deal of savings and require some money&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the savings of the taxpayers and it is to those people that the money is being returned, not to me. If one has a billion pounds surplus and money is required in the short-term what is the difficulty in borrowing that money? It is not for paying me or my like and goes back to the individuals from whom the money was originally taken. That would be a prudent management of finances and correspondingly is prudent management of the economy. This is basic mathematics. It is not a matter of stealing, it is delivering back to the people money that is in excess and I do not see the problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear any logical or coherent arguments in the other House from the Opposition as regards what we should have done. We would not have been able to deliver this level of spending to social welfare recipients who we all say are the most in need. We are in general agreement that <Col N="1826" /> the more we can deliver to them the better, but we would not have been able to do that if we had not borrowed from this surplus fund. Can someone tell me where to get money for social welfare increases without borrowing? There is a limit to what is in the bottom of Santa Claus' sack.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what Senator O'Meara will say about the social insurance fund. I have yet to hear a logical explanation from the Opposition as to where they would get the money to provide all their proposed increases.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge spoke of an extra £2 in fuel allowances and this, that and the other. I would love to do that and more but one has to be realistic. We must decide where the money will come from. She criticised the Minister for using money from the social insurance fund but did not say where he should have got it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>People appreciate what has been done for them in recent years. The most deserving have been looked after.</P>
      <P>We all focus on the major changes that take place in the social welfare Bill, but every year the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern has introduced a small change which has benefited a huge number of people and this year has been no different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the special increase for qualified adult dependants over 66. It is important to recognise the contribution of these people, mainly women, who have spent their lives working in the home. Another small adjustment was referred to by Senator Ridge who spoke of the anomalies that exist within the widows' pensions as opposed to other types. The Minister gave a special increase to widows and widowers over 66 years up to £114 this year. This sum is only £2 short of the full contributory pension and I welcome this fact. At last we are giving recognition to widows and I am sure people under 66 years will be dealt with in years to come. It does not affect a huge number of people but, for those who are left with dependent children following the loss of a partner, it eases the financial burden. <Col N="1827" /> While we tend to look at the wider scope of the Bill, it is often the specifics that mean most to individuals. I welcome the fact that these individuals have been taken care of in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Pre-budget commentators did not anticipate any significant improvements for social welfare recipients. As a result of the social welfare improvements, social welfare expenditure in 2002 will be two thirds greater than in 1997. Increases for those dependent on social welfare will now be payable more than five months earlier than when the Government took office.</P>
    <P>Improvements sometimes tend to be overlooked. The amount of media attention generated is one significant yardstick by which a budget can be measured. I believe the recent budget got less media attention than most previous ones. It was practically forgotten within a very short time, perhaps, partly, because George Lee of RTÉ was not jumping up and down excitedly on the six o'clock news bulletin. There was relatively little media discussion on it after the Thursday evening and I interpret that as an indication of success. If media people had found something controversial to take issue with, they would have done so. It is an excellent tribute to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government collectively that this budget and the social welfare provisions attracted so little media attention.</P>

      <P>I join in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. I also thank Senator Leonard for her incisive media analysis in relation to the budget. Effectively, media coverage of the budget has become a one day wonder &ndash; it is purely a matter of habit at this stage. Regardless of whether it generates political controversy, the media just moves on to the next story the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill is, in effect, the main part of the recent budget. Unfortunately, the late and unexpected change to the Order of Business led me to change the main thrust of my remarks this afternoon. I intended to table more than one amendment to the Bill which, I expected, we would discuss tomorrow. Since that is not now to be, I have concentrated on the issue of the social welfare fund which I did not intend to address <Col N="1828" /> until Committee Stage but, in the light of Senator Leonard's remarks, I may as well deal with it now.</P>
    <P>I posed the question as to why the Minister for Finance needed to raid the social welfare fund to the extent of &euro;600 million. He needed to raid the social welfare fund as well as the Central Bank fund and others because of the way he has totally screwed up his management of the economy. Within the short period of a year, he has gone from what was a healthy financial position to a disastrous financial position. The country now faces a very serious and difficult period of economic management . Undoubtedly, the next Government will be a different Government, not led by the Fianna Fáil Party. People have seen how the Government has completely mismanaged the nation's finances and its prosperity. While the media may not have paid much attention beyond budget day and its immediate aftermath, the people know full well that the raiding of the social insurance fund actually represents stealing. It involved raiding a fund specifically put there by workers and employers to shore up the position of people, particularly in hard times.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said the insurance fund has only been in surplus for the last five years. That is stating the obvious, but why is that the case? It is only in recent years that we have had significant prosperity in this country and the Minister should stop claiming it as his own. This Government knows it inherited a sound, well-managed financial position which, as it also knows, it has squandered and blown to an unbelievable extent. The Minister for Finance has attempted to mask the situation with his amazing magical tricks in the budget. I will return to the social welfare fund on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The budget and this Bill represent another missed opportunity in a long line of missed opportunities. It is particularly tragic for people living with the day to day reality of poverty in this country. They are the people we meet in our clinics and elsewhere in the course of our work as politicians and they are to be found in every community in Ireland. They cannot survive on the social welfare income they are given by the Government and Christmas, for them, is a source of great anxiety, stress and pressure. Despite all that has been said about social welfare increases, the fact remains that Ireland spends proportionately less on social welfare than it ever did before. Total State expenditure on social welfare, as a percentage of gross national product, has declined from 9.9% in 1997 to 9.1% in 1998, 8.4% in 1999 and 7.9% in 2000 to an estimated 7.5% this year. As the country's prosperity has increased, as the Government has had more to spend on social welfare, it has chosen to spend less. That just about sums up the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" />Senator Leonard said that people who are at work should not feel that people on social welfare are getting more than they should. That reflects the views of the Tánaiste that we should be a work driven economy and, to a large extent, we should be such an economy. We should welcome a situation in which more people are at work because the best counter to poverty is to have a job. However, we have a moral responsibility to take care of those who are not at work, for whatever reason, those who cannot work and who are vulnerable in our society and those who are elderly or widowed. The fact is that we are not doing that adequately. The scandalous aspect is that, for the first time ever, we could have done so in the last five years but the Government did not do it, for its own reasons, which I suspect were ideologically driven. We have passed up the best opportunity ever to eradicate poverty once and for all in this country.</P>
    <P>On this matter, the justice commission of the Conference of Religious in Ireland concluded:</P>
    <P>The poorest people in Irish society have been betrayed in Budget 2001. With sufficient resources available to enable it to eliminate income poverty from both adults and children the Government chose instead to give these resources in superabundance to those who were already better off. As a result this Government's legacy after four budgets is to have substantially widened the rich-poor gap which was already the worst in the EU.</P>
    <P>The facts, therefore, speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that some aspects of the Social Welfare Bill are not to be welcomed. I welcome the increase in child benefit for what I hope it is, namely, a measure designed to deal with the matter of child poverty. However, I suspect it is the view of the Government that it is designed to somehow meet the increasing needs of those parents at every level of society &ndash; not just those who are totally dependent on social welfare &ndash; who are obliged to avail of child care. If that is the aim of the increase, it appears quite miserly because it will do nothing to help meet the increasing costs working couples who incur in providing adequate child care for their offspring. The other side of the equation is &ndash; this again shows how the Government has failed in respect of child care &ndash; that the issue of provision has not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter on more than one occasion in the House. Despite the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated millions of pounds to assist with the provision of child care across the country, this simply has not happened. That money has become stuck in the works somewhere. I recently made inquiries at local level about the child care committees and was informed, I am sure absolutely correctly, that structures have to be established. In other words, we must first build <Col N="1830" /> the framework to deliver child care before we can even contemplate spending the money that has been provided. This issue has been managed in the most ham-fisted way and I wonder why parents do not become worked up about it. I suppose the reason is that they are so busy working, in the first instance, and, in the second, they know they cannot rely on the Government to deliver what is should be delivering, namely, good quality, accessible and affordable child care.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to raise in the context of this Second Stage debate but I am more anxious to proceed to Committee Stage. I will, therefore, keep my remarks to a minimum. However, I do wish to refer to two groups, one of which is carers. The sense of disappointment among carers at the inadequacy of the Government's response in the budget is monumental. Everyone in the House pays lip service to the work done by carers. We meet these people and we know many of them. One of the best things to happen in recent years was that carers became organised and began to demand their rights. However, we have a long way to go in terms of meeting their real needs. Carers are one of the most neglected groups in society in the sense that we pay lip service to the wonderful work they do but then do not do enough to meet their needs by providing tangible resources.</P>
    <P>I recently met a man who is involved with the Centre for Independent Living in Thurles. He specifically asked me to raise with the Minister the question of the money allocated for personal assistants by the Government in the budget. The individual in question understands that this money will be spent through the health boards and he has asked that it be ring-fenced in order to guarantee that it will only be spent on personal assistants. This will ensure that the <i>raison d'être</i> behind providing the funding will be met. I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the issue of widows and widowers. I am sure other Senators have had experiences similar to mine. Perhaps it is because I am a woman, but I am approached on a worryingly regular basis by widows, in particular, who inform me in graphic terms that they cannot manage to live on the pension payments they receive. One woman told me that she has to depend on a family member to buy her a winter coat from time to time because she is so badly off for money. She cannot keep a car on the road under any circumstances and is dependent on her neighbours to bring her to town to do her shopping. This woman is living a life of poverty. Widows are one of the most forgotten groups in society. Again, we pay great lip service to them but do nothing to meet their real needs.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the fact that social welfare payments are not inflation-proof. The Minister could have taken action in that regard in the legislation had he chosen to do so. The rate of <Col N="1831" /> inflation last year was so high that it effectively neutralised the impact or benefit of the increases provided in budget 2001. It appears this may also happen in 2002. I have stated on more than one occasion that a person on a fixed social welfare income will have to make provision throughout the year to pay waste collection charges, for example. People, particularly pensioners, find that charges of this nature eat into the annual increases they receive. While we may not be able to take action in this regard, we could certainly deal in the legislation with the impact of inflation on the increases being provided. Unless we do so, we will not be taking a realistic approach to tackling the effects of inflation and ensuring &ndash; I am sure this would be the desire of the Minister and the Government &ndash; that the increases have the required impact.</P>
    <P>In budget coverage on the radio and television, various Ministers and spokespersons refer to percentage increases here and percentage increases there. A percentage increase on a small amount of money does not add up to much. In my opinion we are again contemplating, not only in the budget but also in the Social Welfare Bill, another in a long series of missed opportunities. It is probably appropriate that we are debating the Bill in the week before Christmas, a time of unprecedented spending in the economy which, according to some commentators, is possibly due to the euro changeover. However, it is also a time of extraordinary pressure for people, particularly single parents, due to the poverty in which they live. The reality of these people's day to day lives is that they are extremely dependent on the few pounds they receive through their fuel allowance which helps them to stay warm during cold weather. The diets of these individuals and their children are probably inadequate. They inevitably fall into debt at this time of year because they want to ensure that their children enjoy Christmas and are then obliged to face the reality of doing so in the new year.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government in respect of how it has managed our prosperity can only be condemned for the reasons I have outlined &ndash; I will continue to concentrate on them on Committee Stage &ndash; in relation to the social fund, but also because, despite having a unique opportunity to do so, it has failed not only to tackle or eliminate poverty but has also widened the gap between rich and poor.</P>

This sum matches the record increases provided last year. It also includes £326 million for child benefit increases, as promised by the Minister last December. Others promise, we deliver. The current Minister has proven that he is a man of his word. The £850 million provided will bring up the Department's spend next year to over £7.4 billion &ndash; an increase of over 20% on 2001 and an increase of almost two-thirds on the 1997 spend. The Opposition when in Government were in a position to do all the things they say we should have done, yet they did nothing and it took them three years to do exactly that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that those on the lower end of the social scale are looked after. This budget and the previous four budgets have done exactly that.</P>
      <P>There is a £10 increase for people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of the full rate of qualified adult allowances with proportionate increases for those on reduced payments. That is very important. We are again talking about the most vulnerable section of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the current Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs were ever to be called Santa Claus it would be with full justification. He might not wear the garb or the beard of Santa but his <Col N="1833" /> action in bringing forward by 23 weeks social welfare payments is another ground breaking decision. Child benefit payments have been increased by £25 each for the first and second child and a £30 each for the third and all subsequent children. We all know the budget is not about child benefit increases but increases in this area is one of the fairest and most effective ways of eliminating child poverty. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for children aged 12 years or over has been increased from £78 to £94. That again is a very welcome development. The income limit for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is to be increased from £5 to £39.</P>
    <P>What has been said pertaining to the pension fund can be compared to the piggy bank and who is more entitled to raid the piggy bank than those who fund it. This Government funded the piggy bank and has prepared for the rainy days. Our national finances were in a serious state when the Opposition was in Government. The Minister for Finance took the correct action when he made his very courageous decision. I wonder what CORI had to say &ndash; I appreciate it, and every other organisation, is entitled to comment on this &ndash; when old age pensioners received an increase of £1.80.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which goes a long way towards looking after those in society who are unable to look after themselves. Some of the relevant points from the health strategy are: community groups will be funded to facilitate volunteers in providing support services such as shopping, visiting and transport for older people; the introduction of a respite care grant for dependent older persons. This will cover two weeks respite care per annum; the detailed arrangements for the operation of this scheme will be worked out by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and reform of the operation of existing schemes, including the carer's allowance to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children will begin work immediately with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to develop detailed proposals for the new scheme with a view to its introduction as soon as possible; a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people will be developed by the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Public Enterprise and a major study of the funding of long-term care for older people led by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is nearing completion. Policy proposals will be prepared following publication of the consultancy report. Funding options to meet the cost of care will be outlined for public debate prior to the preparation of legislation; development of care management approaches involving packages of care <Col N="1834" /> for groups with multiple needs &ndash; again, a very welcome development; appointment of key workers in the context of care planning, in particular, dependent older people such as those on the margins of home and residential care and children with disabilities and recruitment of a multi-disciplinary range of staff to support the development of primary care services such as domiciliary care and day and respite services.</P>
    <P>This is very welcome legislation. The Minister has gone a long way towards improving things. I respect the right of Members on the other side to criticise and oppose &ndash; that is their job &ndash; but it is important to note that old bones are cold bones. The increase in the free fuel allowance, taken in tandem with the expansion of the scheme last year by a further three weeks has been welcomed by all the old people to whom I have spoken.</P>
    <P>This year's budget has been a brave one and this Bill contains many significant proposals. This is chapter five of book number one. Let us wait for the next chapter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. One of the greatest barometers of the test of a Government, particularly in the changed economic climate, is the manner in which it has distributed its resources, recognises the changes that have taken within the economic progress of the country and the wealth that has been made and recognises the relationship it has with its social partnership in providing a balanced ordered community from the point of view of sharing the wealth of the national cake.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on his performance in this Government, in particular the huge allocations made in the two most recent budgets. Those changes recognise the needs of and change in the wealth of the nation and the prosperity of a large section of our nation who, in turn, have made accumulated wealth available to the State, thereby putting the Government in the position of recognising the changed needs of our society. The increases in social welfare across the board are to be welcomed as a positive recognition by the Government of the needs of our people and an attempt to address those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the Government's recognition of social change. The emphasis on direct payments to the family recognises what CORI and the social partners have said on directly supporting <Col N="1835" /> the family. This is supported by the increase in child benefit, which gets the money to where it is needed at the core of the family, be they single parent or two parent families. Those with children will benefit.</P>
    <P>There has been a recognition of the changing needs of elderly people. There is co-ordination between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health service in the provision of community homes, capital projects, support for private development of community homes and community welfare hospitals. The concept of caring for the elderly has changed throughout the peripheral parts of Ireland, and new measures have been put in place. In our most peripheral regions, there are community support groups, good transport facilities and new community homes now in place. There is great interaction between the elderly and their families and more is being done by the Government in this area and extra money is provided for it in the budget.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's decision to use money from the social insurance fund on the basis that it has been provided from the wealth of the nation and is there to support the needs of the nation. I compliment the Minister for Finance on his approach to financing the budget and providing the necessary funding. This Government and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs have supported this area in a very positive way, recognising the inflation rate and the growth within the sector and addressing its needs. This budget of £850 million follows on from a similar provision in the previous year. It continues to provide for this sector within a growing economy.</P>
    <P>The budget was based on growth within the economy. There are now 170,000 extra people working within the economic structures of the State, providing extra capital. That welcome growth enables the economy to create more wealth which can be distributed among the sectors which need it most. A recent OECD report pointed to the positive Government move to support children and families. It also said that there was a greater need for single mothers to participate in the economic structure. The Government is prepared to take such issues on board. However, there is a responsibility on both Government and people in this area. If we are to support all the children in the State by providing care facilities, while also caring for our growing elderly population, there is a huge responsibility on the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and on the Department of Health and Children to prepare for the substantial changes to come in our economy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on providing funding for the Centre for Independent Living. I support Senator O'Meara's proposal that money provided for personal assistance to people in the care of the Centre for Independent Living should not <Col N="1836" /> be distributed in any other way. It should not be spent on other projects but should be used where it was intended. One has only to look at today's Public Accounts Committee meeting which dealt with hospital treatment for the elderly, where money was taken out of one pot and put into another&mdash;</P>

I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House, on the provisions within the Bill, on the recognition of the needs of people in the State, on the adjustments made to address recent changes and to provide for future needs in a changed economic environment, and for the Government's attempt to redistribute the wealth of the State in a reasonable, fair and balanced way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their remarks in relation to the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, and on the recent budget changes. I cannot agree with everything that has been said on the opposite side of the House but I take in good spirit the remarks made.</P>
      <P>I want to pick up on a number of issues. Senator Ridge referred to the £2 increase in the fuel allowance. This will be payable from next January to almost 300,000 people, mainly pensioners, at a cost of £17.5 million. That is a substantial amount of money. As I have said previously in both Houses, one of the last decisions I had to make in relation to the budget package was whether I would put money into the free fuel allowance or give that money in the general weekly increase. Over the last four years, I have decided that it is better to give people a sum of money for 52 weeks of a year rather than give an extra pound or two on free fuel for 29 weeks of the year, or 26 weeks of the year as it was until I increased the number of weeks by three last year. The more the free fuel allowance increases, the worse the sudden death is when that money is lost to claimants in mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might extend the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons I said last year in both Houses that I thought it was best to extend the free fuel allowance for the 52 weeks of each year and subsume it into overall payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost is £17.5 million, which is a substantial amount of money. I would have liked to increase it by more but I was conscious of the sudden death issue, and I wanted to keep the increases in the personal rates &ndash; of £8, and £10 per week for pensioners &ndash; equal to the amounts that were <Col N="1837" /> received last year. This year, I gave in to the pressure to do something in relation to the free fuel allowance. However, that was tempered by the knowledge that the more the allowance is increased, the worse the sudden death is when the payment is lost. A policy decision needs to be made on whether we go down the route of increasing the allowance exponentially over a number of years or subsume it into the overall yearly payments, which might be best. Fuel difficulties will not be solved by a free fuel allowance but, as Senator Ridge said, by the implementation of resources in relation to proper central heating and other fuel sources in the houses of the elderly and less well-off.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the adequacy of social welfare payments. Under the PPF, we are subject to the benchmarking and indexation group. It reported some time back and said the majority of the group considered that the target of 27% of gross average industrial earnings on a current year basis for the lowest social welfare payments was not an unreasonable policy, and that should be achieved between now and 2007. If we were to do that between now and 2007, it would imply an increase for the lowest social welfare rates of £9.70 per year over the six-year period. We have increased it by £9.56 this year, which is just slightly under the target figure.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer to the recent article by the ESRI which appeared in one of the daily newspapers after the budget. It stated that the budget was highly progressive and favoured people on low incomes, whether one examined it from a tax or social welfare point of view. Equally, the Combat Poverty Agency complimented the Government both this year and last year on policy direction, particularly on child benefit increases.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge referred to the transfer of £500 million from the social insurance fund. It is important to ask some very basic questions. On the one hand, she argues that £8 is not sufficient and the amount should be increased, while on the other she opposes taking money from the social insurance fund. Where should the money come from? In the Dáil, I specifically asked the Opposition how it would have funded the record £850 million package. Would it have increased borrowings? Would it have decided against borrowing or taking money from the social insurance fund? In other words, would it have returned to the position of making increases in the order of £1.50 and £3, which was the case just five years ago? Would it have borrowed money when there is money in the bank? As this money was collected from the people, it belongs to them, not the Government.</P>
    <P>The economy is in such a healthy state that it would be ludicrous to leave a huge sum of money in a fund and give less to people on social welfare or, alternatively, to borrow in order to increase social welfare payments. In our domestic circum<Col N="1838" /> stances none of us would borrow money for day to day spending if we had money on deposit in a bank. We would use whatever money we had. It is not as if the picture into the future is not rosy. Given the increase in employment, from 1 million ten years ago to 1.8 million now, this step is absolutely logical. The ongoing actuarial review of the social insurance fund indicates that the fund will be in the black for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Had the Government not allocated money to the national pensions fund, I would partly accept the argument against using money from the social insurance fund. There is £5.5 billion in the pension reserve fund this year. We will put 1% of GDP into it next year, which is an extra £800 million, giving a total of £6.3 billion. In addition, there will still be £1 billion in the social insurance fund. It is not logical to borrow to fund payment increases or reduce benefits when this money is available.</P>
    <P>I have already told Labour Deputies, who espouse the redistribution of wealth and resources, that giving some of the social insurance fund to less well-off people is, in a way, redistributing resources. We would have been criticised had we not reduced taxes or the national debt, both of which we cut substantially. The Government's action on the social insurance fund was logical. Deputy Quinn said of one economist, Moore McDowell, that one could not describe him as left wing. Equally, one could not describe Colm Rapple as a right wing economist, yet he has been exhorting us to use the fund in recent years, the latest occasion being just a few days before the budget. It was illogical, he said, that the Government was being advised to borrow when there was money in the fund. Three days before the budget the Labour Party argued that the Government should use for day to day spending the 1% of GDP, a sum of £815 million, which it put into the pensions fund. Now, it criticises us for using a smaller amount from the social insurance fund. The argument defies logic.</P>
    <P>When the Government came to office, it was roundly criticised by all parties for announcing payment increases in the budget and not delivering them until months later as well as for delivering social welfare increases later than tax increases. This year, for the first time, we have aligned tax cuts and social welfare increases. In one fell swoop we are bringing them forward a further three months at a cost of £80 million to the taxpayer. People on social welfare, in other words, will benefit again. I estimate that this will amount to an extra 4% or 5% in annual income on top of the social welfare increases. People will see the justification for the measure.</P>
    <P>As regards how the increases are implemented, I offered the committee on social affairs the opportunity to question my officials. The procedure we adopted is the only way it can be done. Some people argued we should have introduced the budget in October. Even if we had, we could <Col N="1839" /> not have delivered the payments in a different way and we could have been accused of announcing increases months before implementation. The Government decided it would try to keep the gap between announcement and delivery as short as possible and I assure the House this is the case.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the widening of the poverty gap. In times of economic boom the issue of relative income becomes more topical because the more people in work, the more income at their disposal. At a time of recession, relative income becomes less of an issue. As I said in the Dáil, if one of ten residents of a small village in the midlands earning £10,000 wins the lotto, the issue of relative income disparity becomes more critical, but does not mean that the people on £10,000 are poorer than before the lotto win. It is superficial to judge everything in relative terms. Again, I refer to the ESRI research which showed that the impact of the 2002 budget is highly progressive, favouring those people on the lowest social welfare rates. In its last budgets the Government pegged social welfare increases to increases in earnings. This has not happened for many years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the effects of inflation on the level of social welfare increases, both this year and last year. In 2001 the main rates of social welfare increased by an average of 10.3% in long-term assistance payments and 10.4% in old age pensions, both of which are well ahead of the rate of inflation which was running at 3.8% at the end of November. There were real increases this year and as the projected level of inflation in 2002 is 4.2%, the real increases in social welfare next year range from 8.4% to 11.8%. We are running at twice the rate of inflation with regard to the lowest payments and three times the rate of inflation with regard to higher payments.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara and others referred to carers. I do not accept that carers were left out of the budget. One only has to examine the Government's record, particularly in the last four budgets, to see the changes that have been made in the carer's allowance since its inception. The expenditure on carer's allowance has increased by 184%, from £36 million when I came to office to approximately £130 million. The numbers in receipt of carer's allowance when I came to office were 9,200, and they will increase to approximately 23,000 or 25,000 as a result of the budget changes. A total of 3,400 extra carers will receive the carer's allowance as a result of the changes, and another 2,300 already in receipt of carer's allowance will get an increased amount on their payment. The total cost of these changes is £12.62 million.</P>
    <P>As Minister I instituted the respite care grant, which started off at £200. It will now increase to £500, which is very much welcomed by all recipients of carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" />On the broader issue, there is only so much one can do about a social welfare payment which is designed for people on low income. The carer's allowance was not designed to repay people for taking care of a relation or a loved one. We should examine the broader issue of caring, in the context of the health strategy, taking into account the health board subvention, the home help service and the carer's allowance and devise a more integrated scheme to deal with the issue of caring into the future. It is important &ndash; and this is the view of the Minister for Health and Children also &ndash; to plan for the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to child care. The Government made the decision last year to invest £1 billion over a three year period in the area of child benefit. There was a lengthy debate on the way to address the issue of child care and we came down on the side of giving money to mothers to assist them, in whatever circumstances they find themselves, in their child rearing responsibilities. Providing a universal, tax free payment, which generally goes to the female of a union, is the most beneficial means and addresses all the arguments about giving tax relief. Because of the major tax changes, approximately 30% of the population do not pay tax so any tax changes would be of no use to those people on low income. Equally, tax changes probably would not benefit women who stay at home and who have an equal entitlement to assistance in terms of their child rearing responsibilities. It is illustrative to see how much child benefit has increased under the stewardship of this Government, from £398 million in 1997 to approximately £1.2 billion this year. Obviously that figure will increase by another £300 million or so, regardless of which party is in Government after the next election, which will bring it to £1.5 billion.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered most of the issues raised by Senators. I thank them for their comments and look forward to the later Stages of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 refers to the raiding of the social insurance fund. The section states: &ldquo;In the financial year 2002, an amount of &euro;635 million shall be paid out of the Fund into the Exchequer&rdquo;. With those two lines, a fundamental alteration in the social fund has been made. Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Minister <Col N="1841" /> for Social Welfare is charged with the management and control of the current account of the social fund while the Minister for Finance has the task of managing the investment account of the fund, but sums payable out of the fund shall be paid out of the current account of that fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to this issue and a number of speakers, particularly on the Government side of the House, mentioned that raiding the fund to the tune of &euro;635 million is, in effect, giving people's money back to them. That appears to be a logical statement, but is it? The Bill states that the money shall be paid out of the fund into the Exchequer. The Exchequer manages funding across a number of projects and a range of spending headings, including social welfare, pensions and so on, but it also covers capital spending. We do not have any indication, beyond the fact that the &euro;635 million will go into the Exchequer, where that money will be spent and, therefore, we do not know that it will go directly back to the people who paid into it. The argument will be made, and I can almost hear it, that it will go in some way to the benefit of the people who paid into it, but will it go towards the major roads building projects or the building of hospitals? Will it go back only to social welfare recipients or to workers and employers? It is going into the Exchequer so we do not know precisely where it will end up.</P>
      <P>I challenge the fundamental principle of taking this money in the first place and, in making the argument, I want to quote the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, David Begg, who, on the night of the budget, when the news of the raiding of the fund was announced, reminded television viewers that the fund had been established and supported by workers and employers through their contributions for nearly 50 years. He said it provides a range of basic benefits for which workers have paid through their social insurance contributions and that by diverting the &euro;635 million from the fund into the Exchequer, the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs have attacked a key principle of social solidarity and undermined its basic purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &euro;1.8 billion surplus to which the Minister referred offers a unique opportunity to enhance existing benefits and introduce new ones. The Minister and other speakers talked about using this money rather than borrowing. Because the fund is designed for this purpose, it could have been used in the past and, if it had not been raided, could have been used in the future to introduce PRSI funded parental leave benefit within the scope of the social insurance fund. Another suggestion made by my colleague and our spokesperson in the Dáil, Deputy Broughan, was to introduce an improvement in the homemaker's scheme. There are many other benefits, such as the contributory old age, widow's and widower's pensions, which could have been <Col N="1842" /> enhanced further by using the surplus in the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The raiding of the fund is a very serious matter and one over which we could not stand. Now that the principle has been established in this legislation, we have no guarantee that this Administration, particularly if its ambition to get re-elected is realised, will not do it again. Has the fundamental principle of the fund been completely changed? I would suggest it has and that this is possibly not a once-off move. If this Government gets a chance, it will do this again.</P>

      <P>In my Second Stage response, I referred to the issue of the social insurance fund. In the other House, I challenged the Opposition to say how it would fund the record social welfare package. It would be naive of anyone to think that a package of the size of £850 million would have been achieved but for the fact the fund was there with substantial surplus moneys.</P>
      <P>Again I ask the Opposition how it would have funded a £850 million package. In the other House, I could not get an answer from either of the main Opposition parties. The Labour Party spokesperson said he would cut corporation tax &ndash; that was his personal preference. I challenged him on that and said I could guarantee that if his party was in Government after the next election, it would not touch the issue of corporation tax because it set up the negotiations to reduce corporation tax to 12.5% over a certain period before it left office. It was left to this Government to finish the negotiations and to implement the reduction which was more difficult. It was wrong and misleading of Deputy Broughan &ndash; he is not here to defend himself, but I am just saying what he said &ndash; to claim he would reduce corporation tax to fund this package.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael took a day or so to come back with an answer which I referred to as the flexible friend approach. It said it would not put as much money into the pension reserve fund when times were bad but that when times were good, it would put in probably more than we have said we would put in &ndash; the 1% &ndash; which, in effect, means that it will probably never put enough money into the pension reserve fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the Government could be criticised if nothing else had been done. Everyone has said the Government was great to put aside the pension reserve fund and, of course, it was. As I said before, there will be a sum of £6.3 billion in the pension reserve fund next year. If that is not social solidarity, I do not know what social solidarity is. This is money which, as Senator O'Meara said, has been contributed by employees and employers over the years. In a <Col N="1843" /> way, it is redistributing some of the wealth of our country to the people who are less well off.</P>
    <P>While people might have a problem with the principle, what really matters to people are their individual circumstances. I do not think the public is too interested in the principle of the social insurance fund, particularly if it is in surplus. I say that because for years it was in deficit and the taxpayer subvented it. There is an absolute guarantee that no matter what, the social insurance fund will be subvented by the taxpayer. Given the increase in growth and our demographics whereby we have the youngest population in Europe which will be in its most productive phase for at least the next 15 years, if not longer, all the indications are that the social insurance fund will be in fairly massive cumulative surplus over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say it could have been used for this, that and the other. The inference has been that no new schemes have been brought in. That is incorrect. Prudently, we have brought in new schemes, such as the carer's benefit, the free schemes for people in receipt of the carer's allowance, the over 56 special pension and the pre-1953 special pension, all of which would be, by and large, funded by the existing social insurance fund. That is to name but a few of the improvements which have been made at the same time as managing a surplus in the social insurance fund and, obviously, looking at the issue of the cumulative surplus as we move forward over the next few years. As I said earlier, there will be somewhere in the region of £3 billion in the social insurance fund in just two years time.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies in the other House tried to indicate that there was a divide between myself <Col N="1844" /> and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. There was no divide and we were <i>ad idem</i> in this regard that it is nonsensical for the Government to borrow while having a substantial amount of money in surplus in what is, in effect, the people's fund. The alternative is to give people less money out of the resources available at budget time and to go back to a stage where people would get social welfare increases of the order of £1.50 to £3. We were not going to go back to that. As far as we are concerned, we have incrementally built up the increases to such an extent that old age pensioners have received 50% extra in their payment since this Government came into office. Even people on the lower rates have received increases somewhere in the region of 30% and over.</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit are absolutely astronomical. People have very short memories and we would not have been able to give £325 million for the second year in a row if the issue of the social insurance fund had not been written into the equation. We would have had to go back to the situation five years ago where mothers with three children got an increase of £7 per month instead of £80 per month this year and next year. Mothers got £1 for the first two children and £5 for the third child as opposed to £25 for the first two children and £30 for the third child this year and next year.</P>
    <P>As far as this Government is concerned, what it has done in this Bill and generally in relation to the budget is prudent management of the resources available. We are very proud to bring forward a budget which, for two years in a row, contains the largest social welfare budget in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this budget allocation which is due to his determination and skill. I am a Member for 19 years and have never before seen a Minister receive such an allocation. It is all about getting allocations in the budget. Many years ago the communications sector received a very poor allocation every year until Deputy Albert Reynolds took office and used his influence. Deputy Ahern has also used his influence to get the largest allocation in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>The children's allowance is a godsend to the poorer section of society and I never thought I would see the day when the allocation would be £50 and £60 per child over two years. I saw families reared on those allocations per quarter, never mind per month, in the past. I wish to be associated with the kind words of congratulation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Many years ago I said of Deputy John Bruton, who went on to lead Fine Gael and become Taoiseach, that he was a person who would go places when he became a Minister, even though he was on the opposite side of the House. I say the same today. Deputy Dermot Ahern is a dynamic, young, energetic and enthusiastic Minister, who will go much further in years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Appropriation Bill, 2001. As Senators are aware, the core purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services, both current and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which <Col N="1847" /> were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill appropriates the net sum of £20,362,692,000 to the various services listed in the Schedule for the year ending 31 December 2001. The amounts in the Bill that relate to the year 2001 are in Irish pounds. In euro the equivalent net sum is &euro;25,855,285,000. The total amount comprises the original net Estimates of £19,692,504,000 as approved by the Dáil prior to the summer recess and net Supplementary Estimates totalling £670,188,000 which have been approved by the Dáil in recent weeks. The Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts, amounting to £1,802,444,000 as appropriations-in-aid of the services listed in the Schedule. As I have mentioned, the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which are included in the Schedule to the Appropriation Bill have been approved by the Dáil. This Bill seeks to give formal legal effect to those Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill also provides an opportunity to review the budgetary and economic position. My ministerial colleague, Deputy Cullen, spoke in this House recently in the context of the changed economic environment in which the recent budget was framed. A slow down from the exceptionally high rates of growth in recent years was perhaps inevitable, given the significant reduction in unemployment and the rise in overall labour force participation. Domestic and international events have meant the rate of slow down has been much more drastic than expected. The signs of economic slow down in the United States were further worsened by the sad events of September 11. Domestically, the impact of restrictions put in place as a result of the threat of foot and mouth disease can be seen, especially in the food, tourism and transport sectors.</P>
      <P>While the economic outlook has changed significantly in recent times, we are well placed to take advantage of the recovery when it comes. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said in the Budget Statement that he expects GDP growth to slow significantly next year, to 3.9%. It is worth restating that this performance outstrips that of many of our European partners and reflects the success of the Government in building the capacity of the economy to grow in a sound and sustainable manner. Employment is expected to increase by about 1.5% annually to 2004. While unemployment may average 4.75% next year, this trend should reverse as economic conditions improve. Consumer price inflation is projected to ease in 2002, helped by lower imported inflation, before falling to 2.25% by 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has built up a sound economic foundation during its term in office. The recent budgetary measures announced by the Minister for Finance will contribute to our prosperity and competitiveness and will promote <Col N="1848" /> social cohesiveness. The measures in the budget will enable continued economic progress by further developing our infrastructure and public services, by promoting social equity and by continuing to encourage enterprise and investment. The Government is committed to deliver on these objectives in a way that sustains fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline some of the detail of this Bill. Section 1 gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, current and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. The Dáil approved the original 2001 net Estimates for departmental expenditure, which totalled £19,693,000,000, prior to the summer recess. In late November and early December, the Dáil approved a number of Supplementary Estimates for various Departments, totalling about £670 million. The extra amount brings the total grant for supply services expenditure in 2001 to £20,363,000,000. Section 1(1) appropriates this amount to the various supply services or Departments as listed in the Schedule to this Bill and section 1(2) provides for the application of a total amount of £1,802,000,000 in departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the grants for the supply services listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the main factors which have given rise to additional expenditure and the need for Supplementary Estimates. Three Departments account for £595 million or 90% of the total Supplementary Estimates of £670 million. Net additional funds of £205 million were approved for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Of this, £55 million was additional current spending on the local government fund. The balance of £150 million was in respect of additional infrastructural spending on road improvement and maintenance and water and sewerage services. The additional allocations were provided to fund accelerated development of the roads network. They will also allow for accelerated progress under the water services investment programmes which cater for a number of major schemes including waste water schemes in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. This extra funding brings this Department's total net 2001 estimate to £2,470,000,000, or 12% of the total spending approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children was granted an additional net £197 million. This provides for additional spending in a number of areas, including £60 million for drugs schemes and £10 million for the cost of extending the medical card to those aged over 70. Nearly £35 million relates to additional pay costs for home helps, care assistants, increases due as a result of the Buckley report, agreements on incremental credit and unsociable hours and additional PRSI and pension costs. The expenses arising from the events of September 11 amounted to almost £24 million, including costs associated with the day of <Col N="1849" /> mourning, iodine tablets and medication associated with the threat of anthrax. Additional spending on a number of tribunals and inquiries was £14 million and medical indemnity and public liability insurance cost nearly £13 million more than forecast. There was a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid, mainly health contributions, of £17 million and an extra £23 million was spent on other projects. The total net 2001 Estimate for the Department of Health and Children was £4,720,000,000, or 23% of total expenditure approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>An additional net allocation of £193 million was granted to the Department of Education and Science. Of this, £80 million was needed to cover a shortfall in EU receipts in 2001, £42 million was granted for early payment of capitation grants to schools, £16 million was for additional pay costs in the universities and institutes of technology, £15 million was for additional secretarial, caretaking and child care assistant costs at first and second level and £6 million was for additional pension costs.</P>
    <P>There was additional capital spending of £33 million at first and third level which included a site purchase for the development of the Dundalk Institute of Technology and earlier than expected expenditure on first level school projects arising from early project completions. This additional allocation brings the total net 2001 Estimate for the Department to £3,728 million, which represents over 18% of total spending.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was appropriated an extra £30 million for the additional costs of prison officer and Garda overtime. The Garda overtime arose from the preventative measures taken to stave off foot and mouth disease. However, this extra allocation is offset by other savings to give an overall saving on the Justice group of Votes.</P>
    <P>The other significant Supplementary Estimates were for the Office of Public Works and the Department of Public Enterprise. The supplementary provision for the Office of Public Works was £32 million. This amount funded net additional spending of £16 million for refurbishment work and rental costs on properties for a number of Departments, nearly £7 million for preventative measures to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease and £9 million towards an office development purchase for a proposed one-stop-shop for immigration and citizenship.</P>
    <P>The additional allocation for the Department of Public Enterprise was £17 million which concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, additional funding for CIE for public service provision and compensation for Aer Lingus for the post September 11 period when US airspace was closed. Smaller Supplementary Estimates of less than £3 million were taken on the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Foreign Affairs and Taoiseach's groups of Votes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" />I will now deal with section 2 of this Bill. Article 17.1.2º of the Constitution requires that the financial resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that year or by 31 December 2001 in the case of the financial resolutions passed on budget day &ndash; 5 December 2001. However, Article 17.1.2º also allows for the end of year deadline to be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of that year, in this case, before 31 December 2001. This section makes provision for this deferment to be invoked. The provision of this section of the Appropriation Bill will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law, namely, 84 days for completion of Second Stage and four months for enactment of the Finance Bill. Identical provisions were included in the Appropriation Acts of 1998 to 2000.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to this House I would like to state that the level of funding provided by this Government in 2001 built on significant investments made since 1997. Since taking office this Government has increased net voted current spending by nearly £6 billion, or 57%. These funds have been targeted at the key social priorities of health, education and social welfare. We have also provided considerable resources for capital developments. The level of capital expenditure has increased by over £2.4 billion or 164% since we took office in 1997. This is indicative of this Government delivering on its promises to improve priority public services and to invest our resources wisely on behalf of the all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is always a pleasure to have him in the House and I know he enjoys coming here. The Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to moneys approved under departmental Estimates for the current year. This Bill provides for £20 billion which is a staggering figure. The debate on the Bill also provides an opportunity to review our budgetary and economic position, particularly the Government's economic performance during 2001.</P>
      <P>When speaking on last year's Bill I paid tribute to the Government for the excellent financial returns for 2000. At that time we had enjoyed economic growth for seven years and, in his Budget Statement 2000, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that he expected growth to continue. We now know that, sadly, this has not happened. However, I must acknowledge that two major events which were outside the Government's control during 2001 made a significant impact on the financial situation, namely, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in early May and the terrible events of 11 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his first budget speech in 1997, Deputy McCreevy outlined his political and economic philosophy when he stated that he would avoid creative gimmickry and lucky bag spending to win <Col N="1851" /> votes. He also stated that his budgets would have three characteristics, namely, control of public spending, the correction of tax inequities and the overdue acknowledgement of children and the elderly. One must admit that there was a certain amount of creative gimmickry and lucky bag spending in the last budget, with which I will deal when debating the Finance Bill. However, I wish to address the three issues which formed the Minister's political and economic philosophy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced long overdue reforms of the tax system. The rates of tax have been substantially reduced, tax credits have replaced allowances thereby introducing greater equity and tax bands have been widened. In 1997 a single person started paying tax at £77 per week, but, after the provisions of the last budget, a person can now earn £165 per week tax free. In the debate on budget night I expressed disappointment that the Minister had not gone all the way and taken all those on the minimum wage out of the tax net. By any measure, these changes represent a substantial achievement for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for which he can take credit.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients have also received real increases. The Government has delivered on its old age pension commitments with an increased payment of £116 per week, £16 more than its target. The Minister has also improved the lot of senior citizens who pay income tax by increasing the allowances whereby a married couple can now earn £20,500 before paying tax. There have also been substantial increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the sad aspects of the economy is that poverty remains, even though there has been substantial economic growth over the past number of years. The Minister claimed in his Budget Statement that he had looked after the less well-off, but CORI has made a strong case that many people remain on the poverty line. In an interesting recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Dr. Ken Whitaker, one of the main architects of economic growth in the late 1950s and early 1960s, stated that while we had enjoyed significant growth over the past number of years, he felt that more should have been done to eliminate poverty. While I welcome the Minister's forecast of a 2.4% inflation rate, I hope it is not over optimistic.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have met their targets regarding two of their three political objectives, but they have failed utterly regarding the third objective, namely, the control of public spending. An alarming picture is beginning to develop regarding the public finances, particularly current spending. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took office in 1997 he promised that public spending would rise by 2% ahead of inflation per year. In his recent Budget Statement, he admitted that current <Col N="1852" /> spending has risen by an enormous 79% during his five years as Minister. It was never realistic to expect the Minister or the Government to curtail public spending at the promised rate during an era of unequalled prosperity. However, the challenge was to contain spending at a level which could be sustained in the future so whoever forms the next Government would not be landed with a financial nightmare.</P>
    <P>Further spending commitments are now so large that the next Government will face dire choices if the economy does not continue to grow rapidly, which is likely taking into account the international situation. The Minister informed us that the slowdown has been much more dramatic than expected. Projections for 2003 and 2004 are for deficits of at least &euro;3 billion. The Government has failed to manage spending in a way that ensures its sustainability in the longer term. If it had done a better job, it would not now be projecting significant deficits for those years.</P>
    <P>The Government inherited a booming economy but leaves behind one that could face serious problems. I will not be here for next year's Appropriation Bill but it is abundantly clear that the next Government will find it very difficult this time next year. Public spending is now almost out of control. If the economy does not begin to recover in the second half of the year, boosting revenues, then harsh measures will be required to keep the economy from going completely off the rails. This is a sad note on which to end my Appropriation Bill speech for this year, but the facts bear out what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is always a delight to have him here. I was disappointed to hear that this would be the last occasion on which Senator Doyle would speak on an Appropriation Bill. In the short four and a half years I have been a Member, I have been in the House on many occasions for finance matters and he has always been a real gentleman, which I know he is. I wish him well.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for £20 billion in expenditure &ndash; a staggering figure, as Senator Doyle said. I acknowledge his praise of the Government on two of the three aspects he discussed. He has always been reasonably fair. Time will tell about forecasts for later years. I believe in taking each year as it comes. While one can prudently provide for the future, matters can go outside one's control, as was proven this year with foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September. Anyone who looks at the record of the Minister for Finance will see that he has done a tremendous job. I praised him the last day and I continue to praise him. He has always been his own man and has delivered everything that was in our election manifesto along with promises he made to the public. He has delivered on the programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" />Taxation is a matter with which I deal on a regular basis, due to my profession. One of the matters about which I have always been concerned is the discrepancy between tax rates for those based in Northern Ireland and those based south of the Border. I could not have believed when I came here that the Irish tax rate would be down to within 2% of the top rate in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That was achieved by taking 6% off both rates, 12% in the lifetime of the Government. The Opposition, with all its socialist connections, only presided over a 1% reduction in tax, as far as I remember, throughout all my years as an accountant.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken 380,000 people out of the tax net. By introducing the system of tax credits he has made the system more equitable. If he returns he will investigate the poverty trap to which Senator Doyle referred. The increase in the tax band rates also contributes to the equity of the system and gives better opportunities to those on lower pay than the cutting of tax rates. It is interesting that of the £4.8 billion in cuts given by the Minister over the last five budgets, 43% has consisted of increases in basic allowances, 22% in taking 370,000 people out of the top tax band and 16% in reducing the standard rate but only 11% in reducing the top rate.</P>
    <P>Currently, social welfare expenditure is approximately £7 billion. In 1997 that figure was only £4 billion. The Minister for Finance has, through the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, increased social welfare spending by £3 billion. The Minister stated that the contributory pension would increase to £100 per week in the lifetime of the Government and it was unbelievable that he reached that target last year. The pension is now £116 per week. There have been other social welfare increases: a 40% increase for those dependent on social welfare assistance, a 50% increase for those receiving a contributory pension and a whopping 60% increase for widows over 65. This is a good start in helping those who are less well off and those, now pensioners, who contributed to society for so long. I do not know what planet I am living on but nobody else seems to see this.</P>
    <P>Despite all the doom and gloom, there is £79 million extra for national roads with a total of £750 million being spent this year. That is three times what was spent in 1997. Yesterday I attended a meeting of my local authority about housing. We have not only allocated the 1,040 starts decided upon for the period 2000 to 2003, but we are seeking another 130 through the new programme in which contractors provide housing for the council. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has always said that the problem is not lack of funding but the slack administration of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Education expenditure is 4.5 times what it was in 1997. The spending on waste management, which will be a huge issue in years to come, is <Col N="1854" /> seven times what it was. My only fear is the forecasted infrastructure cutbacks. I have already told the Minister for Finance that if things do not pick up next year, although I am sure they will, I hope that the areas which have always suffered will not suffer again. I refer to places such as the area from which I come in the BMW region. While there have been major improvements in road infrastructure over the last five years, there is still much work to be done over the next four to five years. If there are to be cutbacks, I hope they will not affect the people who have never really gained from the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Minister's simplification of the tax system. In the not too distant past I spent long hours working on bogus tax accounts. When the last 20 years is viewed in hindsight one realises how complex the system was and how the high rates of tax and complex system were a disincentive to working. However, the PRSI system is still relatively complex, although I know the Minister is working on it. I did returns under that bogus tax account and it took me longer to carry out reviews of small PRSI and levy calculations for what people owed than it did for those who made substantial payments through the system of income tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the measures provided for in the Appropriation Bill which were announced in the budget. I welcome the tax relief made available to the sports capital programme to enable private investors to donate funding to sporting bodies. I welcome the announcement of the capital programme by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid. The applications are now available and have to be submitted by 4 January with the hope that schemes will be up and running by the end of February. A perennial problem with both central and local government is the lateness of funding being made available so that one cannot get on with a job in the current year and this has been tackled for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is not here this evening but I know the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will bring all points to his attention. I am sure this point affects the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. I welcome the increases the Minister made in the extension of urban renewal schemes, but I make a plea for County Donegal that it be allocated a rural renewal scheme similar to that of the upper Shannon region. After a slow start that scheme has really taken off and with the tourism element that is attached along the River Shannon, residential and other properties are able to avail of the tax relief. Regeneration has been given a major boost in those areas and I ask for the same for my county. It is cut off from the rest of Ireland apart from three miles in County Leitrim and we rely totally on visitors from Northern Ireland. Rather than the urban renewal scheme which gives the same benefits to towns on the outskirts <Col N="1855" /> of Dublin, it should be replaced by a rural renewal scheme, particularly for an area such as west Donegal where I come from.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would not like me to raise the issue of Eircom but it cannot be ignored. So many pensioners and first time investors lost money in that debacle. Whether we like it or not they were encouraged to invest by the directors and the publicity. They were guaranteed a secure risk free investment with the hope of reasonable gains, as had happened with other flotations. I know income tax and capital gains are two separate matters and that one can get tax relief for losses against future gains but many of those who invested in Eircom were first time investors with no other investments to realise profits on to net off their gains. I urge the Minister for Finance to consider the possibility of giving 20% tax relief on a specified maximum amount of £500 or £1,000. At least those people would have £200 out of £1,000 or £400 out of their £2,000 investment back. I am not looking for relief for those who can well afford to suffer those losses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak today. There are many other matters I could raise but I will leave them until we are dealing with the finance Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to both Senators for their contributions and the very positive endorsement they have given to the Appropriation Bill, 2001. It is very important constitutionally, legally and politically that we make a clear distinction within Parliament as to the role of Parliament in appropriating the funds expended from the Exchequer on behalf of the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The quality of the contributions from both Senators has led to a most informed debate on the economy and the priorities facing the country as we enter 2002. I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and to respond to the points raised.</P>
      <P>We have seen a rapid turn around in our economic fortunes in 2001 and have to accept that in a small open economy external influences such as economic changes in our main markets will have an impact on us. Our challenge is to respond appropriately to these changes. Our goal must be to remain competitive and build on our success to date while ensuring that the fruits of that success are fairly distributed. We must and will continue to invest in our future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident this Government's foresight in planning our investment priorities over the medium term will strengthen our economy and enhance the quality of life for everyone over the coming years. The continued development of our infrastructure is one of the key elements of our national development plan between now and 2006. This is our blueprint for investment over <Col N="1856" /> the medium term. I am sure we are all agreed on the plan's vision that Ireland remains competitive on the international market place and that our economic success is distributed more equally at regional level.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the future sustainability of the public finances. It has the foresight to prudently provide for the future through the establishment of the National Pension Reserve Fund, a very historic decision showing huge vision on the part of the Minister for Finance and the Government in endorsing it.</P>
    <P>Learning from the experience of our European Union partners the Government has committed 1.1% of GNP to this fund annually and has honoured its commitment despite the prevailing economic conditions. The Government has also prudently used the fruits of our economic success since 1997. Reflecting the infrastructural priorities of the national development plan, investment in capital spending has increased by more than 160% over that period. From 2000, in the first three years of the national development plan, in excess of £8 billion in Exchequer and EU funding will have been allocated for infrastructural priorities.</P>
    <P>While Senator Doyle speaks of public spending it is also useful to look at the areas where our resources have been invested. In the area of health, gross spending has increased by more than &euro;4.5 billion between 1997 and 2002. After many years when spending on health was behind that of our EU partners it is now on a par with the European average. Senator Doyle also acknowledged our success in the area of social welfare. The social welfare measures in Budget 2002 cost &euro;1.08 million in a full year. All weekly social welfare increases will now be paid with effect from 1 January next. We are conscious of the need to improve the overall management of public expenditure and focus on achieving value for money. Increased expenditure is not always the way forward and we have to be careful about how we manage it.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Bonner for his contribution and acknowledge his input as a professional in the field of accountancy and as a public representative. I endorse what he said about the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. I agree the Minister has done an outstanding job and will go down in history as one of the best Ministers for Finance this State ever had. His acknowledgement of our role as politicians and professional colleagues as Members of Parliament will be remembered. His recognition of the key role between the permanent administration of the State, society itself and the citizens we represent has been fundamental to his careful planning for the future and all of us collectively have a role to play in that. Parliament is about equality of opportunity, for everybody having their individual contributions in a collective consensus to ensure that the country goes forward in a positive manner to sustain us going <Col N="1857" /> forward. Future generations will take account of the historic achievements made and the contribution made by our current population.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody for their contribution and will mention the matters raised by the Senators to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I am sure he will reflect on them and if at all possible will respond to them. I compliment the Cathaoirleach for the leadership given to this House in recent years and wish him and all the Members and staff of the House a very happy Christmas and a very successful year and years ahead.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Bonner, I am disappointed that Senator Doyle will not go forward again. He is one of the great gentlemen of politics and I thank him for his contribution in both Houses and as a distinguished first citizen of this country over many years. I wish him well and bring greetings from all his many cousins in east Galway. I am sure they too will be disappointed he will not go forward again. I wish everyone a very happy Christmas and successful new year. I hope it will be sustainable and successful for all of us and that we will be back again to serve the people for as long as they believe we are good enough to do the job.</P>

This is, perhaps, an unusual year in that the Cathaoirleach and Senator Joe Doyle have said they are not seeking re-election and, indeed, those of us who are going forward again cannot be sure if we will be back. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Clerk, Assistant Clerk and staff of the Seanad Office, the ushers and all who have assisted in the work of the House. I thank my colleagues on the Government side, particularly the Leader of the House, Senator Donie Cassidy and the Whip and assistant Whip.

There is a great spirit in this Chamber, much of which is attributable to your approach to the running of the House, with your great patience, your sense of humour and your ability to put people down painlessly when they deserve it. I thank the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and all the staff for the very smooth way in which this House runs. I thank the ushers, the press corps, especially Jimmy Walsh for his coverage of the proceedings of the House, and those involved in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.

      <P>I say a special word of thanks to my colleague, Senator Joe Doyle, who, as we know, will not be back in the House. Others of us may not be back either &ndash; that is a hazard of political life. Over the years, Senator Joe Doyle has won a special place of affection and respect from everybody and all parties in the House.

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal by Irish Rail to reduce by 46% the amount of freight it carries has caused great concern among the staff of the company and the wider public. I raise this matter as an important policy issue. Since the story first broke in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>some weeks ago, many people have raised the matter with me. People can see very clearly that cutting the <Col N="1860" /> amount of freight carried by Irish Rail will only add to the increasingly difficult problem of negotiating one's way on the already congested roads of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The effect of heavy goods vehicles on our roads can be very negative. I have no doubt this applies right across the country as well as in North Tipperary. Smaller roads are being used as rat runs by heavy goods vehicles seeking short cuts to ports, airports and other destinations. That has a very detrimental effect on the quality of life of people living along those roads. Car drivers are familiar with the difficulties and delays resulting from convoys of heavy goods vehicles on our roads. It also has a dangerous effect on drivers. There are statistics to prove that heavy goods vehicles are involved in the city of Dublin, for example, in a high number of accidents, particularly those involving cyclists.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage where we are anxious to consider not only our transport infrastructure &ndash; I refer to roads &ndash; but also the different methods of transport we use. The Government has embarked on an ambitious and contentious programme of building interurban routes across the country. However, people are continually inquiring why more money is not being invested in rail transport. I no longer drive my car to Dublin because the level of traffic is so bad that I fear for my health and also because I believe people should do everything possible to ensure that the number of cars on our roads is reduced.</P>
      <P>Increasing numbers of people are using the train. They are inquiring why the Government is standing over a decision by Irish Rail to reduce the amount of freight it carries by 46%, which will lead to an increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles using our roads. There is also the issue of pollution. There is no doubt that the level of air pollution is being increased by the preponderance of heavy goods vehicles on our roads. There are also health and road safety issues involved.</P>
      <P>I understand from contacts I have had with the Department that, to quote the Minister, this decision is not &ldquo;a done deal&rdquo;. I appeal to her to reconsider the proposal by the board of Irish Rail, particularly in the context of the need for greater investment in rail. I live in Nenagh and the number of people who commute from the town to Limerick each day is increasing. The level of traffic and the increase in congestion is causing major difficulties. The Ballybrophy rail line runs from Nenagh to Limerick, but the people in the area believe that if a decent line was put in place, it would improve the situation from the point of view of commuting. It would also have a benefit from the point of view of protecting the environment and people's health and promoting sustainable development. Unfortunately, however, action has not been taken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" />There has been some discussion about the need to extend the rail line to Shannon Airport. That would be a fabulous development and it would have a tremendous effect in terms of boosting the tourism of the towns, including Nenagh, Roscrea, Cloghjordan, Birdhill and others, which are located on the line leading into Limerick.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it is a short-sighted approach on the part of the Government to, on one hand, invest billions in building motorways while, on the other, drip-feed funds into rail infrastructure. What the Government is doing also runs contrary to EU policy and philosophy in respect of this matter. I have no doubt that the time is fast approaching when we will be forced to change our policy on investing in rail infrastructure. We will also be obliged to see infrastructure for what it is, namely, part of the social and economic fabric of our society and a necessary tool in ensuring that our economy runs smoothly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to respond positively to the points I have raised. I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for raising this important matter. The Government is fully committed to the future of rail and visibly demonstrated this commitment in the recent budget by maintaining the levels of investment required by National Development Plan, 2000-2006. This plan provides for substantial and badly needed investment in the rail network after many years of under-investment. The total planned investment in the six year lifespan of the public transport priority plan is £2.403 billion. This investment provides for the following elements: £500 million for mainline rail investment, comprising two principal components, namely, completion of the implementation of the railway safety programme and a renewal/upgrading programme; upgrading capacity on the DART and suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area; increasing the physical capacity of the railway to cater for growing demand for mainline rail services; and improving the quality, speed and reliability of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made to date in meeting the ambitious targets set out in the national development plan. A total of 26 new DART cars have entered service in the past year. These are the first new DART cars since the service first commenced in 1984. A further 12 DART cars were recently delivered and, following the commissioning process, will commence service early in the new year, increasing overall DART capacity by almost 50% since 1999. A total of 80 new diesel rail cars have been ordered and delivery will start in mid-2002. Under the national rail safety programme, an additional 74 km of trackwork was renewed up to mid-2001. In <Col N="1862" /> addition, 30 railway level crossings were upgraded in the period, 21 bridges were renewed or upgraded and an additional 16 miles of fencing was completed up to June 2000. This investment reflects the Government's continuing commitment to the maintenance and development of the rail network.</P>
    <P>The review group into Iarnród Éireann, comprising Kevin Bonner, John Dunne and Bill Attley, in its report, Iarnród Éireann &ndash; The Way Forward, which was given to the Minister for Public Enterprise in July last, identified the need for the development of an overall national rail strategy. In this regard, the Minister is anxious that there should be a strategic consideration of the contribution of rail services in the light of the £500 million investment programme and the emerging national spatial strategy to be announced soon by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The study, which will be carried out by my Department, will take account of the various rail proposals arising from land use studies being undertaken throughout the country. It will also consider the forthcoming report to be made to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources by the task force on port logistics. It is intended to discuss the terms of reference of the proposed study in the near future with CIE and the social partners at the partnership forum on public transport.</P>
    <P>The report, Iarnród Éireann &ndash; The Way Forward, also raised issues in relation to the future of the rail freight business. It made a number of arguments in favour of and against retaining freight services generally and suggested that long-range plans will need to be established for the rail sector as a whole. In that context, a business strategy in relation to rail freight was recently submitted to the board of CIE for consideration. Having considered the business strategy, the Minister for Public Enterprise has been advised that the board recently decided that larnród Éireann should continue to operate rail freight services and investment was approved by the board to provide freight handling facilities in the North Wall area in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister of State may or may not be aware &ndash; I appreciate that this is not his area of responsibility &ndash; that in the High Court last week Mr. Justice Kelly, who manages the list of non-jury and judicial review cases, stated that a serious situation had developed in respect of delays because of a shortage of judges. It is time to call for a review of this area, particularly in respect of the administration of the courts. The new Courts Service has been put in place but dif<Col N="1863" /> ficulties still obtain throughout the court system, particularly in relation to the High Court.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Kelly pointed out that the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Morris, had retired, and that Mr. Justice Quirke and Mr. Justice Smith were involved in dealing with other matters and they had not been replaced. He also highlighted the fact that another judge is dealing almost exclusively with cases, many of which have yet to be heard, involving refugees. Mr. Justice O'Neill who was involved in the hepatitis C tribunal advised barristers and solicitors that there are no hearing dates available for many cases due to come on stream from mid-January onwards. This is a deplorable situation which must be reviewed. The Minister should make the necessary contacts with the courts and the Bar Council to discuss how best this situation can be resolved.</P>
      <P>There is a clear need for the appointment of extra judges. Various judges have been seconded to other areas &ndash; I compliment Ms Justice Lindsay for her work on the Lindsay tribunal, a tribunal that has received fewer headlines than others given the details involved, the families who have suffered, the people who died. Her report is awaited and will be discussed on another day.</P>
      <P>A long serving member of the District Court, who did a great deal for the administration of justice at the lower end of the spectrum, Mr. Justice Sean Delap, passed away last weekend. I pay tribute to him and other members of the Judiciary who have given long service in a variety of capacities. Many cases have been delayed due to the unavailability of judges. There is a clear case for the appointment of extra judges and a need to undertake an overall review of the High Courts and District Courts. We must face up to this problem. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General and the Government must look at this situation in consultation with the relevant authorities to see how best the problem can be addressed with a view to shortening the delays in the administration of justice.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to deal with this issue. There is a particular problem in terms of judicial resources and this may have prompted the Senator to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is currently one vacancy on the High Court Bench. This has arisen as a result of the retirement of the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, with effect from 1 December 2001 and his replacement as President by Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan. This left a vacancy for an ordinary judge of the High Court and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has requested the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to submit the names of suitable candidates for appointment to this post as soon as possible. When the Judicial Appoint<Col N="1864" /> ments Advisory Board submits the names of suitable candidates to the Minister, he will bring the matter of appointment to Government without delay.</P>
    <P>To address the heavy demands on the High Court Bench, the Minister has provided for the creation of two further High Court posts. This will increase to a total of 26 the statutorily approved number of ordinary High Court judges who may be appointed. This increase requires legislation and provision for this is being included in the Court and Courts Officers Bill, 2001, which is currently awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil. It had been hoped to enact this legislation before the end of this year but this did not prove possible due to a very heavy legislative programme in both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister is very anxious, however, to progress the matter early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The two additional High Court positions which the Government has agreed are to provide for the replacement of Mr. Justice John Quirke who was appointed to the chair of the Public Service Benchmarking Body earlier this year and Mr. Justice Matthew P. Smith recently appointed to chair the Ethics in Public Office Commission. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied that once these three posts are filled, i.e. the existing vacancy and two new posts which are being created, the current pressure on the High Court will ease.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been concerned with the level of delays in the hearing of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court and he has, accordingly, requested the Courts Service Board to examine the jurisdictional relationship between the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Courts. In response, the Courts Service Board has indicated that it plans to undertake a comprehensive review of the distribution and business among all courts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Circuit and District Courts it is my understanding that cases in these, with the exception of some problems in one or two circuits, are largely up to date. The Minister is aware of the heavy work load which the Circuit Court carries and for that reason, he arranged, with Government approval, for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court in February last year and the appointment of a further extra judge in January of this year.</P>
    <P>The Senator may also be aware that major changes in the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts are proposed in the Court and Courts Officers Bill, 2001. It is proposed to increase the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £30,000 to &euro;100,000 and the civil jurisdiction of the District Court from £5,000 to &euro;20,000. These are major jurisdictional changes which will affect the work load in all three courts &ndash; the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District <Col N="1865" /> Court. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied the courts are well equipped to handle such cases and will keep the adequacy of judicial resources generally under review in that context.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This case was brought to my attention recently by a degree student in a third level institution who for the past three years has qualified for grant aid. When she re-applied for the grant for her fourth year in college she was refused as her mother had won £18,000 on the national lottery. That is harsh and unfair. First, the refusal of the grant does not affect the winner of the money but the student in question. Perhaps other such cases could be quoted but I am sure they are few and far between.</P>
      <P>A family might be fortunate enough to cash in a small insurance policy and an applicant for a grant from that family would, therefore, lose out for a 12 month period. If the student were to go back to college next year or the following year, he or she would be entitled to a grant. This anomaly should be removed from the relevant legislation as it deprives needy students in these circumstances of their weekly maintenance grant. It is difficult to explain to a student that he or she is losing their grant because one of their parents won a relatively small sum of money. The sum involved could be even smaller than in the case I have raised and an applicant would still lose out. I would not have raised this matter if it concerned someone who won a large sum of money. Perhaps an upper ceiling could be put on the amount of winnings to ensure that those who could not otherwise afford to send their children to college would benefit from grant aid.</P>
      <P>I apologise for having the Minister to the House at this late hour in Christmas week and look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>There is no need for the Senator to apologise. His raising of this important issue is evidence of his interest in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. Under the terms of the scheme, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his or her gross income from all sources and the gross income of <Col N="1866" /> his or her parents or guardians, where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments, as follows, being exempt: child benefit; family income supplement; disability allowance (where paid to the candidate); blind pension (where paid to the candidate); means tested one parent family payments; orphan's pensions; back to education allowance; foster care allowance; domiciliary care allowance; and carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of a grant application for the 2001-2002 academic year, a candidate's reckonable income is all amounts, with the exception of the above payments, received during the tax year ended 5 April 2001. In the calculation of reckonable income, account must be taken of gains from prize bonds, lotteries or sweepstakes winnings within the accounting period in question.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to change the means testing arrangements under the higher education grant scheme to allow for the exclusion of lottery winnings in the calculation of reckonable income. Where prize money from the national lottery has put a candidate's reckonable income outside the income limits prescribed under the higher education grant scheme for a particular year, he or she may apply to be reassessed for grant assistance in any subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The cost of the four maintenance grant schemes operated by the Department of Education and Science in 2000 was £90.4 million. The estimated cost for 2001 is £96.4 million. In 2000, expenditure on all student support, including free fees, amounted to just under £250 million. The equivalent cost for 2001 is likely to be in the order of £260 million.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard, it is relevant that in September 2000 the Minister established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the barriers to participation by disadvantaged students in higher education. There is provision within the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for a third level access fund, totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Last July, the Minister launched the report on access to third level education prepared by the group. The report is a landmark document which contains 78 recommendations. The Department has to date initiated a number of measures aimed at implementing some of the main recommendations in the report. At the launch of the action group in September 2000, the Minister announced the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders in 2001. Recommendations relating <Col N="1867" /> to the criteria for the special rates of grant are set out in the action group's report and approval for payment of the special rates have issued to the local authorities and vocational education committees. The special rates, effective from the 2000/01 academic year are £3,000 for students residing over 15 miles from the college attended, and £1,200 for students residing less than 15 miles from the college attended.</P>
    <P>In September 2000 the Minister also announced a millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001. The fund is intended to build on the experience of the support scheme for students from disad<Col N="1868" /> vantaged families, operated by the Northside Partnership, which assists students to participate in higher education. Area Development Management Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, has accepted the Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-2002 academic year. The Minister is committed to progressing implementation of the group's recommendations as resources permit.</P>
