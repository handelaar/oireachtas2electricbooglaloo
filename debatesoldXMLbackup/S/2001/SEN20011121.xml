      <P>I have received notice from Senator Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the procedures that are in place to ensure that unsuitable material is not included in primary school textbooks.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Brien that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to designate disadvantaged status to St. Patrick's boys' school, Ballybay, County Monaghan, and to provide an additional teacher.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Eligible Customer) Order, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 2, European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 20, non-Government motion, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in taking all Stages of No. 2 today. This should have been taken much earlier. We are one of only three countries in the EU which have yet to ratify this Bill. I asked the Leader two weeks ago if he could indicate what business he intends to bring into the House between now and the end of the session. He told me he would have an answer for <Col N="846" /> me today and that he would indicate today the legislation he intends to introduce between now and the end of the session.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if a debate could be arranged on an issue which is causing great anger in the country at the moment, and that is the entire Eircom debacle. It is very clear that there are very many thousands of losers and very few winners, but the winners won big. Some people made enormous sums of money at the expense of the small investor. I want a debate, not on how the Stock Exchange works but on the role of the Government in all of this debacle, how it was hyped up by the Government in the early stages, the selling, the false promise and on the incompetence which surrounded so much of the handling of this issue. There is a real need for government accountability on this issue. Promises were made and expectations were raised. Hype surrounded the entire issue and the Government behaved at the time as if it was its own idea &ndash; which it was &ndash; and as if it was part of the giveaway to the ordinary person. The people want this issue debated. They are doing so already on the airwaves. It is time to have a full debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Leader with respect that every day the items on the Adjournment are issues to do with education. He has given a commitment to have a full debate on education. Many of these issues could be aired and questions could be put to the Minister and the issue thrashed out properly. I insist that we address that issue.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I raised with the Leader the importance of having a debate on transport policy. Perhaps other Members are better informed than I but the idea that the Government has taken a decision to take freight off the railways and put it on the roads at a time when the whole world is talking about road congestion, at a time when the incidence of traffic accidents is at a peak and the idea of putting more trucks on the roads seems like absolute madness. I want to hear what the Government's policy is and whether these reports are correct. This is a matter of fundamental importance. All over the country people are talking about traffic and road safety and we will be debating that tonight on Senator Quinn's motion. If a facility such as the rail network is being put aside and even closed down in some instances, it makes no sense at all in the light of the stated policy to make the roads more usable and safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree to take No. 1 without debate. It is a significant issue which raises many questions. I do not have any objection to the thrust of it and I will not enter into that debate now, but winter is approaching and we need to know if this is just an attempt by Government to make more electricity available before we run out during winter or if there is a real issue here. This is something which will not be capable of giving us more electricity until a couple of years into the future. I want to hear the Government's view on this issue. <Col N="847" /> I do not accept that the motion should be taken without debate. I am happy to have a short debate but people have a view on the issue. I do not know if it is appropriate to put an amendment on the question of whether there should be a debate, and perhaps the Cathaoirleach will guide me on this matter. This is a serious matter which affects every household in one way or other. The cost of electricity is something about which we are all concerned. May I object to the Order of Business on the basis that it is proposed that this matter be taken without debate, without putting forward an amendment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator O'Toole's proposal in regard to taking this matter without debate. I have raised on a number of occasions the question of matters which should be debated for at least a short period of time before they are passed. This pertains to the deregulation of electricity supply and the liberalisation of the market, which has enormous implications and deserves debate.</P>
      <P>Last week I called for a pre-budget debate on the economy in the presence of the Minister for Finance. Now that the Estimates have been published we could consider the various areas that need to be addressed such as the matter raised by Senator O'Toole, which is widely covered in the newspapers, regarding the 73 primary schools that are unsafe and require substantial refurbishment. Most of these shortcomings relate to basic matters such as drinking water, the quality of playgrounds and so on. There is nothing in the Estimates about this issue, which is just one example of matters that should be drawn to the attention of the Minister. We also need to look at it in terms of the global economy and the sectors which have been most severely hit since the downturn, particularly Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House at an early stage &ndash; I made this request last week also &ndash; to address issues arising for local authorities in putting together their estimates, such as the waste management strategy, house construction, lack of social and affordable housing and increasing rates of homelessness?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate with the Minister for Public Enterprise on the issue of Eircom. This is a major issue in terms of how it was presented to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach:</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points which can be made when the debate which has been sought takes place. We cannot go into the detail of the matter now. I take it you are supporting the request for a debate on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting it for the reason that this is a public utility that has been sold to venture capitalists. There was an announcement to the effect that 3,500 jobs are about to be lost and we are in danger of losing control over that public utility. Many people lost a considerable amount of money because of what was presented under false pretences in terms of the advertising campaign on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that I ask my colleague, Senator Cassidy, to allocate time, perhaps next week, to consider the proposed closure of Foxteq in Mullingar with the immediate loss of 89 jobs and a further 20 or so to be lost in February when the plant will be completely shut down. I ask that everything possible be done to try to rectify the situation such as the immediate establishment of a task force. In making this request, I ask for the support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Eircom situation, particularly because just this afternoon I heard an elderly pensioner talking about the fact that he and his wife had invested substantially during all the hoo-ha and now he is being forced to give back his shares at a price determined by Valentia Telecommunications. There is an issue of freedom of operation here. People should be allowed to keep their shares and not have to sell them. Stockbrokers tell people it is better to leave them in. It is outrageous in a democracy that people should be coerced into surrendering shares they bought in good faith.</P>
      <P>There have been calls for a debate on Northern Ireland but I am not sure that is appropriate at this time. However, I am sure Members on all sides would wish to congratulate the Police Service of Northern Ireland on locating and defusing a large bomb. It is an important matter and the police deserve the congratulations of all people in this country who like democracy.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader see if there is any possibility of bringing legislation before the House to tidy up the Bill which regulates pyramid selling? The Bill was passed in the House in 1980 but there are loopholes in it, particularly in regard to Women Empowering Women in the Swords area. It is really women ensnaring women and it seems the Garda is powerless to operate against pyramid selling. There is a defect in the law and the House should be able to rectify it simply.</P>
      <P>I repeat the call I made last week for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House to explain asylum policy. There was a different issue last week. This week it is the case of brilliant 16 year old Moldovan female student who is about to be deported to Moldova despite the fact that she is the star pupil of a school in Bray. We are entitled to an explanation of the way this asylum policy works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Toole's comments on the transport problem, particularly <Col N="849" /> in regard to the regulation of the movement of heavy good vehicles during the day. This issue should be examined as Christmas approaches.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned about alcohol-related advertising because advertising standards are being breached. While the Minister for Health and Children has also expressed concern and is setting up a committee to examine this issue, false messages are being given to young people regarding their confidence and self-esteem in radio and television advertisements. Statements on this issue would be worthwhile. Alcohol and speed-related accidents occur regularly and affect every walk of life. This would be a golden opportunity to tackle false advertising of alcohol products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I questioned the Leader about the risk management regulations under the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and I expected a reply from the him today. We were told previously they would be brought before the House in October. I have not received a reply from the Leader even though he said he would get back to me.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House to explain why she considers the axing of £370,000 from Radio na Gaeltachta's budget to be justified, given everybody's support for the Irish language and North-South links relating to radio broadcasting and the progression of the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost six months since we debated the operation of the National Roads Authority and it is time we had a further debate because the NRA is riding roughshod over every local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I came across another example of this earlier this week when the county engineer in Kilkenny informed the county council he had no responsibility for safety on the new road between Waterford and Carrick-on-Suir but he would report to the council what he learnt from the NRA safety officer. Despite the horrific crash which took place in County Louth, there will be 13 right-hand turns on a 5.7 kilometers new stretch of road in south Kilkenny. This means people will be stopped in the middle of the road and there will be accidents. The relationship between the Oireachtas and the NRA must be debated as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that there should be a debate on Eircom and what has happened to investors, when the company was floated on the stock market it was very successful. In terms of its impact in Ireland, it had more than 80% of the land lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Senator Lanigan has realised the full extent of the powers of the National Roads Authority and the lack of power of councillors in that regard. However, it is a little late. I hope it is not too late for Irish Rail in light of recent reports that the Government plans to reduce the amount of freight the company will carry. This will be a disaster not only for the company but for the wider community using the roads because of the increased element of risk it presents at a time when we are all abhorred at the high number of deaths on the roads. I ask the Government to look carefully at the issue and realise that what is happening is a complete and utter disaster. It is a backward move which is environmentally damaging and downright dangerous. It is an increasingly irresponsible move for all the reasons I have set out.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Government to respond to the issue of violence against children given the high number of deaths of children through domestic violence? I ask for a considered response on the issue which we have not had to date despite the very disturbing levels of deaths of children.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Ormonde said on the issue of alcohol advertising, which would be a useful debate. I ask the Leader to ask the Government when it intends publishing the long-awaited health strategy.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification in the context of Senator Jackman's remarks about the Government reducing the Radio na Gaeltachta budget, it is RTE itself, as part of its cost-cutting structure, not the Government or the Minister, that is making the cuts and it is unfair&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suitably chastised. My question relates to a contribution made last week at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government by the Irish Planning Institute during which it referred to draft regulations with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. According to reports, if they come into effect it will mean an exemption from local planning obligations for the location of mobile phone masts. The Department of the Environment aqnd Local Government, according to a story in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> confirmed that there is an exemption included in the draft regulations.</P>
      <P>Although it may not exercise the minds of many of my colleagues, this matter does concern the people of County Leitrim and the north-west. It is a double-edged sword however because large parts of my county do not have proper mobile phone coverage due to objections to the masts being erected by Eircell and Esat. I am sure Senators will agree that this does not help inward investment. However, there are real concerns and I do not wish to take away from well-meaning parties.</P>
      <P>If these draft regulations are to be given effect, they will create difficulties for a variety of people. I ask the Leader of the House, in the context of the request for the Minister to come to discuss the National Roads Authority and other matters, to clarify the position in relation to these draft regulations as they are currently being reported, bearing in mind that I do not want to add credence to those reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by Senators Manning and Norris for a debate regarding the price for Eircom shares when the company was floated. I remind the Member of the Opposition who spoke earlier that the price was set by the Minister against the recommendations of Eircom. If Aer Lingus had come on the market, would it have been sold in the same way?</P>
      <P>I support the call from a Member opposite for a debate on the National Roads Authority. If the Senator had been listening carefully to this side of the House, he would have heard us say that a body like that, which has such guaranteed independence, is guaranteed to ride roughshod over people. This is only beginning to dawn on Members opposite as the election draws near.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Senator O'Toole said regarding heavy goods vehicles, trucks should have some form of skirting to prevent mud splashing off them. I know it is an issue I should raise elsewhere but I do not know where. We should impose regulations to ensure that this splashing is minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to explain what action he plans to take in light of recent reports that the causes of lung disease are not sufficiently investigated in Ireland. This is a serious problem because we do not know what steps to take to prevent it.</P>
      <P>Lung disease is a greater cause of death than any other in Britain, according to research published there today. With the exception of four countries from the former Soviet Union, Ireland has the worst record in the world. It is startling to note that a recent report here stated that we do not investigate the causes despite this fact. This may be included in the debate on the health strategy that Senator O'Meara has sought but it is time the Minister came to the House to explain what action he intends to take in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's points regarding the student in Bray who is facing deportation. From the newspaper reports, it is quite clear this family has everything to fear in being deported to Moldova from where they came. We have had many debates on this issue in this House, some of them very angry and undignified. The anger and indignity came from the chair, not from the floor. However, when the Minister was dealing with the Immigration Act, 1999, in this House, he said he would welcome an early review of the operation of the Act. If this young lady is deported to Moldova it will amount to a case of<i> refoulement, </i>which is specifically prohibited under our international obligations. I urge the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he will be available to come back to this House to carry out the review of the Immigration Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again ask the Leader when we might have a <Col N="853" /> debate on the livestock industry. It is just over a year since the discovery of BSE in France and one or two other countries set off a chain reaction, which has done enormous damage to the livestock industry, especially the export sector. The response to this by Government has been considerably less than adequate. The Leader of the House has been very good during the foot and mouth crisis this year. He allowed time for numerous debates during which the Minister or one of the Ministers of State gave us an update on the fight against foot and mouth disease. I think this is the fourth time, a Chathaoirligh, I have trespassed upon your indulgence to ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the livestock industry and related issues. I hope this can be held within the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning inquired about the forthcoming legislation for the remainder of this session. I will inform the House after the replies to the various questions that have been put.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Coghlan and Coogan called for a debate on Eircom shares and the Government's role. I have no difficulty in allowing time for this.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Manning, O'Meara, Coghlan and Coogan called for a debate on transport policy, particularly the mooted change in policy to have freight transported by road rather than rail as reported in the press over the weekend. I have no problem in allowing time for this also.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Ormonde called for a further debate on education. I can allow time for this. Senator O'Toole also spoke about No. 1. This was laid before the House on 20 June and I ask for the co-operation of the House in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on the economy. The budget will be introduced in two weeks. The key ingredient to all success in business or any walk of life lies in confidence. I hope people do not start to talk, for political gain, about a recession that does not seem to be there. Yesterday in America, we saw a rise in the markets.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello also called for a debate on local authorities. I have no difficulty in allowing this, but it will not be before the Christmas recess. Senator Glynn called for a task force to be set up by the Tánaiste in relation to the closure of Foxteq in Mullingar. We all know that the midlands are being very badly hit at present. I will pass his views to the Tánaiste immediately after the Order of Business and I will add my name to it also. If necessary we will come into the House&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because the midlands have to be looked after, the same as every other part of the country. Senators Norris and Connor have called for various actions to be taken on the Government's asylum seekers' policy. I will pass those views on to the Minister. I understand that every application is being considered individually.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris has also called for a debate on Northern Ireland and I join with him in congratulating all those involved in stopping that dreadful bomb in Armagh and having it defused. Senator Norris also raised the issue of pyramid selling and I will certainly pass his views on to the Minister. Senators Ormonde and O'Meara have expressed strong views on alcohol-related advertising and the glorification of alcohol through the use of sports stars and those who have been successful in other walks of life. I agree with their views and I invite the Senators to make their views more broadly known tonight during Private Members' Business. Senator Jackman called for a debate on health and the insurance industry, I will provide time for that. I agree that budgets are set by the RTE Authority for the television and radio channels for which they are responsible.</P>
      <P>Senators Lanigan and O'Meara have called for a debate on the National Roads Authority. I think we have had two or three debates in the lifetime of this Seanad on this subject and I have no difficulty in allowing another take place as soon as possible. Senator O'Meara has called for a debate on violence against children and I will certainly provide time for this. That very sad incident in Moate, County Westmeath, last week brings the horror home to all. Senator O'Meara also inquired when the health strategy will be announced. I understand it will be announced early next week, probably on Monday.</P>
      <P>I will pass Senator Mooney's views on to the Minister. I will also pass Senator Quinn's views on to the Minister. What he has stated is alarming and I will certainly have the Minister here before Christmas to discuss this report. I did not realise that the report was published. Perhaps the Senator will give me a copy of it. I will provide time to discuss this very serious matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor has called for a debate on the livestock industry and related matters and I will provide time for this, I have always been forthcoming in giving every opportunity to the many hard working Senators who have been elected to represent the agriculture sector.</P>

He spoke about anger and indignity from the chair. I know he pointed at the Minister's chair, but I am concerned that it might reflect on the Cathaoirleach.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities and Swiss Confederation Bill, 2001, was published on 15 November. The purpose of the Bill is to give the force of law, once they are ratified, to seven sectoral agreements which have been signed between the Euro<Col N="859" /> pean Union and Switzerland. The seven agreements cover the following areas: free movement of persons; air transport; rail and road transport; trade in agricultural products; mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment; Government procurement; and scientific and technological co-operation.</P>
      <P>The agreements were signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999 and will enter into force after ratification by all the parties. Switzerland ratified the seven agreements on 16 October 2000 following their approval by the Swiss people in a referendum. The ratification process is well advanced in the EU and it is expected that the necessary procedures will be completed in the near future. The seven agreements are linked in the sense that they can only come into force together and they will all come to an end if any one of them is terminated. This was at the insistence of the EU, which argued that the agreements satisfy the interests of both sides only as a complete package.</P>
      <P>The Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons differs from the others in that it requires ratification by the 15 member states as well as the European Union and Switzerland. This is because it covers matters which come within the competence of member states. The other six agreements require formal ratification only on behalf of the European Union and Switzerland. However, as they include references to various EU directives and regulations which need to be adapted to take account of their future application to Switzerland, the Bill, when enacted, will ensure that all the necessary adaptations required to give effect to them are made. The Bill is modelled on the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1993, which provided for the ratification of the European Economic Area Agreement.</P>
      <P>As Senators will appreciate, the European Union's relations with Switzerland are of special significance. Switzerland is very close to the Union, not only geographically where it is surrounded by EU member states, but also economically and culturally. Figures published by EUROSTAT show that Switzerland is second only to the US as a market for EU exports. Swiss direct investment in the EU is second only to that of the US and represents almost half of the non-US direct investment in the EU. Switzerland is also the second largest recipient of EU direct investment after the US. Other statistics show that Switzerland is the country in Europe with the highest number of non-national EU residents, with a population of over one million, and it receives 95% of EU cross-border workers, with 150,000 EU citizens crossing the Swiss border to work every morning. Thus as the EU's most important European partner, there is mutual interest in a widening and deepening of relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Switzerland had participated in the negotiations on the European Economic Area Agreement, the Swiss people subsequently voted <Col N="860" /> in a referendum against participation in that agreement. Accordingly, the European Economic Area, following the accession of Sweden, Finland and Austria to the European Union, now consists of the 15 member states of the Union, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The result of the referendum in Switzerland rejecting the EEA Agreement also meant, in addition to the country not being able to participate in the EEA, that its request for accession to the EU, which had been transmitted in May 1991, had to be frozen and remains so to this day, although Swiss membership of the European Union remains a &ldquo;strategic objective&rdquo; of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, bilateral relations between the EU and Switzerland continue to be based on a number of existing agreements, including the 1972 Free Trade Agreement, a framework agreement on scientific and technical co-operation and a transit agreement. However, as both the EU and Switzerland recognised the need for a closer formal relationship, in their mutual interests they proceeded to negotiate the seven additional sectoral agreements signed in June 1999.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the signing of these agreements, the parties made joint declarations indicating an interest in negotiating agreements in a number of other sectors. Since June 2001, negotiations have been under way on co-operation against fraud; the environment; co-operation on statistics; and a liberalisation of trade in processed agricultural products. Further negotiations in areas such as trade in services, participation in Union programmes on training, youth and media, savings on taxation and co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs and the Schengen agreement are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with the seven agreements which are the subject of this Bill and, first, with the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. This agreement will provide broadly for the free movement of persons between the EU and Switzerland. It aims for the granting on a reciprocal basis of the same living, employment and working conditions as those enjoyed by the respective citizens. It covers rights of entry, residence, access to employment, the right of establishment on a self-employed basis, access to education and the right to benefit from reciprocal social security arrangements. It provides for the mutual recognition of educational qualifications and the co-ordination of social security systems. All these rights are based on the principles of non-discrimination by nationality and equality of treatment. The agreement affords Switzerland a transition period to facilitate the liberalisation of its labour market. This agreement is intended to last for seven years when Switzerland will either renew it indefinitely or repudiate it.</P>
    <P>As far as the social security aspects of this agreement are concerned, Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement with Switzerland which came into force on 1 July 1999 after the signature of the free movement agreement. The majority of <Col N="861" /> persons covered by the free movement agreement are covered by the bilateral agreement, although the benefits of the EU agreement will be more beneficial as short-term benefits, and family benefits are included. The provisions relating to old age benefits are also more beneficial. However, having regard to the level of migration between Ireland and Switzerland, it is considered that the additional costs arising from the social security provisions of the free movement agreement will be minimal. Irish citizens resident in Switzerland will benefit from similar arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Air Transport provides essentially for the reciprocal liberalisation of aviation, on the basis of previous Community agreements. It covers air traffic rights for journeys between any point in the Community and any point in Switzerland, for carriers registered in either party. Two years after the entry into force of the agreement Swiss air carriers will be granted traffic rights between points in different Community countries.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of compliance with this agreement, especially as regards the implementation of competition law, will be under the responsibility of the Commission and the European Court of Justice. In return, Switzerland will have observer status in the committees assisting the Commission to define the evolution of European air transportation policy. This agreement therefore creates a unified legal regime for air transportation, based on strict reciprocity between rights and obligations conferred within the EU and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>We welcome this further liberalisation of air transport within Europe, with Irish carriers benefiting by being granted greater access to operate air services between Switzerland and the EU. Swiss carriers will be granted reciprocal rights two years later.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road deals in particular with the maintenance of the freedom of transit for road vehicles across Switzerland, at a reasonable level of charging. The 28 tonne limit for trucks circulating in Switzerland will be progressively raised to 40 tonnes, the European standard. It provides for the avoidance of traffic diversion from Switzerland into neighbouring countries, the reciprocal liberalisation of bilateral and transit road transport operations, the adoption by Switzerland of legislation equivalent to specified elements of the road and rail transport <i>aquis communitaire,</i> with a timetable for the progressive adoption of Community rules on vehicle weights and dimensions, and compliance by Switzerland with Community rules on state aids to road transport.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products is expected to improve significantly access for agricultural products to the EU and Swiss markets respectively, while abolishing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade according to the principle of reciprocity. A large number of tariff concessions have been granted for plants and flowers, <Col N="862" /> fresh or prepared fruit and vegetables, cheeses and milk products, meat products and wine. The agreement also seeks to facilitate trade through mutual recognition of legislation on plant protection, animal feedstuffs, seeds and organic farming. It includes veterinary rules designed to facilitate trade in live animals and animal products. In the case of live animals the legislation of both sides is deemed to be equivalent and for animal products trade will be based on Community legislation. The agreement also provides that Switzerland will apply the same rules as the Community to imports from third countries.</P>
    <P>The proposed agreement will provide increased export opportunities for Ireland over a range of products. The section on trade in wines and sprits, which provides for mutual protection of protected names, will afford protection for Irish denominations such as Irish cream and Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Agreement on the Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment is to establish mutual recognition of the results of tests of conformity to standards for most industrial products. Both parties will thus recognise reports, certificates, authorisations and labels of certification delivered according to their respective procedures. The effect is that products can be certified by recognised conformity assessment bodies in the European Union and placed on the Swiss market without having to undergo any further approval procedures, and vice versa. This will result in reduced costs and increased efficiency for obtaining product approvals and will facilitate market access. The agreement lists the various sectors to be covered, including machinery, toys, medical devices, telecommunications terminal equipment and a range of others.</P>
    <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has been notified under EU procedures as a conformity assessment body, CAB, for many of the sectors mentioned in the agreement and NSAI supports any agreement that leads to better mutual recognition of certificates of conformity. As the NSAI is already accredited in a wide range of sectors, the implementation of this agreement does not pose any administrative or technical problems for it.</P>
    <P>The right of fair access to Government contracts is most important and the Agreement on Certain Aspects of Government Procurement will help ensure this. It aims at ensuring harmony between the public procurement regimes of the European Union and Switzerland and to provide for greater reciprocal access to the public procurement markets. The agreement focuses only on certain aspects of public procurement as account has been taken of the already existing agreements in the framework of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Overall, an almost complete reciprocal opening of the respective public procurement markets will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Agreement on Scientific and Technological Co-operation will associate Switzerland with the EU's Fifth Framework Programme for <Col N="863" /> Research, Technology and Development and the corresponding Fifth Framework Programme of Euratom. Up until now, research bodies established in Switzerland have only been able to participate in these research programmes on a project by project basis and without the possibility of launching a research project of their own. Under this agreement they will be allowed to take part on an equal footing with their EU partners. In addition, research bodies in the EU will in future be able to participate in research programmes and projects in Switzerland. The financial contribution by Switzerland to the budgets of the research programmes will be based on the ratio of Switzerland's GDP to that of the member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>While this agreement is not expected to have significant implications for Ireland, it is likely on implementation to increase the number of EU research projects, currently standing at around 60 projects, with both Swiss and Irish involvement.</P>
    <P>All these agreements will be supervised by joint committees, in which decisions will be taken by unanimity. The joint committees will only have decision making powers if this is expressly stated in a particular agreement. Each party is responsible for the application of the agreement in its own territory.</P>
    <P>Section 1(1) is a standard feature defining &ldquo;the Act of 1972&rdquo; as meaning the European Communities Act, 1972. It lists the formal titles of the seven agreements. Section 1(2) is also a standard provision which will enable the 1972 Act to be read as including any amendments that have been made to that Act between 1972 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill amends section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972, by inserting a new subsection, after subsection (2) of that particular Act. The new section provides that from the coming into force of the seven agreements between the EU and Switzerland, their provisions and the Acts to be adopted by any institutions established by those agreements will be binding on the State and that they will have the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill, when enacted, will enable the European Communities Act, 1972, to be used for the future development of the seven agreements and, depending on the precise terms of any development under the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons, to be used also for the future development of that agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will have the effect of converting all existing instruments, for instance EU directives and regulations listed in the seven agreements, and which at present only apply to the member states of the EU, to apply to Switzerland. Section 4 is a standard feature which gives the short title to the Bill, the collective citation, and provides for a commencement order to be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The entry into force and successful application of these agreements will constitute an important step in the development of formal relations <Col N="864" /> between the EU and Switzerland and will form the basis for the future development of relations to the mutual benefit of both sides. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I too commend the Bill to the House and give it a warm welcome. I support it fully and the only criticism I offer is the tardiness of the Government and the Minister's Department in having this legislation prepared to go through. It is almost two years since the Swiss approved this agreement by plebiscite. The negotiations for it started as far back as 1992 and then it was put to all 15 members of the European Union for ratification. We find ourselves second last &ndash; only Belgium has yet to ratify it and they might beat us yet as the matter is currently before the Belgian parliament. All in all it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Switzerland is very much a part of European culture and the European way of life. It sits directly in the centre of western Europe. Ethnically it is made up of French speaking people, German speaking people and Italian speaking people. In every way it represents a great cross-section of European cultures. It has enjoyed 300 years of independence.</P>
      <P>Earlier I spoke at length to the Swiss ambassador, Mr. Pfister, who is present in the Visitors' Gallery. He delivered an address to the Institute of European Affairs recently in which he raised many issues regarding Switzerland's relationship with the EU. A total of 61% of Swiss exports go to EU member states while 71% of its imports come from EU member states. The level of trade between Ireland and other EU member states is similar with perhaps Ireland exporting more to the EU.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered why Switzerland is not enthusiastic about joining the EU but following the initiatives pioneered by Jacques Delors in the early 1990s a debate opened in the country regarding membership of the Union. The first step in this regard involved Switzerland joining the European Economic Area. A plebiscite was held and the proposal was rejected. Many of us who believe very much in the European ideal were disappointed because it was felt the Swiss Confederation would eventually accede to the EU if it joined the European Economic Area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great believer in enlargement and it was hoped that Switzerland would join the Union when Austria, Sweden and Finland joined some years ago. However, Switzerland would be a major loser upon taking up EU membership. I refer to a number of points made by Mr. Pfister during his address to the Institute of European Affairs. He said Switzerland would be a net contributor to the EU budget because of its high level of development and prosperity. It would have to contribute 4 billion Swiss francs per annum while it would receive approximately 1 million Swiss francs in return. That is a large sum in terms of the Swiss Confederation's budget. <Col N="865" /> One can understand how difficult it would be to sway public opinion in favour of EU membership.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of VAT in Switzerland is 7.5% but on taking up membership of the EU it would be obliged to raise it to 15%. That would create significant difficulties for a government in any country, no matter how prosperous. The agriculture industry is small but powerful in Switzerland and the rural way of life is close to the hearts of its people. Its countryside is beautifully preserved and the Alpine landscape is among the most beautiful in the world.</P>
    <P>Swiss farmers are the most subsidised in the world but there has been a move to reduce the level of subsidisation. The ambassador stated Switzerland invented the concept of direct payment rather than direct intervention to underpin farmers' incomes. Direct income support has been part of Swiss agricultural policy for many years. However, Swiss farmers would lose out if they adopted the EU farm support model because the level of supports would be reduced. It would be almost impossible to sell EU membership to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Euro-scepticism is more prevalent among the German speaking population of Switzerland while there is almost a complete absence of scepticism about EU membership among the French speaking population. There are historical reasons for that. However, according to recent opinion polls, accession to the EU is more popular among younger people than older people in all communities, irrespective of their linguistic or ethnic backgrounds.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the liberalisation of agricultural trade, there are not many products that Ireland could trade with Switzerland, which is self-sufficient in terms of food production. The Swiss consume everything they produce whereas we export almost 80% of our beef, sheep and dairy produce. Nevertheless there must be opportunities for both countries under this liberalised trade regime as technical barriers which interfered with agricultural trade have been removed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the agreement on the free movement of persons and the granting to Swiss citizens of all the rights that I, as an EU citizen, would enjoy if I moved to France or any other EU member state. It is a move in the right direction towards greater integration as Swiss people will enjoy the privilege and freedom to live in other EU member states without facing work permit problems and so on. That is bound to lead to much greater movement of people between various European countries.</P>
    <P>A former neighbour of mine had moved from Switzerland to County Roscommon and for many years she sought freedom to work here. She had many skills and she applied to become a citizen of the State having lived here for ten years. I made representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department of Foreign Affairs has always been much more helpful in such cases than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, the person <Col N="866" /> we had to convince at the end of the day was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and we did not succeed. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not very fond of foreigners, no matter where they come from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>My good neighbour has now returned to Switzerland because she became frustrated with all the problems in trying to get work permits and so on. This Bill would have given her the freedom to work in this country. That was my direct experience of someone coming from a European country which was not a member state of the European Union having great difficulty trying to make a living in a country she loved and wished to make her home. Nevertheless, she found a hostile attitude and environment in terms of providing a living for herself.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the liberalisation of civil aviation. Regrettably, it has come too late for one of the great international air carriers, Swissair, which is now effectively bankrupt. No doubt it suffered because Switzerland could not participate in the liberalisation of air transport in Europe which has been taking place for approximately 15 years. This resulted in new private airlines competing with many of the great national flag carriers such as Sabena which did not adapt in time to the realities of the marketplace and now find themselves bankrupt. Companies who became fettered to companies like Swissair found themselves dragged down with them. Our own national airline suffered as a result of the emergence in this country of Europe's largest and most successful private airline, and good luck to it.</P>
      <P>Those who have benefited from the liberalisation of air transport have been the flying public or consumers on whose side most people in this House are. I live close to Knock airport and during the summer one of the Swiss airlines, Crossair, operated three return flights a week bringing tourists from Switzerland to the west of Ireland. Liberalisation will assist this type of trade.</P>
      <P>I live in and represented in the other House an area which depends very much on tourism. One of the great problems in this regard has been access, a problem which is further exacerbated by technical barriers. Because of aviation policy and other irritatingly technical reasons, a carrier cannot operate charter flights into small regional airports in another country. This section of the agreement, by and large, deals with that issue, which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the overland transport provisions. Nowadays we transport directly a lot of merchandise to countries such as Italy. Much of this merchandise is transported through Switzerland and the Alpine passes. Much fresh meat was transported to Italy from this country until the BSE scare began over a year ago. This was transported through France but when it reached the Swiss border there were certain technical barriers and <Col N="867" /> a greater level of bureaucracy and paper work purely because one was entering a non-EU country and exiting from it into, say, Italy which is an EU country.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that Switzerland is taking the opportunity of this agreement to re-organise its transport, in particular its railway system. It intends to work in close co-operation with its European neighbours such as Italy, France, Germany and Austria to develop a whole new rail infrastructure which will use the Alpine passes. There have been a number of accidents on the road system through the Alps, many of which turned out to be catastrophies. It is very interesting that the Swiss Government wants a reduction of 50% in heavy goods transport through these passes in the next number of years. In fact, it wants to reduce this traffic to 650,000 per annum which will make it expensive and inconvenient for the huge volume of heavy goods vehicles using these routes. Some of the tunnels were constructed in the 1980s, while some are of the 1950s and 1960s vintage and no longer have the capacity to cope with the current levels of traffic.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the new transport policy operated by the Swiss Government and the Swiss cantons will focus on rail, forcing heavy goods vehicles on to the railways. Large trucks travelling through the Channel tunnel do not have to load their containers on to a railway carriage. The whole truck goes on to a carriage and is transported through, which is the way to operate. This minimises accidents, increases speed efficiency and so on, which is a far cry from what is happening in this country. We are proposing to take freight from our railways and put it on to our already choked and totally inadequate roads system. Could we take a more retrograde step?</P>
    <P>The Swiss Government, which is in tune with the needs of the modern world, is taking the opportunity offered by this agreement to re-organise its transport system and orientate its heavy goods traffic towards the railways. Because of its location, a large volume of trade passes through Switzerland, which is taking advantage of this agreement. I would like the Government and the Minister, who is a pragmatic man, to take that lesson.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to welcome the Bill, which my party supports. It is a pity we did not deal with the issue long ago. I hope that it will have a free passage through the Dáil next week. Perhaps in the meantime Belgium will have completed the process. I hope this agreement will be fully in operation by 30 November or by the end of December at the latest and that it will lead to closer co-operation between Switzerland and the European Union and closer trading co-operation between Switzerland and Ireland. There is the potential for closer and friendlier relations.</P>
    <P>I hope this historic step is seized upon by the Swiss people and that it will be a move towards greater integration within the European Union. <Col N="868" /> When the next debate on enlargement begins &ndash; the debate Jacques Delors began around 1990 opened the debate in Switzerland &ndash; perhaps the Swiss will take the option to join the European Union. After 1 January, every country surrounding Switzerland will be using the euro currency. While it operates a very strong internationally recognised and traded currency, nevertheless it will create major difficulties given that 79% of its exports will be from countries that use a single currency.</P>
    <P>There are many persuasive arguments why Switzerland should become a member of the European Union. I am sure the ambassador, who was here today, agrees. I hope ultimately that his Government will also agree and that the people, who enjoy the unique popular sovereignty that operates there, requiring all major questions to be put to the people, agree too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this is a short Bill, it is important and has profound implications for the way Switzerland and the European Union deal with each other. If we look at the reasons behind the framing of this Bill and why the agreements are necessary, we need to look at how Switzerland orders her affairs and how she behaves. For many decades, Switzerland has enjoyed economic and political stability which is due to the <i>status quo</i> being maintained among the political parties. There is an emphasis on stability and consensus at Government level and in labour relations. There have been practically no strikes in Switzerland since the 1930s. I wish other countries could follow that example. Switzerland, in the way political business is carried out with frequent referenda, is an example of democracy <i>par excellence.</i> In order to understand the importance of these agreements and how they were initiated, we need to examine the way she conducts her affairs with the European Union and the rest of the world. One of the main principles guiding foreign policy in Switzerland is that of neutrality which dates back to the 16th century and has been recognised since the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Although Switzerland is in the &lsquo;cockpit of Europe' and was surrounded by many countries at war during the First and Second World Wars, her neutrality has never been violated nor has she ever entered into any military alliances.</P>
      <P>In 1997 Switzerland joined the Partnership for Peace, which belies some of the rubbish that was talked about when we were debating our membership of that organisation. We were told around the time of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice that it would infringe our neutrality and that we would be marching with NATO. It shows that a country which is really neutral can be comfortable joining an organisation like that. We have fortunately come to that view now but some of the scaremongering, particularly during referendum campaigns, should be seen in the light of a progressive country and the way it conducts its affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Switzerland operates a principle of solidarity. <Col N="869" /> She believes that she is morally obliged to help countries with humanitarian aid and contribute to world peace and stability. Although Switzerland is not a member of the UN, interestingly a large number of UN organisations is stationed there. There will be a debate in 2002 as to whether the Switzerland will join the UN.</P>
    <P>The principle of universality is also central. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations and dialogue with every country regardless of the government of that country. The Swiss are therefore more interested in talking than fighting, which demonstrates the old adage of &lsquo;jaw-jaw instead of war-war'. She also operates the principle of availability, making her good offices available to help solve the problems of other countries.</P>
    <P>Switzerland was a founder member of the European Free Trade Association and since 1972, when she signed the agreement with the EEC, the government has maintained European membership as a long-term objective. She has not become a member yet, not just because the vote was against membership, but also because the Swiss have a different way of doing business. They base co-operation on the basis of treaties with member states of the EU. They have a number of bilateral agreements with other countries but within the EU they have almost 100 different bilateral trade agreements that deal with the movement of goods and with goods generally.</P>
    <P>Given the three traditional obstacles to full EU membership, Switzerland's neutrality, federalism and direct democracy system, membership of the European economic area was identified in the late 1980s as a golden mean solution which requires neither involvement in a common foreign and security policy with regard to third countries, nor a common monetary policy with EU partners. Moreover it would not be necessary to adapt Swiss legislation. However in December 1992 the EEA option was rejected in a referendum by 50.3% of the electorate. It was a close margin, something we have been subjected to in some referenda here. Since that referendum defeat the Swiss Government has focused its attention on bilateral, sector-by-sector negotiations which is why these negotiations are so important, not just for the EU but for Switzerland particularly.</P>
    <P>It is also important for us because we trade extensively with Switzerland, making it Ireland's 12th largest trading partner and 10th largest export market. She is Ireland's fourth largest non-European Union trading partner after the US, Japan and Singapore. The balance of trade is heavily in favour of Ireland, with the value of Irish exports to Switzerland five times higher than imports from there. In the past year, Ireland has overtaken countries such as China, Sweden and Spain to become one of the ten largest exporters to Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Two-way trade between Ireland and Switzerland has increased steadily in the past decade and reached a new peak of £1.9 billion in 2000. Irish <Col N="870" /> exports were valued at £1.6 billion in 2000, a year-on-year increase of 29%. Swiss exports to Ireland were valued at £3.2 million, a year-on-year increase of 44%. It is worth noting that Swiss multinationals are among the largest exporters of chemicals and pharmaceuticals to Switzerland. Nevertheless, the balance is in our favour and we welcome bilateral relations with Switzerland, particularly in relation to trade.</P>
    <P>These trade negotiations are important because the Swiss economy is highly international, integrated and capitalises on an open-trade regime for industrial products. Tariffs on manufacturers are generally low and in principle there are no quantative restrictions, anti-dumping, countervailing or safeguard actions. However, in a number of sectors, market entry has long suffered from private or informal barriers which can be attributed to a legacy of weak anti-cartel legislation, specific and protective technical regulations, certain investment restrictions and exclusive rights under intellectual property legislation.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector in Switzerland is strongly protected and enjoys the world's highest subsidies. This, together with the weak competition for a range of goods and services, means high consumer prices, well above the levels of neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>We know well that the banking community has special arrangements in Switzerland. There are special laws on bank secrecy and non co-operation in the prosecution of fiscal crimes. About one third of the world's offshore private banking market is controlled in Switzerland. Nevertheless, Swwitzerland is a country with which we do an enormous amount of trade and we are eager to see this legislation go through. It is important that it does so quickly because there are about seven agreements, most of which can be agreed by the European Parliament on behalf of the European Union, but the agreement on the free movement of persons has to be ratified individually by all the member states in the EU.</P>
    <P>It has been asked if there will be an influx of Swiss people into Ireland as a result of this legislation but I do not believe there will. It will make it easier for Swiss people and Irish people to tranfer from one country to another or to take up residence or employment in either country, but I do not expect the numbers to be significant. There will be no significant cost to social security benefits because the majority of these are covered by the regulations in the freedom of movement agreement and already covered by the bilateral social security agreement between Ireland and Switzerland which came into effect in 1999.</P>
    <P>There is a way in which we can expect to improve significantly the access for agricultural products to both parties' markets by abolishing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. A large number of tariff concessions have been granted for cheeses, milk products, beef products, fresh and prepared fruit and vegetables and wine products. The section on wines and spirits will provide <Col N="871" /> protection for Irish denominations including Irish cream and whiskey, while the section on veterinary rules will require Switzerland to apply the same rules as apply in the community to imports from third countries, which is important from a food safety point of view.</P>
    <P>There has been reference both in the House and outside to the implications of agreements on air transport for Ireland, particularly Aer Lingus. Most national flag carriers in Europe are facing difficulties. However, the agreement will merely ensure fair rules of competition are applied to all. The aim is to apply liberalisation in a reciprocal manner to both European Union and Swiss carriers on the basis of the Community <i>accueil.</i> Following the introduction of this agreement any support for Swiss airlines by the Swiss authorities will need to be examined and approved by the European Commission's competition authorities in the same way as for European member states. This will be new for Switzerland and the purpose is to level the playing pitch for all.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus no longer flies directly to Zurich, but operates a co-share arrangement with the Swiss airline Crossair. This service is important, given the growing number of Swiss visitors to Ireland and the potential for developing the Swiss market for Irish tourism. The agreement will provide greater access for Irish carriers to operate services between Ireland and Switzerland should they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through all the details of the agreement. However, the agreement on land transport will allow immediate access for 40 tonne vehicles to the main Swiss economic centres. If I were a Swiss person, this is the only part of any of these agreements that I would be worried about. I would say to the Swiss that they are crazy to let these huge trucks roll through their beautiful countryside. Apart from that, we should move to ratify these agreements and pass this Bill very quickly because the Swiss government is really to have this settled by 1 January 2002. I believe we are one of the last countries to ratify this and we should do so immediately. We have good relations with Switzerland, which we wish to maintain. We hope to continue to trade with her and these agreements can only enhance that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. I will spare him going through all of it as Senators Connor and Lydon have done that very ably. However, there is one section of the Bill that I find particularly interesting as a doctor and as someone involved in medical research. That is the agreement on scientific and technological co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not completely agree with the Minister when he said: &ldquo;While this agreement is not expected to have significant implications for Ireland, it is likely on implementation to increase the number of EU research projects, currently standing at around 60 projects, with both Swiss <Col N="872" /> and Irish involvement.&rdquo;  I hope this agreement might have a very strong implication for Ireland. I ask the Minister to address the implications of the patenting of human genes. I have already failed to get the Tánaiste, whose Department covers patenting, to deal with this. The Minister for Health and Children did not seem to understand what I felt was the importance of this for us.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Switzerland both have large pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. I hope the biotechnology industry, which we are developing here, will not be like our computer companies, which ended up being sub-contractors for various American firms who, when there was any contraction in the market, frequently went back to base with consequent loss of jobs here. Our biotechnology industry is extraordinarily important, as is that of Switzerland.</P>
    <P>However the Swiss authorities have taken a more serious look at the question of the patenting of human genes. This happened because of the influence of the American biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. They succeeded in persuading the US Supreme Court that anything under the sun could be patented. As the Minister is aware, for something to be patented, it has to be an invention; it has to be original and not obvious; and it has to have industrial application. Very many scientists, including those working in America, feel that human genes are not inventions. They are part of our shared history and are discoveries. One just sees the coding of a section of DNA sequences. Firms within the United States of America have succeeded in patenting huge numbers of these sequences without there being any application for these genes at the time. The European Union looked at this for about ten years and agreed to the patenting of human genes in 1998.</P>
    <P>Although I feel there are very serious ethical and moral issues involved, there are also the technical and industrial aspects of this. Any research in these countries is stymied by the fact that tests cannot be promoted because the patents are held by American companies. For example, in Ireland we do significant work on breast cancer genes and we have to send tests from Irish women to Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, where it costs $1,800 to have the tests carried out. However, both the French and Swiss feel they have tests in this area which are far more reliable, better suited to the genetics of the European population and which can be procured for about a third of the price. This is important to us because our health service has to pay for these genes. However, it is also important because it stymies research here into the development of any tests in this area. It also impedes progress in the treatment of patients here because the patient's clinical considerations are not taken into account side by side with the tests which have to be sent to Salt Lake City.</P>
    <P>Some countries decided not to take this lying down and the Swiss were to the forefront. The Swiss and French have brought cases to the Euro<Col N="873" /> pean courts over this. First, their genetic associations objected and this was followed by support from their governments. Some of the major scientific institutions in France such as the Institute Curie led the opposition to this development. The human genome is our shared history. It is not something that any pharmaceutical or biotechnology company should be allowed to put forward as an invention.</P>
    <P>I strongly applaud the Swiss for what they have done in this area. They have been supported by Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Germany and the UK, but my requests to our Government to join in the repudiation of this approach to human genetics has not met with any success in either the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Department of Health and Children. Now the European Parliament has joined the objections. I urge the Minister to persuade the Government to join the Swiss and French to stop this outrageous practice.</P>
    <P>When there was an anthrax problem in the US recently, the Americans very rapidly broke Bayer's patent on the antibiotic Cipro. It was then manufactured by pharmaceutical companies throughout America with great alacrity. We, in Europe, should not allow this to go on. In these scientific areas in particular, I am very pleased that we will have the Swiss as partners in many of the projects. They have a very good record in this area and I look forward to their future involvement.</P>
    <P>Unionists like me have attended the national forum on Europe. When the Minister is concluding, he may be able to allay some of my confusion about some of what we heard there on Monday. For example we had the Danish MEP, Jens-Peter Bonde, and the debate that day was on enlargement of the European Union. He said that the Treaty of Nice protocol on enlargement does not in any way mean that the European Union cannot enlarge. That included using the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; theory now being put forward by the European Commission that ten countries could be admitted by the end of next year. I do not know whether it is proposed that they will be brought in on some basis, like making agreements with them as was done with Switzerland. It seems very confusing. He said that the Nice treaty was irrelevant regarding enlargement and I began to wonder why on earth we had that debate. The Minister will be relieved to hear that I was one of the 35 &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; voters. Only another 34 people have to admit that they voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and if the Minister admits he was another one, the total will be 36.</P>
    <P>This is something that needs rapid clarification. Applicant countries must be extraordinarily confused by the major statement in the European Commission report on enlargement last week. I read the report and did not find Ireland mentioned once &ndash; maybe I skipped over it but it seemed more concerned with the Turkish part of Cyprus than Ireland. There was talk about the Commission producing a new road map for enlargement and that eight or ten countries <Col N="874" /> would be ready to join by the end of next year. I had thought that only five could be admitted under the Amsterdam treaty. The Commission points out that the Gothenburg European Council invited the candidate countries to translate the Union's economic, social and environmental objectives into their national policies. Why would they ask that unless candidate countries can come in with the greatest possible speed? This seems to be what they were saying.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement that the Nice treaty had to be ratified before that could take place. Perhaps when replying he will clarify that. Otherwise, judging from what one reads from the Commission, it appears there will be accession treaties all the way. Is an accession treaty necessary for admission of each country? If so, legislation like will be before us for quite some time.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House too long on this legislation. It is short legislation with important implications and most of what needs to be said about it has already been said. Senator Connor mentioned the delays in our ratifying this agreement and said that the target date is January 2002. If there is a delay in its implementation, the blame can be put on the Swiss. They rejected entry to the EU, and had they joined this process would not be necessary. We are drip-feeding measures into our legislation which are of mutual benefit. In the form of democracy peculiar to Switzerland, entry to the EU can be turned down if, for example, they do not want their trade or agriculture to suffer. They do this on a step-by-step basis and then come to us seeking mutually beneficial agreements. We should not be blamed for delays caused.</P>

Maybe one person was affected and there have been reciprocal problems for Irish people trying to work in Switzerland. There will not be a huge difference in the numbers of people who will move from here to Switzerland or <i>vice versa.</i> If there is to be movement it should be free and reciprocal arrangements in employment should be sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We constantly hear about Swiss neutrality. Neutrality has been beneficial to Switzerland, but I am not sure if it has benefited other countries. I have most difficulties with the secrecy in the Swiss banking system. Were it not for this mooted secrecy, maybe a more open society would have <Col N="875" /> existed sooner rather than later in Europe after the Second World War. Switzerland was used by the Nazis to launder money. They were neutral during the war but the amount of money they syphoned off through Nazi gold is not something of which to be proud.</P>
    <P>We must look again at this issue. In Ireland we try to find where the proceeds arising from tax evasion have gone but find it virtually impossible due to secrecy in offshore banking systems. That also applies in Switzerland. We must realise that money is at the root of most terrorist acts. If money is deposited in secret accounts in Switzerland and used by terrorist organisations, that must be addressed by the international community. One of the reasons it cannot address this matter is that Switzerland is not a member of the United Nations and is therefore not under its rule &ndash; the rule by which 99% of countries want to abide. We are told that it might join the UN in 2003, but I suggest that some canton will have a reason to oppose joining when it comes to a referendum.</P>
    <P>Mutual recognition in terms of conformity assessment is important but it will not have to be of major consequence in Government procurement. I am not sure if we have applied to enter major contracts in Switzerland. I know that the outlook for trade between Ireland and Switzerland is good and that trade has been good in the past. I believe that we exported about $969 million worth of goods to Switzerland and imported $170 million worth. The trade is to our benefit and bilateral agreements should further increase that trade.</P>
    <P>As regards airlines, the pitch will be levelled as the Swiss adopt a similar policy to airlines to that adopted by the EU. The fact that Switzerland exports a large amount of materials to Europe and imports the majority of its goods from Europe is not surprising given its central location and the difficulties it has in exporting &ndash; goods must be exported by road, rail or air. Switzerland is inaccessible in ways, despite being strategically well placed, and it has to export and import a huge proportion of goods.</P>
    <P>The legislation is necessary. There may have been recent changes in the laws of secrecy in Swiss banks, though I have not come across any. If there have not been, then it is time that we as members of the EU and the UN put on as much pressure as possible to make certain nothing untoward is happening in the banking system in Switzerland. It took from the end of the last war to the mid-1990s to get any sort of reaction from the Swiss banking system and Government regarding the repayment of money stolen from German Jews during and immediately after the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. It is important to have this debate in the context of the developing relationship that exists between <Col N="876" /> Switzerland and the EU. The fact is that Switzerland is a respected member of the international community and one that has for many years developed bilateral and other relations with institutions like the EU in a way which is to our mutual benefit. I welcome the fact that today we seek to proceed with the passing of this Bill as part of the necessary placing on a legal basis the seven sectoral agreements which were agreed between the EU and Switzerland to facilitate the greater development of that relationship, including in economic and social terms. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>
      <P>I have met the Swiss Foreign Minister, Mr. Deiss, on a number of occasions. He was here as recently as 11 October when we discussed a range of issues of mutual interest. I raised with Mr. Deiss banking secrecy and the measures being taken by the Swiss authorities to ensure that Switzerland and its banks will not be used for any untoward reason and he assured me that Swiss controls in this area were and are on a par with those in place in the United States and elsewhere. I acknowledge that completely. Obviously they are people who are respected in the financial services area and who have had a pre-eminent role in the development of international financial services. Of course they will seek to maintain and develop that in the future and will do so on the basis of being a compliant country in respect of international obligations which apply to us all in the face of the most recent threat to international peace and security on 11 September.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the scientific and technological agreement which will enable Swiss scientists to participate in the fifth EU research programme. It does not in any way address the issue of human genetics or any other specific research programmes. It will be a matter for individual scientists and research institutes to agree among themselves on the projects they wish to work. I thank Senators for raising issues regarding trade and the opportunities that will now present themselves as a result of the passing of this legislation in the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned an issue in relation to enlargement as if there were some confusion about it. It is true that during the Nice referendum campaign a suggestion was made, to which some credence was given, that there was a prospect of enlargement taking place in the next phase which would not require ratification in the treaty. Commissioner Verheugen's report to the General Affairs Council last Monday was adopted by that council and will now go forward to the Laeken European Council, where heads of Government will consider the report. In respect of the EU report on the progress being made by applicant countries and enlargement, the stated position of Commissioner Verheugen is that anything up to ten countries may well have completed their negotiations by the end of 2002. That being the case, there is no political reality to what Mr. Bonde from Denmark said last Monday or <Col N="877" /> during the Nice treaty campaign when he made similar points.</P>
    <P>The idea that one is going to see an accession possibly of ten member states in addition to the existing 15, without ratification of the Nice treaty, has no reality. It has no political reality at all. We know from the Berlin Summit that the financial basis to facilitate enlargement up to 2006 was agreed and the financial prospectus was agreed. Nice was about making the institutional arrangements to enable enlargement to take place; that is precisely what the Nice treaty was about. How does one ensure that the institutions can work and what rules will apply in the context of a European Union of 15 nations being enlarged to 25, taking on board the prediction of the Commissioner dealing with this and negotiating with these applicant states on behalf of the EU? He is stating categorically that up to ten will have completed their negotiations successfully with the EU by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped giving credence to views which are not shared by any government. No head of the European Council is going to allow enlargement of the EU to take place and the instruments of accession to be lodged with the European institutions without ratification of the Treaty of Nice. If anyone thinks otherwise they are not living in the real political world in which we have to operate. It is time for that sort of nonsense to be removed from the very important work the national forum is doing, which is addressing for ourselves where we fit and making an assessment of the benefits of European Union membership, looking at that in the round for the credit balance and any perceived debit balance people wish to raise. Clearly, on any objective assessment, taking the whole situation into account, anyone who would suggest that it is not in Ireland's interest or our political destiny to be full participant members of the EU going forward has a very naive and dangerous understanding of how the economy works and what impact we can have in a globalising world, where we can share, initiate, adapt and contribute to the formulation of common policies under the aegis of the EU which will provide not just prosperity for our people but maintain peace and security on our continent and further afield. That is the reality with which we must come to terms. It is not something we must accept as if it were an unwelcome development. It is in fact the means by which the modern Ireland in which we live has been built. The place and status this country is now accorded in the international community is precisely because of the responsible and participating role successive Irish Governments have taken in the EU and in other international fora.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear. We need to recognise that even those who were opposed to the Nice treaty in the last referendum campaign claim they are in favour of enlargement. I take their word that they are in favour of it. People may agree it is right that emerging democracies in former Communist <Col N="878" /> countries in central and eastern Europe can reintegrate with the European family, of which they were always part. People may also agree it is right that this should happen because we support democratic values, which are shared by those in government in those countries now, and for hard headed commercial and economic reasons and our own self-interest given that every enlargement thus far has created greater economic prosperity and economic opportunity for an economy that lives by its trade. The people who were against the Nice treaty in the last referendum said they were in favour of enlargement and, since our referendum campaign, it has become clear that up to ten countries will be ready for accession by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>On that basis, how can anybody suggest it is in Ireland's interest to put a brake on enlargement, which would happen if we do not facilitate enlargement by ensuring that Ireland is one of 15 countries that ratify the Treaty of Nice? The European Council in Gothenburg made the position clear. While there is much sympathy for the Irish Government, the Parliament and the people in terms of respecting the sovereign decision of the people on that day&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We respect the decision and the European Council showed its solidarity with the Government in accepting, as we did, that it was the decision on the day. However, the Gothenburg European Council conclusions confirmed that the Treaty of Nice is not up for renegotiation. The other 14 member states negotiated the treaty in Nice in long, thorough, intense and forthright discussions. A political consensus emerged from these negotiations on how the European Union would enlarge and what institutional arrangements would be put in place to facilitate that enlargement. That being the case, the suggestion that enlargement will take place without the Treaty of Nice being ratified defies logic. I also question the political capacity or the ability to recognise political realities of anybody who makes that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must use the forum as a means of trying to deal with the concerns that were raised during the campaign and to find out in what way we can seek to resolve some of those issues which do not cause problems for member states who are ratifying the Treaty of Nice. We must then go back to the people with a considered proposal that is the best possible option in the interests of ensuring that we do not cut off our nose to spite our face and end up committing what I would regard as the serious and fundamental political error of suggesting that Ireland, by the end of 2002, would not have ratified the Treaty of Nice in a way that would allow enlargement to take place, thereby defying the political will of not only the European Union, but the 120 million people in the applicant countries who are committed to democratic values which we claim to share. We must be logi<Col N="879" /> cal and credible. I hope this national debate will be conducted in a way that informs people and does not foment confusion or cause the air of unreality that, unfortunately, dominated the referendum campaign on the last occasion. However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, I appreciate the contributions of Members. I recognise that the legislation has the unanimous support of the parties and Independents in the House. We wish Switzerland and its people well on the road they wish to choose. It is the sovereign right of every country to decide how it wishes to proceed in developing a relationship with the European Union. This is the point of development we have reached. Ireland is not at the centre of Europe &ndash; it is peripheral in geographical terms &ndash; but its membership of the EU since 1 January 1973 has brought about many benefits in many ways not only in economic and political areas but in social and cultural areas. To my mind, it has been the platform for the modernisation of Ireland over two political generations.</P>
    <P>From our point of view, we will seek, through our actions and the development of our relationship with Switzerland, to encourage the deepening of its relationship with the EU. Eventually, this may lead, subject to the agreement of the Swiss people, to full membership of the European Union. However, that is a decision for them in their own time and we totally respect their position. In the meantime, we recognise that our bilateral relations with Switzerland are excellent and we wish to develop them. We will continue to work with the Swiss Government for the mutual benefit of both nations and to ensure the relationship between the two countries continues apace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recommends the immediate introduction of random breath testing by the Garda as a response to the continuing unacceptable high level of slaughter on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me an opportunity to speak. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. I am pleased he is here as I know he is committed to this topic. I was quite excited when I saw the Government amendment to my motion, as I briefly thought it condemns the Government before I realised it calls on Seanad Éireann to commend the Government. For a few moments, I was interested to see that the Government side was supporting me to an extent. I am not here to condemn anyone, however, but to draw attention to the carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain why I am testing the patience of this House by putting down yet another motion on road safety. I am in no doubt as to Members' feelings on the topic, as we have discussed it on countless occasions on the Order of Business and during formal debates. The Minister of State has been here on a number of occasions and I know his heart is in the right place. I have learnt from previous discussions that everyone in the House is appalled by the continuing slaughter on our roads. Members are disappointed and angry at the lack of progress that has been made in addressing the problem. None of us believes that enough is being done to promote road safety, or that measures are being put in place quickly enough. The Minister's attention is needed as my comments apply to his area of responsibility. His heart is in the right place, but nobody believes that we are sufficiently combating the carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>What is the point in raising this matter tonight? I simply wish to highlight the need for clear and simple action to show the people that the Government is committed to road safety. Three separate issues indicate that such a need exists. The first of these is the long delay in giving teeth to the national road safety strategy by passing the necessary supporting legislation. The public has been given the impression that road safety is low on the Government's list of priorities. The Minister of State will tell me that measures will be taken tomorrow, but I will return to that.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a penalty points system, under which a driving licence can be taken away if a driver exceeds a set number of points, is a central plank of the national strategy, which was published in 1997. Two things are needed if the points system is to be put in place: legislation to underpin the scheme and a new computer system to make it work. Four years after the publication of the strategy, the Road Traffic Bill, 2001, will receive its first reading in the Dáil tomorrow. It will not matter if the Bill passes speedily through the Oireachtas, however, as I understand the computer system to operate the points scheme is not yet in place, which has given rise to further delays. I am not sure if the computer system has even gone to tender yet. It is extremely unlikely, therefore, that the penalty points scheme will be in place before the five year term of the national road safety strategy has expired. The points scheme is a central plank of the safety strategy. The regrettable delays in passing legislation and <Col N="881" /> establishing a computer system are reasons people are unconvinced that the Government is serious about this matter.</P>
    <P>A second factor which demonstrates the need for clear action and which is even more regrettable is the continuing carnage on the roads. In the first two years of the national road safety strategy, we saw a significant and highly welcome reduction in the number of road deaths. The reduction coincided with the arrival into office of the Minister. We were led to hope that the target of a 20% reduction in road deaths from the 1997 level might be achieved over the five year period of the strategy. Some people thought the target was ambitious, but others felt it did not go far enough, given that our road death level is twice that in the United Kingdom. At least we had set a target and in the first two years of the road safety strategy it seemed progress was being made. The progress stopped, however, and the number of deaths increased last year. It was a small increase and I would not like to make too much of it, but the real point is that the reduction of the previous two years did not continue.</P>
    <P>It looks unlikely that this year's road death figures will show a reduction, as there have been 360 deaths so far, even before we encounter the most dangerous period of the year. The possibility of finishing the year below last year's level of 415 deaths now seems tragically remote. We have to ask ourselves why progress stopped. There are, no doubt, many reasons, but I suggest that one of them is that people have stopped believing in the 1997 road safety strategy. There has been a lack of strong national leadership on the issue. Those who have become cynical about the Government's seriousness regarding road safety have good reason for their cynicism.</P>
    <P>The third reason a single clear and simple gesture is needed is, paradoxically, because road safety is quite a complex subject. The problem does not respond quickly to a single dramatic gesture. A couple of years ago, I proposed that a weekend be devoted to increasing public awareness of the problem. The National Safety Council made a valiant effort, but there was no suggestion that such a weekend would solve the problem. It is a problem which needs to be attacked on many fronts and sustained over a long period. In other words, it needs to be tackled in precisely the way outlined in the national road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>It is now clear, however, that this approach lacks one vital ingredient &ndash; an element which will catch the imagination of the public. It lacks the ability to mobilise the public and unite them in a conviction that this problem can be solved if we really put our mind to it nationally. The strategy, because of its nature and because it is being held back by foot dragging on the part of the Government, has become a dead issue with most of the people of Ireland. I am inclined to believe that if one went out into the streets tomorrow and asked a sample of people about the national road safety strategy, the vast majority would not even know what one was talking about. That is a <Col N="882" /> dreadful situation, one which bodes badly for an improvement in it. While it is true that some elements of the national road safety strategy such as the provision of better, safer roads will take effect regardless of whether the public knows about it, the reality is that the ultimate success of the strategy depends overwhelmingly on the people getting behind it and making it work. At the end of the day, it is people who one must change.</P>
    <P>Safer roads can make a difference, safer cars can make a difference but ultimately only safer driving will make a real difference. It is only by changing people's attitudes and changing their behaviour that we can ever hope to get the level of road deaths down to the level in Britain &ndash; and in Britain they think they have a problem. Because people are disillusioned, disappointed and even cynical about the issue, the problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Above and beyond all the complex and worthy elements of the national road safety strategy, there is a pressing need at this time to send a clear message to the public. We need to say, first, that we are serious about tackling the problem and, second, that the people themselves must start taking the problem much more seriously too. Third, we need to say that as a nation we must face up to the fact that alcohol is perhaps the biggest single factor in fatal road accidents. It is for this reason that I suggest the best way we can send a clear signal to the public is by the introduction of random breath testing.</P>
    <P>The reason we need random breath testing is very simple. It is to increase the chance of being caught if one drives when over the breath test limit. At present the reality is that one's chances of getting away with drinking and driving are very high indeed. That is exactly my point. The deterrent effect of the consequence of being caught is diluted precisely by the chances against getting caught at all.</P>
    <P>Under the current system the chances of being caught are very low indeed. One need only look at the situation in Scandinavia to see the truth of this. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be aware of the situation in Scandinavia. The likelihood of getting caught there is very high and the consequences are swift, certain and drastic. The result is that people in Scandinavia do not drink and drive &ndash; it is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Of course I am not arguing that just by introducing random breath testing one can change overnight the attitudes or, even more importantly, the behaviour of a nation. Such a change involves a shift in culture and that would take some time to achieve, but random breath testing would be a step in the right direction and, I believe, a highly useful step.</P>
    <P>Many Members will remember that in a sense we have actually been here before. A few years ago there was a major pre-Christmas crackdown on drink driving. It was well publicised in advance and it was very instructive to see how people reacted. We all remember it well. People gen<Col N="883" /> uinely felt they would get caught if they drank and drove and that year they changed their behaviour, but only until they realised that the chances of being caught had not really changed much at all. While the chances had increased, it was not by so much as to create a high likelihood that the offenders would be caught. As soon as people realised that, they began slipping back into their old ways.</P>
    <P>I want to make two further points in favour of the motion before commending it to the House. The first is about the argument that the real offenders where drink driving is concerned will not be affected by any changes of this kind. That, I am sure, is the first argument which will be made. The people who get killed are not a broad cross section of the population but they are a sub-section of it. To a large extent, they are young and inexperienced drivers and if we want to reduce road deaths, we should target those people directly, not the whole population. Whether or not it is a problem restricted to a small segment of the population, to young people &ndash; and particularly younger males &ndash; it is the entire population who must change it. The young people who recklessly drink and drive do not do so in a vacuum. They do so in a society which is scandalously tolerant of that kind of behaviour. The young people behave that way because they are part of a society which tolerates such behaviour. If society as whole changes, so will the behaviour of young people.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to address is what I would call the civil liberty argument. This is the contention that random breath testing would be a serious and unacceptable invasion of our personal rights and personal freedoms. It is a contention which is often made, not in its own right but as a cover for the vested interests such as the interests of the alcoholic drink industry itself. This is my response to that argument. First, any diminution of our liberties involved in random breath testing is far outweighed by the benefits the community would derive from it in lives saved, injuries avoided and costs which would not have to be borne. Second, random breath testing is accepted in many other countries where it does not seem to have significantly diluted the general level of personal freedom. Third, and perhaps most pointedly, how is it that we do not seem to have any problem with the Garda carrying out entirely random checks of road tax and insurance documents and of driving licences? I am regularly stopped to see if I have got insurance. While driving without proper road tax or insurance or without a valid driving licences are offences under the law, such offences, compared to drinking and driving, are far less likely to cause an accident. How is it that random checks are acceptable in the case of relatively trivial offences such as those to which I referred but suddenly become unacceptable when it is a matter of life and death?</P>
    <P>I really believe this is the opportunity the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, can grasp which will <Col N="884" /> make an impact on the nation as a whole and draw the attention of people to the horrific figures we see week after week &ndash; I will not touch on any particular case but there have been one or two accidents recently which were just so horrific. It will draw our attention to it and make us say that we must do something. Here is the dramatic step we can take which will actually be a step in that direction. I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry:</NameTxt>
      <P>While asking for the introduction of random breath testing may not increase one's popularity as a politician a great deal with the electorate, naturally as a doctor I must support Senator Quinn's call to introduce random breath testing and second his motion. However, it would be most important that the Department ensures whatever type of apparatus it decides to use for breath testing in future will be both legal and accurate. As the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be well aware, when changes were made to make it possible for gardaí to carry out breath tests on the spot on people suspected of driving in a manner which would indicate they had alcohol in excess consumed, there were problems in the courts regarding the validity of these tests. It was a great improvement on the system of having to find a doctor in a rural area to carry out blood alcohol or urine tests and, therefore, it is a great pity that sufficient effort was not put into ensuring that the equipment used was of the right standard. I gather that many cases before the courts at present may be dismissed because the equipment was found not to be of a sufficiently high calibre &ndash; I see the Minister of State shaking his head and perhaps he will tell us the position in his reply.</P>
      <P>I said that as a doctor I must support this motion. I base what I am saying on a report produced by my colleague, Dr. Anthony Staines of the Department of Public Health Medicine and Epidemiology at University College Dublin. He and his colleagues surveyed injury in Ireland and of course discovered that one of the main causes of unintentional injuries in Ireland was road traffic accidents and that the deaths concerned were really quite dreadful. They made a series of recommendations about what should be done to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries. In their report, they specifically urged: strict driving restrictions on provisional licence holders; random breath testing; an effective penalty points system with a significant increase in Garda resources to enforce it; a reduction in the permissible level of blood alcohol to 50 mg per 100 ml of blood; and a review of the national road safety strategy. Apart from the reduction of the permissible level of blood alcohol to 50 mg per 100 ml, where have I heard those words before? One hears these suggestions made over and over again. Senator Quinn is quite right in saying that we address this subject with monotonous regularity and always fail to achieve anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the worst things about deaths caused by <Col N="885" /> road traffic accidents is that a very large number of the victims are young. The vast majority are in the 15 to 35 age group, with a peak in the 20 to 24 age group. Most of the victims are male, with about four times as many male victims as there are female victims. There is a very specific audience to target. This should be one of the most important things we do in dealing with the dreadful loss of life, in terms of years lost, that is taking place. Television advertisements urge people, especially young people, not to drink and drive. One of the most telling is accompanied by the constant sound like a heartbeat which, at the end, is seen to be a young man in a wheelchair bouncing a ball. The acquiring of disability through road accidents is quite dreadful. Anyone who has visited the National Rehabilitation Centre in Rochestown Avenue has been truly shocked by what is found there. That institute could be filled ten times over with people who do not get the specialised treatment they require because of lack of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Unintentional injury accounts for 8.5% of hospital admissions, the vast majority due to road traffic accidents. The group most affected are aged 15 to 30. Imagine what this does to waiting lists. People on waiting lists must give way to those who are brought in from casualty departments. A huge amount of time is consumed in casualty departments dealing with road traffic accidents. When people complain about the delay in casualty departments I often wonder whether they look to see why, suddenly, all systems go on alert. They have to be held to one side for some time as half a dozen people are brought in from a road traffic accident, some of them dead perhaps, with people making desperate efforts to resuscitate the victims who can be saved. Others are extraordinarily seriously injured.</P>
    <P>We have very little knowledge about what happens to those injured people. There is a deficit of information about the amount of disability which is due to these injuries. The organisation Headway is concerned with those who have head injuries resulting from car crashes, motorbike and bicycle accidents and having been knocked down, but all they can tell us is that a large number of victims become unemployable for years and some for the rest of their lives. There are huge economic costs, not only due to the amount of health service time and resources taken up with road traffic accidents, but also due to time taken off work or to people who are injured and unable ever to return to work. The largest awards in cases concerned with road traffic accidents are given to young people who will perhaps be immobile and unable to work for the rest of their lives. The economic implications from the point of view of insurance are also very important. We do not have much idea of the economic costs of people with lesser injuries who do not attend casualty departments but go to their general practitioners.</P>
    <P>An effort is needed to find out more about the accidents which happen. There have been some dreadful accidents involving articulated trucks in <Col N="886" /> the last few days but it is impossible to obtain figures for accidents involving these trucks. Even the hospital in-patient inquiry does not tell us how many patients were injured but only each episode that involved a road traffic accident. We cannot find out how many times a certain person may have had to attend hospital after an incident, or how long he/she will be out of work. A huge effort must be made to obtain better figures.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the involvement of alcohol in road traffic accidents was not addressed in this report. However, taking into consideration that the consumption of alcohol in the age groups referred to is particularly high, as is the incidence of binge drinking, and that so many of these accidents happen in the period from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m., alcohol must be an important factor. Car occupants account for almost half the deaths in road traffic accidents. Pedestrians and cyclists are also important, but to start with the testing of drivers on a random basis would be getting somewhere. It is important that we look at the issue not just in terms of death but also in terms of morbidity. People's lives are destroyed by the fact that they were injured in accidents.</P>
    <P>I applaud the safety campaign which has emphasised the dangers of drinking and driving, particularly for young drivers. Indeed, these young people are often driving on provisional licences as well as having consumed alcohol. The Minister has a very big job ahead of him and I am very sorry that the Government has put down this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for putting down this motion. I appreciate the opportunity it gives me to speak here. It was intended to deal <Col N="887" /> with the Road Traffic Bill, 2001, tomorrow but due to happenings in the Dáil and arrangements about the Order of Business it may be delayed until next week.</P>
      <P>Road safety is now the focus of greatly increased public, media and political concern and the Government welcomes this development. Indeed, we have been proactive in encouraging it. This Government is the first one to have adopted a national road safety strategy. We accept that we are accountable for this and we will answer for it. Adopting this systematic and focused approach to road safety planning and management has allowed us to pursue a policy that has proved to be successful in many other states. It is particularly noticeable that this type of strategy has supported and enhanced road safety in many of our fellow EU member states, which have seen major advances in reducing road casualties. Recognising that drink driving is a major contributing factor to road accidents is common in these strategies. However, it is also clear that these national strategies do not promote identical approaches to addressing the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government road safety strategy has a five-year term and sets as its primary target the reduction of Irish road fatalities by a minimum of 20%, relative to the 1997 figure, by 2002. A similar minimum reduction is targeted for serious road accident injuries. We estimate that this primary target should save at least 172 lives annually from 2002, compared to continuing on the present basis. We accept that this is an ambitious and demanding target. We also accept, as do the governments of many other states, that drink driving is one of the greatest single factors in traffic accidents.</P>
      <P>The Government road safety strategy acknowledges drink driving as one of four key areas. Similar priority has been afforded to this issue in strategies adopted in most other countries. One of the key supporting targets set out in the strategy is to reduce by 25% the number of fatal road accidents, commonly drink-related, occurring during the hours of darkness. Other supporting targets of the strategy are to reduce by 2002 the incidence of excess speeding by at least 50% from present levels &ndash; this was subsequently revised to reduce the number of vehicles exceeding the 60 m.p.h. speed limit on single carriageway national primary routes from 51% to 40% by 2002; to increase the wearing rate for front and rear seat belts to at least 85%; and to implement specific accident reduction measures at more than 400 additional national road locations. These targets are to be achieved by the application of certain new policies and actions and by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International experience shows that reductions in road accidents can be most quickly achieved by targeting human behaviour, in particular the three key areas of speeding, alcohol use and the wearing of seat belts. The challenge which we currently face can be seen from the fact that at <Col N="888" /> present half of Irish cars and heavy goods vehicles drive in breach of the principal speed limits, our rate of seat belt wearing is well behind international best practice and despite a welcome change in social attitudes, alcohol is still a major factor in road accidents. It is logical that the strategy should prioritise three areas calculated to deliver 72% of the total life savings which we are targeting.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the final year of the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy have been fully met. These were, by end 2000 to reduce Ireland's rate of road fatalities per million inhabitants to a figure not exceeding 116 and to complete specific accident reduction measures at 240 locations on the national road network. By end 2000, Ireland's road fatality rate per million inhabitants stood at 110. Some 268 accident reduction schemes were completed and a further 88 have been approved.</P>
    <P>Real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of road deaths reduced by 12.1 % between 1997 and 2000 and serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by almost 25%, relative to a similar reduction target of 20% by end 2002. Early indications are that these positive trends have been maintained in 2001. We are not here to debate the road safety strategy but I wanted to make those introductory remarks. We are debating random breath testing and drink driving.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Acts provide that it is an offence to drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle &ndash;&ldquo;intoxicant&rdquo; includes alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol. The sanction for committing a drink-drug driving offence is disqualification from holding a driving licence for a minimum period ranging from three months to four years depending on the alcohol level and a fine to a maximum of £1,000, or &euro;1,269.74. In addition, a court may order that the convicted person be imprisoned for up to six months.</P>
    <P>The laws in relation to drink driving were comprehensively reviewed in the Road Traffic Act, 1994. That Act provided for the reduction of the blood alcohol level to its present level of 0.8 and empowered the Minister to amend it further by way of regulations made following the agreement of the Oireachtas. In addition to that innovation and the restatement of the relevant laws generally, the 1994 Act provided for the introduction of evidential breath testing.</P>
    <P>The roll-out of the evidential breath testing system throughout the country has been pursued as a priority target of the Government's Road Safety Strategy, 1998-2002. EBT was operational in four Garda stations by end 1999 and in 25 stations by end 2000. The EBT system is being extended to more stations across the country dur<Col N="889" /> ing 2001 and it is intended to bring the total in operation to 40 by the end of 2001. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is responsible for the forensic analysis and integrity of this programme through supply, ongoing maintenance and testing of the instruments and the provision of training. Approximately 460 Garda operators were trained in 2000.</P>
    <P>I refute Senator Henry's comments about the effectiveness and efficiency of the machine that is in use and her reference to some law cases. There have been three cases to date, one of which is the Mayo case which was defeated in the courts and not appealed. There are two cases at present before the High Court. The Garda Síochána, the Department and the medical bureau have every confidence in the efficiency and integrity of this machine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister. He should sock it to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to correct Senator Henry because there is an impression that it may not even be used. It is being used and we are happy with its integrity. It has been very successful.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government in relation to drink driving policy is set out in a comprehensive manner in the Road Safety Strategy, 1998-2002. This recognises the relatively recent introduction of the 80 milligram blood alcohol limit in Ireland. Our priority is to improve compliance with this requirement rather than move to new limits. We apply an 80 milligram limit with very strict application of driving disqualification. Lower blood alcohol limits operating in some countries do not necessarily attract such strict penalties. The strategy also states that the Government would follow the progress of developments internationally, as well as progress towards relevant national road safety targets, in considering the adequacy of the present 80 milligram limit in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A recent EU Commission recommendation on the maximum permitted blood alcohol content for drivers was debated at Council. The primary focus of the document is to outline the benefits of moving to a standard BAC level of 0.5 throughout the EU for car drivers. A lower level of 0.2 was recommended for certain special categories of drivers. The text accepted, however, that legal competence in relation to this matter rests with the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are three states in the EU in addition to Ireland that have a blood alcohol level of 0.8. These are the UK, Italy and Luxembourg. The Government takes the drink driving issue very seriously. The measures which I have outlined above in relation to the introduction of evidential breath testing are proof of this. The strategy also provided that consideration should be given to some change in the present legal requirement for a member of the Garda Síochána to have formed the opinion that a person has consumed alcohol before requesting a roadside breathalyser test. At that time it was stated that the <Col N="890" /> Government did not envisage the unqualified application of random breath testing within the lifetime of the strategy but that an extension of the circumstances under which a breath test can take place may be warranted.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the new measures which are being proposed in the Road Traffic Bill. These concern the circumstances under which a member of the Garda Síochána can require a breath test. Section 10 of the Road Traffic Bill, which will be debated in the other House later this week, extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen. The section provides that where a driver is involved in a road accident or where a Garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, he or she may require that the driver provide the specimen. This is in addition to the present grounds where the Garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy refers to the fact that international research indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents and estimates in Ireland suggest that the problem is of similar proportions in this country. The NRA road accident facts indicate that alcohol is a factor in 25% of all accidents and 33% of fatal accidents. Based on those figures, even though they are only suggestive in relation to the data for this State, there is a clear case for the creation of a direct association between accidents and any enhancement of the application and enforcement of drink driving legislation. In that context, there is a case for the direct association of random breath testing with accidents involving mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>A similar argument can be put forward in respect of driver involvement in road traffic offences. The fact that the commission of traffic offences increases the potential for the occurrence of accidents justifies the empowerment of the Garda to breath test drivers considered to have committed such offences. Limiting the extension of the application of breath testing to instances where accidents occur and where offences are committed would clearly not create such an excessive strain on Garda resources in that the Garda is already called to accidents on a general basis and is engaged in the detection of traffic offences. However, it can be argued that notwithstanding any other consideration, the Garda should be empowered to establish whether drink driving was a factor in causing an accident or contributed to a traffic infringement.</P>
    <P>A number of benefits are immediately evident from the pursuit of the policy promulgated in the Bill. There would be an immediate deterrent value from the realisation that any involvement by a driver in an accident or a breach of the traffic laws would automatically give rise to the taking of a breath test. It would be possible to establish for the first time in this State a direct link between accidents and alcohol. The policy would not be discriminatory in that it would be applied <Col N="891" /> to all drivers irrespective of their age, level of experience or licence status.</P>
    <P>Breath testing on the more selective basis provided for in the Bill is the most effective and targeted manner in which we can use the resources available to us and equates to standard practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Random breath testing involves the stopping and testing of all drivers, or a certain proportion of drivers, passing a certain point over a given period. It can be argued that there is absolutely nothing to be gained by subjecting drivers to a public breath test where there is no suspicion of drink having been consumed. On balance, however, the steps being taken in the Bill represent a significant improvement. It extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána can request a preliminary breath specimen and it represents an efficient use of resources. The possibility of an unqualified application of random breath testing has not been ruled out in the longer term. Government policy states clearly that such a move is not envisaged within the period of the strategy.</P>
    <P>We believe that the approach now being taken will lead to a significant improvement in driver behaviour with subsequent benefits for road safety. At present a member of the Garda Síochána may stop any person driving a motor vehicle on the road, but breath testing powers will be more specific. Under the Bill a garda will only be empowered to require a breath test if he or she has formed an opinion that the person has consumed alcohol, or has committed an offence, or has been involved in an accident. This means that a garda can stop any vehicle at any time, but can only require a breath test where one of those criteria applies. A garda can stop a vehicle at random and if during that time he or she forms the opinion that alcohol has been consumed by the driver, the garda is empowered to request a breath test. The powers now being given to the Garda therefore are wide, but not unrestricted. They represent a significant improvement on current arrangements and we believe they will deliver results in terms of increased prosecutions and better driver behaviour.</P>
    <P>The level of enforcement in relation to road safety offences in general has been steadily increasing during the lifetime of the strategy. Over 224,000 on the spot fines for speeding were issued by the Garda in 2000 and over 253,000 already to the end of September 2001. Over 132,000 on the spot fines were issued for non-seat belt wearing in the period from July 1999 to the end of September this year.</P>
    <P>Drink driving, despite the perception and reality of stricter enforcement and changed social attitudes, remains a major road safety problem. Some 10,433 detections for this offence were made by the Garda Síochána in 2000. This represents a 24% increase on 1998. Some 92% of blood and urine specimens and 82% of breath specimens analysed in 2000 by the Medical <Col N="892" /> Bureau of Road Safety were above the alcohol limit for driving. Some 61% of blood and urine results and 33% of breath results more than twice exceeded the limit. Almost 10,500 drink driving detections were made to the end of October 2001. There has also been a significant increase in the number of specimens analysed for alcohol. The number of blood, urine and breath samples certified in 2000 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, at over 9,500, represents an increase of almost 47% on 1997 levels. Over 6,000 specimens have been analysed in the first six months of this year alone.</P>
    <P>The worrying statistic that 61% of blood and urine results and 33% of breath results more than twice exceeded the limit would suggest that reducing the BAC level will not impact on that situation which must remain as the primary focus for drink driving law enforcement. We need to strive for greater compliance with the existing level and to change the driving behaviour of those who continue to drink and drive and for whom the BAC limit is irrelevant. The road safety strategy also recognised that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. A research programme is being carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to assist in determining the extent of this problem. Since the beginning of 2000 over 1600 specimens have been analysed for the presence of drugs by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. It is expected that by the end of 2001 sufficient &ldquo;under the limit&rdquo; specimens will be received to complete the survey, the preliminary findings of which were made available in May 2000. These showed that 37% of samples screened were positive for drugs. The extensive survey being conducted during 2000 and 2001 will identify true trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol and the extent of polydrug use. A full review of all the collected data will take place in 2002.</P>
    <P>The consistently high percentages of specimens which are over the legal limit, and the fact that research has shown that a considerable amount of specimens below the legal limit are testing positive for drugs, indicates that the Garda resources are being effectively targeted. The new provisions will enhance the effectiveness of those resources by extending the grounds on which a breath specimen can be requested.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the motion as proposed, on the basis that the Government is actively pursuing the introduction of a wider range of circumstances under which breath testing can take place, as provided for in the Road Traffic Bill. The proposals represent an improvement on current requirements while still maintaining an efficient use of resources. There is a clear case for directing this proposed enhancement of the enforcement of drink driving legislation at drivers involved in accidents &ndash; which cannot be denied. A similar argument can be made in relation to incidents where motorists breach traffic laws &ndash; neither can that be denied. I consider that breath <Col N="893" /> testing, as provided for in the Bill, is itself effective and targeted. I am prepared to listen to arguments in regard to this matter. The Road Traffic Bill contains proposals to introduce the new legislation extending breath testing and I have an open mind on this issue.</P>
    <P>Four years ago when the strategy was written we made a move in this area and I am prepared to consider moving further. I will take into account the views expressed here in the Seanad and the views that will be expressed in the course of debate in the Dáil on Second Stage. I am quite open to an amendment introducing random breath testing. The Government has not yet made a decision to do so but we are open to considering this matter during the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of it that need to be carefully considered. Senator Quinn referred to the civil liberties aspect in his contribution and that is a matter we have to carefully examine to ensure we are fully satisfied before we proceed further. I welcome the opportunity to discuss it as it gives a double focus by bringing this House into the discussion and we can proceed from here into the other House with the Bill. I mean what I say &ndash; I think every one knows that I usually do what I say nowadays.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I have time to go into much more detail but I may write to Senator Quinn. People are complaining about the delay in the penalty points system but this is not because I want it held back or anything like that. There were certain difficulties and I could give the House a long explanation on this. There were constitutional aspects that had to be agreed. The Oireachtas and the Judiciary are two separate entities. Disqualifying a person from driving by automatically removing their driving licence on the accumulation of a certain number of penalty points without redress to the courts is a new departure and impinges on the area of the Judiciary. The Attorney General, wisely and correctly, took time to study this issue before the proposals which were put into the Bill emerged. We are quite satisfied that they will stand the test of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>We know that of all the offences that people commit the ones most likely to be challenged time and again are those relating to driving disqualifications arising from drink driving. There is much evidence already to that effect and the evidential breath testing machine has been challenged in the courts. One challenge was successful and there are two more pending, with presumably more to come regarding the penalty points system when it is introduced. We must accept that there is a need to be very careful regarding the formulation of the legislation to ensure that it will be constitutionally solid.</P>
    <P>Measures are currently under way to link together related databases such as the Garda information technology system, PULSE, the Department of the Environment and Local Government's national driver file which is located in Shannon and the local authority records of licences issued as well as those of the <Col N="894" /> courts system. This will need to work efficiently and well in order for points to be awarded. It was a massive software task and work is proceeding on it with a significant chunk already completed.</P>
    <P>In May 2001 tenders were sought by the Garda for the development and implementation of a national fixed charges processing system within the PULSE computer system and a general PULSE central records archiving system area. Tenders have been received and are being evaluated. It is expected that a contract will be awarded shortly and the system will be ready for testing by mid-2002, and operational by the end of 2002. The specification for the new system takes account of the national driver file requirement in regard to penalty points.</P>
    <P>The successful tenderer will be required to analyse, design and build a system within PULSE which will provide a national capability for the data capture and processing of fixed charge offences. The main elements of the required solution includes data capture, offence processing, archiving, change management and implementation. The new Garda computer system, FOTS, is being introduced in the context of the Government's road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>A criminal case tracking system which tracks criminal and road traffic cases heard in a District Court has been implemented in the Dublin, Swords, Dun Laoghaire and Limerick District Court offices. The national driver file will link in to the CCTS. A prerequisite to the implementation of the CCTS in all 42 District Court offices is the installation of local area networks in each office. In addition, it will be necessary to connect each office to the central CCTS database in Dublin through the installation of a wide area network throughout the country. Tenders have been received for the installation of both local and wide area networks linking all offices throughout the country and are being evaluated. Completion of the installation of local and wide area networks in all offices is anticipated by the end of 2002. Once the networks have been installed it will be possible to commence the roll-out of CCTS in each of the local offices and it is expected that such work will commence in June 2002. In regard to the implementation of the interface between the CCTS and the NDF it is the intention of the courts to develop the interface as an addition to the existing contract. It is a complex, massive job and it is important that it works.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to debate this issue. No single measure in the national road safety strategy, whether penalty points, random breath testing or the dramatic television advertisements, which are also shown in cinemas to bring home the road safety message, is a panacea that will result in zero road deaths or accidents on the road. The culture and attitude of road users need to be changed. All of us need to exercise much greater care and courtesy, and compliance with road traffic legislation. If everybody acted in a reasonable, sensible fashion, the figures could be halved overnight. <Col N="895" /> Unfortunately, there is always a percentage of the community who do not behave in such a fashion and these changes are aimed at these people to encourage and motivate them to be more careful.</P>
    <P>Young people have a significant belief in their capacity and ability to drive vehicles at speed but they do not have the necessary experience, nor do they understand the capabilities of the cars they drive. They take enormous risks with their lives without even knowing it and that is a difficult problem to address. We are focusing on schools. A programme for primary schools was launched some time ago and recently a programme was produced by the National Safety Council. Many agencies are working in the road safety area but it is not an area one can grasp with one's hand.</P>
    <P>It is not like any other issue because a bus with 40 passengers on board could leave the road tomorrow and crash into a river. That would increase the number of road deaths by 40 and the finger could be pointed at the Government that it is not achieving its target. I expect people to be sensible and reasonable. We set targets and they are a challenge to the community and the Government. We are prepared to accept criticism for foot-dragging. However, I have not been responsible for foot-dragging. There have been difficulties and complications along the way which may have made it appear there was a slowdown, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Earlier I launched the Christmas anti-drink driving campaign. Motorists will experience the most vigorous enforcement of the drink driving legislation ever between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comment that there will be strict enforcement of drink driving legislation in the run-up to the festive season. There was a major tragedy on the roads earlier this week which left the families of two young people devastated and our sympathies go out to the respective families.</P>
      <P>There is only a small percentage of people within the community who cause mayhem through drink driving and the majority of them are males aged between 17 and 34 years. The Minister of State addressed the problem of the combination of drugs and drink given that drug taking is becoming an increasing force with drink. I am delighted he identified this problem. In 2000, 1,600 blood samples were taken and tested for drugs and 37% proved positive. I am delighted further testing has continued this year and that sampling will be carried out on the types of drugs being taken because this is extremely important. The erratic driving that we sometimes witness on our roads is the result of a combination of alcohol and drugs being taken. It is important that future testing should allow for the identification of drugs as well as alcohol. I do not have a scientific background but there is a need to identify the drug element among various offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" />Senators Quinn and Henry proposed the introduction of random testing. International figures demonstrate that such testing has proved to be helpful and positive in reducing the number of road accidents and fatalities as a result of drink driving. However, as the Minister of State and Senator Quinn said, a balance must be struck. People cannot be tested on a whim and there must be a reason. The provisions in place are highly commendable. If a garda thinks somebody has committed a crime or believes a person is under the influence of drink, he or she can breath test that person.</P>
    <P>If random testing is introduced, the democratic rights of citizens must be protected so that they are not apprehended unnecessarily or stopped for frivolous reasons. I am delighted the Minister of State has not totally rejected random sampling and perhaps down the road his Department will consider it favourably. It is worth examining the information that exists on random sampling throughout the world and the type of legislation that would be required to enforce it. However, resources are also an issue. The Garda must be complimented on the action it has taken to prevent accidents through the taking of samples. The proportion of people testing positive in relation to the number sampled is high.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, however, everybody should have a sense of personal responsibility. There is a small percentage of people within the community who do not have a sense of individual responsibility and there is a number of reasons for this. Some parents have not instilled in their children that they should not drink and drive. There are not sufficient education for life courses in our schools and there is a need to convey the absolute necessity to take responsibility for one's actions, which is vitally important as there is increasing evidence of people behaving irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise young people. I am most impressed by the responsible position that young people adopt in regard to drink driving. I come from a rural area and most young people must travel by car to discos and other entertainment venues. I am amazed at how responsible they are as they take it in turns to drive or they hire taxis to take them home. They deserve to be commended for the responsible way in which they behave. However, some people lose the run of themselves when they are out celebrating and partying and, unfortunately, tragic accidents occur. It is telling that many alcohol-related accidents involve only one vehicle.</P>
    <P>One can continue to legislate but eventually people must take responsibility. Education is fundamental in all of this. The television advertisements are extremely helpful and the more shocking and horrifying they are to try to shock potential offenders into a sense of reality the better. Needless to say, I am sure it will cause major heartbreak for people who have lost relatives in horrific crashes <Col N="897" /> but if it prevents others from being victims it is highly commendable.</P>
    <P>We must equally address the issue of our roads structure which in many instances is substandard. CIE has just announced ending freight transport. This will be a disaster because more cars and lorries on the roads will cause more accidents. The Minister of State should discuss the issue with the Minister for Public Enterprise because it is unacceptable. Driving cars and using mobile phones simultaneously is becoming extremely common. The Minister must look at this aspect as a potential offence in the future. If there is not a hands-free set in the car one should not use a mobile phone. This is a serious distraction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general tone of the Minister of State's contribution tonight. The fact that he has not totally closed his mind to random sampling is welcome. I look forward to his coming back to this House with a further assessment on research carried out by his Department on the introduction of random sampling. I concur with him that if more drivers had a sense of care, courtesy and compliance there would be fewer accidents. I travel extensively and I am amazed there are not many more accidents given the near misses that occur. If one travels on a short journey one could have six near misses, which is extraordinary. When I travelled recently for approximately 60 miles with my 18 year old son who has a provisional licence we witnessed six near misses. He asked whether these people knew anything about the rules of the road. He suggested these drivers should either not have passed the test or they should be retested because of their incapacity to apply the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>The current scenario in regard to carnage on the roads is extremely serious. The high incidence of alcohol-related incidents, amounting to more than 40%, is totally unacceptable. Any action required which would reduce this figure and save families from the heartbreak and hardship that has affected so many people down through the years must be examined with a view to implementation.</P>

    <P>Whether in regard to politics, business or whatever, I always admire people who nail their colours to the mast by setting themselves targets and objectives. The first road safety strategy of the Government, setting a target of a 20% decrease in fatalities and serious injuries on the roads from 1997 to 2002, was commendable. Should the tar<Col N="898" /> get be achieved, it would lead to approximately 172 lives per annum being saved by 2002. Significant progress was made from 1997 to 2000. There has been a reduction of 12% in fatalities and 25% in serious injuries. This is a significant improvement, particularly against the background of a huge increase in the volume of traffic on the roads during the same period. That fact magnifies the percentage of decreases for which great credit is due.</P>
    <P>The three areas identified as the main contributors to accidents, that is, speeding, driving while under the influence of alcohol and the non-wearing of seat belts, have to a degree been tackled effectively. However, everyone will concede there is no acceptable level of accidents or deaths on the roads. We will not eradicate the problem but every effort must be made to maintain low levels comparable to the best practice achieved in other countries. This is being done with the assistance of many agencies. The NRA, through its road safety measures, has spent more than £14 million. The National Safety Council has been very much to the forefront in this regard. Its fairly graphic and hard-hitting advertisements have been effective and have been commented on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been pioneering in other areas such as breath testing. Despite current difficulties in the Supreme Court, I am confident the measure will withstand that test and go on to be a significant contributor to reducing alcohol-related accidents in the future. On the spot fines for the non-wearing of seat belts is commendable. He has taken on board the idea of introducing penalty points, which has been spoken about for decades. Once the legislation is formulated to comply with the Constitution, I have no doubt there will be a major improvement in driving behaviour and patterns generally.</P>
    <P>Other measures which have been undertaken include the schools education programme and support for road safety from the business and voluntary sectors. As the Minister of State rightly pointed out, it is essential to obtain public support and compliance in this regard. That can be done in a number of ways. We must continuously concentrate on three areas if we are to achieve more acceptable levels of accidents. These include driver behaviour, enforcement and the roads network, which has not been commented on to date. On driver behaviour, the educational programmes are good. Perhaps we could institute more meaningful courses during civics classes, for instance, particularly at second level. I do not know if they should form part of the curriculum. One would be dealing with people, some of whom are beginning to drive, so it is the ideal stage to emphasise the need for good behaviour on the roads and compliance with road safety standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's information that compliance with the wearing of seat belts would result in a 40% reduction in fatalities and serious injury is alarming. That would be an extraordinary reduction and it defies logic that people will not <Col N="899" /> wear seat belts in their own interests. I am aware that some people who suffer from a type of claustrophobia have difficulty in this regard. Some friends of mine will not wear seat belts. However, very few people are afflicted in this way. Most people do not wear seat belts through negligence or failing to recognise the hazards involved. On the spot fines will be a deterrent in that regard.</P>
    <P>We mentioned alcohol alone but we must also examine the drugs issue. Drugs will increasingly become an issue in terms of enforcement and ensuring people drive safely. Evidence of that is already starting to emerge. It was timely to put down the motion on random breath testing. It may be a factor and evidential breath testing another.</P>
    <P>What is really needed is higher visibility of enforcement. Someone on the radio today said that he could drive from Cork to Dublin without seeing one Garda car. In the US and some European countries, the police are highly visible. That is an effective deterrent and I ask that it be examined. Perhaps the role of the gardaí in this area could be transferred to traffic wardens or rangers, employed by the county councils, who would be resourced to do the job effectively on a county-by-county basis. The results could then be compared.</P>
    <P>Speeding is such a major issue partly because people are caught in large volumes of traffic for long periods of time and take chances in speeding when they get moving. Investment in road infrastructure is essential. When one looks at comparable countries in Europe one sees good motorway and dual carriageway networks and the number of accidents and fatalities is significantly reduced as a result. It is an area that should be examined. The NRA is often viewed as being too short-term, taking too long to reach decisions. We should see if there is a more dynamic body to tackle that area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his initiatives and endeavours. He is on the right track and if he continues to put the same energy and commitment into it, we will see the reductions that have been targeted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it illuminating that the Minister put the clear technical specifications and the results of this new breath testing machine on the record of this House. The fact that he is in a position to inform the Seanad is very useful. It is always good to have a Minister who is on top of his brief and can depart from the script and amplify it for the information of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to profit from his warning of the intensification of the drink driving measures. I will do my best not to be in my car, even with the comparatively low blood alcohol level that is involved. I agree with the Minister when he says that there is little point in reducing the upper limit further. It is the equivalent of one pint; one worries after a glass and a half of wine. I am not entirely convinced that it is simply drink that <Col N="900" /> causes problems but people who are unwise with drink taken. The Minister did say that many of the people convicted of these offences have very high levels of blood alcohol, many of them twice the legal limit.</P>
    <P>It seems possible that there is a correlation, not just between the amount of blood alcohol and the accident rate, but also the personality type. The kind of person who is gung-ho and likely to go out and get totally gargled is the kind of person who is likely to make bad driving judgments anyway. It is bad driving, complicated by other factors such as alcohol and speed. Speed on its own is not necessarily such a dangerous thing &ndash; it is a question of the capacity of people to drive.</P>
    <P>Six weeks ago I was filming in the country and, while we were returning in a van, a four-wheel drive vehicle passed us out. The driving was so bizarre that I used the car's phone to call the gardaí in Maynooth and ask them to keep an eye out for it because I was convinced that the driver was about to kill himself or some other unfortunate road user. It worried me because he was travelling across the double white line, almost into the ditch, before swerving all the way back again. It seemed a situation almost bound to cause a tragedy.</P>
    <P>There are certain factors to be examined, such as the time of night accidents happen, say, between the hours of ten o'clock in the evening and four o'clock in the morning. So many accidents happen at this time when people are returning from the pubs and often involve just one vehicle. These combinations suggest that the accidents may be drink related but I do not think it is the only element.</P>
    <P>There are certain curious phenomena. I have tried to stop driving in the country, especially at night, partly because I am a lousy driver. In the old days, I could get away with it because there were far fewer drivers and other drivers were generally of a higher standard. I am sorry to say that the Irish people have sunk to my level, which makes it dangerous for me to be on the road.</P>
    <P>There are certain geographical factors to consider. The worst driving is in County Louth. There is no doubt about it. I made anecdotal personal observations but I examined the figures and it seems to be fact. I suggest that we target our response towards those counties that have the highest levels of accidents. There should be education through schools, advertising, police control and monitoring of traffic. Anyone who has been in Louth will find driving hair-raising. Cars overtake on the brow of a hill with oncoming articulated vehicles. I do not know what kind of magic they think controls their lives.</P>
    <P>Speed cameras are a good thing but I ask the Minister to encourage greater public co-operation. There are some idiotic examples of the positioning of speed cameras and people are continually complaining about them. For example, the speed camera on the dual carriageway near Belfield &ndash; which is almost a motorway &ndash; is positioned where the speed limit suddenly reduces to <Col N="901" /> 40 miles per hour. The same applies on the approach to Kingsbridge station at Kilmainham. One comes off a motorway onto what appears to be still a motorway with no increased danger and the speed limit is suddenly 40 miles per hour. This is stupid and it ought to be stopped because it will antagonise people and make them lack respect for speed cameras in places where they ought to be. The proper and wise location of these cameras is crucial if one is to avoid setting people against the system as the Dublin traffic system has done.</P>
    <P>If there is to be random breath testing there should be random intelligence testing for the people directing the traffic in Dublin. It is dreadful, and laughable in some respects, but it is also tragic as evidenced by the case of young Dr. Potterton who was killed on the quays. It is inevitable because the corporation is constricting the traffic by erecting steel fences that people get squashed against them. Drivers of articulated vehicles cannot see cyclists and tragedy struck again recently in this way. What is happening? One of the reasons there are so many accidents in Dublin is that the city authorities have decided to use the infrastructure of the city as a weapon against motorists in order to drive people out of the city. This too must change.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Quinn, has a genius for picking the items <i>au courant.</i> In today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a piece by Jim Cusack which prefaces relevant figures with descriptions of some dreadful accidents. One of these happened in Wicklow in 1998 when five people, three children and two adults, were killed in a crash between a minibus and a lorry and this week there was the dreadful accident in County Louth. A young couple, who were due to emigrate to Australia the following day, had stopped and were indicating a turn when a lorry crashed into them and knocked the car into the path of another lorry coming in the opposite direction. I felt a frisson when I saw that.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same thing happened to Nuala Ó Faoláin and me at Termonfeckin as we were driving to the North to make a television programme. The person in front stopped to turn right. As we drew up behind, I could hear the vehicle coming up behind us and it splattered right into us. Thank God the driver of the car in front, who was a monk, took his sandals off the brake and let us drive into him and he pushed forward with the impact. We could very easily have been killed.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the tragic accident in Wicklow, a new strategy was introduced aimed at reducing fatalities by 20%, but up to yesterday afternoon, there were 20 road deaths in November. There has been one a day for this year. It will probably go over 400, unless the Minister's Christmas campaign has an effect.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the penalty points system. It is in operation in Northern Ireland where it has been quite successful. It is incremental in that after a speeding offence the driver receives a fine and a three-point penalty for a first <Col N="902" /> offence. After five points, the insurance is weighted. At 12 points the licence is revoked. There is also the issue of speed cameras and there is the question of introducing a system where fines will be issued without recourse to the courts. The Minister has indicated the constitutional crux there, but appeared to believe he would get over it, and I hope he will.</P>
    <P>This is the way to go. The proof of the pudding is that this system has been successful elsewhere. In the Australian state of Victoria, which has a roughly comparable demography in population terms, these precise measures were introduced. There were 777 road deaths there in 1989 and that figure was reduced to 400, just about half. That is what we can do. I support the Minister in these moves, but I appeal for common sense and moderation. The gardaí need to put these cameras in appropriate places. The authorities in Dublin must cease to use the infrastructure of the city as a weapon against the citizens in their motoring cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on the personal hands-on way he has introduced many initiatives that have been a deterrent in the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. Drink driving is a serious contributory factor and a serious road safety problem. Although the substance of the motion refers to random breath testing, there are other factors that contribute to serious injury and loss of life on our roads.</P>
      <P>Speeding has been mentioned and I believe it is the biggest killer on our roads. Although we have figures that indicate that drink driving is a substantial contributor, in many cases there is a combination of speed and drink driving. We have also heard reference to the bad driving habits of many people, causing problems on the roads, and the same is true of road rage, which has become common on our roads.</P>
      <P>Up to a few months ago, anybody could walk into a local authority office and pick up a provisional licence. The only criteria were that the person had the required fee and was over 17 years of age. That certainly lead to accidents on the roads. It was very sensible to introduce theory testing before someone could start to drive on the roads. I welcome that very much and I believe it will be a huge help in ensuring that young drivers in particular have a decent level of knowledge after preparing for and passing the theory test.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Road Traffic Bill, which will shortly be introduced in the other House. For many years, I have advocated the introduction of a penalty points system. The problem of enforcement has been mentioned this evening. It is quite common for someone to travel from Dublin to Cork without meeting a Garda car. Those who are caught and prosecuted are probably the unlucky ones. We all know that we can take chances on long journeys without getting caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Walsh's proposal to divide the duties of the Garda Síochána. There is serious <Col N="903" /> crime and there are road traffic offences. Many gardaí would be much better deployed tackling serious crime. It is necessary to make a serious attempt to enforce our traffic regulations and try to reduce deaths and serious injuries on the roads. One way of doing that is to have either a police force or a particular section of the Garda Síochána that would deal specifically with road traffic offences. If I knew there would be a Garda presence on the road on which I was about to drive without knowing the exact location, I certainly would not take a chance.</P>
    <P>Despite the article quoted by Senator Norris, 250,000 fines of £50 have issued this year alone. That is a deterrent in one sense, but in an affluent society people are quite prepared to pay the £50, sit in their cars and break the speed limit again. They know they would be unlucky to be caught a second time and may survive three, six or 12 months or may never be caught again. This must be addressed also.</P>
    <P>Educating our younger people has been mentioned. I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn who said our younger people are very responsible. On many occasions these young people tend to ensure that the person driving the car is drink free or that they get a taxi or some form of public transport. However, that is exceedingly difficult in rural parts of the country. In my constituency, there is no public transport, no taxi service and only a small number of hackney cars. It is difficult for people to go about their business, particularly at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the present 80 milligram level will stay. Reducing that further would make no difference. We must have some level of tolerance for people who have to drive their cars in rural areas so that they can have a drink or a drink and a half and drive home on a county road at probably 40 or 50 miles per hour. Those people are not a threat to anybody on the road. It is time somebody spoke up for those people. I am certainly not advocating a different law for people in rural areas, but it is preferable to enforce the law we have rather than try to reduce the level further.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system would benefit young drivers who are paying astronomical and immoral premiums for their insurance. After the penalty points system has been operational for a number of months, the insurance companies should start young drivers on a reasonable premium that they can afford to pay. If they then get penalty points, they should certainly have to pay the price for that. The penalty points system must be introduced as soon as possible and it will prove a much better deterrent than a £50 fine. None of us wants three or four points on our licences because people who get 12 points may lose their licences and probably their jobs. They will lose their cars and we all know the serious inconvenience that causes. It is difficult to change old habits and that is probably why young people are more responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" />Some Senators mentioned an input to the school curriculum to ensure greater education for young people. If they start off on the right foot they will probably stick with it. They will be better drivers and will be more responsible on the roads, and that will help in reducing death and carnage.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy has a very positive impact. The gains that have been made have been quoted by the Minister of State in his speech. The level of road deaths was reduced by 12.1% between 1997 and 2000 and that is to be welcomed. Serious injuries have decreased by almost 25% in the same period. That tells us we are getting it right. We certainly have to go further and the Road Traffic Bill, which will soon come before us, will help to reduce accidents on our roads.</P>
    <P>For all intents and purposes, random testing already exists. A garda is entitled to stop any vehicle at random. There are times when the gardaí are suspicious and find it necessary to ask for a random breath test. While I welcome the fact that the Minister is here to listen to the ideas put forward, I am satisfied that the means necessary are already available, but we must ensure proper enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the independent Senators for putting the motion before us. The high levels of carnage and mutilation arising from road accidents is an extremely important issue and one which, despite all our best efforts, does not go away. We have an extraordinarily high tolerance for bad driving, speeding, drink driving, bad roads and all the other things that lead to the unacceptably high level of deaths on our roads. Only last week I attended the funeral of a seven year old child killed on a Saturday afternoon on a stretch of road not known or considered to be dangerous. While it is not possible to say exactly what the cause of the accident was, it would appear to have been as a result of speeding, the use of a mobile telephone, or possibly both. That accident had nothing to do with drink, it had everything to do with negligence.</P>
      <P>A colleague brought to my attention that the report of the National Crime Council shows that there has been a considerable drop in the number of charges of criminal negligence and manslaughter arising from road deaths. That appears to be part of our tolerance for the high levels of accidents and deaths on our roads. Why do we not charge those responsible for road deaths with manslaughter and criminal negligence? I would like to know why the figures have dropped considerably at a time when there has not been the same drop in the number of deaths or in the levels of negligence on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what the problems are because we are all drivers. We see what the problems are, the risks people take and the speed at which people drive. We also see that people drive while under the influence of alcohol. I do not share Senator Cregan's view on the alcohol limit. I think the <Col N="905" /> level should be decreased. I accept the issues he raises about rural areas &ndash; I also represent a rural area. Unless we accept that it is simply unacceptable to drink and drive we are only fooling ourselves. We are accepting that it is all right to go to a public house or visit someone's house, take alcohol and then get behind the wheel of a car. Unless we take the view that it is simply unacceptable to do that in any sense, we will not move forward. If we tolerate to a small extent, we tolerate to a large extent.</P>
    <P>Yet I believe that there have been improvements in that attitude. When I started to drive there seemed to be a view that one could be a better driver having taken a drink. I have heard that said. I have heard of people going to the pub at Christmas time, drinking a lot of alcohol and then driving to midnight Mass. At least we have moved to a time when that is simply not tolerated. I do not think we have yet arrived at a stage where there is a complete intolerance of drink driving.</P>
    <P>Many people have referred to the need for education for young people and I agree with them. My son was in transition year the year before last and he and his class were expecting some driving lessons as part of the year, but that did not happen. That is not good enough. It must be part of the curriculum. Good driving habits, learned early, are extremely important. I agree with those who say that young people are, in general, very responsible and probably more responsible than their parents. From my son and his friends, I know they would not tolerate someone who had a drink attempting to drive a car. They nominate a person to drive who has not taken alcohol or drugs. However, young people have a sense of invincibility. We had it ourselves when we started to drive. We thought it could never happen to us, no one will ever run into us and we would not have an accident, and if we did, so what?</P>
    <P>There are much more cars on the roads now and because of our economic prosperity, young people can now afford to buy bigger and faster cars than they did a generation ago. That in itself is an increasing problem. Senator Walsh referred to a radio programme he heard this morning. I heard the same programme as I was driving to Dublin &ndash; unfortunately I was not taking public transport this week. Pat Kenny, one of our national broadcasters, referred to this matter on more than one occasion. He believes that we should introduce a system whereby cars are not allowed to exceed the speed limit by means of a mechanical impediment. I have a lot of sympathy with that. Why should that not be introduced?</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinarily high tolerance of carnage and injury on our roads. We attend funerals of people of all ages who are killed in accidents. We meet families whose lives have been devastated and ruined forever by accidents which should not have happened. Why are we continuing to allow that to happen? We need to take radical and extreme measures to stop that <Col N="906" /> and we need to continue to change our culture particularly in relation to speed and drink driving.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh and Lanigan mentioned the National Roads Authority. There is a spot on the N7 on the Dublin side of Roscrea where the RTE broadcaster Uaneen Fitzsimons died a year ago. She died at a spot which had been brought to the attention of the NRA on several occasions by county councillors and the county council. Effectively, the answer of the NRA was that not enough people had died there. One person died. Is that enough to make the NRA act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend Senator Quinn for tabling this motion. This matter is discussed often because there are so many deaths and tragedies on the roads. There is also outrage and people ask how many people are dying on the roads. They see it happening every day and nothing seems to change. The Minister has said that his plan has been in place since 1997 and it is coming to an end. I do not know if there are 12 months or one month left in this but there is very little to show. The anti-drink driving campaign released its findings on the &ldquo;Six O'Clock News&rdquo; and some of those findings were incredible. They expect one person to die every day on the roads between now and Christmas if the trends continue and 50% of deaths are drink related. The Minister of State's figure is 40% but theirs is 50%. There are also many deaths as a result of speeding and people not wearing seat belts.</P>
      <P>Obviously alcohol is the key area when it comes to deaths on the roads. I welcome the measure proposed by the Minister of State in relation to random testing and analysis but what can be done? Nothing done so far seems to have made the slightest bit of difference. Is it because our roads are so bad? Is it because we have such a tolerance for drink? Is it because the people of Louth and other areas have some strange propensity for accidents on the roads? Nobody seems to know. The Minister of State's figures give no indication that there is a decrease. The gardaí have imposed more on the spot fines for speeding and conducted more analysis of drink driving. Certainly there is no awareness campaign that seems to have improved the attitudes of drivers. What has happened in the last five years? There is very little to show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State has worked on this and that everyone has the best intentions but has anyone ever looked at the possibility placing responsibility closer to home where this arises? If 50% of injuries and fatalities are due to drink driving, surely we should not be looking at the gardaí in terms of detection but also where the problem occurs. It is alcohol that causes drink driving, not drugs. I also notice the Minister of State said there is an increase in the amount of drugs showing up in urine and blood analysis samples but he has given us no idea whether this is cannabis, heroin or another drug. It is not meaningful just to say there are drugs involved. <Col N="907" /> What sorts of drugs are people taking? Are they mixing drugs with alcohol? Is there a new element to this area?</P>
    <P>We have made publicans responsible for serving minors in public houses. However, our planning authorities virtually insist when a new pub is being developed that there are adequate parking facilities. Why should pubs have huge car parks? Is it not inevitable that if there are car parks then people will drive into them and use them? If they use car parks they will drive out of them. Would that not be a place for random checking? Are car parks ever checked by the gardaí? Can any onus be put on a publican to take some responsibility for his or her customers, whether they have transport home or they intend to transport themselves? That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>We have a limited number of pubs. There was talk of deregulation but while the population has expanded there has not been an increase in the number of public houses. This is where Irish people normally socialise, so people have to travel to go to pubs. Perhaps there should be more public houses. We should look at this issue in that context.</P>
    <P>Regarding our roads, we still have a notoriously bad infrastructure which affects people's ability to commute, particularly during the hours of darkness. We have narrow roads which are poorly lighted. The increase in traffic makes an increase in accidents, injuries and fatalities inevitable. Any cutback in the infrastructure is not helpful in relation to the matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the answer is. However, we go over the same ground every time we discuss this issue and none of our proposals so far has been effective. It might be no harm to shift the focus, not so much at the detection level &ndash; we do not seem to have made much progress with awareness as tolerance seems to be growing all the time &ndash; but to where most of the problems come from, the public houses. We should look at how we can ringfence how pubs operate and who comes out of them as well as the condition in which they leave and the circumstances in which they depart. We should look at how that can be monitored as it would go a huge distance towards reducing the problem. If we refocused the attention of the legislation to give some responsibility to publicans and to get the gardaí to redirect where they get the random sampling, then we would be far more effective in doing something useful for the future which has not been tried so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I start, the Minister of State, who is also responsible for housing, was kind enough to announce £254 million for social housing in Galway today. He has had a tremendous impact on this area, though I know that is completely irrelevant to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that road safety is about responsibility. It is the drivers' responsibility when it comes to how they behave and drive and <Col N="908" /> the influence under which they drive. If that involves drink or drugs it is the responsibility of the individual first to acknowledge that all the Governments and gardaí are not going to stop the kind of accidents we are seeing, as people are getting into cars without taking responsibility for their own actions.</P>
    <P>The advertising campaign has been mentioned by almost every speaker. It has gone a long way towards identifying responsibility, whether that is the responsibility to wear a safety belt, not to drink and drive or not to speed. Those messages have come across clearly but we need to do more. We must recognise that the strength and direct nature of those campaigns have worked. The other evening I turned off the television because I find the advertisement with the car rolling over and killing the little boy too disturbing but those advertisements are particularly useful.</P>
    <P>Some of my ideas have come from a series of discussions with various agencies involved in this area. It is important to continue the inter-agency approach, which has been one of the fundamental aspects of the Government's campaign. It has involved the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government and Education and Science. The only way to work on safety on the roads is to apply the minds of all the agencies involved. The synergy created by that will allow us to continue to address this problem. It is important from the point of view of the environment and design.</P>
    <P>Much money is being put into the design of roads but I am not sure the Garda is involved in that process. Safety should be incorporated into the design of roads and I am not sure all the danger points have been eliminated on all the new roads. I favour more involvement by the Garda at design level. The Garda would welcome this role and I am sure the NRA would have no difficulty with it in relation to major roads.</P>
    <P>The general speed limit of 60 mph on many of our small roads is too high. County roads, such as those in Connemara or County Mayo, can be winding, narrow and dangerous and a 60 mph speed limit on them is too high. Lower speed limits on these roads should be introduced and enforced.</P>
    <P>More research should be carried out on driving habits &ndash; such as why people drive under the influence of drink, why they do not wear their safety belts or why they drive in an aggressive and negligent manner &ndash; and how they can be changed. The answer appears to be better education and better enforcement of the law. Perhaps we can continue the work with regard to education and I ask the Minister to expand the pilot project in schools in Dublin where young people learned how to drive properly at an early age.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the need for more dedicated resources in terms of people whose only job is to enforce road traffic laws. If more money was spent on that aspect, lives would be saved and the State would face lower costs in terms of accident and emergency, health and con<Col N="909" /> tinuing rehabilitation services. Savings made in that regard would meet the additional costs associated with dedicating resources in this area.</P>
    <P>I drive a Volvo car and if I turn on the engine without putting on my safety belt, a beep will continue until I put on the belt. Perhaps this device could be fitted in all cars. Perhaps the Government could introduce legislation that would require all cars to have a noise deterrent to the non-wearing of safety belts. This would ensure everybody wears safety belts and I am sure something could be done about this idea.</P>
    <P>A pub breathalyser campaign should also be considered. If a person was drinking in a pub and thought he or she was capable of driving, he or she could be tested on a breathalyser in the pub in the same way as a person might check his or her weight on a scales or check his or her blood pressure in certain shops. A pub breathalyser might surprise many people because, as Senator O'Meara said, some people still believe they are better drivers when they are drunk compared to when they are sober. This fallacy needs to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>A huge number of people drive under the influence of drugs. As drugs such as Ecstasy and hash become more prevalent in social scenes around the country, there is a danger that people will do crazy things in cars, for example, race down roads with 30 mph speed limits at 100 mph and cause accidents. Occasionally, such incidents are related to drugs rather than drink and I am not certain that the current tests address that problem.</P>
    <P>There is a need to continue the inter-agency approach. More research into this area is required because more than one solution is needed. While random breath testing may be part of the solution, it is not the only answer. A huge amount has been done with regard to road safety but we all acknowledge it is not enough. Every death on our roads is one too many. I hope the downward trend in road deaths will continue and that the NRA signs, which state how many deaths occurred on particular stretches of roads in previous years, will continue to show declining figures.</P>

      <P>I read an article recently that referred to a fortune teller who gave discounts to smokers. When asked why she was giving this discount, she said smokers do not have as much future as others. This fortune teller could also give discounts to people who drink and drive and those who speed. She could also give a discount to people who do not wear seat belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Safety Council referred to a number of problem areas &ndash; the Minister of State mentioned a number of them &ndash; including speed. I tabled the motion not only to discuss random breath testing but to highlight the horror in this area. Senator O'Meara mentioned attending the funeral of a seven year old child. We have all attended funerals of people who have been killed and we have seen the effect on their families. <Col N="910" /> Every time it happens we say we must do something about it, but not enough is being done.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's heart is in the right place but I did not get a sense that the determination I wanted to see was present. I am a little worried that some of the words used by the Minister of State conveyed a sense of complacency. That may be unfair to him and I know it was not his intention, but he referred, for example, to the efficient use of resources. I am frightened by that term. Accountants and the mandarins in Merrion Street talk about the efficient use of resources. However, I want the Minister of State to show the same determination he displayed last year with regard to taxis. He should grab hold of this issue and say that something actually will be done about it, such as changing the attitude of the Government and the nation to this issue immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will introduce the Road Traffic Bill providing for penalty points next week, but he told the House earlier that it will be the end of 2002 before it comes into operation. Legislation that was due to be introduced tomorrow will not be taken for another week and it likely, therefore, that the penalty points system will not be in operation until 2003. I understand the Minister of State's heart is in the right place but I want more. He should show a single minded determination to focus on this area and to achieve progress in it.</P>
    <P>Regarding speed, on the Continent the speed limit applicable to learner drivers is displayed on the back of vehicles in the same way as the limit for trucks is displayed on the back of those vehicles. This provision is not included in the Road Traffic Bill. I tabled the motion because of the need to do something about drink driving and I will refer to this aspect later. However, figures show that only 47% of male motorists wear seat belts. Something must be done about this problem. The Minister of State introduced a theory test in relation to the problem of the number of people driving with provisional licences. However, people are allowed to continue driving year after year with such licences. The Minister of State referred to what happens if a person fails the test twice, but my view is that if one fails twice, one should not be allowed near a car. Too many people are driving with provisional licences. I understand the Minister of State is doing something about the use of mobile telephones. I want him to grab hold of this issue and to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council referred to the problem of fatigue. The figures show this is a huge area of concern and something must be done about it. According to the National Safety Council's chairman, Mr. Eddie Shaw, the Garda's enforcement capability is being hindered by a lack of resources &ndash; that phrase again &ndash; and limitations in the current legislation:</P>
    <P>Solving the problem of drink-driving requires enforcement in large volumes. We <Col N="911" /> need to see over 500 detections per day, compared to the 28 being made at present.</P>
    <P>I hope the fact that 28 detections are being made each day, rather than the desired 500, cannot be attributed to resources. If it can, it is a problem the Minister can do something about.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch on some of the matters Senators raised tonight. Senator Cox spoke of the use of breathalysers in pubs. Such equipment is available, although it is not being used. I have seen breathalysers on sale in supermarkets and pubs. Others, including Senator Costello, spoke of testing in pub car parks, which is precisely what I hoped would be allowed for in legislation. We cannot test in car parks. It is not regarded as an infringement of personal liberty for a garda to stop us on the road to ask if our cars are insured, if we have driving licences or if we have paid motor taxation, but it is regarded as an infringement if we are interrupted while driving by a garda who asks if we are sober and who wishes to test us. I do not think it is an infringement of personal liberty to be tested with a breathalyser. It is something we should be well able to handle.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke of the need to educate young people. While I am not sure of the details, I believe a former racing driver, Rosemary Smith, has established a scheme in County Meath to teach transition year pupils to drive. Senators Cox and O'Meara spoke of the abilities of young people and the need to educate them. There are many opportunities to instruct young people. The major thing we need to do is to change the commitment of the Government. The Minister needs to show a determination to do something about this. I would like road safety to become an election issue as it would force the Government to show a greater interest. I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken but I am disappointed that he has not gone nearly far enough. We must ensure that he is determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. My Adjournment matter relates to the suitability of certain textbooks for inclusion on the primary <Col N="912" /> school curriculum. It arises from an approach to me from parents in Munster who are concerned about the content of an English textbook, <i>Magic Emerald,</i> used by sixth class students. Parents are worried that a poem in the book portrays grandparents as old, useless, and a waste of space and recommends they be &ldquo;exterminated&rdquo;. As an adult, I find the word &ldquo;exterminated&rdquo; to be strong, so it is unusual to encounter it in a book to be used by ten to 12 year olds. I have read the offending poem which describes how a child feeds into a computer various questions on grandparents. The computer replies that grandparents have slow brains, are a waste of space and that their hair and teeth are falling out. I consider the illustration of grandparents, including the suggestion that they should be exterminated, to be quite ageist. The textbook is accompanied by a workbook, which inspires students to debate the matter. Good teachers will ensure balance in such a debate.</P>
      <P>Parents are shocked, alarmed and dismayed. They have contacted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on several occasions to argue that the poem may contravene legislation on incitement to hatred or equality. He suggested that the matter was within the ambit of the Minister for Education and Science, to whom a letter was sent by parents, pointing out the inappropriateness of this series of texts. The response to this letter was merely an acknowledgment that it had been received. The parents are disappointed that they have not been told who is responsible for vetting textbooks used in primary schools. I was unable to tell them.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to argue for censorship, but I do not know whether it is the responsibility of a syllabus committee, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment or another similar national council, school boards of management, individual teachers or school principals. Nobody seems to be able to say how curricula are formed. There may be other offensive texts.</P>
      <P>I remember that Gemma Hussey authorised an audit of the language used in textbooks. She felt that the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; in textbooks should be replaced with &ldquo;he or she&rdquo;. She was equally annoyed by the stereotyping of males and females, as Daidí was always ag tiomáint an gluaisteáin or ag imirt peile leis na buachaillí. He was having a great time while poor Mamaí was sa chistin and poor Máire was ag cabhrú le Mamaí. An attractive lifestyle for women was not indicated in those texts. Ms Hussey gender-proofed texts, but I wonder who is responsible for vetting books in this era of multi-media and learning materials of all shapes and sizes. The book to which I originally referred was published by Fallon Publishers; it did not appear elsewhere. Who is responsible in the Department of Education and Science for dealing with the definite and understandable concerns of parents in relation to the textbook <i>Magic Emerald</i>? I would appreciate a reply from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science in relation to the matter she has raised. Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, a recognised school is required to provide education appropriate to the abilities and needs of its students and to use its available resources to provide for the educational needs of all students. Textbooks are among the main resources used by schools to deliver the curriculum to pupils. Schools are obliged to ensure the education they provide meets the requirements of education policy as determined by Ministers, including prescribed curriculum provision requirements.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 30 of the 1998 Act, the Minister may prescribe the curriculum for recognised schools, including the subjects to be offered, the syllabus for each subject and the amount of instruction time to be allotted to each subject. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is the statutory body established to advise the Minister on the content of curricula. In the course of developing curricula, the NCCA consults with educational publishers to advise them of amendments to curricula, ensuring that changes in syllabus content are reflected in textbooks published to support the implementation of the curriculum. The NCCA provided detailed specifications to publishers about the content of the textbooks required to support the implementation of the present primary curriculum, launched in September 1999.</P>
      <P>Until the 1990s, under the rules for national schools, boards of management were required to select books from a list sanctioned by the Minister. The practice of maintaining a list of sanctioned text books was discontinued due to the increasing range of text books published and because of doubts about legality of this procedure under European competition law. Text book publishing for schools is a global industry and text books published in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the United States can be readily purchased for use in Irish primary schools. School authorities can therefore select from a wide range of text books to support teaching and learning in various aspects of the curriculum. In the first instance, the selection of text books is a matter for school planning and, in making their selection, school authorities are expected to ensure that text books do not contain material which could be considered unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation with parents is an integral part of the process of development and review of the school plan. It is important to stress that primary schools are obliged under the terms of the Education Act not to require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. This requirement should be borne in mind when selecting text books to ensure that the content of text books is consistent with the ethos of the <Col N="914" /> school and the values and religious beliefs of the parents of children using the text books. It is very important that this consideration would be among the criteria used when the staff of each school come together to decide on appropriate text books for use in the different curricular areas.</P>
    <P>In the event that parents or others consider that unsuitable material is included in a text book in use in a primary school, as has been suggested here, the matter should be brought to the attention of the principal teacher and the chairperson of the board of management of the school. If the matter is not resolved at that stage, it can then be referred to the text book committee of the Department of Education and Science, who will advise the Minister on the matter and on action he might consider. The Minister has powers under section 30(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Education Act to give directions to schools, where he or she considers it appropriate, to ensure that the subjects and syllabuses pursued in schools are appropriate and relevant to the educational and vocational needs of the students in those schools. I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity of explaining the position on this matter to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to hear my Adjournment matter on Ballybay boys' national school. Having lost one teaching post two years ago, Ballybay boys' national school is a four-teacher school. The school is seeking to be classified as disadvantaged, which would allow fewer children per teacher and, if possible, the appointment of an extra teacher. The boys' school in Ballybay should be classified as disadvantaged because the boys are much more difficult to teach and control and the Minister should take this into consideration.</P>
      <P>Ballybay is a deprived town. Many parents of the boys attending the national school are unemployed, many long-term. A great number of them were educated to junior certificate standard only, very few of them were educated to leaving certificate and practically none of them received third level education. The school also has many children from single parent families and this brings its own problems.</P>
      <P>Four Traveller children have attended the school for the past two years. Even though there were up to 11 Traveller children attending in previous years, no extra resources were supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many children with learning difficulties in reading, mathematics, etc., attending the school. There are a number of children with cerebral palsy and there is one child with Down's syndrome who would require a teacher all to himself. Psychological reports have been done on all the children concerned. These reports have been submitted to the Department <i>via </i>the local school <Col N="915" /> inspector and are available to all concerned in the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to grant Ballybay boys' national school its urgently needed disadvantaged status and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, for hearing their case this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position on the staffing in St. Patrick's boys' national school. The Senator referred to the provision of disadvantaged status for the school with the appointment of an additional teacher. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, primary schools were selected on the basis of priority of need as reflected by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria. These criteria include unemployment levels, medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy among the families of pupils.</P>
      <P>It has been found that the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level is inflexible and does not take account of different levels of need. The scheme has generally focused on schools in larger urban areas, while neglecting smaller but serious pockets of disadvantage in schools in medium-sized towns around the country.</P>
      <P>On this basis, an independent comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in April-May 2000 at the request of the Minister for Education and Science. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey forms the basis of the new programme called Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which the Minister for Education and Science launched earlier this year to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. Under the new programme, the existing approach to dealing with disadvantage through the designation of schools has been refined to ensure that individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted wherever they are. Therefore, the new programme subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the schools identified in the survey as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Over 2,300 primary schools will benefit under the new programme, based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. This involves an overall cost of £26 million over <Col N="916" /> a three-year period, including the allocation of over 200 additional teaching posts.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, that is, infants through second class, and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, that is, third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>Schools in areas with populations fewer than 1,500 people were categorised as rural. Schools identified by the Educational Research Centre as having the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils have been allocated the services of a co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils which cannot be clustered with other schools with similarly high levels of need will benefit from appropriate financial support as an alternative to teacher/co-ordinator support. All participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received in 2000 from St. Patrick's boys' national school. After the new programme was launched in January 2001, several schools, including St. Patrick's boys' national school, contacted the Educational Research Centre and-or the Department of Education and Science offering various explanations for their school's non-participation in the survey in 2000. In February 2001, following consideration of submissions received, it was decided that any school that made a case concerning the failure to return a questionnaire in 2000 should be given a second chance to complete a questionnaire.</P>
    <P>In March 2001 the Educational Research Centre invited all these schools, including St. Patrick's boys' national school, to participate in the survey by completing a questionnaire. A total of 133 schools responded to the second-round survey, including St. Patrick's. The Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the inclusion of these schools in the new programme is currently under consideration. The schools concerned will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the concerns of the school in question. The Senator should be reassured that the Minister for Education and Science is committed to dealing with educational disadvantage and supporting the schools and teachers that cater for these children.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 November 2001.</P>
