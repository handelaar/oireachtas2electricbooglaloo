      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to grant disadvantaged status to Littleton primary school, County Tipperary, in view of the special needs of a number of pupils there and the inability of the school to meet these special needs without this status.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to establish forthwith an adopted persons contact register as promised in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to immediately instruct the Mid-Western Health Board to provide funding for the purchase of a mammography machine at Ennis General Hospital and to ensure this service is continued on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Meara and Henry and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Taylor-Quinn may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re referral of the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-Operation, 1990, to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re referral of protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of <Col N="206" /> Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re the fourth protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam regarding refugee status, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re referral of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997 (Relevant Company) Regulations, 2001, to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, to be taken without debate; No. 5, Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages; No. 6, Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 23 motion no. 31 to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and the afternoon's business to be resumed thereafter, if not previously concluded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I wish to raise two issues on the Order of Business. The extraordinary continuing carnage on our roads is an issue of concern. While no Government can legislate against stupidity, recklessness or criminality, there are a great number of things that should be done. There is the scandal of the huge number of untested provisional drivers on the road and there is the continual digging up of streets throughout all of our towns and cities, both of which present a traffic hazard. Will the Leader arrange a full debate and invite the Minister in to account for his stewardship? </P>
      <P>Does the Leader know what is happening in what were previously called our semi-State companies? The chief executive officer of the ESB is, apparently, facing a coup designed to remove him. Does anyone know what is happening? The chief executive of CIE leaves behind him an agenda of chaos and incompetence, while he departs with £500,000 in his back pocket. The more we look at CIE the more things seem to be going from bad to worse, with no political control or direction. It is important that we have a full debate as early as possible on developments in the areas of public enterprise.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate on the local government Bill if there is truth in the rumour in this House that the four independent TDs are about to withdraw support from the Government unless the dual mandate at local level is restored? I think it is a very good idea. Perhaps the Leader could indicate whether he knows anything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should note that since we debated the matter last week there are two European countries, Holland and Spain, whose inflation rate has gone above that of Ireland. As Commissioner Solbes intends to visit Ireland next month, I ask the Leader to arrange for him to debate with interested Members in this Chamber his fiscal and economic policies proposed for June 2001. He should be given a formal invitation to debate this, not to address this House. He could well do with hearing our views as well as those of other groups he will be meeting. The possible <Col N="207" /> referendum on the Nice treaty is another issue he could deal with. It is important that he be exposed to the views of the Irish public and meet their representatives.</P>
      <P>On an unrelated matter, a Chathaoirligh, since I was elected to this House I have consistently raised matters in this House concerning the Irish waterways. There is a disturbing report in today's newspapers about the proposed Kildare by-pass as it affects Pollardstown Fen. This has been a concern of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland for many years. If the Government wishes to raise some of the issues involved, including the proposal to lower the level of the road below the water table, I will be happy to debate the matter in the House. The Government is taking an action which will have a negative environmental impact and possibly affect leisure facilities in that area. It is a feeder waterway into the broader waterways. Will the Minister give reassurances to the House that no irreparable damage is being done? </P>
      <P>Last week we asked the Leader about a debate on Northern Ireland and how we can keep a continuing view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Order of Business except for No. 3. I ask for clarification from the Leader of the House. My understanding is that No. 3 was debated in this House last week and it was then referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, but here it is again on the agenda, to be referred a further time&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite correct. This matter was discussed in the House last week and it was referred to the joint committee. It is now back so that the House can ratify the substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly a very short discussion. I have mentioned before the large number of motions on the Order Paper that are being referred to committees. There are four before us today. This House should receive some indication of the outcome of these referrals. It is amazing that the matter can be referred one week and finalised the next. It seems it has been rubber stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has no control over the length of time a joint committee spends in discussion on any matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have control over what we pass in the House and how we pass it. There is a question mark over the manner in which this was processed and I am asking the Leader of the House for some clarification on the outcome of the deliberations in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Senator Manning in relation to fatalities on the roads. The carnage is very alarming. It seems that the Minister for the Envir<Col N="208" /> onment and Local Government is not providing the Garda Síochána traffic corps with the resources properly to regulate traffic and drink driving. The number of motorists holding provisional licences is growing. There are at present 350,000 in the State. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to explain this to the House? This is a record increase in road accident fatalities and it is a record nobody wants. It is time we were told why the resources are not available to control the number of fatalities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that Commissioner Solbes should be invited to speak to the House. The Minister for Finance should also be invited. I am alarmed at the rate of spending and the manner in which credit card companies are charging exorbitant interest rates of between 18% to 25%. I am concerned that there is no statutory regulation on the upper limits of credit available to credit card holders. There is no statutory regulation of upper limits regarding how far into debt a card owner can go. The Central Bank has issued a warning to companies, but such a warning has no statutory basis. The operation of credit card companies, including interest rates, the criteria for lending and so on, should be the subject of a debate here. It is central to our economic agenda. I hope the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will come to the House to deal with the matter and that we will hear from Commissioner Solbes on the wider issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to request the Tánaiste to come here in the near future to discuss the skills shortage. We should have a debate on work permits and visas, and especially the integration of non-nationals into our workplaces, communities and schools. This House can assist the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in formulating strategies to deal with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of accident and emergency departments in our hospitals, particularly Cork University Hospital. There is an average of 25 patients in the department full time over a 48-hour period &ndash; there were 31 there yesterday. That is equal to half a mile of patients, were they stretched along the hospital corridor. This is an ongoing problem, and nurses telephone us to say they cannot handle it. This is a matter of urgency as no beds are available. What is happening in our hospitals? Wards are closed at weekends and there is no consultant service in the evenings. Patients who cannot get beds in wards have to stay in accident and emergency departments. This is a very serious problem, especially considering that £6 billion has been spent in this area. I ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to come before this House to explain what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators Manning and Costello as regards the dreadful carnage on our roads. Most of us have experienced heart-rending scenes of families who have lost loved ones. Many young people's lives are snuffed out in this way. We have an epidemic on our hands. It is an emergency and I ask the Leader to initiate a debate, not only here but with other organisations. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan's call for a debate on accident and emergency services. Patients are spending three or four days in many accident and emergency departments waiting for admission to wards.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to this House to debate the public health aspects of the BSE disaster. This might help to reassure consumers and it could also help the beef trade.</P>
      <P>I previously requested the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the 1999 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. I ask that the report for 2000 be published before Easter so that both reports can be debated together. It would avoid continuallly having to raise this matter with the Leader during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning and others in calling on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House for a constructive discussion on how best to reduce the carnage on our roads. At a recent public meeting, about 200 young drivers lobbied for a decrease in the current exorbitant insurance costs. Those sensible young people made specific points which we could put to the Minister. Allied to debating road deaths, we should consider the exorbitant cost of insurance premiums for young male drivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's invitation to Mr. Solbes. The Senator's call should be taken very seriously. It is extraordinary that one of the most divisive and important issues in recent years which culminated in a debate in Brussels on Monday is not being debated in this House. I would like to go one step further. If the Minister for Finance came to this House, and I would be one of those who support his stance, it would also be appropriate not just that we should have Mr. Solbes but also that we should send an invitation to the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi. He could enlighten us on the state of the Italian economy which is interesting in that there are two economies there. There is the European-type economy regulated from Europe and by the Italian government, and there is the black economy not subject to any regulations, European, national or otherwise. I think we ought to ask Mr. Prodi to explain to us how to run a black economy&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you would bear with me for one moment, Senator Ross. If Members have suggestions on individuals they would like to see invited to address the House, they should make those suggestions to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>The committee will consider such proposals and will make a decision. This has been the procedure and will continue. It is not in order for Members to take the floor of the Chamber and suggest willy-nilly that A, B, or C should be invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, a Chathaoirligh, and I apologise for being out of order, but I have found in many years in this House that it tends to be more successful if one does things in the open rather than behind closed doors. The Leader could do one thing. If he does not invite Mr. Prodi, perhaps he could invite the Minister so that we have a serious debate on this issue. There are different views among the Opposition and there has not been a debate on this, the most important national issue for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of those who proposed that particular rule, I did not ask that Mr. Solbes come to address the House. I asked that he come and meet the Members of the House in this Chamber and that was what Senator Ross supported. We were not out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the horrific car accidents that have taken place in recent weeks and months. This Chamber should be used to further the debate on why this is happening, to look again at the causes and to see if there is any way forward.</P>
      <P>The recent report by the ESRI emphasised the shortage of workers, yet local employers are not accepting suitable young people, aged 15-plus, who did not get as far as the leaving certificate. They would be very good workers, yet they have been turned down. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, will be coming here under other auspices and perhaps that will be an opportunity to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call to invite the Commissioner, Mr. Solbes, to the House to discuss the issue which has come before us in recent weeks and to explore the nature of our relationship with other members of the European Union, including our changing role within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the calls for a wide-ranging debate on the issue of road deaths. In particular, the Leader should ask the Minister to address the role of the National Roads Authority and its relationship to local authorities. When the attention of the NRA is brought to a dangerous <Col N="211" /> location their response is often not to address the issue until road death numbers have gone up. The Minister should address that.</P>
    <P>I once again ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the whole issue of waste management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader inform the House when the Committee and Report Stages of the Broadcasting Bill will be taken? I asked him last week to outline the parliamentary timetable for the local government Bill, but he omitted to mention it in his response, perhaps inadvertently.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning in regard to the semi-State bodies. These bodies are showing themselves to be almost ungovernable. Many of them seem to act as though they are independent republics. That is not right in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much so. I also agree with his other remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to draw to the attention of the appropriate authorities No. 23, motion 24 about the conditions of the area of this complex known as the bunker. I do not want to make too many extravagant demands but really we should have decent direct access and we should also have access to our offices at weekends, which access is available to cleaners. It is ridiculous to be treated like schoolchildren in this manner.</P>
      <P>I formally propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take an item inviting Mr. Solbes and Mr. Prodi to this House to discuss the economy. I would certainly look forward to an opportunity to support the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It seems astonishing to me that they went through a range of indicators in all of which, to use the cliché, Ireland was top of the class. The one remaining one they said they were worried about was inflation. We had just published, before their meeting, figures that indicated our inflation was going down. What on earth are they talking about?</P>
      <P>I want to make one qualification. If these gentlemen come, I would suggest that they be decently attired and properly shaved. I thought Mr. Solbes was an unattractive proposition on the television. I would like to include Mr. Prodi because I am delighted to hear there is a proddy running the Community. An extra one in the House will be a great refreshment to us here because the proddies seem to be entirely concentrated on this backbench.</P>

      <P>I join with all the people who have called for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to discuss the carnage on our roads which is certainly frightening. While there are many reasons for all the dreadful accidents that are taking place, the reality is that we have neglected the small county roads. In every local authority, there are requests each year for funding and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has not sanctioned that funding. As well as having a discussion on it, we should put that on our agenda. There is huge money for national roads but there is certainly&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On BSE and the issue that Senator Henry has raised, I ask that the Minister come in at a special time because there are proposals in relation to the destruction scheme. There are things we need to say and that need to be pointed out. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come in and discuss it before he goes back to the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an in-depth debate on the whole education system. The Minister is commissioning and receiving reports and we had a very lively and interesting debate on a particular aspect of education last week. The report from Mr. Cromien was partly debated in a committee yesterday. This House should really debate these issues, particularly his point that the examination system should not be the prerogative of the Department of Education and Science. There are fundamental issues that need to be discussed and there is expertise on both sides of this House to do so.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we are not debating No. 2 because, given the number of eminent former members Fianna Fáil has dumped in recent years, it may have something to say on dumping and it might be entertaining. I would have seconded Senator Norris's proposal for an amendment to the Order of Business, but it has been ruled out of order. However, we should have a debate on Fianna Fáil's attitude to rules and regulations because it has demonstrated again that it ignores them when it suits it.

The motion, which was referred to a committee last week, is now being passed with no report. Why refer items to committees if they do not produce reports? Debate on a sensitive issue is being diverted to where the media will not notice it. It is incorrect use of the otherwise valuable committees.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan in asking the Minister for Health and Children to come here to discuss the problems in the health service, particularly in the city where I live. He is more concerned with issues outside his brief, like the dump in Cork, than with those within his brief, such as the health service in Cork, which is a disgrace.</P>

Last year we passed the Intoxicating Liquor Act and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="214" /> Reform rejected pleas from this side of the House to strengthen the provisions dealing with under age drinking. In reply to certain amendments which I tabled he became emotional and bad tempered, which a Minister ought not to do. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, in so far as it addresses under age drinking, is not working. Both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come to the House to hear the debate.</P>

We must commend the Garda Síochána on its vigilance in this regard and hope it will be even more vigilant in the future because nobody can condone under age drinking.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as a report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for copies of those amendments to be made available. As Members are aware, they may speak only once on this question. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the proceedings unduly as we are in the closing stages of this legislation and I am sure Members who have already contributed a great deal to the debate on the Bill and put considerable time and effort into its deliberations will want to say a few final words on it in the time allowed.</P>
      <P>My senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, would have liked very much to be present to see through this legislation. It was perhaps one of the longest running Bills in recent memory. However, she had to attend an EU Council meeting, hence her absence. Nevertheless, despite the long gestation period, we are very glad to be in the final Stages of the Bill so that the very important work of the Aviation Commission can commence at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before addressing the amendment which the Bill has undergone since being in the House, I pay tribute to the contributions of my colleagues in the other House, especially the members of the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, who put a great deal of time and thought into this process. As the Minister would say, we had some lively debates on the Bill since Senators saw it last. There may have been times on Second Stage in the other House when one would have been forgiven for thinking it would never be back in the Seanad again. However, I <Col N="219" /> know the Minister was very appreciative of the useful contributions made on Committee Stage and we now have a stronger Bill as a result.</P>
    <P>I will not absorb the time allotted in addressing technical or drafting amendments which have arisen, although I am happy to provide an explanation on any of these should any Members require it. I will concentrate instead on outlining those amendments which have added to or enlarged on the policies or procedures underpinning the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 was proposed on Committee Stage and, although it was always the case that any decisions of the commission would be non-discriminatory and transparent, the Minister was happy to accept the amendment and include it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The next significant amendment is amendment No. 12 which addresses the issue of interests in land or property by any member of the commission or anyone employed or engaged by it. It was accepted on Committee Stage. I am aware that there was some discussion in the Seanad on this item and that Senator Taylor-Quinn was anxious to see the measure included. I am sure she will be pleased to see its addition to the existing disclosure provisions in section 18.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 13, we have now added a six month custodial sentence to the existing fine in respect of the offence of the unauthorised disclosure of information. Senators may be aware that there was a request at Committee Stage that the penalties contained in the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998 &ndash; the Act vesting the airport assets in Aer Rianta and establishing it as a semi-State body as opposed to the agency status it previously enjoyed &ndash; be applied to this summary offence. However, the Minister took the view that these penalties provided for indictable offences allowing up to £100,000 in fines and two years imprisonment and it would not be appropriate that they be imposed for an offence such as the disclosure of information. It was pointed that the offences in the 1998 Act address far more serious issues, bringing dangerous articles into the airport, the non-payment of charges etc., than those envisaged in the Bill and the 1998 Act offences therefore merit the status of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>It was also noted that, even in the 1998 Act, the offence of the unauthorised disclosure of information is only categorised as a summary offence and does not attract indictable penalties. We did, however, re-examine the issue in conjunction with the Attorney General's office. Given that there was a custodial sentence provided for in respect of this offence in earlier Acts establishing regulatory offices, we have now included a six month custodial sentence in addition to the fine.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 was accepted in response to concerns raised on the subject of transparency and accountability. We have, therefore, inserted <Col N="220" /> this amendment in section 23 which deals with the raising of the levy. The amendment requires the commission to be diligent in its approach to its operating costs. We had already very clearly provided for all the necessary measures in terms of accountability in respect of the levy in that the commission is obliged in the first instance to produce regulations to introduce the levy and, secondly, it is only permitted to raise sufficient funds to finance its operating costs. However, we were happy to declare this in the more deliberate terms of the amendment.</P>
    <P>On amendments Nos. 25 and 27, initially the Bill provided in section 32(2) that the commission had a timeframe of up to 12 months to produce a determination on the price cap and this was an appropriate measure at the stage it was included. However, further consideration was given to the implications for the industry if a price cap was not determined for a further year. Given the very long period since airport charges were last reviewed in 1987, and given that due to delays in the legislative process an interim commission has been in place since autumn 1999 which has engaged with the relevant issues, it has been decided that it would be more appropriate at this juncture to reduce the timeframe to six months.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 arises by virtue of amendment No. 25 and is designed to reflect the fact that the timeframe for the price cap determination is reduced to six months. We are therefore reducing from two months to one month the consultation period for industry views.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 was also accepted at Committee Stage and although the same concept was inserted into section 10 by virtue of the substantial debate on the issue in this House the Minister was agreeable to copperfasten it in section 33 also as part of the list of issues to which the commission must have due regard.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the final amendment, I draw the attention of the House to the deletion from the Bill of a provision contained in section 46 which sought, by way of amendment to the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, to remove the impediment in that Act which prevented the IAA from exercising its jurisdiction at military aerodromes. As Senators were aware, the provision was merely enabling in that it paved the way for the IAA to carry out its remit in respect of civil aviation operations at military aerodromes, should a Government decision be taken in the future to allow such civil aviation activity. Although the only issue under consideration, as it were, was the possibility of developing the facilities at Gormanston Aerodrome for use as a flying training school, deep concerns arose on the part of the residents living in the environs of Baldonnel Aerodrome. These concerns centred around the assumption that the Government was intending, without consultation or notice, to open up Baldonnel to civil aircraft. This was not the case and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, put this on the record of the Dáil. However, in order to allay the concerns of the residents' groups and <Col N="221" /> given that the question of a flying training school can be addressed in due course, the Minister took the decision to remove section 46 from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last amendment I want to deal with is the best one yet, amendment No. 49, which inserts a new measure in the Bill dealing with an appeals mechanism. Having considered the many contributions made both here and in the Dáil on the subject of the merits of an appeal mechanism, the Minister decided to introduce a Report Stage amendment to provide for an appeal against a price cap determination. In summary, the process provided for is as follows. If Aer Rianta, or the IAA or an airline, is aggrieved by the decision of the commission in respect of the price cap, it may make a request to the Minister in respect of an appeal on that decision. On receipt of that request, the Minister must establish an independent appeal panel comprising three persons or a maximum of five. There is a two-month timeframe provided to the panel within which it must examine the decision of the commission in the context of the regulatory objectives laid down in sections 33 and 36. The panel is empowered to either confirm the decision of the commission or refer it back to the commission for review. There is a further time limit of one month placed on the commission to carry out that review. Following the review, the commission must publish the result in the same way as it would have done in respect of the original decision.</P>
    <P>The provision affords a further opportunity, in addition to judicial review, for a person affected by the price cap decision to seek redress. I know that the issue of an appeal mechanism was one which Senators raised early in the debate on the Bill and was an issue on which some Senators felt strongly. I hope we have met those concerns with this new provision.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am happy to explain these amendments, but Senators can see that the vast majority are technical drafting amendments, many consequential on each other or refinements of earlier drafts. I record once again, on behalf of the Minister and myself, our appreciation of the good work done by Senators and their colleagues in the Dáil. We are very anxious to finalise the processing of this Bill so the real work, as it were, can begin. I extend every good wish to the new commissioner, Mr. Bill Prasifka, and to his staff. I am sure it has not been easy to have to wait in the wings for so long. I have no doubt that the commission will find the task ahead both challenging and rewarding and I am hopeful that the new regulatory framework which has been created by virtue of this legislation will bring about a regime in which the needs of all the participants in the industry and of the travelling public are met and fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While there are many amendments to the Bill, the Minister of State has pointed out that most of them are technical and substitutions for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;, the deletion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and so on. I spent three hours this morning going through the Bill parsing, analysing and marking out all the changes. From a housekeeping point of view, in this modern age where we have word processors and the ability to print drafts and redrafts, it should be a simple matter for us to get a copy of the Bill, as amended. That is not a criticism of anyone but, as a housekeeping exercise in all Departments, Bills to which there are amendments &ndash; there are 56 amendments to this Bill &ndash; should reprinted as amended. This would enable us to proceed with the business in ten minutes.</P>
      <P>The time I spent going through the Bill was not wasted in that I went over all aspects of it. Having also read the Official Report, I appreciate that the Bill occupied a good deal of Members' time in both Houses. In particular, I commend the contribution of Senator Taylor-Quinn, which the Minister of State acknowledged. Many of her points have been taken on board.</P>
      <P>I am aware the rules are that we should go through each amendment in turn. I approached this exercise by marking the additions on the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Long Title of the Bill, the Minister provided for amending the Freedom of Information Act. That is to ensure that all the activities of the commission will be open, transparent and available for FOI requests. That is an important and welcome provision. I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge that is the position, that any decision made and or appealed can be referred to through the FOI process.</P>
      <P>I welcome, in particular, the changes the Minister of State spoke about. If Members will bear with me, it is not good teaching practice not to have the necessary words at one's fingertips. A major point has been included under section 18(2). It states that for the purposes of this section, but without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be regarded as having a beneficial interest if he or she or any member of his or her household, or any nominee of his or her's, has an interest in a property or anything that is material to the decisions of the commission. The subsection also covers the position where he or she or any member of his or her household is in the process of acquiring land or property to which such a matter relates. That is one of the points Senator Quinn made. That is an important and welcome addition to the Bill. It is part of the openness and transparency that is provided for in this legislation and that, hopefully, will apply to all future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State on section 19(2). It states that a person who contravenes <Col N="223" /> subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500. The words &ldquo;or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both&rdquo; have been added to the subsection, which make it stronger. The debate on the Bill in this House was important in that it constructively influenced and changed the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 23(7) states that the commission shall ensure its own costs of operations are kept to a minimum and are not excessive. I am not sure how that provision will operate and initially I wondered if it made sense. Good and prudent management of a commission or any public body would require that, but given that provision is mandatory in that it is included in the Bill, how will it be put into effect? Will it conjure up auditors' questions as to why the chairs purchased were more luxurious than they ought to have been, that the office should have been painted once every four years rather than every two years, or whatever? In terms of prudent, modern management, what is provided for in that paragraph should happen anyway, but given that it is included in the Bill, what, if any, will be its implications?</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments provide for the substitution of words. Section 33, which deals with regulatory objectives in respect of airport changes, provides that in making a determination the commission shall aim to facilitate the development and operation of cost effective airports which meet the requirements of users and shall have due regard to a number of points, to which has been added the contribution of the airport to the region in which it is located. That is a welcome addition which acknowledges that airports do not have only a local or county impact but also an important regional one.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State added a new section 40 which deals with the appeal panel. It is an important addition which provides that an aggrieved party can avail of an appeals process rather than having to go directly to the courts, although that is an option a party can exercise if he or she so wishes. This is a beneficial and constructive addition to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer a few questions regarding the appeals process. If one has gone to the commission and is aggrieved at its decision, one can appeal it to a ministerial body made up of at least three but not more than five people who will re-examine one's case. I acknowledge that any decisions and submissions made to that body will be transparent and open to FOI requests. Who will be the members of that panel? What skills does the Minister of State consider they ought to have? Why did he opt for a panel of at least three and not more than five persons? Does he envisage different appeal panels will be set up for different situations, or will the five people or whatever number he decides be on the panel for the dur<Col N="224" /> ation? Will a different panel be set up specifically for each appeal?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consider giving representatives of users of the airports, be they airlines or other users, the right to nominate people to the appeal panel, given that a similar provision is included in employment legislation? It would be helpful if he were to reply to that request in the affirmative. Obviously a potential nominee could not be a member of a company directly involved in a particular appeal. If the Minister of State decided to nominate five persons to the panel, perhaps the representatives of the users of the airports could nominate two members. Such a provision is included in the employment appeals process, although I appreciate it is a different situation where an employer and an employee are represented and there is a neutral chairman. I do not suggest that must the case but there should be recognition of the importance of the employees' point of view. Ryanair's chief executive appeared on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; recently and it is clear how aggrieved he was by decisions at airports out of which his company operates. He has a deep and strong conviction in this regard and, whether or not we agree with him, he is making a strong case.</P>
    <P>I hope airport users are involved in this process. I welcome the changes to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Bhí, mar a duirt se, an-phlé againn leis an mBille seo nuair a tháinig sé chun an tSeanaid don chéad uair agus caithfidh mé a rá ar dtús báire go gceapaim go bhfuil na rialacha faoina phléimid ceist cosúil le seo, nuair atá 57, 's é mo thuairim, leasuithe á gcur ós ár gcomhair, go bhfuil an t-ord atá againn &ndash; go gcaithfimid iad a phlé mar cheist amháin &ndash; go bhfuil sé as dáta ar fad agus go bhfuil sé in am dúinn réiteach eile a chur le chéile tríd an gCoiste Procedures agus Privileges. Ní dóigh liom b'fhéidir go bhfuil Gaeilge an tSeanadóra MacGearailt agam. Ach tá sé in am dúinn an cheist a phlé mar tá an saol athraithe.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Bills in the Seanad was a rare event in the past and, therefore, they were rarely returned to the House with significant amendment. It a simple procedure but 57 amendments on a variety of topics deserve a better procedure than this. Nobody wishes to take up time and, as the Minister of State said, many of the amendments are technical but a couple of points should be made.</P>
      <P>I would like to know more about the context in which a basic public policy decision was reversed. The intention in the original legislation was to enable the Government to permit Baldonnel aerodrome to be used for civilian purposes. That was a major public policy decision. The Bill contained a provision to enable the Government to do so but it has been deleted. I did not hear a chorus of objection to the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electoral boundaries have changed and Baldonnel is in the Tánaiste's constituency. She is a great advocate of competition and the right of <Col N="225" /> people to choose. I do not recall a large chorus of dissent in this House about this Bill because it was only enabling legislation which had to go through a political process. However, suddenly one section, the merits of which could not be debated because it simply provided that Baldonnel could be used for civilian purposes if a Government wished it, was deleted.</P>
    <P>Governments are subject to public opinion but it is nice to go back to one's cantankerous constituents and say one was responsible for the removal of that section and received a categorical assurance that the people of north Dublin are the only ones who will have civilian aircraft imposed upon them in greater numbers. It will look well on election literature during the next campaign. Who represents that area?</P>
    <P>I undertake to pursue this issue following the passage of the legislation. I will write to the Minister of State's Department under the Freedom of Information Act seeking correspondence in connection with the deletion of section 46 because I would like to know who made representations and the process under which this decision was made. Whatever its merits. it is interesting that something that was peripheral to enabling legislation has been deleted.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the notion of locking people up for disclosing unauthorised information. I wonder about our sense of our own importance, particularly in the public sector, whereby an amendment is made which provides for the possibility of six months in jail for unauthorised disclosure of information. This leads us into a world of wonderful contradictions because the classic old phrase, &ldquo;confidential information means that which is expressed by the commission to be confidential&rdquo;, which was inserted in every Act for a long time, has been inserted in section 19. That is straight out of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. As the Queen of Hearts said, &ldquo;Words mean what I say they mean.&rdquo;  If the commission says that the colour of the toilet paper in the bathroom is confidential, then it can make it confidential.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the argument but an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act introduced later in the legislation provides that the commission cannot do so because the definition of &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo; cannot be used to frustrate the intent of that Act. That is welcome but it is time that instead of inserting contradictory phrases in legislation, the parliamentary counsel recognised we are operating in the world of freedom of information. Legislation should be drafted differently so that information that is not covered by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act shall be deemed to be confidential. Any other phraseology is meaningless and contradictory, as evidenced by the provision of a penalty of six months in jail for disclosing information which might be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>Responses to FOI requests must be made within three weeks to discover such information. <Col N="226" /> My experience is that Government Departments are expeditious and efficient at doing so and the three week limit is observed conscientiously. If one seeks an internal review it is carried out efficiently and quickly and in a transparent manner.</P>
    <P>However, we are presented with legislation such as this which contains contradictory phrases that turn the entire process upside down and a provision for six months imprisonment for revealing information which might turn out to be legal under the FOI Act is added. This is a message for those in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel who are still drafting legislation in a form that predates the FOI Act, one of Labour Party's great legacies to public discourse. I was not a member of the party at the time and therefore I can say that without any strings attached.</P>
    <P>I am glad there will be an appeals panel but I am still a little wary of the criteria under which charges are to be made. I am not sure yet that regional airports will be properly supported. It is an absolute nonsense to maintain that an airport should only be built where there is a commercial demand. The construction of an airport creates demand and industrial development. It is similar to saying roads should only be built where there is already traffic. We should examine ways to use the road infrastructure to change the patterns of development and that is similarly true of air traffic and all other infrastructure. Infrastructure is not only a service to existing development but is an attempt to change it.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is an attempt to put together an independent appeals system and that the Bill is finally about to be passed. Let us be wary about fashion. There is a great fashion for commissions to regulate things nowadays. That fashion will change as sure as night follows day. The Californians have discovered that deregulation and commissions produce their own negative consequences. The idea that what would be the sixth richest state in the world could have permanent threats of blackouts or else exorbitant prices for electricity is a lesson to us all to be wary of fashion and of rigid ideology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to address the points raised by Senator O'Dowd. The Senator suggested that the original Bill with the amendments contained therein might be presented to facilitate preparation for the debate. I certainly consider that suggestion meritorious and I will ask my officials to take note so that it can be considered.</P>
      <P>The Senator also lauded my good friend, Senator Taylor-Quinn. I referred to her excellent work and I totally concur with those remarks. Senator O'Dowd asked whether the activities of the commission would be amenable to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. I can confirm that it will be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Dowd and Ryan welcomed the appeals mechanism in the legislation. The <Col N="227" /> members of the panel will be appointed by the Minister for Public Enterprise. There will be a separate one for each appeal. Consideration will be given in due course to the nature of the expertise needed. Aviation and economic expertise would be obvious requirements. It will be important to avoid conflicts of interest in choosing the members of the panel.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd referred to amendment No. 18. This amendment to section 23 was accepted in response to concerns raised over transparency and accountability. This is the section dealing with the raising of the levy. The amendment requires the commission to be prudent in its approach to its operating costs.</P>
    <P>Accountability measures in respect of the levy have been provided for. The commission is obliged in the first instance to produce regulations in order to introduce the levy. It is only permitted to raise sufficient funds to finance its operating costs. We are happy to specifically adopt the wording of that amendment. It puts expressly into the Bill the onus that all expenditure be subject to due and proper consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan then raised the matter of Baldonnel which I referred to earlier. With regard to who represents the area, I have always had difficulty with Dublin constituencies. I cannot help the Senator to find out but I am sure he will find some way of eliciting the information. The Minister took the view, given the concerns raised regarding Baldonnel, that the issue contained in section 46 could be addressed at a later date. Hence the removal of that measure.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Davern, to the House for the resumption of a very important debate on the Second Stage of the Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001. Last week much <Col N="228" /> of the time was taken up with reference to the difficulties being faced nationally due to the disastrous situation resulting from BSE.</P>
      <P>In the intervening week the situation has become worse rather than better. As I stated last week, I give the Bill an extremely warm welcome. In principle the Bill is an extremely good one. It sets up an independent appeals structure to give farmers somewhere to go if a decision made by an official in the Department of Agriculture is not to their satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Many incidents were related and indeed I could relate some myself. Senator Avril Doyle referred in her own case to a problem that seemed to recur every year. In fact there is correspondence between the Minister and me regarding a problem that, like &ldquo;Groundhog Day&rdquo;, pops up every year with the same individual. There is absolutely no doubt that he and many others need the office of an independent director of appeals to break this vicious circle of incorrect decision making and problems in the bureaucratic works that recur year after year in the case of a small number of individuals.</P>
      <P>The principle of the Bill is very important. I too would have difficulty with the level of independence being given to the appeals structure. The Minister last week referred to the fact that the model being used in the appeals structure is similar to that used with regard to social welfare appeals. If that were so I would welcome it 100%. I have accompanied people to oral appeals conducted by the Department of Social Welfare appeals section and it is an excellent model of independence. The reason it is truly independent is that the officers of the social welfare appeals office are recruited independently from within the wider public service and Civil Service. This Bill, however, sets out a structure whereby the Minister will appoint the appeals officer from his own Department and designate the chief appeals officer and the director of agricultural appeals.</P>
      <P>I will put forward amendments to ensure the independence of this appeals office and hope the Minister will accept these amendments in the spirit in which they are intended. The intention is to establish a truly independent office which has the trust of the agricultural community. The only way to achieve credibility is to operate independently of and employ officers who have not worked in the Department. I do not suggest that officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development do not exercise their duties properly but if an office is to be independent it must be seen to be independent. The manner in which it is established, staffed and allowed to run its operation is extremely important to those who will use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note section 9(3) provides that an appeals officer on the hearing of any matter referred to him or her under this Act shall have the power to take evidence on oath. Will the Minister clarify whether the officer has a choice to take evidence on oath or whether all evidence must be taken on <Col N="229" /> oath? If it is the case that all evidence must be taken on oath, can the Minister inform us why that provision is specifically in the Bill? I would like to know the rationale behind it.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Act does not require much comment. The essential problem is the fact that it is stated to be independent but in reality this must be questioned. That element of the Bill will have to be amended before it is satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute on this Bill. This is an issue I have raised on a number of occasions. Problems many farmers had in relation to penalties imposed on them for minor infractions of regulations were caused by misunderstanding of very complicated application forms. It often seems that these forms are constructed in such a way as to be complicated and confusing. I have come across many cases of people losing substantial payments because they did not tick the correct box. These payments are income support to farmers and are absolutely necessary to maintain a decent standard of living. They are given by the European Union in recognition of that fact.</P>
      <P>What always intrigued me was that when one raised queries one was told that the rigid interpretation and application of the rules was because the European Union audit insisted on this. That is not really true but was a deliberate decision taken in the Department of Agriculture. Injustice has been done to hundreds and possibly thousands of farmers who have been deprived of payments for very minor infractions of the rule.</P>
      <P>An all-party Oireachtas committee on strategic management initiatives looked at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and its administration of particular schemes. They identified problem areas such as delays of payment, the absence of an independent appeals system and telephone access to Department officials. A complaint I repeatedly come across is that farmers ring up the Department trying to identify the official dealing with their case but they cannot find anyone or are left hanging on for long periods.</P>
      <P>I am a farmer myself and must fill complicated forms and also help my constituents to complete them. The same question is asked in different ways deliberately to confuse people. The smallest technical error causes them to lose out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative system should be more decentralised. It is concentrated too much in the main offices in Dublin, Wexford and Portlaoise. The Minister should ensure that district livestock offices and veterinary offices have the power to deal with small administrative queries. There is always resistance to these things within the public service but if we are to have a strategic management initiative it is absolutely necessary. The level of management commitment <Col N="230" /> to customer service is seriously in question. It is something the Minister should concern himself with.</P>
      <P>A number of recommendations were made including establishing a properly resourced, accessible and independent appeals system similar to those operated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This Bill is not quite doing that. Senator O'Meara has drawn attention to the fact that this is not similar to the appeals system operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The appeals officers for that Department are independent and very fair. Some are barristers recruited by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, enacted major changes to guarantee the independence of the appeals system in social welfare cases. I am not familiar with the appeals system in the Revenue Commissioners' office.</P>
      <P>The appeals systems proposed in the Bill should be properly resourced and above all independent. Anyone with the appropriate qualifications should be allowed compete for the position of independent appeals commissioner. I say commissioner rather than officer because it implies greater independence. The Agriculture Appeals Board should have the same level of independence as the appeals system in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>I oppose the Bill at Second Stage because the necessary level of independence for the appeals board is not included. The penalties to be applied for incorrect applications are totally out of proportion to the infraction of the rules or failure to tick the correct box. In the past, farmers who made errors in completing application forms were warned by the Department of Agriculture that this was regarded as fraudulent. Farmers were insulted by these allegations and it is surprising that none of them took court action. There was no allowance made by the Department for genuine errors. It was assumed the unworthy intention of the person was to defraud the Department. Perhaps the wording of these letters has been changed now. Penalties used to be totally out of proportion to the error committed.</P>
      <P>It has been announced that the EU beef destruction scheme will be extended to 31 December 2001. One of the means of paying for this would be to cut back on the various agricultural budgets over the next five years, from 2001 to 2006. This proposal will affect Ireland because the national beef quota will be reduced. This is not acceptable. The beef industry is more important to Ireland than to any other EU member state. Beef production in Ireland is based on extensification principles. Other European countries produce beef by intensive farming. These premia act as incentives to even greater numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I know the Minister has a fight on his hands in Brussels and I do not wish to weaken his position. If we are forced to use the ultimate weapon at our disposal, then so be it. The national cattle herd is a very important asset. That may sound old fashioned but it does not diminish the fact. I urge that we reject absolutely this proposal to bring about a reduction in the beef quota.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome what is contained in the Bill, but I cannot give my support because of its imperfections. With Senator O' Meara and others, we will put forward amendments which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This week has been a traumatic one for Irish farmers with Mr. Franz Fischler's plan to tackle the effects of the BSE crisis on meat markets. It is a very severe blow. Last week, it was the T-bone steak crisis. Mr. Fischler has stated that the present situation is worse than 1996 when we saw a drop in beef consumption and export markets crumbling. He hopes that his seven-point plan will defuse, in his own words, a slowly ticking time-bomb.</P>
      <P>I say to Mr. Fischler that of course we wish to restore consumer faith in beef but we do not want further blows to our farming industry. I heard on the radio this morning that, according to Mr. Fischler, set-aside land can be used for the production of other types of crops and for organic farming. This is part of his seven-point plan. I am concerned about the future of Irish farming in the context of what Mr. Fischler is proposing and I know that when the Minister attends the EU Council of Ministers meeting on 26 February 2001 he will take the difficulties of the farming industry into account.</P>
      <P>We cannot dismiss what the IFA and the ICMSA said today. Tom Parlon regards the proposals as unbalanced and unfair. He stated that suckler cow, special beef premia and stocking density cuts would cost Ireland in excess of £100 million. I believe what Tom Parlon says and I also believe Pat O'Rourke from the ICMSA. He says that the proposals to cut premia would cause damage by reducing the State's national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the service will be improved by strengthening the rights of recourse by farmers wishing to challenge decisions made by the Department regarding their entitlement to benefit under any of the direct payment schemes. That is my interpretation of the presentation he gave us last week. I am concerned about the Minister's statement on the independence of the appeals board. He stated that the Government made a commitment in the programme for Government to establish the appeals board on a statutory basis. I ask why the Minister did not make the board independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. <Col N="232" /> The Minister refers to natural justice, but I would refer to the constitutional right to appeal.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor referred to the difficulty in filling out forms. I am not an expert in that area. I need to get help when I receive representations in relation to problems with appeals and filling out forms. I know that farming organisations such as Teagasc help, but the detail involved is mind-boggling. There should be a simpler way of dealing with these forms. Some people get their solicitors to help them fill forms and lodge appeals. I ask the Minister to take into account the Fine Gael proposal for an independent body. Problems arise with officers in the local authorities because they have a natural loyalty to their co-workers. Appeals officers within a department, no matter how good they are, find it difficult to be independent. I would prefer a board of governors utterly independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The appeals officers are to be appointed by the Minister, which is like breathalysing one's self. The relevant organisations should be allowed make the appointments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the REP scheme. I referred to the difficulty in filling out forms. No time limit is specified in the Bill by which the appeals would be met. Planning applications appealed to An Bord Pleanála were to be made within a specific time, but that time has been extended from two months to six months. A time limit is needed in this case as we are talking about money which farmers need.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the fear of appearing before the appeals board. People might not think that is difficult, but it is. Farmers would be far more relaxed and confident if they were to appear before an independent body, separate from the Department. I notice in the Bill that appeals may go to the Minister if there is a difficulty with them, but it is important that there is an independent board. I welcome the Bill, and farmers would welcome greater independence in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions to the debate. I recognise the need for the appeals service to be seen to be impartial and effective, we are all working to a common agenda, that of protecting the rights of citizens and providing a quality service. I have taken note of the criticisms and the suggestions as to how the Bill might be improved, and some of the points are worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Senators argued in favour of setting up the appeals office as a separate institution, presumably with its own accounting officer and perhaps, as Senator Hayes proposed, with its own board of governors. I do not object to that approach, but I am doubtful that it would generate a better result. When considering the appeals procedure, I will take into account the successful <Col N="233" /> experience of the social welfare appeals office, which is independent. The head of the appeals office will not report to a departmental hierarchy, nor will he need the approval of the Minister. On the contrary, the Bill specifically provides that he will be independent.</P>
    <P>There is a great tradition in the Civil Service, which we should not ignore. There have been extraordinary people in all areas of the Civil Service who have given great service. Most of them have acted independently &ndash; they are often called the permanent Government.</P>

      <P>There will be no negative consequences of setting up an appeals office. I emphasise the consistency between the proposed agriculture appeals office and the social welfare appeals office. Senator Avril Doyle rightly adverted to the credibility of the social welfare appeals office, which has been operating effectively and with full public confidence for a decade. It was not the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, who brought in that system, it was the then Minister at that Department, Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>Senator Avril Doyle will be pleased to note that the material provisions of this Bill are identical to those governing the social welfare appeals office. There will be the same regime whereby the Minister appoints appeals officers from among the staff of his Department and designates one of their number as a director. The same provision will govern the independence of the two offices, the same functions will be vested in the appeals officers, the same arrangement will apply whereby the director will report to the Minister and so on.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan made the useful point that accountability to the Minister is not necessarily a bad thing. Whereas the office will be independent in the performance of its functions, as the Bill prescribes, there is merit in the accountability framework, which reminds us that the appeals body operates within the overall democratic system based ultimately on accountability to the people. Senator Connor blames the Minister when he is in opposition and praises him when he is in government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am talking in general terms. A number of Senators on both <Col N="234" /> sides of the House suggested that the disease eradication scheme should also be considered by the appeals office. The Minister considered bringing within the scope of the Bill the on-farm valuation scheme for TB and brucellosis reactors, which was set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and concluded that its central element, the valuation of reactors, would not be a suitable activity for inclusion &ndash; most of the animals would be taken away at that stage.</P>
      <P>All appeals would have to be considered in terms of valuation, involving arbitration where necessary. Such an appeal mechanism will be built into the compensation scheme itself. It is my considered view that the appeals office would not be a proper mechanism to consider disputed valuations. We should respect that as valuations are more immediate and urgent than appeals which are ongoing for some time.</P>
      <P>I accept there may well be benefit in assigning to the appeals office some functions under the scheme. These include imposing penalties where there is non-compliance by the applicant farmer with the regulations underlying entitlement to compensatory payment. Similar considerations will obviously apply to those effecting the appeals process in the direct payments area, and this would seem a reasonable basis for bringing the compensation scheme within the remit of the appeals office.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor spoke about filling out forms. Every half hour a farmer spends filling out an EU form earns him £500. The EU introduced these forms to collect general information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>They could state it in more simple terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but it is not always what they demand. If they are the paymasters in that area we have to follow. Some 3,000 people who did not even sign the forms but simply sent them away were fined and appealed last year. The IFA and ICMSA should ensure that help is there for people who need it.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are ongoing with the farming representative organisations about the precise terms to govern this scheme. When those negotiations are completed, I hope to be in a position to make provision, by amendment at Committee Stage or by order, whereby the new office can assume an appeals function in relation to the non-valuation aspects to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the compensation scheme for depopulation on account of BSE, I do not consider the appeals office to be an appropriate forum. The issue is one of valuation. As the evolving scheme matures, there may be a good basis for bringing appeals under this scheme within the remit of the appeals office, but this must be left open because we have an emergency now that hopefully will not be there in one or two years' time. No animal born since 1996 has been found with BSE and we hope there will be an <Col N="235" /> end-solution in two years. It would be possible to bring appeals under the scheme during a calmer time but not in the present emergency.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to delays in making payments under certain schemes. The protocol on direct payments has laid down stiff targets, as did its predecessor, the charter of rights for farmers, and in general these targets are being met. The application process has been substantially simplified, making more use of pre-printed application forms and bar-code readable passports for the animal premium schemes. This year will see further simplification with the introduction of the area-based system for payment of disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that standards are high. Where there is room for improvement, I intend that my Department, which has an excellent record in this area in terms of European comparisons, will take the necessary steps. One of the difficulties which the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development faces is that many farmers are slow to respond to queries which arise when applications are being processed. The protocol on direct payments contains a section dealing with the role of the farmer in ensuring the various targets are met. The achievement of payment targets can be greatly facilitated where farmers respond quickly to correspondence from the Department. The Department is committed to making maximum use of data collected under the cattle movement monitoring system in the processing of payments. The database is only useful if farmers ensure that they register the birth of all new-born calves and notify the movement and deaths of all animals.</P>
    <P>Recently my Department undertook a herd reconciliation exercise with a view to bringing the database fully up to date. This involved the issue of herd profile forms to farmers. It is somewhat disappointing that as many as 18,000 farmers have so far failed to return these herd profile forms. That failure is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Both the IFA and ICMSA, as well as those of us in politics, should be educating farmers to fill out the required forms, and also to respond to officials. We have all heard the joke about the fellow who gets the tax bill and throws it in the fire, believing that is the end of it and he will never hear from them again. These matters are now being followed up and that realisation is getting through to many farmers. For 18,000 out of 146,000 farmers not to have replied is a sizeable amount and they will be at a loss if they do not improve in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes was anxious that the new office should have power to consider appeals against decisions taken some years ago. I can sympathise with his motivation, but I do not consider retrospection to be realistic. Any newly elected Member of either House will find that <Col N="236" /> they get every refusal for the past 20 years referred to them. We all did. When I came to the House first I got every failure in the business to deal with. If we get into retrospection, the people who made decisions may not be there anymore. I do not think it would be fair to those who made decisions years ago to ask them to recollect the issues. It would amount to re-opening any case where the appellant was still dissatisfied with the decision of the Department or the appeals unit. That would not be productive. It would generate a very large workload and would raise hopes almost certainly to be subsequently dashed. Unfortunately people believe that if a case is re-examined they can expect a favourable result. That would be disastrous and would lead to further disappointment.</P>
    <P>Regulations will be prepared under section 15 is to specify a reasonable interval &ndash; perhaps 28 days &ndash; within which an appeal must be made. This will be subject to an overriding power on the part of the director to accept appeals made late, at his or her discretion and where he or she is satisfied that the facts justify late acceptance, say if somebody is sick, has a broken arm, or has had a bereavement. The appeals office will deal with matters on a human basis. The established Civil Service is sometimes debarred from considering such matters by the regulations from Europe. The only exception is the <i>force majeure </i>which is a major issue and unfortunately a telling one which may have other consequences.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle wondered about section 18. The purpose of that section is to preserve fully the right of recourse to the Ombudsman in spite of the appeals officer. There is still that right. There was a recent case not too far from Senator Jackman's area where the Department feels that the penalty was too severe. The regulation from Europe unfortunately decided the penalty that had to be applied. It involved the removal of a ditch for safety purposes because tragically somebody had been killed coming out of an entrance when the ditch blocked the view of the roadside. It was the neighbouring farm and the man removed the ditch in response to the accident. We have appealed our own decision to Europe, and that will give some flavour and show that there is reality, practicality and humanitarianism within the civil service.</P>
    <P>Senators Callanan and Hayes emphasised the importance of an oral hearing. Such a hearing will be held in every case where it is requested, unless the director is satisfied that the request is frivolous or vexatious. I was part of a recent oral hearing in Senator O'Meara's area. There were nine meetings about the matter and no new evidence was produced. We decided to have a full meeting of all the people dealing with the matter from the person who initially started it to the people at the finish. No new evidence was brought up after an hour in Nenagh. That totally wrong appeal was vexatious, but the amount of time involved was great despite the fact that the more the man said <Col N="237" /> the more he condemned himself. Where there is a genuine appeal people will be heard.</P>
    <P>Farmers can also be assured that they may be accompanied by an expert of their choice, family member, or as Senator Connor has offered, a public representative. We are delighted that the Senator can spend his time on this as well as the social welfare appeals. I should point out &ndash; because some anxiety was expressed about this &ndash; that the oral hearing will be in private, so that a farmer appealing need have no fear that the confidentiality of his or her case will be breached.</P>
    <P>Several contributors to the debate thought that the 12-week interval for processing appeals was too long. I would prefer a shorter time limit. There are some cases which cannot be made within this limit. I am reluctant to provide a statutory obligation to deliver a result within a specific time, because there may be outside evidence to be brought in, and outside bodies over which neither the appeals officer nor the client has any authority. The relevant person may be away on holidays. It would be wrong to tie it down but it is the intention to make it a shorter term period. There is the risk of compromising public faith in the law because it simply would not be possible in all cases to observe the law. It is worth noting that neither the Social Welfare Appeals Office nor An Bord Pleanála has statutory time-limits, largely for this reason. We are all frustrated with An Bord Pleanála's appeals section which writes letters every three months advising of another query and a further three month delay.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it wise to lay down a precise target in statute, but I am anxious to keep as short as possible the time taken to turn an appeal around. The guidelines I will issue under section 8(4) will therefore be as tight as I can make them, and shorter than twelve weeks if that is at all realistic. I am anxious to be helpful here.</P>
    <P>Misgivings were also expressed about the position of REPS planners, where it may happen that an error by a planner may give rise to a penalty on a farmer. I listened with glee because these are people who are charging a sizeable fee and who should do a professional job. I had a case in my own constituency where the REPS planner did not even leave the kitchen table. He looked at the maps. They were old maps and three ditches had been removed in 1980 with grants from the Department but they were still included. When the inspector came, the ditches were not there. It was then I discovered that the REPS planner had never left the kitchen. He got a soft fee for this instead of walking the farm and advising on what needed to be done.</P>
    <P>Planners are employed by farmers to draw up their agri-environmental plans, and they also have a role in the subsequent annual applications for payment. Ultimately, if it happens that a farmer meets difficulties and perhaps suffers penalties because of error by a planner, it is up to the farmer to take that up directly with the planner. He has insurance and it is time we started using <Col N="238" /> some of this to protect people who are misguided and misinformed in those areas. There is a responsibility that those who are weaker in that area will be dismissed by word of mouth and not taken on in future. It is a professional job to advise somebody and if a fee is being paid responsibility should be taken.</P>
    <P>My Department takes action against REPS planners when there is evidence that they have contravened the terms of approval for REPS works. Sanctions take the form of warnings, and a series of warnings can result in significant financial implications for planners. I believe that this system is a substantial deterrent against negligence or deliberate breaches of the conditions of approval. It is only fair to say that the vast majority of the thousand or so approved REPS planners carry out their work in a competent and professional manner and that there are very few who have merited sanctions. Just as with legal advice, people are slow to take action in relation to a person who has wronged them by giving the wrong advice or indeed not acting on the plan.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that if a farmer suffers a penalty under REPS &ndash; and I know that the penalties can be very severe &ndash; even now he or she has a right of appeal, and under this Bill that appeal will be to the new appeals office. If a farmer believes that the error by a planner has contributed to a penalty, he or she is free to make that argument in the course of the appeal. Where they have been wronged by a professional they have the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the position of particular applicants under the various schemes. This is not the appropriate forum in which to respond in detail to the claims or criticisms made. Where Senators believe that a farmer has been unfairly treated on an original decision and then on internal review within the Department, they should encourage that farmer to lodge an appeal. There is already an appeals unit dealing with headage and premium cases and arable aid. There is also a REPS appeals mechanism. Obviously these mechanisms will be enhanced on the passage of this Bill, but even now there is an effective means of recourse for farmers in this position where they can actually meet the appeals board, talk to them and make their case. I have found it a reasonably good system to date and have no great objection to the system that has been working. It is a tribute to the officers who have imposed the penalty in the first place, that if there are circumstances that come to light that they were not aware of, they have generally been very sympathetic and have recommended a reduction in the penalty.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases where the original officer has changed his mind or downgraded his opinion and the appeals group upheld his original decision on the basis that they felt it was appropriate. They operate quite independently of each other. I have great respect for the civil service, for what they <Col N="239" /> have done over the years and for the high standards they have kept.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were also made in connection with the referral process for representations under the NBA scheme, where the Minister intends to refuse or revoke a certificate of approval. In particular, it was suggested that appeals from decisions by the Minister should be referred to the appeals office in the normal way, instead of getting the input of the office in advance in accordance with the scheme of the Bill. I can see the basis for this proposal, which is reasonable, but it seems to me to be ruled out on the following ground: it is the Minister himself or herself who will make the decision whether ultimately to refuse or revoke, and it would not be proper that that decision should be overruled by a body ultimately reporting to the Minister. To take advice in advance seems the best way to meet the case. I do not see any Minister treating that advice casually. The strong likelihood is that the Minister will be guided by the advice. Furthermore, the NBAS provides that the Minister's decision may be appealed to the Circuit Court and that court's decision will be final. Any change to that, such as has been proposed today, would require an amendment to the NBAS Act.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the reservations and the criticisms that have been expressed on many occasions, particularly by those who work in a rural constituency. Senators will, I hope, accept that I am as concerned as anybody to ensure that the penalty fits the crime. There was a case in Cork recently where two people injecting slurry into an animal had the probation Act applied. It was an act of treason, particularly bearing in mind the current issues with beef, but the cruelty involved alone was huge. I believe there is a further case pending. It is a small minority but they must be weeded out.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the people who are swapping tags. I am aware of a case where an eight year old cow's tag turned up on a heifer and the cow has been killed twice. Those cowboys have to be got rid of. I believe that we will soon see farming being licensed. Only an appropriate per<Col N="240" /> son will be licensed to produce food. People who prepare and sell food are licensed by the health boards and I believe that the primary producer at some stage will have to be licensed. It will be a way to ensure that the 99.9% of our farmers who are caring producers, proud of their product and want to be even more proud of their product are fully recognised under that system.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara mentioned the oral hearings. Evidence may be taken on oath but it does not have to be taken on oath. There was a famous court case some time ago where Senator Jackman came from originally. The defendant was accused of killing a man at a faction fight and the doctor said, &ldquo;He had a thin skull, it was not the killing blow that killed him.&rdquo;  The accused man said, &ldquo;You heard the good doctor. The fair at Cappawhite is no place for a man with a thin skull.&rdquo;  He did not have to swear it but he could defend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person takes an oath it is an offence not to tell the truth, but it is not a must in this situation.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of the staff from the agricultural appeals office, like the level of independence, is identical to that of social welfare. It is not open to Senators denounce the Bill in this sense and simultaneously to praise the social welfare appeals office when in fact it is exactly the same system we are using. Unlike people from outside the system, those people will know the area they are dealing with.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is complicated. The original officers in the social welfare system were from the Department. That office is a success. As Senator Connor said, we should not criticise the application forms. We need education, either through the organisations or ourselves, to help people. This is a move forward. I have confidence in the proposed appeals system, but I also have conifidence in the existing system. The perception outside the Department is the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, due to the shortage of applicants for positions in the fire service, calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to review the retirement age for fire service employees.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo. This is an important motion. Due to the shortage of applicants for positions in the fire service, we are calling on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to consider increasing the retirement age for fire service employees with a view to ensuring a fair and equitable system.</P>
      <P>The publicity surrounding the anniversary of the Stardust tragedy highlights the dangers posed by fire and the fact that, in many instances, the public is dependent on the quality of the fire service. It brings home to us the courage and commitment of the many people who have given tremendous service over many decades to fire prevention and alleviating the difficulties caused by fire. It is appropriate that we take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who have dedicated themselves to the fire service over many years.</P>
      <P>The labour shortage presents the biggest challenge to the economy. It is significant that in one decade we have witnessed a transformation from a situation where there was an oversupply of labour, with serious unemployment, to one where many sectors of industry are encountering difficulties in recruitment. Various efforts have been made to address these difficulties, some of which have successful. Others have not been as effective. The need to fill vacant positions in the public and private sectors will continue to present a significant challenge to the economy in the next decade.</P>
      <P>During the years there were changes in the fire service, which may have reflected the labour shortage, to lower the age of retirement. In many ways ageism became a factor during an era of high unemployment when efforts were made to encourage employees in the public and private sectors to retire early in order to create opportunities for younger persons who found themselves without work. While there was some logic to this, there has been no adjustment in thinking to take account of changing economic circumstances. There is a need to do this in many areas.</P>
      <P>There is evidence from the medical profession to suggest that people will live longer because of improvements in health care. It may be difficult for us to appreciate, but the suggestion is that in the next 100 years people may live to the age of 150 years. This highlights the need for a radical look at the age of retirement. Where a person is in a position to continue working and remain productive, it is difficult to see how one can sustain, economically, a situation where those who will retire at the age of 65 years will live to the age of 100 years or more. That is a challenge which will have to be looked at by future generations.</P>
      <P>At a time when there are considerable opportunities to work full time and of unprecedented mobility in the workforce, with companies competing for staff by offering higher salaries and full-time jobs, it behoves us to look at the areas in the public sector in which this is having an adverse effect. Because of its nature, the fire service is one such area. While there are full-time firemen, there are also part-time services, which form the backbone of the service in rural areas. It does not seem logical, therefore, that firemen with many years' experience and who are fit, medically, to continue should be forced out of their positions at the age of 55 years. While the motion calls on the Minister to review the age of retirement, it does not seek to set an age limit, but it seems reasonable and logical that firemen should be in a position to continue working up to the age of 60 years at least. Persons of that age are normally of good health and would be well able to perform the duties of firemen effectively.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at the situation in other European fire services. In Holland, for example, the fire service has increased the retirement age from 55 to 60 years. Other countries, including Britain, are considering doing likewise. It is, therefore, a matter we should address. We are calling on the Minister to look seriously at it in a review of the fire service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The amendment raises an issue regarding the remuneration of firemen. I am not convinced that this is an issue upon which rates of pay will have great influence. In Wexford, there is a low ratio of firemen to population because of the structure of the service, which is both good and effective. As a result, firemen are reasonably well paid. Retained firemen earn about £12,000 a year, slightly below the average industrial wage. We have found that advertising in the current climate has not been productive in getting new recruits.</P>
    <P>Other issues have an influence. Those involved in the fire service and in county councils are well aware that many are not prepared to offer the commitment needed from a fireman, who must be available seven hours a day, 365 days a year. It is one of the areas, such as politics, where one must be available around the clock. A quality of life issue is involved which should be examined. Provision has not been made for normal scheduled holidays for those involved in many of the retained fire services because of the nature of their work. This is an issue which needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>On rates of pay, it may involve moving from a retained to a full-time service. I am not sure that would be necessary and it would definitely be more expensive compared with the current system. Given the nature of the job and the fact that, in the main, the service is satisfactory, it be should examined to ascertain how adjustments can be made and it can be trimmed to suit the needs of the new economy. Perhaps the way forward is to continue with retained fire services, but to build into the system sufficient time off and curtailment of the necessity for firemen to be available at all times, including Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day and Easter. There is great emphasis on quality of life issues and such curtailment would have a great impact on the quality of life of those involved.</P>
    <P>Another issue may be important. While there is scope for promotion within the fire service, perhaps it is not as open as it should be in what is a vibrant and competitive area of the economy. In the early 1970s, the McKinsey report stated that there should be access to promotion in all areas up to and including the position of chief fire officer. Qualifications were added subsequently. In order to qualify as a chief fire officer one must have a degree in engineering. Most chief fire officers are engineers or architects. On examining the requirements of the job, however, it appears that being an engineer or architect does not give one a greater feel for the job, greater experience or capacity to do it better than someone with ten, 20 or 25 years' service, who has come up through the ranks, the attaching additional responsibilities, who manages staff and tackles problems within the service. That is an area which should be examined because opening up career opportunities within the retained fire service will be an attraction when it comes to recruitment to the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> There is greater emphasis on training within the service, for which certain moneys have been set aside. That should continue. Focusing on training and improving the skills of staff while drawing on their commitment to the service are the key to avoiding a dearth of staff within the service. I have been informed by the Leader of the House that Moate fire station had to close because of the failure to attract recruits to the service. This could happen in other places. The motivation behind the motion is to focus attention on the issue. While it is being examined by the Minister and his Department, the motion allows us to have an input in ensuring the quality of the fire service, which has been a tremendous success and of tremendous value during the years. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I never thought I would see the day when there would be a shortage of staff in any service, but, to my amazement, there is such a shortage in the fire service. It was the case of Moate fire station which brought the issue to light and it will be one of many. We must try to rectify the matter immediately before it gets seriously out of hand. For as long as I have been a local authority member I have fought continuously to have the fire service upgraded and have a service provided in every town and village in my county. I am sure the same is true of other councils. It is a sad day if recruits cannot be found for this service, which is vital to the viability of communities. It has proved to be effective and done tremendous work for which I compliment all firemen.</P>
      <P>It is nonsensical to state that firemen must retire at the age of 55 years. That is taking matters too far. Those who have spent 20 to 25 years in the fire service and who have gained vast experience must retire at the age of 55 years even if they are fit and healthy. Perhaps they could undergo an annual medical screening. There would be nothing wrong with that. It might be better, therefore, if the retirement age was raised to 60 years.</P>
      <P>The fire service has provided a service on a 24 hour basis for the public since the early 1940s. It is voluntary in many places. This impacts on the social life of those involved because they can be called out at any time. In my village in County Kerry the fire brigade was called out recently at 4 a.m. If we did not have a local fire brigade, the consequences could have been serious. The house was burned down and the family concerned was assisted to escape by the back route. Those involved in the fire service can be called out at any time, including Christmas Day, New Year's Day or on the day an All-Ireland is being played. They must be available constantly.</P>
      <P>When an experienced fireman leaves the service and efforts are made to replace him, a young person may join and be trained at a cost of £5,000 or £6,000. However, this person may leave after two or three years having been trained with taxpayer's money. That is unsatisfactory and akin to a revolving door system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="245" /> The lowering of the retirement age was requested by the trade unions. A letter from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, dated 20 December 1985, which concerned retirement gratuities for part-time fire services stated:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for the Environment to refer to Labour Court Recommendation No. 9605 of 12 March, 1985, which recommended acceptance of a revised scheme of retirement gratuities which are already being offered to part-time fire service personnel.</P>
    <P>The recommendation has been accepted by the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on behalf of each county and city manager but not by the group of unions representing the personnel concerned. In discussions and correspondence subsequent to the Labour Court recommendation, the Board indicated the intention of each manager to introduce a retirement age of 55 years and a compulsory annual medical examination.</P>
    <P>That may have been acceptable in 1985 but now, in 2001, we cannot get recruits anywhere in the country. The situation is out of hand and quite serious. The retirement age for senior officers such as chief fire officer etc. is set at 65 years of age while those performing the donkey work must retire on reaching 55 years of age. That is wrong. We need to take another look at that situation. In 1971 the Government commissioned McKinsey to compile a report identifying the problems being experienced in the fire services. That report was published in 1975.</P>
    <P>Fire service officers are frustrated by the lack of opportunities available to those at ground level. A person working in the Garda can work his way to the top of the force and become Garda Commissioner, yet fire officers can only attain the level of station officer having spent years working at ground level. The position of chief fire officer is held by those holding a degree in architecture or engineering even though such people may have no experience of fire fighting. In the UK, which has a population of millions of people, the chief fire officer is usually a person who has worked his way up from ground level. We need to re-examine the structure of the fire services and introduce incentives to attract young people back into it. We could do so by making it possible for a person having worked at ground level for many years to attain the position of chief fire officer. It is logical to do so.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion. We must put out this fire and change the current retirement age for people in the fire services from 55 years of age to at least 60 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to <Col N="246" /> examine the remuneration scales of both full time and voluntary fire service employees with a view to making employments in the service attractive to possible applicants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first thing that strikes me is that we are debating this motion on the 20th anniversary of the Stardust disaster yet the recommendations made the following year have not been implemented. That is a sad reflection on all of us. It is worthwhile remembering that sad tragic occasion as we open this debate.</P>
    <P>To avoid confusion, the amendment was not intended to subjugate the Leader's recommendation, it was intended to run parallel with it. The idea behind it is two-fold. One of the difficulties being experienced by the fire services is in the area of recruitment, even to the voluntary sector. I asked the chief fire officer in Galway how many unemployed people there might be suitable for the position of fire officer and he came up with only one. The reason he gave was very straightforward; it is not worth their while financially. Any benefits they might accrue from the income would lose them money in social welfare benefits, etc. The position holds no attraction for such people. It was from that perspective I decided to look at this issue further.</P>
    <P>Having worked as a fireman in the voluntary sector for some years, while salary scales have increased they remain too low. I know of the dangers in which people can find themselves. One may be called out to deal with a small chimney fire, but you do not know how serious the fire will be, nor do you know if you will come home. If you are asking people to put their lives on the line to save others, you must be willing to pay them well.</P>
    <P>The Minister could do two things. He could ensure that retention money paid to voluntary firemen is exempt from taxation. That would make employment in the fire services much more attractive. He could also look again at the age at which such people must retire, which is the main thrust of the Government motion. I discussed this issue with the chief fire officer who, obviously, had to reflect the view of the establishment. He pointed out that if one is fighting a fire and using breathing apparatus equipment while operating a buddy-buddy system, that person must be able to perform his function, and a person of 65 years of age may not be able to do so as obviously he will not be as strong as he was in his thirties. The point seemed valid until I started thinking about it. Obviously opportunities exist in the fire services for people over 55 years of age which do not necessarily require them to use such equipment or to climb 100 foot ladders.</P>
    <P>A number of people representing fire fighters raised the issue of including a requirement that people undergo an annual medical examination. If the person is found to be fit and capable, he should be allowed to continue his job. That is very reasonable.</P>
    <P>During my time serving in the voluntary fire service in Galway I recall a number of people <Col N="247" /> reaching senior levels. That is no longer possible because of the current structures. Let us talk about this issue. It may be the most important issue we deal with tonight. It is true that people can work their way to the top in many jobs &ndash; the position in the Garda was referred to earlier. The directors of institutes of technology are not necessarily people who had to qualify in areas of administration, etc. They can also rise to the top having attained a degree. Why can that not be the case in the fire services? I was thinking of a structure which would enable this to happen.</P>
    <P>The institutes of technology are ideally suited for this purpose. They give certification, diplomas and degrees. It is possible, if somebody in the fire services wishes to advance his career, for him to attend such an institute and gain a degree &ndash; there is great flexibility in creating such courses. There are courses in engineering, construction and civil engineering, administration, communication and leadership skills and personnel skills. There are courses covering all the skills required to become a senior officer in the fire services. The institutes could put together a package that would suit these people. They could start with a two year course, leading to a national certificate, and if the person wanted to advance he or she could study for a diploma or degree which would qualify them for employment at senior level. It is not difficult and it is practical and possible. The limit on the retirement age means the experience acquired throughout the years can be wasted. It is only through working on the ground that one learns how these matters operate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Stardust tribunal report, we have all failed when it comes to that report's recommendations. The report stated that the Irish system was unique among those studied by the tribunal in that it combined the worst of both the single tier, graded advancement system and the two tier system. It made recommendations to the national training centre which it should be possible to implement.</P>
    <P>The increased costs of fire services is such a burden on local authorities that it is becoming almost impossible to run them. The cost in Dublin increased from £48 million to £53 million in one year and although it receives some subvention from the Department of the Environment and Local Government it cannot sustain those costs. Other large cities also face this problem. The Minister will have to review both the revenue and capital costs of fire stations with a view to paying the sums involved. Otherwise, local authorities will not be able to continue to give the level of service they have given in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. We welcome the Government motion both for the specific issue it raises and because it allows us to discuss other matters. It is fitting to recall the Stardust disaster in which so many people lost their lives. The old footage was shown on television over the past few years and one could see the great work done by fire-fighters and the ambulance crews which backed them up. The loss <Col N="248" /> of life would have been even greater were it not for the brave actions of those fire-fighters.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that any time a fire engine is called out, be it for a hoax call, chimney fire, bonfire or a major fire, there is the potential that some fire-fighters may not come back. I have witnessed that in the Dún Laoghaire fire service from time to time and it behoves all of us, particularly those of us who are members of local authorities, to remember the great work and commitment of fire-fighters down the years. We hope we do not meet fire-fighters too often, apart from on social occasions, because meeting them usually means a problem of some sort, be it flooding, fire or accident. There is always a problem when the fire-fighters are called out and they have to solve it. We should give them whatever support we can.</P>
      <P>Experience has been mentioned by previous speakers and no matter what training fire-fighters get or manuals they are given, they are dealing with the unknown . There are certain drills but there may also be unexpected problems. One of their colleagues may get into trouble and when this happens the experience factor should not be underestimated. It is often said that one has to be in politics for several years, through ups and downs, to learn about it and one should bear the same lesson in mind regarding the fire service.</P>
      <P>Fire-fighters' hours can be unsocial and they spend their time waiting for something they hope will not happen. They may wait days and then a disaster may occur, whereupon they must be capable of peak performance. Recently we in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council saw statistics about understaffed departments and although we are all aware there are planning departments and so on around the country which are short of administrative staff, there should be no cost-cutting or cutbacks in fire-fighting. If there is a delay in filling a pothole, with luck someone will not die as a result, but fire-fighters should not be short-staffed or feel that their role is not taken seriously. I appeal to the Minister of State to give us an assurance on this matter.</P>
      <P>I heard a fire officer say recently in an interview that accidents are waiting to happen in Dublin, as some places are not inspected and practices are not reviewed regularly enough. If fire officers in some areas were totally vigilant they would cut room sizes in certain buildings by a quarter or a half as there is much overcrowding. There were reports and recommendations after the Stardust disaster but this issue has probably not been taken seriously enough by the Department and successive Ministers. There have been other fires since, such as the Whiddy disaster and a recent tragedy in Bray, but unfortunately our attitude seems to be the same as that which applies to road accidents, that a certain number is inevitable. However, a lot of fires could be prevented and if posts are demanded in certain areas, money should be found in the Department for them. We all have our pet projects but there should be no equivocation or tightening of the purse strings in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the holding of this debate. I am delighted Members on this side will not press a <Col N="249" /> vote on it, as I am sure the terms of our amendment are supported by the Members opposite, in the same way as we support the thrust of the motion. A debate on a subject such as this, which at times probably does not get the airing it deserves, is very useful. I hope the Minister will respond positively to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the issues raised in the motion and the amendment before the Seanad, I am conscious of the fact that today is the 20th anniversary of the Stardust fire tragedy and it is particularly fitting on this day to remember in a special way the 48 young people who died in that disaster.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling the motion and affording me the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to express my appreciation and that of the Minister for the great job our fire-fighters do and the service they provide to the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>When I spoke at a presentation of long service awards to members of the fire service last November, I pointed out that over the past two decades, the role of the fire service has had to change and evolve to meet the changing needs of modern society. Fire-fighters have adapted to those changes and they are now capable of responding effectively to all manner of calls. Fire brigades are now dealing routinely with a diverse range of non-fire emergencies such as road traffic accidents, incidents involving hazardous materials, flooding and rescues. Given this changing role and that the fire authorities respond to almost 120,000 calls a year, including more than 70,000 ambulance calls, a modern, well-equipped fire service is essential to the community.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 more than £110 million has been invested by the State in the fire service capital programme. That has enabled about 115 fire stations to be built or refurbished, more than 400 fire appliances as well as other emergency and rescue equipment to be purchased and the nationwide computer-aided mobilisation project to be implemented. This year, another £15 million, the highest on record, is being allocated to the fire service capital programme.</P>
      <P>There has also been a very significant investment in training. Since it was established in 1983, the Fire Services Council has provided more than 200 courses for more than 4,000 fire service personnel. Those courses are continually being reviewed and updated to take account of the developing needs of the fire service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, announced a strategic review of the fire service just over two weeks ago. In making that announcement, he said that notwithstanding the many positive developments in the fire service over the past 20 to 25 years &ndash; to many of which I adverted &ndash; many factors pointed to the need for a strategic review at this time. Those included the changing role of <Col N="250" /> the service, the changing economic and social circumstances in which the service operates, resulting in recruitment and retention difficulties, particularly in the retained service, and other factors such as the changing agenda in the public service.</P>
    <P>The overriding objective of this review, which will be carried out by independent consultants, will be to examine and report on the arrangement to ensure that people, property and the environment are protected from fire and other emergencies, by the provision of quality fire safety and emergency services. The consultants' report will help inform the development of policy for the future direction of the service. Proposals for the carrying out of the review will be sought shortly. All those who have an interest in this area are urged to make their views known when the consultants commence their task. This review, which will clearly include the issue of recruitment and retention difficulties, is a correct way to inform the development of policy for the future direction of the fire service.</P>
    <P>There are two issues raised in this debate, pay and retirement age. The pay of the full-time and retained fire service has been determined in general by successive national agreements. The retained service has a pay relationship with local authority craftworkers while the full-time service has a pay relationship with the Garda Síochána. Arising from the revisions in the pay of the Garda Síochána, the pay of full-time fire fighters in Dublin has recently been adjusted and negotiations are ongoing with representatives of the other full-time brigades.</P>
    <P>As recently as 1999, the remuneration structure of the retained fire service has been the subject of an independent review by a rights commissioner, Janet Hughes. Arising from that review, which was accepted by local authority management and the unions, the annual retainer and the hourly attendance rates have been significantly increased. Those increases should result in an increase in applications for positions in the retained fire service.</P>
    <P>The public service pay agreement associated with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provided for the establishment of the public service benchmarking body which is now up and running. That body will deal with full-time fire-fighters.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking of the retained fire service will be carried out separately in a parallel exercise to the work of the public service benchmarking body. This exercise will be carried out by a joint working group representing employers and unions under an independent chairperson nominated by the Labour Relations Commission. This working group will examine the existing grading and pay-reward structure, including roles, duties, responsibilities, conditions of employment, etc., and will present its report to an independent expert appointed by the benchmarking body. The independent expert will analyse the results of the study and submit a report to the working group. <Col N="251" /> The report will then be discussed by the working group with a view to agreeing appropriate changes in the existing grading structure, pay-reward structure, work practices etc. In the event of the joint working group failing to reach agreement at any stage in the process, the issues involved will be referred to the Labour Court for resolution. The first meeting of the joint working group has recently taken place.</P>
    <P>It was accepted in the context of the agreement between the parties on the establishment of the public service benchmarking body that any outstanding claims or commitments in relation to pay, analogue or other reviews, in whatever form, by or in respect of any grade, group or category, would be subsumed within the benchmarking exercise and would be dealt with solely in that context. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to embark now on a separate exercise such as is envisaged in the amendment before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As regards retirement age, the 55 year age limit was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job. It is important, too, to realise that since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the fire service is a front line emergency service. Of its nature, fire-fighters' work is dangerous. It is also physically demanding and it is essential that fire-fighters are capable of safely and efficiently undertaking the tasks they are required to perform. This is in the interest of the fire-fighters, their colleagues, the authorities who employ them and the public whom they serve.</P>
    <P>International research indicates that the retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure that fire-fighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them. The compulsory age of retirement has been reviewed in light of the strenuous nature of fire fighters' duties, the possibilities of persons of a particular age achieving the physical capabilities required and the risks involved in undertaking such work. In light of the foregoing it would be very difficult to justify a change in the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1985, various fire authorities operated different retirement ages, with some applying age 55 since the 1960s. In 1985, compulsory retirement at 55 years of age for retained fire service personnel was introduced at national level as a result of a lengthy negotiation process engaged in by the local government staff negotiations board representing local authority managers and the trade unions representing the retained fire fighters. This national measure came about following Labour Court Recommendation 9605 of 12 March 1985, which recommended the phasing in, over a two year period, of compulsory retirement at age 55 and a scheme of retirement gratuities.</P>
    <P>It is important to record that in the arguments put before the Labour Court the unions did not object to the introduction of compulsory retire<Col N="252" /> ment at 55 years of age for part-time firemen &ndash; the issue which brought the matter to the Labour Court was dissatisfaction with the retirement gratuity scheme. In their submission to the court, the unions recognised that the demands of fire-fighting, even then, had changed dramatically over the previous two decades as the physical demands were greater than up to then and they acknowledged that it was in the interests of the community that the retirement age be lowered. It is also significant that, since 1985, there have been no demands from the unions for any change in the retirement age of 55. In this context, too, the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published recently, recommended that new entrant fire-fighters should continue to be subject to a retirement age of 44.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate. It is clear there is widespread understanding of the important role the fire service plays in the lives of our communities and concern for the well-being of the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad mention was made of the Stardust tragedy &ndash; Senator Coogan referred to it first. The debate should be seen in that context. First, I call on the Minister of State to fully implement the Stardust report. That has not been done yet and the Minister of State talked about another report in his contribution. I propose to put on record the number of reports that have been created over the past 30 years whose full implementation is still awaited by the fire service and the public.</P>
      <P>Second, I express my sympathy to the victims of the Stardust tragedy, particularly those who survived because they have been traumatised and many of them feel guilty. I pay tribute to the wonderful work of the fire service and acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of distinguished members of the service. Every major city has fires. This week there was a major fire in Lillie's Bordello and thankfully nobody was injured.</P>
      <P>In the 18th century householders invested in private commercial fire brigade services. If there was a fire, the firemen came out and checked whether there was a little lead spud on the wall. If one had not paid, they would let the house burn down. Thankfully, we now have a decent, courageous and fully professional fire service equipped to deal with the complications of modern life such as chemical spills, chemical explosions and appalling tragedies on the roads in which sometimes cars burst into flames.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we pay tribute to the fire service. I am extremely glad that Fine Gael has accepted that the motion will not be put to a vote. It would not be the right way to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Stardust tragedy or to pay tribute to the fire people. The recommendations of both sides of the House should be taken on board. I see no huge difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a university degree. My cousin, Horace Reginald Harold Sharpe, who was chief fire officer of County Wicklow until his death, had a <Col N="253" /> degree in engineering. I do not think that is necessary and, in a situation where one must think on one's feet as one is ultimately dealing with an absolutely practical situation, nothing replaces experience. Experience should be rewarded and we should not have this apartheid &ndash; every report since 1970 has referred to this. Let us have action instead of pious platitudes.</P>
    <P>To retire at 55 is a joke. The Minister of State did not retire at 55. I am 55 this year and I have no intention of retiring. Earlier Joe Duffy was discussing ageism. We have sexism, racism and ageism. If people are not capable of doing the job let them have a medical check up. In France the Department responsible tried to make fire-fighters continue until they were 65 whereas they were required to retire at 60. The firemen protested because they wanted to enjoy themselves and not be stuck in that situation.</P>
    <P>The most frustrating scenario for firemen in Ireland is the lack of opportunity for people at ground level to advance. This is completely different from the situation in Britain. For example, it is possible in the London fire brigade service, which covers ten million people if greater London is included, twice the population of this island, to advance to the position of chief fire officer without a university degree.</P>
    <P>The second principal recommendation of the McKinsey report in 1971 was that opportunities should be created for promotions to chief fire officer from within the service. It stated that current staff shortages can be attributed in part to poor career prospects, and a programme should therefore be established to enable firemen with suitable ability to develop the necessary administrative and technical skills. Does the Minister of State still think another report is needed to confirm this conclusion?</P>
    <P>A working party was established in 1972 on foot of the report. It reported in 1975 and its summary recommendations were:</P>
    <P>A new technological qualification should be devised for senior grades. The F.S.C. should advise on the appropriate qualification, and how best it might be provided for within the third level educational system.</P>
    <P>Appointees to the Senior Grades should have a Fire Service Background.</P>
    <P>Appropriate technical qualifications should be devised for middle grades of S.O., Sub O., and related ranks.</P>
    <P>Entry to the Fire Service should be on the basis of a single tier entry system at Firemen level.</P>
    <P>No progress was made on foot of this report, so what is the point of a report?</P>
    <P>We then walked straight into the Stardust tragedy and the report of the tribunal in 1982. Its recommendations were:</P>
    <P>The Staff of the Fire Prevention Department should be increased immediately to the number <Col N="254" /> which, in the opinion of the Chief Fire Officer, is the minimum necessary to deal with its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>(2) Structure.</P>
    <P>The morale and efficiency of the Dublin Fire Brigade has been at a disturbingly low level for a number of years. The Tribunal considers that, with a view to raising the morale and efficiency of the Brigade generally, certain major changes in its staff structures should be made.</P>
    <P>That leads to the point ably made by Senator Coogan regarding the two tier system and its application in Ireland. The tribunal report stated:</P>
    <P>The system of recruitment to fire brigades differs from country to country: in some cases, there is what is called a &ldquo;two-tier&rdquo; structure, in other cases a &ldquo;one-tier&rdquo; structure. Where a two-tier structure is employed, posts above a certain level are filled either by promotion from the ranks of firemen and inwards or by the appointment to the posts of persons with university degrees or equivalent qualifications. Where a one-tier structure is employed, all posts up to the highest ranks are filled by promotion from the lower ranks; and this normally means that the posts at the highest levels are not filled by persons with university degrees or equivalent qualifications. The advantage of the two-tier structure is that it ensures that members of the fire brigades at the appropriate levels have the necessary specialised knowledge of fire safety engineering which can only be derived from attendance at university courses or their equivalent. The advantage of the one structure is that it ensures that all posts in the fire service up to the highest level are filled by persons who have a wide practical experience of all aspects of fire fighting. The Irish system is unique. in combining the worst features of both systems.</P>
    <P>For this reason it needs to be examined. We have been promised the establishment and maintenance of a national training centre and we should hear more about that. In 1982 the engineer's working party report was published, which stated there should be further discussion on education. In 1998 the Report on Findings and Recommendations of the Review Team was published. It stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend that access to career opportunities should be explored. In particular, we recommend that ways of equipping fire brigade staff to meet the qualification requirements of Chief Fire Officer and Assistant Chief Fire Officer be examined. We also recommend that the scholarship scheme already agreed be communicated and encouraged to the brigade. Furthermore, with the expansion in the range of third level qualifications now available we recommend that the recognition of &ldquo;Equivalent Qualifications&rdquo; to those currently specified for those levels should be explored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> The current degree qualifications recognised by the Minister for the post of chief fire officer, bachelor of engineering or bachelor of architecture, are not the only appropriate qualifications. Areas such as personnel management, command and control, health, safety and welfare at work, knowledge of appliances, budgets and the myriad details needed to manage a full-time emergency service which sometimes only comes from experience are not covered.</P>
    <P>While it is agreed that a degree qualification is a requirement for the post of chief fire officer, it does not follow that that same level of education should also be required for the rank immediately beneath the chief or the ranks below that. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance. I believe he will take on board the unusual degree of co-operation between the different groupings in the House. If we must have a report, let us know when it will be published and let its recommendations be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>In a short time I put together a list of reports covering the past 30 years which have still not been implemented. If we really feel as we should about the situation and the tragedy of Stardust, the best memorial we can give to those people is to implement in full the recommendations of these reports and in particular those of the Stardust inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to take this debate and also Mr. O'Connor and his colleagues from the fire-fighting service. His father served as a distinguished Member of the Oireachtas for 21 years and also in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I support the call for retained firemen to be left in their positions until at least 60 years of age. I am concerned at the Minister's reply that the local government staff negotiations board, representing local authority managers, and the trade unions representing the retained fire-fighters, made this decision on 12 March 1985. We know what was happening at that time. We had massive emigration aptly described as the &ldquo;flight of the earls&rdquo; by Liam Reilly. There are totally changed circumstances now. We are told the full complement of the retained fire-fighting service is 2,220. At present the numbers are 1,860. That leaves 360 vacancies. I do not say there is a crisis in the service but there is an alarming problem emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 January shows that Moate, in County Westmeath, is to lose its fire-fighting service. Moate, like Castlepollard, Mullingar, Kilbeggan and Athlone, has had a fire service since around 1946. I come from a family very much associated with the fire service. Since 1946 there has been a continuous link to my family. The fireman going to bed each night has to organise things so that in the event of a call he can be at the station within three minutes. I do not need to mention the unsocial hours. If he wants to attend church or a sporting event his wife must <Col N="256" /> be beside the phone or the bleeper must be on. Such people provided Ireland with a spectacular service. There was very little monetary reward for what they were doing. They were an emergency service putting their lives on the line every time there was a call-out. I have personal experience of occasions when horrific accidents or house fires occurred. People have lost their lives and it is the firemen who have had to face this. The remuneration for the service that these men and women provide, above and beyond the call of duty, is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The retained fire service has a station officer, the most experienced person the fire service has. What is being proposed, in a time of crisis when men and women cannot be recruited to join these services, is that senior people retire at 55. Senior personnel do not have to go out on emergencies but they have to make decisions on what has to be done. We should recognise their experience. If the Minister is to bring in another report he should at least keep those senior people in place until the report is published. We intend to go further with this matter.</P>
    <P>Last year I said that waste management would be the single biggest issue facing local authorities. I can see now that this emergency service will be another major problem for all local authorities. The population of Moate is 3,000 and we cannot get eight people to serve in the local fire brigade. Unemployment is down to 4% overall and down to 1.2% of those able to work. It is plain that there is a crisis. I also understand that SIPTU representatives and managers have no objection to the age limit being extended.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that the retention money these fire people get for attending their parades should be tax free, as it was in the past. They are an emergency service on call 24 hours a day. Every Member of the House is in full agreement that the men and women in the retained fire service should be listened to. They have never before come in highlighting their problems and risks but now come to us as Oireachtas representatives and as local authority members. At the general council of county councils' conference in Castlebar and at the local conference of urban councils and town commissions this was a topic they wanted addressed by us as Members of the Oireachtas. We are the direct elected representatives of the county councillors and their voice in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If 60 years of age cannot be accepted, surely the age limit should be extended to at least 57 if it is going to take a year for this report to be looked into by the consultants. The age limits for station officers should be extended to 60 immediately because there is no difficult manual work expected of those in such positions. The circumstances of 1985 have changed over the last 15 years.</P>

      <P>I come from the second biggest city in the Republic. The Minister is very aware of how we feel about our fire service. There are <Col N="257" /> particular problems from a costing point of view. In 1999 it cost us £6.6 million in the city of Cork. The county contributes £400,000 of that. In 2001 it will cost £8.3 million, an increase of over £2 million. It is the biggest expenditure in the city apart from capital expenditure on housing and roads.</P>
      <P>I do not know how towns are holding on to people to do this work. In 1985, jobs were needed for younger people and older people were let go. Now we are getting rid of experienced people. An amendment is needed to give employees the option of retirement at 55 or not later than 57 years, if they so wish.</P>
      <P>The bigger urban areas have full-time employees in the fire service. I am worried about smaller towns where people are no longer prepared to work in the fire service. The small remuneration they receive is taxed, which is most unfair. What will happen in the future? </P>
      <P>The city of Cork is paying over £8.3 million a year for the fire service and the county is paying only £440,000. The city is the smallest part of the whole county but the city takes the responsibility. Heavy industry is situated in the Cork Harbour area and there have been serious fires in Irish Steel and in a pharmaceutical factory. It is the city which provides the fire services, even though the harbour is in the county area. The Department of the Environment and Local Government makes contributions to the Dublin region for fire services but not to the Cork region. I wish that to be noted. If a certain group of people are asked to pay all the costs and others pay nothing, it could be detrimental to the fire services and this cannot be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Stardust fire tragedy happened 20 years ago and it is still upsetting to think of the loss of young life. The fire regulations are better than they were then. The relevant authorities have made great improvements and they are to be congratulated for that. Anyone in business today knows that the fire regulations must be implemented. At least today there is protection in the form of fire doors in corridors, higher standards in house building, and the fire officers strictly enforce the regulations. We are proud of our fire service in Cork.</P>
      <P>I am worried that people will not be interested in working in the fire service on a voluntary and part-time basis. The proposal that the earnings of part-time fire service workers should be taxed is most unfair. These workers are on call at all times.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Cassidy's point about using older experienced personnel. They can train the younger people and they should not be put aside at the age of 55, 57 or even 65 years. Senator Norris mentioned the practice in France where older workers are used to train their juniors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I am pleased to welcome members of the Retained Fire-Fighters' Association who are in the House. They came at their own expense and this shows <Col N="258" /> the interest they have in this important topic. Local authorities have very important responsibilities and this one is about life and death. This House should give it serious attention this evening. I note that both sides of the House are in agreement.</P>
      <P>The playing pitch must be levelled. Junior officers are obliged to retire at 55 years of age and senior officers do not retire until 65 years of age. This can be very demoralising. A career in fire fighting is a vocation. Even in poor working conditions with poor remuneration, fire-fighters stick at the job. They do not wish to retire at 55 years of age because they are totally dedicated to providing a much-needed service, for which they are to be commended. This House should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure these workers have an opportunity to remain in employment until at least 57 and have an option to continue until 65 years of age. I agree that a medical examination would be necessary but there is a role for older employees in the fire service.</P>
      <P>I refer to the lack of incentive for retained fire-fighters to compete for promotion within the fire service. I would like to see opportunities for those coming up through the ranks to compete for the position of chief fire officer against those who have professional qualifications. Some of the best and most famous people in this country have come up through the ranks &ndash; the Garda has been mentioned and I could mention many other people in the public sector and the private sector. They may not be highly educated or have numerous degrees, but they are outstanding leaders. They are experienced and know what it takes on the ground, which means that they can control and run a good service. This applies to the fire service.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy mentioned that we do not have the full complement of 2,200 retained fire-fighters. Some 340 extra people are needed, which is quite a lot when one considers that seven or eight people can make up a fire service in an area. It is also a number which will increase. I understand the Minister of State's point that the figure was reached in consultation with the trade unions in the 1980s when there was an employment problem, which we no longer have. It was sensible at that time to create more jobs and to get more people into the workforce. Thankfully, we have reached full employment. Young people will not take up positions such as fire-fighters because they do not consider it worthwhile for the remuneration involved. They are not prepared to sacrifice their social life, as is their entitlement. Those who are prepared to make such a sacrifice should not be neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently informed local authorities of his intention to refurbish and develop stations and replace vehicles. Although welcome, I wonder if we will have the people to work with this new equipment. It is important that those over the age of 55 are retained. They want to stay because they are dedicated people with a <Col N="259" /> vocation. Many years ago, the fire service was only used in the event of a fire, but fire-fighters are now involved on a daily basis in dealing with carnage on our roads, as we discussed this morning. It is an appalling problem which is getting worse. It results in severe trauma for fire-fighters, who have to come back to their station to be debriefed. Their colleagues in the past did not have to deal with chemicals and so on but mainly with chimney fires and house fires. They are to be complimented for the diligent manner in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Stardust tragedy, which should not have happened. There was a fire in Drumcollogher in 1926 when 48 people died, as in the Stardust. Lessons had not been learnt, but we must learn them now if we wish to avoid another tragedy. Today's<i> Irish Independent</i> reports the fear of overcrowding expressed by many fire officers. Many nightclubs are overcrowded because as many people as possible are packed in. Rural areas do not have a lot of venues, so everybody wants to get in. A fire officer is entitled to close down a nightclub and count the people as they exit. A subsequent prosecution will take many months, which causes problems. We encourage people to be aware of fire prevention.</P>
    <P>I support this wise motion, which comes at an opportune time. It is getting the support of all Members of the House. Senator Norris has quoted many reports which recommended new systems of recruitment into, and promotion within, the fire services. Reports are a dead loss, we need action. People over the age of 55 should be allowed to continue to serve.</P>

      <P>When I was 17 years of age, I joined the local part-time fire service in Dingle. On Sunday afternoons, I went from Dingle back to An Fheothanach with Pat Brosnan, Tadhg Lynch and others who gave their time week after week, month after month, year after year to provide emergency cover at the far end of the Dingle peninsula. I did not spend any great time in or make any great commitment to the area. A few months later, I went to college which brought an end to my brief period in the fire service. I know the reality of what these people have done and the commitment they have given.</P>
      <P>Society does not invest in what Maureen Gaffney calls &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;. Senator Cregan spoke of people having other lives and not having much spare time anymore. Society needs to recognise the contribution made by people in their communities, above and beyond what is demanded of them. We should celebrate and welcome voluntary services, which provide the social fabric of Irish life. We should increase rather than cut back on the fire service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as being a part-time member of the fire service, I was and still am a member of the Public Services Pensions Commission, which produced the report that the Minister of State quoted in his <Col N="260" /> last two paragraphs. Although I do not believe that he misled the House, I believe that part of the speech was drafted incorrectly. For example, it stated that the public services commission final report which was published recently recommended that the new entrant fire-fighters should continue to be required to retire at the age of 55. Although well written and correct, the speech gave the wrong impression of why such a recommendation was made. It was made because there had been a proposal to increase the age to 60 years of age. It was the view of the Public Services Pensions Commission that that was not necessary and it should not happen. The retirement age was retained at 55 even though there was a proposal to increase it to 60. A wrong impression was given. I took part in discussions with SIPTU on the permanent fire service, which is a different issue. Those who came to the decision did not intend it to apply to the part-time fire service. I want to make that clear for the record. I should also say that the Minister made that statement in good faith.</P>
    <P>Today's edition of<i> The Guardian</i> said &ldquo;The Government [the British Government &ndash; maybe we should not have let it go] will today announce a working group to iron out the details of the law which will ban compulsory retirement at any age&rdquo;. The reason it is doing so is that employment, in Ireland as well as Britain, is so low. Society is plagued by ageism. There is a view that people should have to retire. I have argued within my own teachers' union that there should not be a retirement age. People should be allowed work as long as they are ready, able and willing. In 1981, I similarly argued that one could not say whether a four year old child was or was not ready for school because of their age. There must be a readiness.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a teacher should not have to retire at 55 years of age. The pensions commission, of which I am a member, has recommended a compulsory retirement age for teachers of 65 years of age. Anyone who thinks that the parents of Ireland are going to imprison teachers in the classroom until 65 years of age should realise that it will not happen. When asked my view, I said that it was utterly irrelevant as teachers are a strong enough group to ensure that the recommendation will not be put in place. The same applies to the fire service. The only way in which we can meet additional employment needs is by taking on immigrants and people who have retired.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about this subject many times in this Chamber. The idea that people reach a certain age and then they are cut off is nonsense and does not recognise increased life expectancy, better health or better living conditions. You are able or you are not able. What do you do at particular ages, not just at 55 but at any age? That people are fit and able, medically, physically, and whatever other way is required by the job, should be the one and only demand of them. It is utter nonsense to decide that we should implement <Col N="261" /> across the board, in an ageist fashion, a measure that is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>It was this House which brought forward the change to the employment equality legislation of 1997 to prevent ageism on job specifications and we are now moving in the wrong direction. Even the right-wing economists of Europe tell us we should not be allowing people to go out of the workplace at 55 years of age. The hypocrisy of this decision is striking. If the Government had to pay a pension to people at age 55 they would not allow them to retire &ndash; they would want them to stay on until 70.</P>

      <P>There is no justice or basis to this decision. It is wrong, it should be fought as being wrong, and that is where we need to go. We need to encourage people who provide the social capital, people who give of themselves to their communities. Those in churches, in political parties, in trade unions, anywhere we try to get people together, recognise how difficult it is to get people to do things voluntarily, or for a pittance or whatever. Lives are dependent on these people.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of quality of life and community protection, which is important for those living alone. We had politicians thumping their hearts with concern for elderly people living on their own and in danger. This change has the same impact. We are reducing the number of people who can make a contribution. This legislation and regulation is a nonsense. It should be reversed and we should make it clear to Government that we want a change and will not put up with it any longer. The people deserve to be given a voice and I would support them in ensuring that the proposed maximum age of 55 is thrown out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the motion but I differentiate between full-time fire-fighters in cities and those who look after communities. A community is made up of particular people. The town of Dingle, for example, is made up of different voluntary groups who protect it in different ways. We do not have a life boat to protect our fishermen. Instead we have voluntary people in cliff and sea rescue who are there at any time, a tradition started by the British. The fire-fighters and the fire station in Dingle make up an important part of our community, as they do in every small town and village.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about fire-fighters in the cities or their pay. We are not talking about the pay of part-time fire-fighters either. All they want is to be allowed work. Look at the experience we will lose. These are community people, those that Senator O'Toole and all of us have grown up with in our parishes. I do not think education comes into it. If there is a fire you want a good, strong lump of a man to go out there to do his job.</P>

      <P>The rules and regulations being brought in mean you would nearly need a university education to become a temporary fire-fighter and that is wrong. The rule that you have to be an engineer to become the chief or the assistant chief is wrong also. All we want is those with common sense who are properly trained by the right people. Concerning training, I am reliably informed that ten people who have trained all the fire-fighters around Ireland over recent years will shortly reach 55 and their skill and experience will be lost because they will have to retire. In Dingle two weeks ago, we celebrated the retirement of two fire-fighters against their will and we praised them for their work down the years.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way. I remember the fire service in Dingle when I was a child of ten or 12. The fire-fighters would come in an old banger of a car with the word &ldquo;fire&rdquo; painted on the side, a ladder on the roof, and about ten buckets painted red. That was what we had, and back then people stuck with it. The service went from that to getting a pump that was towed by the car, and eventually to getting the fire engines that were hived off when Tralee or Killarney were finished with them.</P>
      <P>I do not want to cite examples from Dingle only &ndash; every town and village is the same. We now have good buildings and equipment and what are we trying to do? We are trying to sideline the people with experience, those who attended fires all their lives. It is not just the fighting of fires anymore. Fire-fighters are called out to everything that happens in the community, including car crashes. If a doctor aged 75 goes out to help somebody after a car crash he is not told to go home. He is still qualified.</P>
      <P>I am on the governing body of UCD. When a teacher or professor reaches the age of 65 in UCD, he or she is supposed to retire. That is fine. There is an option, however, in that the governing body can decide whether that person is fit to continue. In the same way I suggest that fire-fighters, when they reach the age of 55, look for an extension of their service. They should go through whatever is necessary to make sure they are fit people. There are people like myself who had a bad heart 40 years ago and would never qualify for fire-fighting, but there are others who are 60 and 65 years of age and have nothing wrong with their heart. They are physically strong and healthy. They have experience and ability from the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>When I was a county councillor in 1974, one of the councillors was a fire-fighter. He still is, and he is here listening to this debate. It is sad that he and his colleagues will have to retire in one or two years' time. There is 30 years of experience going down the drain. Somebody has to pass on the skills that these people have and these experienced fire-fighters are the ones to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortage of fire-fighters has nothing to do with pay. It is a particular type of person we need and we are running short of them. The service is <Col N="263" /> based on community spirit and a basically voluntary effort. These people have their own job to do in life but whenever their beeper goes off, they are gone. No matter where they are &ndash; they could be out at a social or a dance, but whatever they are doing, they have to go. They are of vital importance.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we focus on the cities and forget that rural Ireland needs a service. I urge the Minister to heed the views of both sides of the House. I ask him to reconsider and to set up a meeting with the appropriate members of the temporary fire-fighting service. They could make their case to the Minister. By the time the forthcoming review is completed, quite a number of people will have retired. We need something done now.</P>
    <P>From the number of people speaking here tonight, it is clear that they know what is happening in their community. There are a few things that we all look for in our community. We want to make sure we have doctors, policemen, fire-fighters and so on. These are part and parcel of our parishes and towns. I would hope that in the next couple of weeks either the Minister for State or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government might think it appropriate to meet a group of these people to thrash it out. If they went through a fitness test quite a number of them would be there for another couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. Anybody listening would recognise this as a very valuable debate on an issue which would not come before us too often but is a very important matter. I commend Senator Cassidy on bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody in this House disagrees with what Senator Fitzgerald has just set out so well and indeed others have also stated, which is that enforced retirement at 55 is ridiculous. We all know lots of people who are fit, able and working away well into their 60s, 70s and in some cases into their 80s. People who chose to stay working should be allowed to do so. I support the comments made on that. The idea of enforced retirement should simply be done away with. I have heard some comments recently on the radio about ageism and am aware of the views of the Equality Authority and certain advertisements in the newspapers. I have no doubt that there exists a level of ageism which we will have to combat, not simply because it is right to do so but also because, as other speakers have said, times have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The era of a large-scale availability of people for the workforce is over. We are in the happy position of having full employment but economic change has created challenges in other areas. As others have mentioned, one effect of the economic change is that the availability of people for voluntary activity in the community is diminishing. That does not mean that the spirit is not <Col N="264" /> there, but people simply do not have the time to give to community activity that they did in the past. This may be a result of both parents being at work from Monday to Friday, often away from home, and that the rest of the time available must go to family. The number of people who are engaged in self-employment such as agriculture has also dropped. People who are engaged in full-time tied-down work are not going to be available for, for instance, the retained fire service. Senator Fitzgerald has set that out very well and I do not intend to repeat the point.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and we must change with them. In the Minister's review that must be taken into account. We need to retain that voluntary spirit, that sense of contribution to the community which has been at the heart of the retained fire service since it was established. People are prepared to give when they are asked and when they can, but we should not stand idly by and accept an injustice such as this issue of enforced early retirement.</P>
    <P>We know that the role of the fire service has changed and certainly, as Senator Cassidy said, the fact that there are 360 vacancies nationally in the retained service is an issue of concern which must be addressed. It could quite easily be addressed in the short term and a potential crisis averted by the Minister acting immediately to abolish this compulsory retirement age of 55. That would ensure that a large body of experienced people are not lost to the communities in which they serve. I know that away from the cities, in many of our major towns, the fire service would be under pressure because of the reducing numbers in the retained fire service. In the review the Minister must look at a number of options and this would be one that he could easily address very quickly.</P>
    <P>Another option which he should look at as a potential change is to generate, at least in some areas, particularly in the major towns, a number of full-time jobs. I am suggesting the possibility of someone having the choice of going into the fire service on a full-time basis against the background of its being a well-paid job and not being treated as a lower grade worker without promotion opportunities. People who are gaining experience and have training should be allowed to work their way up through the ranks.</P>
    <P>The role of anybody in the fire service is a far more responsible one than it was. There are large factories all over the country. We have major utilities that we did not have before. We have building regulations that we did not have before. We have higher standards of fire regulations and that is as it should be. As a result of the larger body of legislation that has come forward, we have generated far greater responsibility and a higher level of work for the whole fire service. That should be reflected in the Minister's review and I ask him to consider creating a greater number of full-time posts, both to keep people in the service <Col N="265" /> and also to attract more people into it, while at the same time not diluting the community spirit and the sense of voluntary service which is so central to and valuable in the retained fire service.</P>
    <P>The media have recently revisited the Stardust incident which left a huge mark on the country. All of us remember where we were when we heard about the tragedy. I was a university student at the time and many of those who died would have been about my own age. It is very poignant to revisit the whole issue. We did learn lessons from it and we know that we have to be so much more careful. The community that I come from immediately moved to make community facilities safe and to ensure that there would be no such tragedy again. There are very few of us who, when we go into a cinema or other public facility, do not look for the fire exits. Lessons have been learnt but there is a long way to go yet. I urge the Minister to take on board the views expressed here tonight and to act on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Wallace. I support this timely and important motion. I agree with the review of the retirement age. As one who is nearing that age I can understand that a fireman does not like being told to retire at 55. The fire services give excellent service. Those being asked to retire have been there a long time, before the modern call-out system. They stayed at home all weekend and at other times to be available to tackle a fire or other tragedy. We have to respect people who reach this age. It is unnecessary to retire at 55. The people in question are prepared to undergo medical tests to ascertain whether they can fulfil their duties.</P>
      <P>I live near Moate and I have seen advertisements seeking fire-fighters. Recruitment is difficult everywhere because people have other jobs. There are 300 unfilled vacancies in the country. This must be addressed. A strategic review of the fire service has been announced. A stay should be put on the retirement age until after that review. The union representatives should be allowed to put their case to the Minister. Then a decision can be made.</P>
      <P>Fire-fighters have many skills, such as life saving. They cope with accidents, flooding and chemical spills. We cannot afford to lose them because of age. This would be a major mistake. This issue should have been addressed before. A fit member of the fire service should be allowed to remain after 55. The Minister, Deputy Wallace, should impress upon the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the points made here tonight by speakers on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the members of the fire service. There are some here tonight who are recipients of long service awards. It shows their commitment that they are here to listen to <Col N="266" /> the debate and fight on behalf of those wishing to serve as fire-fighters. It is poignant that this is the 20th anniversary of the Stardust tragedy. On that Valentine's night many young people died.</P>
      <P>Voluntary service is declining because people find it hard to make the commitment. As Senator O'Meara said, people have little free time because they commute to work. It may seem appropriate that people retire at 55 after long service to the community, but shortages are so severe that we cannot afford to lose men and women, the few who are there, of this calibre. They are willing to remain on. They accept the point raised that a two year medical review is necessary.</P>
      <P>In Cappamore, one person who retired has not been replaced. This is why it is necessary to retain people beyond 55 years of age. They are an extraordinary breed. They often know the people they attend to at accidents, and they need counselling to cope with this. I appeal to the Minister to listen to the points raised, particularly that rates may have to be increased to retain people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader on tabling the motion. I have been approached by firemen in Donegal. None mentioned pay as an issue but they were concerned about retirement. The Stardust tragedy was mentioned. That would have been worse but for the firemen present. I pay tribute to our firemen who work unsociable hours in a dangerous job. When the age clause was introduced in 1985 society was different. There was high unemployment which meant people were available. We have become health conscious in the past ten or 15 years. Firemen are fit and able and age is no obstacle to performing their duties. As Senator Fitzgerald said, I would prefer an experienced fireman to a young one. Fire strikes so quickly that it does not give one many options. I support the case made by other Senators. As they said, there is no need for the Minister to wait for a report. He can put a stay on this.</P>
      <P>There are other issues regarding deficiencies in the service which I would like to see addressed in reports, such as the services available to the islands, for example. The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, is pushing for this following the disaster in Galway. In particular, the service available to Arranmore, County Donegal, needs to be upgraded.</P>
      <P>Traffic accidents were mentioned by Senator Cassidy. In a large town like Dungloe, it took an accident to highlight the lack of cutting equipment available to the fire service. Thankfully, when I made an approach to the Department, the cutting equipment was made available quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other issues which are particularly relevant to rural areas. When we approached the environment engineer in our area about the lack of fire hydrants and inadequate water pressure he <Col N="267" /> informed us that while a survey would be conducted, unfortunately, there was no money available to address the problem. Funding should be provided to install sufficient hydrants, etc.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister and the Department for the capital programme which has been undertaken to provide equipment, such as fire engines, and upgrade fire stations. I am glad that in the past week the Department has allocated funding to County Donegal to upgrade two fire stations and provide two or three new fire engines.</P>
    <P>There is an insufficient number of ambulances in rural areas. I am glad that the report drawn up for Donegal County Council recommends a minimum of two bays in all upgraded stations. An ambulance service should be provided in each fire station. Such a service could be provided on a part-time basis or operated by firemen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant meeting of minds during the debate. I have attended many debates on Private Members' motions where there have been divisions, but there has been much common ground tonight.</P>
      <P>It is, as the Minister of State and others reminded us, the 20th anniversary of the Stardust fire and we extend our sympathy to all those who were bereaved on that night. In the past week others have lost their lives in fires. It is only at such times that we fully appreciate contribution made by the fire service in the preservation of life. It establishes firmly the contribution of local government in improving quality of life and safety standards. Firemen deserve to be commended for their contribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State astutely indicated the two issues involved in the motion and the amendment. He has been a strong proponent of the fire service in his city and county. The recent remuneration review took full account of the Opposition amendment which seeks to address the issue of proper pay and conditions for firemen.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that increasing the age limit would involve consideration of the health and safety issue, but there are certain responsibilities and duties within the fire service in respect of which the sensitivity attached to the age limit would not be as pronounced. We all agree that people's ability and what they can do at different ages vary considerably. I recommend that the arbitrary age limit of 55 years be looked at in the overall review.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely. The age limit should be increased in certain circumstances, with due consideration for particular medical qualifications. There should also be a review of various duties within the service to ascertain how persons who have made the fire service their career can continue in the service given that the opportunities for employment are far greater than heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to hear about this important matter, the application of St. Kevin's primary school, Littleton, for disadvantaged status. My files indicate that this is the third occasion on which I have raised an issue concerning the school, although not specifically this matter, on the Adjournment. In the past I have raised the question of the need for sanction for refurbishment and extension of the school and other works. I am happy to say that the works in question have been sanctioned and are at design stage. They are linked to the need for the school to be granted disadvantaged status.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who comes from north Tipperary maintains contact with the area through her family. Perhaps she is <i>au fait</i> with the situation in Littleton, which is near Thurles.</P>
      <P>There are 143 children on the roll in Littleton national school. The economic and social background of the area can only be described as disadvantaged, mostly for historical reasons. There are 160 local authority houses in what is a small area where employment is concentrated in the large Bord na Móna factory, where employment opportunities have depleted. As in other areas, many of those who used to live in the local authority houses to which I have referred have bought their own homes. This means that the catchment area of the school is dominated by households which collectively are experiencing a number of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain considerable contact with the staff of the school, including the principal, the parents' council and the community in general. A huge amount of work is being done by the parents' council on behalf of the community and the school. While it is true that there are problems in the area, it would be unfair to label it as a prob<Col N="269" /> lem area. The committee is doing its utmost to secure the necessary resources to solve the school's problems. It is unfortunate that it was not included in the announcement by the Minister in January of this year's programme for schools designated as disadvantaged. It was a bureaucratic problem of application forms and a questionnaire not reaching the Department in time. A bureaucratic error meant the school was not included. The application is one of a number being reviewed by the Department this month. That is the reason it is so urgent that the matter is attended to as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The school is rising to the problems and issues facing it. Over 50% of the 143 pupils on the roll come from households in public or voluntary housing, 16% come from traveller families who have their own special needs, while about 46% come from households where the head of the household is unemployed. The picture is clear. Barnardos is undertaking a project in the school based specifically on the identified needs of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a six teacher school and, apart from its immediate inclusion in the disadvantaged schools programme, its needs are to maintain the current mainstream teacher number of six, to have a full-time home-school-community liaison officer and to obtain additional funding. The school has been allocated a part-time learning resource teacher who is present in the school three and a half days each week. There is a need for a resource teacher both for children with special needs and for traveller children, of whom there are 23 on the rolls. This is, proportionately, much higher than average. There is also a need for special needs assistants.</P>
    <P>The school has outlined its needs. Its major concern is that, refurbishment and extension having been sanctioned, the brief given to the architect is much less than what the school needs. The brief is for a six classroom school, but lack of space is a major problem. It is urgent that the school is granted disadvantaged status. This can then become part of a new brief for the extension and refurbishment of the school to ensure, for example, a parents' room is provided for with increased staff facilities. There is a need for an additional staff bathroom, additional car parking space, and additional space for resource teachers and special needs teachers.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to the needs of this community which does much to help itself. She should heed its call for inclusion of the school in the disadvantaged schools programme in order that the teachers concerned and the community as a whole obtain the resources they need to meet the special needs of the community. I make that plea in the hope of a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the <Col N="270" /> Senator for raising the issue of Littleton national school in which, as she said, I take an interest. When I met the principal last week we discussed the full profile of the school and the application made.</P>
      <P>The issue of disadvantaged status arises in the context of the new programme of supports for pupils in primary schools announced by the Minister for Education and Science on 4 January. Only schools which participated in the recent national survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools are eligible to receive the package of supports available under the new programme.</P>
      <P>All primary schools were invited to participate in a comprehensive survey of all primary schools undertaken by the independent Educational Research Centre in April and May 2000 on behalf of the Department of Education and Science. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The profile of the school outlined by the Senator and an examination of its file and profile suggest that it would qualify under a number of different headings.</P>
      <P>At least three separate items of correspondence issued to all schools about the survey. It was expected that the survey would be completed before the summer of 2000, but this was not possible because schools requested additional time to compile the information requested. It was then decided that schools which submitted returns before 31 August would be ranked under this phase of the programme. Almost 75% of primary schools responded by that date. Participation in the survey was not obligatory. There was no way the Department of Education and Science would go back to a school which had not replied to ascertain the reason it had not replied.</P>
      <P>A number of accepted socio-economic variables were used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found to be valid indicators of disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research which showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural locations. Participating schools were ranked in order of the number of disadvantaged pupils enrolled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The findings were used to allocate resources under the new programme to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The programme involves expenditure of £26 million over a three year period, including the allocation of over 200 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils <Col N="271" /> from disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports must be targeted at the disadvantaged pupils in each school. The programme has both an urban and rural dimension.</P>
    <P>All the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Almost 2,300 primary schools will benefit under the programme based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the Educational Research Centre survey. Details of the schools eligible for assistance under the programme have been published.</P>
    <P>Schools which submitted survey returns after 31 August were not considered for inclusion in this phase of the new programme. I am aware from the principal of Littleton primary school that the completed questionnaire was not received from the school until 21 September 2000. While I am aware that there are surrounding issues, it is important to indicate that the reason the school was not considered was not that it did not qualify, but that its application was not received by 31 August. The position on such schools is that the ERC has been requested to consider their submissions. Their position will be considered by the Department under the later phases of the programme. I presented the file again this week to the relevant section of the Department and asked that it review the position of Littleton primary school quickly. It was in the context of the Barnardos project as part of the extended State-run, Government funded Springboard project that I met the principal of the school. I regret that it is not possible to include the school in the new programme at this stage, but I have asked for its submission to be reviewed. I hope it will be included in the new phase.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is committed to supporting schools such as Littleton primary school which will receive the new supports to which it is entitled. I am aware that the school has applied for a second resource teacher for travellers and the Department expects to be in a position to make a decision on this issue shortly. I thank the Senator for raising this issue, in which I take an interest.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming. I am delighted, knowing her concern for children, that she will be replying to my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their programme for Government published <Col N="272" /> in 1997 the partners in Government promised to establish an adoption contact register. I have before me a copy of the programme which states, under the heading &ldquo;Children&rdquo;, that establishing a voluntary contact register for adult adoptees to contact birth parents will be a key priority. Failure to do so almost four years later is shabby in the extreme. The Adoption Board, the Law Society's law reform committee, the Adopted Person's Association and many other organisations and individuals have repeatedly asked that what can only be described as a human right be established.</P>
    <P>Contact registers have been established in many other countries, including most member states of the European Union. In Opposition, the Tanáiste suggested that such a register should be established urgently, yet the position remains the same almost four years later.</P>
    <P>There is no question of anyone being sought who does not wish to be found. We are only too well aware of the stigma attached to single motherhood and, despite improved attitudes, the report on abortion produced by Evelyn Mahon and her colleagues at Trinity College Dublin shows that fear of social condemnation is an important factor in young women seeking abortion in England.</P>
    <P>A contact register is one on which mothers or fathers who gave up children for adoption could put their names. Adoptees over the age of 18 years could also register. Such a register would be entirely in line with our adoption legislation. I take this opportunity to ask that our adoption legislation &ndash; there are six different Acts &ndash; be consolidated as requested by the Adoption Board and many other agencies.</P>
    <P>We will still encounter problems even after such a register is established because some women were forced or encouraged to give false names or to deny their identities. This presents a great problem for those independently seeking the identity of their birth mothers from their birth certificates. Those whose children were sent to America and England in the 1950s and 1960s have the additional problem of distance. Many children adopted in those countries are of the view that they have been denied their Irish identity &ndash; they are, after all, similar in appearance to those around them, but their ethnicity has been ignored. We have done nothing to rectify this.</P>
    <P>A register was established by a voluntary group, the Adopted Persons Association, in the early 1990s. I had the honour last year of launching its website &ndash; www.adoptionIreland.com. There are 1,700 names on the register. This indicates the great demand for such a register. It is, however, impossible for a voluntary organisation to satisfactorily manage such a difficult and sensitive procedure. Three sets of people have recently been reunited through the website while ten others have been in contact by telephone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> This is a suitable night, St. Valentine's, on which to raise this topic. I have tabled this motion as close as possible to the date on which I last tabled it, 18 February 1997, on which date we debated the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996. I welcomed the then Minister's statement that a contact register was about to be established. I have been frequently informed that this is a matter of priority. I would hate to think what is a matter of secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>In four years some older women have died without ever having the joy of seeing the child they gave up, almost certainly with great reluctance. Their children will never be in a position to find out more about their background. The situation is so sad that that Government's delay can only be described as despicable and not understandable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. As I am sure she is aware, 42,000 people have been adopted since 1952, the year our adoption legislation was introduced.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, adoption was carried out in an atmosphere of secrecy. However, attitudes to adoption have changed radically in recent years. The number of babies given up for adoption has decreased enormously as single mothers make the choice to bring up their children themselves. In related developments, there is a huge difference in how adoptions are carried out. Birth mothers can be directly involved with social workers in selecting the adoptive family. It is now common for information to be given to the birth mother on an ongoing basis until the child reaches adulthood and in a small, but growing, number of cases birth mothers retain contact with the child in its adoptive family. This trend towards more open adoption is also being seen in other countries.</P>
      <P>Access to birth information is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952, although tracing and reunion services are provided on a non-statutory basis by the Adoption Board, health boards, registered adoption agencies and some voluntary groups. There has been a significant growth in demand for these services. For some years people affected by adoption have been pressing for changes in legislation to allow them access to birth and adoption information. We realised when examining this issue that there was a number of interested groups with different perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to refute the Senator's comment that the delay is shabby. The delay is due to the fact that there are so many sensitivities and groups involved that we undertook an extensive consultation process last year which included discussions, which I attended, with adopted persons, birth parents, adoptive parents and those working in the area of adoption, including lawyers and the Adoption Board. It was informative and helpful <Col N="274" /> and the outcome will be reflected in the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The discussions which took place in the course of the consultation process made it clear that the introduction of a contact register would not, on its own, be an adequate response to the needs expressed and that it would have to be accompanied by the introduction of other measures. Those affected by adoption strongly expressed the view that the State should assist them in obtaining information on themselves and, through the process of tracing, in seeking reunion with birth families.</P>
    <P>Following the consultation process it was necessary to seek legal advice on some of the more difficult issues. However, I am pleased to say that this process is now complete and I will bring a draft scheme of a Bill to Government within the next few weeks. The Bill is called the Adoption Information (Post Adoption Contact and Associated Issues) Bill. The legislation will go beyond the provision of a contact register. In fact it deals with all the issues raised by those affected. Apart from dealing with access to information, the Bill will provide for the regulation and monitoring of tracing and reunion services provided in the area of adoption. It will also deal with the important issues of access to records and the care and management of records held by the various agencies. The main group of people originally being considered were those separated through adoption. However, there is also a large group of people who were not legally adopted but were separated from their birth parents and informally adopted boarded out or raised in institutions. The legislation will also provide for such people to have a right to information held about them and will provide structures to support and assist them in tracing their birth families.</P>
    <P>While it would not be appropriate to go into detail about the contents of the legislation in advance of the proposals being discussed by Government, a contact register is provided for which will allow anyone affected by adoption or being raised in care to register as being willing to be contacted. In order to ensure the system is properly regulated and appropriate support is provided the Adoption Board will take on broad new responsibilities, including holding and managing the contact register.</P>
    <P>As most will be aware from recent media coverage, we are working to further improve our procedures regarding inter-country adoption. There will be consequent changes to the Adoption Board in this context also. It is intended that the board will become a central authority with regulatory and monitoring responsibilities and provide guidance for all the agencies and bodies involved in adoption, both domestic and inter-country.</P>
    <P>These changes will be introduced in the context of the second major piece of legislation which is being worked on in my Department. This legis<Col N="275" /> lation will enable Ireland to ratify the Hague convention on the protection of children and co-operation and inter-country adoption. The changing trends in adoption have included a huge increase in the adoption of children from abroad and the objective of the Hague convention is to ensure that at all times in the process the paramount interest is that of the child. The Hague Convention Bill will include changes to the Adoption Board which arise from the adoption information Bill and those arising from the convention itself. I expect to bring this legislation to Government, possibly in the next month.</P>
    <P>The legislation will provide a balanced response to the varying needs in this important area of social policy. The delay was due largely to ensuring the needs, wishes and sensitivities of all those involved in adoption are understood, taken on board and included in the legislation. <Col N="276" /> The legislation will bring together the best international practice with the experience gained in Ireland. As I said, I will shortly be bringing this to Government. It is ready, the memo is prepared and I look forward to its enactment.</P>
