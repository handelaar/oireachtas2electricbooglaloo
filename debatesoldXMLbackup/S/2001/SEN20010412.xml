      <P>I received notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide additional funding to the Mid-Western Health Board for the establishment of a general practitioners' co-operative in the north Tipperary area, which cannot be initiated until further funding is allocated.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations, 2001, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 2001 &ndash; all Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. With the Cathaoirleach's permission, I pay tribute to the late Godfrey Timmins who was a Member of the Dáil, with one short break, from 1968 to 1997. The family tradition is carried on by his son, Billy, who is a Deputy for Wicklow. Everyone was saddened by last night's news that he collapsed and died.</P>
      <P>The first words that sprang to everyone's lips were that Godfrey was a gentleman. If ever that word had a meaning, it was embodied in him. He was courteous, quiet spoken, good humoured and considerate. He was close to his Wicklow people and served them in the real sense of that word, reflecting their views on the issues of the day in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also a man who had great judgment. Every Fine Gael leader, from 1968 on, always listened to Godfrey's advice and sought it on important occasions. He did not make long <Col N="482" /> speeches but gave advice briefly and to the point. Many young politicians, new to the Dáil, might have paid little attention to him initially but, as they got to know him, they realised how good his judgment was and how decent he was. He always gave them good advice. He had many wonderful qualities. Those of us who knew him or served with him in the other House and on committees know how strong and good these qualities were. On behalf of Fine Gael, I extend sympathy to his wife and family, especially his son, Billy, who follows in his footsteps in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, will the Leader tell us what are the proposals for the constitutional debates which we must have before the referenda can be held? I raised a question yesterday about the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme, which I withdrew at the Cathaoirleach's proper request. Since then, the issue was raised in the other House. It was riveting television, but it is not possible to cover a complex issue in a one hour documentary.</P>
    <P>We are at a stage in the life of the State where the arms trial can be viewed as an important historic event, not as an item on the current agenda to be used to score points in political debate. We should only seek the truth. It would be in the public interest if the Government established a committee of two or three independent historians with access to all the documents to get the truth about what happened. Will the Leader raise this with the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the first item, the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations, 2001, concern the U2 concert in Slane? Is that why the regulations are being changed? It is a matter of public interest whether it should be debated. I seek clarification because I am not entirely sure that is the issue.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I requested the Leader of the House to ask the appropriate Minister, probably the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to outline the Government's view of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme concerning the arms trial. I agree with the request made by Senator Manning and share the view that this is not a matter for political debate. There is a significant issue in terms of trust and confidence in the Executive, legislation and decision making in the State. The Government should take appropriate action. I would like to hear its view before there is a row about the matter. I do not see why there should be division on the issue.</P>
      <P>Constitutionally, we are required to pass legislation at least 30 days prior to referenda being held. The Government is thinking about holding referenda on 31 May which seems to leave an impossibly tight schedule in terms of current arrangements. When will the debate on the legislation take place in the House? In particular, I want to know when it will be concluded in order that we can have some idea when the referenda will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business. I seek clarification in relation to the planning and development regulations which license outdoor events. Are the proposals related to holding a second U2 concert in Slane and what are the implications of the regulations for planning and development?</P>
      <P>I also express condolences to the family of the late Godfrey Timmins on my own behalf and that of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>During the Easter recess the Leader of the House will be planning debates for the new session. I ask him to consider two matters in particular, the first of which is the extent to which inflation and increased construction costs are affecting proposals in the national development plan. This morning I received news of a major cutback in a local scheme in my local area due to inflation and increased construction costs. I must conclude that this is happening throughout the country. We should receive an update on the matter from the relevant Department as it will effect every community. Second, I ask the Leader of the House to arrange an early debate on poverty. The ESRI has reported that we are making progress in eliminating poverty, but we still have some distance to go. As Members of the Seanad, we could have a very useful and constructive debate on the matter, particularly considering our local knowledge and the impact of Government schemes on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Godfrey Timmins whom I knew reasonably well. He definitely was a very effective and able advocate for the people he represented so well over such a long period. He was educated in Naas, County Kildare. There has always been an association between east Kildare and west Wicklow because of the mountains. One of his significant achievements was that he held a seat in a difficult area for Fine Gael. I think it was the only Fine Gael seat west of the hills in Wicklow for a long time. As Senator Manning said, he was a very modest, unassuming and humorous gentleman. In many respects, he was underestimated. I extend our sympathy to his wife, Nora, his son, Billy, and other members of his family.</P>
      <P>Regarding the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and the circumstances surrounding the arms trial, I agree with Senator O'Toole that this is not a matter for political debate. There may be some merit in adopting the approach suggested by Senator Manning, namely, allowing professional historians examine the material. This is, however, a matter we can discuss on another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Godfrey Timmins. It is very difficult to pay tribute to him in this House as he would hate to hear us paying eulogies to him. I remember very well, as his running mate for Wicklow, that the one thing he could not be persuaded to do was to take prominent positions or <Col N="484" /> push himself forward. He loathed the idea of celebrations honouring his 25 years here or 50 years there and would do anything to wriggle out of such occasions. He was a rare breed in Irish politics in that he was not involved or interested in self-promotion. In addition, he was rare in that he did not rush to judgment. I remember when a Member of the Oireachtas got into a spot of bother, as we all do on various occasions, and was being hounded by the press asking Godfrey what he thought. He responded by saying, &ldquo;He was always very nice to me, and I do not make judgments on people other than on how they treat me&rdquo;. Godfrey Timmins always treated everybody as a gentleman would, with courtesy and respect for their point of view. He was not a quota squatter, which is so rare in the Houses. He was extraordinary in that way. He was almost unique in that he wanted to bring a running mate in with him for a second Fine Gael seat in the same constituency, which he genuinely tried to do. He would ring one saying that they should go to this, that and the other event in the constituency and that he would not attend. He was a most rare, decent and honourable man. I will miss him and those who knew him will miss him as he was a human being rather than a politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the late Godfrey Timmins. I knew him longer and better than anybody else in the House. I was at the convention which selected him in Rathdrum in 1968 and knew him both as a member of Fine Gael and Member of the other House. He was first elected to Wicklow County Council in 1950 and gave 49 distinguished years of service. I extend my sympathy to his wife, Nora, and his son, Billy, our colleague. He was a loyal supporter of the party and great supporter of my father. Other than politics and his family, his other two great loves were Gaelic games and racing. It is appropriate that he passed away last evening in Dunlavin at a Gaelic match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on planning, particularly An Bord Pleanála. Senators Lanigan and Ormonde and I have called for such a debate previously. I see another example of where a local authority made a decision, which was agreed to by the chief planning officer of An Bord Pleanála, following which An Bord Pleanála made a directly opposite decision. It is time An Bord Pleanála was taken from behind the high walls to a place of openness and transparency. Planning applications should be heard before a court where people can see what is happening. Planners on local authorities are qualified, some with masters degrees, yet the board throws their views out the door. There is something radically wrong with the system and it needs to be overhauled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the warm words of tribute from Senators Manning, Dardis, Ross and Cosgrave to the late Godfrey Timmins. There is no doubt but that Godfrey <Col N="485" /> deserved them all. I extend my sympathies to his wife and son, Billy, our colleague in the other House.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's suggestion about the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the arms trial. The banks and Revenue Commissioners should not penalise the many companies and small businesses which are suffering as a result of foot and mouth disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator please bear with me? It would have been much more appropriate to make these suggestions in the debate held yesterday on the foot and mouth issue which ended prematurely because of a lack of speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I missed that debate. It is the last day of term and I do not wish to impose on the Chair, but it would take a Government directive or guideline to convert tax liabilities to low interest rate loans over a reasonable period. The Government might also be able to arrange a rates relief scheme in conjunction with local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that we have reached the last day of term without any definitive word from the Government in regard to the reopening of many of the top tourist attractions throughout the country, not least in my constituency of Kerry South, in particular, Muckross House. I am aware that the Leader of the House is as concerned as I am about our herd of native red deer&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have been a bold boy, Coghlan. Thanks to a certain man, a ballad was composed which included the famous words &ldquo;arise and follow&rdquo; and we have managed to preserve and protect the gene pool of our native red deer species. Senator Fitzgerald is smiling because he had a good hand in it. If anything was to go wrong on the mainland in Killarney, there is a herd on the island and also red deer in Letterfrack and Doneraile. I mention this for the benefit of the Leader of the House because of his admonishment outside the House yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Farrell, that there is an urgent need for a debate on happenings within An Bord Pleanála. There are huge discrepancies between decisions made by local authorities and those made by the board which is comprised of unqualified citizens. There is a need for a debate on the topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to consider <Col N="486" /> arranging a debate on the exorbitant cost of prescribed drugs which seems excessively high compared to that in the United Kingdom and across Europe. People are very concerned about this matter. The Government must be aware of the cost because of the huge quanitity of drugs dispensed under the medical card system. I call for an urgent debate on the matter and raise the question of whether deregulation of the entire industry is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the role of An Bord Pleanála, about which we have talked about many times. I am very uneasy. It is an agency in respect of which it seems there is no accountability. We could broaden the issue to include the NRA and investigate how An Bord Pleanála's role fits in with that of other agencies in relation to planning and rezoning. We should ask the Minister to come to the House in May to account for how the board operates. We are living in an era of transparency and accountability. Perhaps, the media could hold the people concerned as well as others to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made by my colleagues for a debate on An Bord Pleanála. It amazes me when I read the inspector's report how the final decision of the board is totally at odds with what the inspector recommended. As Senator Ormonde said, the debate should be broadened to include the NRA.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House to discuss conservation measures in the fishing industry, particularly in relation to North Atlantic wild salmon. I have noted that Ireland is the only European country not to have signed the North Atlantic Salmon Fund Conservation Charter. There are approximately 1,400 small salmon fishermen around the coast. Stocks are diminishing as a result of which their livelihoods are being dramatically affected. In the House recently the Minister dealt with the National Salmon Commission and the tagging system and ruled out any compensation measures for the setting aside or surrendering of licences. This is happening in all other European countries and of major importance to our salmon fishermen. While conservation measures are essential, we must also ensure the men concerned who have worked hard all their lives are not left without any financial return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Meara, Dardis, Ross, Cosgrave and Coghlan all paid tribute to the late Godfrey Timmins. As Leader of the House and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to be associated with those tributes. Godfrey was a decent, honourable man. I had the honour of being vice-chairman of the Services Committee when he was chairman. Much of the work done to improve facilities in the House was due to his stewardship. We visited the House of Commons and discussed how to achieve the <Col N="487" /> improvements made during his term of office. I visited him at his home in Baltinglass in the course of every Seanad election and enjoyed a very good personal friendship with him. Party affiliations did not matter to him, he was a friend to all. In his time he was Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party and served as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. He also served as a member of Wicklow County Council for almost 50 years. He was the sort of person that if he could not do one a good turn, he would not do one a bad turn. He was not in the business of giving offence. I extend my sympathies and those of the House to his wife, Nora, and son, Billy. It gave him great personal satisfaction to see Billy elected to Dáil Éireann. It was an endorsement of his great work and a lifetime devoted to public service to see his son following in his footsteps in the last general election. He took great pride in his association with his local GAA football team in Baltinglass, of which he was president, prior to his death yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and O'Toole made inquiries about the referendum Bills which are due to come before the House shortly. The House will return on Tuesday, 1 May. With the agreement of the Whips and leaders, it is proposed to take all Stages of the four referendum Bills from 1 to 4 May, inclusive. Thirty days must elapse before a referendum may be held. As these Bills do not require a motion for earlier signature, the earliest date on which the referenda could be held would be the second week in June. The Houses will return on 1 May and all the Bills will be before the House by the Friday of that week.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Dardis expressed their opinions on the RTÉ television programme dealing with events in 1970 and 1971. I watched the programme and it certainly gave an insight into those events which had not been presented before. The Senators' suggestion is a worthwhile one and I will pass it on to the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and O'Meara referred to No. 1 on the Order Paper. This item covers events, including the Slane event. Senator O'Meara called for a debate on the economy, particularly the effect of inflation on the national development plan. I will arrange for this debate. Inflation is beginning to affect the plan. I hope to arrange an all-day debate on the economy, banking and everything connected with the national development plan soon after the Easter recess. Senator O'Meara also called for a debate on poverty. I will arrange for a debate on the subject.</P>
      <P>Senators Farrell, Dan Kiely, Ormonde and Bonner called for another debate on An Bord Pleanála. We debated the matter two weeks ago, but I will endeavour to arrange to do so again before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass on to the Minister for Finance the views of Senator Coghlan on the effect of the foot and mouth emergency on small businesses. Some <Col N="488" /> family businesses in the tourism industry have been maintained for many years with very low profit margins. The Minister should make an arrangement to ensure these businesses continue. No support is available for them. An understanding must be agreed to support them in this difficult time.</P>
    <P>An improvement in the tourism business has been noticeable in the past week. Bookings for the summer have returned to 75% of what they were. If we can keep the foot and mouth plague out of Ireland, we will be in a very advantageous position in two months' time. I call on all Irish people to stay at home and enjoy their holidays in Ireland this year and support the small family tourism businesses which have been the backbone of communities and parishes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on the high cost of drugs. I will have time allowed for that. Senator Bonner called on the Minister for the Marine to implement conservation measures to protect salmon fishermen. I will allow for this.</P>
    <P>I wish you, a Cathaoirligh, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk and Deputy Clerk, the leaders of all the groups, party whips, the press, the ushers, the Garda Síochána and everyone associated with the work of the House a very happy and holy Easter. I look forward to being back again on Tuesday, 1 May.</P>

Nuair a fhaigheann duine atá ina chónaí taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht deontas ón Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil ní leagtar síos coinníoll ar bith fá dtaobh de na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa teach. Tá an t-alt seo ró-oscailte agus tabharfaidh mé sampla a léiríonn a bhfuil á rá agam.</P>
      <P>Bhí teaghlach ina gcónaí ar Árainn Mhór, fear agus bean chéile gan páistí ar bith acu. Bhí deacrachtaí ag deirfiúr acu a bhí ina cónaí sa Bhreatain agus de bharr go raibh na seirbhísí sóisialta ansin chun a páistí a thógaint chun siúil, shocraigh an teaghlach ar Árann Mhór na páistí a thabhairt ansin agus a thógáil leo féin. Nia agus neacht acu ab ea na páistí. Ní raibh Gaeilge ar bith ag na páistí mar gur tógadh iad go dtí sin sa Bhreatain. Dá bhfágfaí na páistí sa Bhreatain bheadh an deontas iomlán le fáil ag an lánúin ar Árainn Mhór ach de bharr an bheart charthanach a rinne siad, chaill siad an deontas. Thug oifig áitiuil na Roinne ar na Doire Beaga seans dóibh deontas labhartha a fháil ach bhí deacrachtaí ag na páistí seo a tógadh sa Bhreatain an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</P>

      <P>Bhí díospóireacht sa Dáil mar gheall ar an míniú a bheadh ar theaghlach. An bhunaidhm atá leis an Acht Tithíochta ná go mbeadh Gaeilge ag daoine a fhaigheann deontas. Tá a fhios agam an deacracht atá luaite ag an Seanadóir mar gheall ar bheirt pháiste a bhí thar lear agus atá ar ais anois ar Árainn Mhór agus in <Col N="490" /> atmasféar Gaeilge, cé nach bhfuill na deontais á fháil acu sa scoil ag an am seo. Ach is é an phríomhaidhm ná go mbeadh iarracht á déanamh ag daoine an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. B'fhéidir i gcás mar sin má dhéanann na páistí Gaeilge a labhairt sa scoil agus ar an oileán go mbeidh an Roinn níos solúbtha mar gheall ar theaghlaigh speisialta. Ach níl daoine atá lonnaithe go sealadach i dtithe san áireamh anseo &ndash; lóistín nó daoine ar cuairt &ndash; daoine atá ina gcónaí go fadtéarmach amháin atá i gceist anseo.</P>
      <P>Maidir le fostering, ní bhíonn sé sin fadtéarmach de ghnáth, ach tá eisceachtaí ann. Má athraímse an riail mar gheall ar an nGaeilge beidh sé deacair orm deontais a thabhairt do theaghlaigh áirithe ach i gcásanna speisialta mar a dhéantar iarracht agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á foghlaim ar scoil, rachaidh mé i gcomhairle leis na cigirí féachaint an féidir aon rud a dhéanamh. Aontaím go bhfuil sé deacair go leor foster parents a fháil agus ní theastaíonn uaim aon bhrú eile a chur ar theaghlaigh mar sin ach caithfear cloí le riail na Gaeilge agus amharcfaidh mé air arís.</P>
      <P>Tá an Roinn solúbtha agus má bhíonn iarracht á déanamh ag na daoine seo &ndash; tá siad amuigh ar oileán agus beidh an Ghaeilge thart orthu &ndash; agus más í an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga an tí b'fhéidir go mbeifear in ann rud éigin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>An rud atá ag cur isteach ormsa anseo ná go bhfuil páistí ag caitheamh trí bliana déag ag dul ar scoil agus ar fhágáil na scoile dóibh níl Gaeilge ar bith acu. Cén seans atá ag páistí sé nó seacht mbliana d'aois ón Bhreatain Gaeilge mheasartha a fhoghlaim laistigh de shé mhí? Má chuireann an teaghlach isteach iarratas agus tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil sé ceadaithe fós ach go bhfuil aithbhreithniú le déanamh beidh sé deacair orthu Gaeilge a fhoghlaim chun an choinníoll sin a shásamh? </P>
      <P>Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit gur ceantair bheaga atá sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus go bhfuil aithne ag gach duine ar gach duine eile sa cheantar. An ceart go mbeadh córas éigin ann le go bhféadfadh cigire nach ón áit sin dó nó di aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gceist? Dúirt an tAire Stáit Ó Cuív liom go minic nuair a thóg mé an cheist seo nach bhféadfadh sé rud ar bith a dhéanamh mar go raibh gach rud scríofa síos sa chomhad ach ba cheart go mbeadh duine éigin in ann aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ionas nach mbeadh rudaí pearsanta ag cur isteach air, cé nach deirim go bhfuil sé sin amhlaidh.</P>

      <P>Luaigh na Teachtaí Dála an rud céanna ar an ábhar seo. Tá sár-obair déanta ag cigirí na Roinne cé go bhfuil brú orthu de bharr líon na scéimeanna agus líon na n-iarratas a thagann go dtí an Roinn. Níl sé féaráilte ar na cigirí a bheith ag dul ar ais arís agus arís eile go dtí an teach céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá struchtúr ann faoinar féidir le cigirí fanacht ar feadh trí mhí, sé mhí nó bliain ar iarratas amháin ar dheontas. Ach táim ag smaoineamh <Col N="491" /> anois go ndéanfar an aithbhreithniú áit éigin eile, nuair is gá sin, ionas nach mbeadh aon bhaint ag cigirí sa cheantar leis. Níl a fhios agam an féidir é sin a dhéanamh ach déanfaidh mé iarracht, cé go gciallódh sé go mbeadh níos mó cigirí ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>Tá mo Roinn ag déanamh iarracht gach seans a thabhairt do achan duine cé go bhfuil brú oibre orthu. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in am socrú éigin a dhéanamh, ní go reachtúil, ach sa Roinn féin, le gur féidir scéim a thabhairt isteach nó duine a cheapadh d'achomharc. Tuigim nach gceapann daoine go bhfuil an scéim féaráilte i gcónaí ach de ghnáth tá an Roinn agus na cigirí solúbtha agus murab ionann agus an Roinn Comhshaoil tá an Ghaeilge mar choinníoll againn dár ndeontais. Tá na scéimeanna ann chun cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu mar ghnáth-theanga.</P>

      <P>I have a query, which I hope is relevant. This section proposes to amend the principal Act determining the current position on Gaeltacht areas. There is power under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1956, to determine their boundaries. It is said that the use of the Irish language has declined in certain areas, but it has also increased in others. Has there been a regular review of these areas since the enactment in 1956? It is important to monitor them because, in the Connemara Gaeltacht, I am told that the use of the language is growing, and it is also used widely outside Gaeltacht areas. To what extent are areas outside the boundaries of Gaeltachtaí expressing an interest in being brought within them? Will the Minister give a brief reply on that?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú a fháil ar an alt seo maidir leis an difríocht idir an Ghaeltacht agus an bhreacGhaeltacht. Roimh an Bhille seo, an raibh daoine sa bhreacGhaeltacht in ann deontais a fháil do thithe agus do labhairt na teangan? Tá deontais na dtithe le gearradh amach sa bhreacGhaeltacht agus tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith i gcuid den  bhreacGhaeltacht agus go mbeidh deacrachtaí ag na daoine ann leis an gcuid seo den Bhille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Gaeilge níos fearr anois ag cuid mhaith daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ná ag muintir <Col N="492" /> na Gaeltachta féin. Rinneadh athrú ar scéim dheontas na teanga i 1999 agus páiste ar bith a bhí ag dul roimhe sin ar scoil Ghaeltachta, cé go raibh cónaí air taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, bhí sé in ann an deontas a fháil. Agus clann ar bith a raibh duine acu ag dul ar an scoil sin, bhí an clann in ann an deontas a fháil fosta.</P>
    <P>Tá deacracht faoi leith ag an príomhoide sa scoil i Mín Teineadh Dé. Cé go n-aithnítear mar scoil Ghaeltachta é, níl an talamh ar a bhfuil an scoil tógtha sa Ghaeltacht. Tá a fhios agam go raibh clanna i dteagmháil leis an Aire Stáit mar a bhfuil an chuid is mó dá gcuid talún sa Ghaeltacht agus nach bhfuil an píosa ar a bhfuil an teach tógtha sa Ghaeltacht. Bhí siad ag dul ar scoil Ghaeltachta freisin. Ba cheart relaxation a dhéanamh ar na rialacha i gcásanna mar sin.</P>

      <P>An phríomhaidhm atá ag an mBille seo ná neartú na Gaeltachta ach i gcomhthéacs na Gaeilge. Muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge chun tosaigh níltear ag cabhrú leis an nGaeltacht. Bíonn an-díospóireacht ann ó am go chéile faoi cé chomh dáiríre is atáimid faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Caithfimid a bheith cúramach faoi seo. Nílim ag cur i gcoinne moltaí an tSeanadóra anseo agus caithfimid a bheith cúramach nach bhfuil aon dallamullóg i gceist. Beidh daoine i gcónaí ag faire ar aon pholasaí eisceachtúil atá ann don Ghaeilge agus is cinnte nach mbeadh siad sásta muna raibh an Ghaeilge mar chroílár an pholasaí sin.</P>
      <P>Luadh an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ó thaobh na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht an lá faoi dheiridh. Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans ag an Aire Stáit é sin a phlé linn lá eile &ndash; tá a fhios agam nach mbaineann sé leis an mBille seo. An dóchas is mó atá ann don Ghaeilge i láthair na huaire &ndash; agus nílim ag déanamh aon neamairt den Ghaeltacht agus tuigim an stádas atá aici &ndash; ná an dea-thoil atá ann don Ghaeilge, na gaelscoileanna agus na teaghlaigh nua le Gaeilge atá á mbunú i láthair na huaire. Má bhíonn an bunchloch seo ceart, beimid in ann athchuairt a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo féachaint cad is féidir a dhéanamh chun cur leis an bhforbairt seo.</P>
      <P>Caithfimid a bheith cúramach nach ndéanaimid aon laghdú ar an nGaeilge le rud ar bith atá i gceist againn don Ghaeltacht. Ní chabhródh sé sin leis an nGaeltacht.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir gur féidir liom freagra dátheangach a thabhairt ar seo. The Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, explained the limits of the Gaeltacht areas. To answer Senator Bonner's question there are breacGhaeltachtaí who are entitled to obtain a housing grant only under the Act. We are now consolidating limistéir na Gaeltachta for all deontais. The 1956 limistéir na Gaeltachta included for the purposes of a housing grant the 1929 breacGhaeltachtaí. We are now putting it all together under the 1956 limistéir na Gaeltachta. That is being looked at by Coimisiún na Gaeilge which hopes to address some of the problems where parishes are split, similar to the <Col N="493" /> school in Mín Teineadh Dé. I hope people from that area have written to the commission to have that looked at because that leads to difficult situations in parishes where often tá an Ghaeilge lag sa Ghaeltacht agus níos fearr taobh amuigh, sa pharóiste céanna.  That is the reason I would like to see a complete consolidation of the Gaeltacht limits and, I hope, through Coimisiún na Gaelige we will be able to address some of the problems that arise which people regard as unfair.</P>
      <P>There were &ndash; I had not been aware of it &ndash; many areas outside the Gaeltacht areas, even in our own county, where people who had the language were entitled to apply for the Gaeltacht housing grant in areas such as Killybegs and in my own parish and places such as Lough Eske, Townawilly and so on, but there were few applications to the Department. There were 13 applications nationally last year, the cost of which was £16,000. We are trying to consolidate the 1956 limistéir na Gaeltachta agus nuair atá seans againn agus go mbeidh an Coimisiún a rá linn gur féidir níos mó áiteanna a chur isteach sa Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh achan duine sásta faoi limistéir na Gaeltachta i dtús báire agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh tuarascáil an Choimisiúin againn roimh dheireadh na bliana.</P>
      <P>It is some considerable time since limistéir na Gaeltachta have been considered. At the end of the year we hope to have proposals to look at the Gaeltacht limits to take into consideration that often one hears, rightly or wrongly, that in small enclaves of Dublin and other areas the language has become very strong and people wish to be considered in the context of Gaeltacht Bills with a view to access to the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is probably the most important in the sense that it sets out clear definitions as to how the Bill will operate. There is a number of issues I would like to raise which are probably more relevant to Second Stage. Part of the section relates to thatched roofs. We all need to do what we can to restore thatched roofs to the landscape, especially in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Gaeltacht landscapes are, by and large, the most sensitive, spectacular and beautiful landscapes in the country. That is certainly true of those in counties Mayo, Galway and Donegal as well as of the Ring Gaeltacht and the Gaeltachts in Cork and Kerry. The only pastoral landscape in the Gaeltacht is probably that at Rathcairn in County Meath and I do not mean to take anything from it by describing it as pastoral while describing the others as highly sensitive or spectacular.</P>
    <P>One difficulty which is not mentioned in the Bill, probably because it relates to planning law, is the proliferation of houses in certain Gaeltacht landscapes. The Minister's area of Donegal is probably one of the most beautiful parts of the world. However, in areas of Gweedore there is a huge density of housing, much of it highly inappropriate from a design and architectural point of view. It certainly is not what is nowadays referred to as vernacular architecture. The houses are of inappropriate colour and design. One often sees Californian style hacienda houses and so forth. These were built years ago when planning regulations were less stringent and when we were less aware of the need to blend a structure with the landscape, especially in a sensitive landscape. The thatched roof and whitewashed walls were very much part of that landscape.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in this Bill we cannot address the issue of laying down guidelines on the design and density of houses in these sensitive areas. We must do everything we can to encourage people to move to and live in these areas and we are doing that. The Gaeltacht area around Gweedore must be the most densely populated area one could find that would still be regarded as rural. If one looks over the area from a nearby high point, one can see that it is dotted with houses. The houses contain families who speak the Irish language which is a good thing. However, it is unfortunate that much of what one sees is inappropriate to the landscape in which it is located in terms of architecture and density.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment on the fact that these issues are not mentioned in the Bill. There is a reference to thatched houses and to the fact that they will be subject to grant assistance. Grant assistance is available throughout the country for building or restoring a thatched house. I understand the grant is £4,000. The figure is not mentioned in the Bill and will probably be determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the price of housing in the Gaeltacht, like the rest of the country, has increased enormously in recent years. The cost of providing an ordinary dwelling house has more than doubled in the last six years in labour and material costs but the grant does not take account of that huge increase. Perhaps the Minister will discuss that matter as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, is é seo an t-aon chuid den Bhille a dhéanfaidh maitheas dóibh. Ach níl ach leath an réitigh anseo. <Col N="495" /> Bhí mé féin agus an tAire Stáit le chéile ag cruinnithe mar a chualamar daoine ag gearán go raibh siad ag obair i mBaile Átha Cliath nó i nGaillimh agus nuair a tháinig siad ar ais ag an deireadh seachtaine gur mhaith leo teach cónaithe a bheith acu ina gceantar féin. Déanfaidh an fhoráil seo maitheas do dhaoine aonair mar is iad féin a rachaidh os comhair an chigire. Corruair bíonn Gaeilge mhaith ag beirt atá pósta ach do chuid mhaith daoine a bhí ar imirce tá siad pósta le daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Daoine a dhéanfaidh sé maitheas dóibh ná daoine atá ag éirí as an obair agus ag teacht ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht in Árainnmhór agus áiteanna mar sin. Tá a gclann tógtha agus níl ann ach iad féin.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam go gcaithfidh an fhoráil seo a bheith ceangailte leis an nGaeilge ach tá deacrachtaí fós ann. Ach tá mé buíoch den Aire Stáit as an rud seo a thabhairt isteach.</P>
      <P>Deacracht eile a fheicim ná nach mbeidh an deontas le fáil ag daoine go dtí go mbíonn siad ina gcónaí sa teach. Cuid mhaith de na daoine seo, tá siad ó shiúil, tagann siad abhaile do na laethanta saoire agus cuireann siad duine ag obair ag tógáil tí dóibh. Cén uair a bheidh siad sa bhaile, dar leis an Roinn? An rud atá i gceist agam ná go m'fhéidir nach mbeidh na daoine seo sa bhaile an lá a thagann an cigire amach agus bheadh an teach tosnaithe faoin am seo. Caithfidh solúbthacht mhillteanach a bheith ann dá bharr mar ní bhíonn na daoine seo sa bhaile cosúil le daoine eile a bheadh ag cur isteach ar an ndeontas. Chím deacracht phraiticiúil anseo agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh siad in ann an teach a thosú fiú munar bhuail an cigire leo. B'fhéidir nach mbuailfeadh an cigire leo go dtí an chéad uair eile a mbeadh siad sa bhaile.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil as ucht an tacaíocht atá ann don chuid seo den Bhille. Ní mór dúinn a bheith cúramach anseo. Nílim ag caint faoi theach saoire do dhuine a chaitheann a laethanta saoire sa Ghaeltacht. Táimid ag caint faoi dhaoine atá ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht chun cónaí ann. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ag obair ón nGaeltacht sna cathracha mar shampla ach má tá an chlann ina ngnáthchónaí sa teach, beidh siad ábalta an deontas a fháil.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an deacracht eile, aontaím gur deacracht phraiticiúil é. Tá daoine ag filleadh ar an nGaeltacht atá pósta le daoine atá gan Ghaeilge. Tá scéimeanna againn sa Roinn a chuidíonn le daoine, go mór mór leis na páistí &ndash; an scéim cúnta teanga i scoileanna éagsúla mar shampla. Táthar ag caint freisin ar scéim chúnta teanga a chur ar fáil do dhaoine fásta, fosta, agus tá súil agam go gcuideoidh sé sin le hiarrthóirí atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Ghaeilge an rud is tábhachtaí anseo mar tá daoine ábalta deontais do thithe úr a fháil ón Roinn Comshaoil. Má bhíonn siad ábalta Gaeilge a fhoghlaim tig leo deontas breise a fháil ó mo Roinn, de thart ar £800. Ní haon mhíbhuntáiste é <Col N="496" /> dóibh a bheith sa Ghaeltacht gan Ghaeilge mar tá siad ábalta an deontas eile a fháil. Ach i gcás deontais fheabhsúcháin agus mar sin de tá buntáiste ag na daoine sin a bhfuil Gaeilge acu mar níl na scéimeanna sin le fáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh daoine ag filleadh ar ais chun gnáthchónaí a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht. The grant for thatched houses has been increased in Gaeltacht areas from £2,300 to £2,796 up to £5,500.</P>
    <P>The other matters referred to on Second Stage related to planning. If I had the chance to deal with planning in the Gaeltacht, I would be very happy, but the Roinn has consulted every county council regarding development plans and has had an input into the planning Acts. When one comes from a place like County Donegal, one can appreciate this. In places like Tory Island one is taken aback by the colour of the houses, but that is the tradition of the people and it would be wrong of me or anyone else to say that we think the particular shade of purple being used is a horrible colour. That is the nature of the people and what makes them unique. This tradition has been accepted in many planning offices.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, if one represents a constituency like mine and that of Senator Bonner, when people are characterised and designated in areas in which they have lived all their lives and where they would like to live. Those coming home from America and England also want to live in such areas and find it more than difficult to get planning permission. We have tried to support them by targeting the planning laws and development plans towards them. Those coming on a day trip or for a couple of weeks' holiday might think that it is a desecration to build a house in a certain area, but we must be balanced in supporting those who live in these areas and encouraging people to return to Gaeltacht areas while at the same time being cognisant of their beauty given that most are on the west coast. It is difficult to achieve that balance, which is a matter for county councils and local councillors. When it comes to the idiosyncrasies of island people and those who have lived all their lives on the west coast, we must view them as being unique and support them. That is the reason the Gaeltachtaí are different and we should encourage people to visit them and support tourism.</P>
    <P>This is a planning matter on which I would not care to interfere with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or locally elected representatives on county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State who is doing everything she can to be helpful. While we have singled out thatched cottages and expanded the grant available, it is, however, a pity that we have been unable to give an additional incentive to those who use natural materials in building stone fronts or the external walls of their homes in nominated stone. It looks very appropriate to its background, though it is <Col N="497" /> three or four times more expensive to construct a stone wall compared to a concrete wall. The visual impact is, however, more pleasing than some of the more garish colours. Though I have never been there, I accept the point made about Tory Island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt it. I have been to most of the islands off the west coast and Scotland where the scenery in the Highlands is rather like the spectacular scenery along our west coast. One finds this new use of colour on the Orkney and Shetland Islands also, which seems to characterise the difference of island life. We might find it garish, but one accepts it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should look at giving another incentive for external finishes to those constructing their homes with native materials such as stone or timber in certain areas. I am also glad that there is to be consultation with local authorities on county development plans in order that what happened in the 1950s and 1960s and sometimes the 1970s and 1980s regarding the proliferation of houses and different designs of houses in the same landscape will not happen again. It can be very jarring to see houses that would be more appropriate to the centre of a city or town in the countryside among a mixture of houses with one, two or three storeys in a bewildering kaleidoscope of colours. There is also the density problem. One must balance this, however, against the fact that in all these houses live people who speak the language. If one views Gweedore from a height, it looks like a little city. One sees the density of houses and it is wonderful that they are all Irish-speaking houses. As we move forward, we should try to make what is constructed appropriate to the landscape.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú a fháil ar rud amháin. Nuair a chuir an Seanadoir Connor an cheist faoi deontas tí. Ta an dara deontas, deontas don dara teach, ag imeacht sa Bhille seo agus don deontas feabhsúcháin caithfidh tu bheith i do chónaí sa teach. Cad a tharla leis na tithe tréigthe, nó derelict houses? Má tá teach tréigthe agat an bhfuil deontas ar bith le fáil? Ní féidir leat bheith i do chónaí ann agus gan díon air.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to colour schemes. I am aware of a case in Gweedore where the paint on the outside of the house was not satisfactory to the inspector who held back the grant. Are there such conditions which mean people cannot decide on the colour of paint?</P>

      <P>We are, perhaps, moving away from the thrust of the Bill which deals with housing and taking on board concerns which relate to planning. The purpose of the Bill is to deal specifically with houses and housing grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is with what is termed good planning. As a young person, I am aware that young <Col N="498" /> people want to live in the Gaeltacht, but they also want to live a modern, cosmopolitan lifestyle. Everyone will not sit in a little teach up a boreen making butter and live in the Dark Ages. That is all right for tourists, but we are a very modern nation and there are many young people living and working in the Gaeltacht. I am sure all Senators want what I want: a young, vibrant economy in the Gaeltacht. We have advantages in that we do not have the traffic of Dublin and there is easier access to housing. We, therefore, need modernity in our idea of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor mentioned stone facing. There is a grant available under the deontas feabhsuchain. While stone facing is eligible for grant aid, it is very expensive. There is also the matter of what planning officers will accept. I am not sure what is acceptable in different areas, though, despite the expense, stone facing has become popular all over the country.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter raised by Senator Bonner, ta an deontas don dara teach ag imeacht anois agus sílim go bhfuil sé in am é sin a dhéanamh mar tá sé níos fearr go mbeidh teach ag gach duine ná go mbeadh dhá theach ag daoine áirithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe tréigthe, is féidir deontas feabhsacháin a fháil ach tá fadhbanna i gceantair éagsula. Tá a fhios ag an Seanadóir faoi seo. Cuir i gcás go raibh seanteach ag teaghlach agus go bhfuair siad SI ón chomhairle chontae. Ní féidir deontas feabhsúcháin a fháil don teach sin mar go raibh ar an teaghlach é a ghlanadh suas. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cúpla cás mar sin ann. Ní féidir deontas feabhsúcháin a fháil má fuarthas an teach ón chomhairle chontae. Is féidir deontas feabhsúcháin a fháil mar gheall ar thithe eile ach ní bhfaighfear an deontas ina iomlán go dtí go mbeidh an teaghlach ina gcónaí sa teach.</P>

      <P>Tamall ó shin nuair a bhíomar ag caint mar gheall ar na tithe agus na dathanna a bhíonn orthu, rinne an tAire ráiteas an-tábhachtach. Dúirt sí go raibh féiniúlacht faoi leith ag baint leis an nGaeltacht. Ní hí an Ghaeilge amháin atá mar chroí na féiniúlachta sin. Baineann sé leis an timpeallacht agus le traidisiún atá an-fhairsing. Baineann sé le dearcadh na ndaoine chomh maith, cé nach bhfuilimid sásta é sin a admháil i gcónaí. Dearcadh an-sláintiúil is ea é agus tá a lán le foghlaim againn ó dhearcadh agus ó fhealsúnacht mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Go minic, nuair a théann daoine chun na Gaeltachta, ní hamháin chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim a théann siad. Tá rud éigin ann atá mealltach. Rud an-tábhachtach é sin ó thaobh ghnó freisin. Tá an-chuid áiteanna sa tír atá ag brath ar an rud difriúil chun turasóirí a mhealladh isteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigim nach bhfuil baint ag a bhfuil á rá agam le tithíocht. B'fhéidir gur cheart díospóireacht níos leithne a bheith againn ar na ceisteanna seo lá éigin eile. A fhad is atá an Ghaeltacht ina bheo cheist, cabhróidh sin leis an nGaeilge. Nuair a phléitear ceist na Gaeltachta tugtar aird i gcónaí ar na deontais agus ar conas is féidir timpeallú a dhéanamh ar na rialacha. Níl mé ag caitheamh <Col N="499" /> anuas ar aon chuid den díospóireacht sin, ach tá ceist i bhfad níos leithne agus rudaí i bhfad níos luachmhaire ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin. De ghnáth, ní bhíonn seans againn é sin a phlé mar go mbíonn Bille á phlé a bhaineann le hábhar cúng agus atá dírithe ar ghné amháin den cheist. Ní phléitear an mhórcheist ariamh. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar díospóireacht amach anseo ar an nGaeltacht féin.</P>
    <P>Tá an-taithí agam ar na daoine thar lear a d'fhan dílis don Ghaeilge i mBoston nó i Chicago nó i Nua Eabhrach. Daoine iad seo a labhrann Gaeilge. Tá Gaeilge á labhairt i dtithe tabhairne áirithe i mBoston díreach mar atá i gConamara. Teanga bheo atá ann. Is minic a bhí náire orm féin nuair a thug mé faoi deara cé chomh maith is a bhíodar ó thaobh na Gaeilge de i mBoston agus gan an scéal a bheith amhlaidh sa bhaile. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an fhadhb seo thar a bheith tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Cé go mbíonn deacrachtaí áirithe nuair a bhíonn duine amháin sa chlann gan Ghaeilge, de ghnáth is daoine a bhfuil a gclann tógtha acu a bhíonn ag smaoineamh ar theacht abhaile. Má theastaíonn uathu teacht abhaile chun na nGaeltachta is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil meas acu ar an nGaeltacht agus ar a gcúlra agus gur mian leo an fód a sheasamh arís ar son na Gaeilge. Bíonn na daoine seo an-dáiríre. Bíonn siad i bhfad níos láidre ina dtuairimí ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus i dtaobh an chultúir Ghaeilge ná éinne sa bhaile. Is cinnte go gcabhróidh siad le neartú na Gaeltachta má thagann siad abhaile </P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire Stáit agus an Roinn as ucht díriú, faoi dheireadh, ar na daoine seo. Cé go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann, beimid in ann iad a shárú le réasún agus le ciall. Tá córas cigireachta ann chun tabhairt faoi sin.</P>

Tá a lán seantithe sa Ghaeltacht agus is féidir leo dul chun donachta go mór le linn tréimhse trí nó ceithre bliana. Ba cheart an treoirlíne a ísliú. Achar fada do shean-duine fanacht seacht mbliana eile. B'fhéidir nach mhairfeadh sé chomh fada sin. Pléadh an cheist seo sa Dáil agus luaitear an deacracht seo go minic i gceantair Gaeltachta.

      <P>Luadh an moladh seo sa Dáil agus sa choiste. Ar dtús bhí treoirlíne deich mbliana le bheith ann ach íslíodh é go seacht mbliana. Íslíodh an treoirlíne do dheontais fheabhsúcháin do na mná tí chomh maith. Cuidíonn seo go mór leis na mná tí, go mór mhór nuair atáthar ag caint faoi deontais fheabhsúcháin a bhaineann le moltaí an chigire dóiteáin.</P>
      <P>Aontaím go bhfuil fadhb faoi leith ag sean daoine, go mór mhór maidir leis an ndeontas fá choinne uisce the a chur ar fáil.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom rud éigin a dhéanamh ar son na seandaoine ach bheadh deacrachtaí praiticiúla ag baint leis sin.

B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh mé aithbhreithniú air ach ní féidir liom é a chur isteach sa Bhille seo. Bheadh costas breise i gceist, níl a fhios agam cé mhéad san iomlán ach tá a fhios agam go mbíonn deacrachtaí ag daoine mar gheall ar theidil agus mar sin. Ach ní seacht mbliana ó dháta an iarratais atá i gceist, ach seacht mbliana ó íocadh an deontas deiridh.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here in the Seanad to introduce this small but important Bill. It gives expression to an agreement reached between the unions, management and Government on the ESB during the time of the CCR in 1996, that is the giving of 5% of the ESB's holding in shares to the workers.</P>
      <P>Two amendments to the Bill were accepted during the Dáil debate. One provided for relaxing the 18 month rule to give that shareholding to any worker employed in the ESB in 1996, when the CCR was signed. That has met with great approval. The other amendment relates to combined heat and power, CHP, allowing for it in a slightly greater measure than was provided in the original Bill.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to a 5% employee shareholding scheme in the ESB without waiting for the passage of legislation to change the status of the company from a statutory corporation to a plc under the Companies Acts. As that would take some time, we wanted to proceed with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The concept of an employee shareholding scheme for staff of the ESB was one of the main provisions of the Cost and Competitiveness Review between the Department, ESB management and unions. This Bill will provide the necessary legal basis to allow this to happen.</P>
      <P>The CCR agreement provided that a 5% shareholding in the ESB will be made available for an employee shareholding scheme; the employee shareholding would be earned out of profit at 5% per annum; and the detailed mechanisms of the scheme would be agreed between management, unions and the relevant Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tripartite CCR agreement was designed to prepare the ESB for competition. The agreement was submitted to and approved by the previous Government on 3 April 1996. Over the following <Col N="504" /> three years 2,000 voluntary staff exits provided for in the agreement were achieved as well as the targeted cost savings.</P>
    <P>Since then the ESB has been setting aside 5% of the company's annual profits for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 for the purpose of the employee shareholding scheme. A total of £46.8 million currently stands in a special reserve in the company's balance sheet to be passed to the trustees of the employee shareholding scheme when it is established shortly.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the employee shareholding scheme and allocation of shares to staff will be an important element in promoting a further round of change in the ESB. At present, ESB management and unions are finalising negotiations on a further major change programme for the company before the electricity market opens fully to competition in 2005. The new round of change derives from the February 2000 tripartite agreement between my Department, ESB management and unions. That agreement sets out a framework for the future electricity industry in a competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The implementation of an employee share ownership scheme is not straightforward. The ESB is a statutory corporation without a share structure. For some time the ESB and my Department have been working on a proposal to create virtual shares under existing ESB legislation. The Attorney General recently deemed that proposal to be <i>ultra vires</i> the provisions of section 4 of the 1954 Act, as that Act empowers the ESB to issue debentures or stock to the public but only for the purpose of raising borrowings. The Attorney General has advised, therefore, that the ESB proposal requires amending legislation to render it <i>intra vires</i> existing ESB legislation. The Bill before us will authorise the board to create and issue capital stock representing its net assets and permit the allocation of not more than 5% to the staff, the balance going to the Minister for Finance. The allocation to staff would thus fulfil the commitment made in the CCR agreement. The Bill provides that the capital stock created shall carry the right of conversion into ordinary share capital once the ESB is established as a plc.</P>
    <P>The holders of such stock will enjoy dividend, voting rights and board representation. Those rights and obligations will be set out in regulations to be made by the board with ministerial consent, such regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for the customary 21 days.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to section 10. This provides for the repeal of section 21 of the 1927 Act and the effective termination of the break-even mandate under which ESB has operated since its establishment. It is an important and historic change.</P>
    <P>The virtual shares provided for in this Bill will carry the normal entitlement to dividends for staff and the State. This, in turn, requires that legal provisions be made for profits, out of which <Col N="505" /> dividends would flow, and legal recognition of profit-making by the ESB inevitably requires the repeal of the break-even mandate. The continuation of that break-even mandate is no longer tenable in a liberalised market where the ESB becomes a player just like any other in the market and must be allowed the same level playing field as other commercial players, including the legal right to make a profit. The repeal of the break-even mandate will effectively bring the ESB into the 21st century from a commercial operating perspective.</P>
    <P>Section 21 specifies that electricity prices are to be set at a level consistent with the achievement of a break-even mandate taking one year with another. The repeal of this provision will not give <i>carte blanche </i>to the ESB on electricity prices. Regulations made by me last year give the independent commission the power to examine electricity charges to franchise customers, in effect, domestic consumers, the costs underlying such charges and the right to issue directions to the ESB regarding the nature or amount of any charge or proposed charge.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provisions aim to achieve, through the vehicle of an independent regulator, a proper balance between electricity consumers and the rights of the ESB as a commercial player. They afford protection to electricity customers against the possibility of excessively high electricity prices.  At the same time, they allow the ESB to argue its case before an independent regulator for a reasonable level of charges including, in particular, a rate of return sufficient to service its borrowings and remunerate its investment programme.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to another significant feature of the Bill in section 9. The aim of that section is to provide for the full liberalisation of electricity generated by combined heat and power plants, otherwise known as CHP plants.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing feature of such plants is the requirement for a major heat input. That, in turn, can allow the simultaneous generation of electricity, a considerable portion of which is usually surplus to the plant's own requirements and, thus, available for sale.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislative provisions, independent CHP plants may only supply electricity to the single premises of the main heat customer of the CHP plant and to eligible customers under an ordinary supply licence. CHP electricity may not be supplied to any other final customers. Those provisions are now seen as unduly restrictive. The amendment proposed would allow any final customer to buy electricity from CHP plants. Electricity generated from CHP would, thus, be put on the same footing as green electricity, the market for which is already fully liberalised.</P>
    <P>I received strong representations from the IDA, Forfás, IBEC and other interests urging the liberalisation of CHP as proposed in the Bill. There are clear advantages to be derived from encouraging the development of CHP. They <Col N="506" /> include high operating efficiencies and knock-on environmental benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the potential of CHP plants around the country to strengthen the electricity network and power supply. EU policy is strongly supportive of CHP on grounds of security of supply and environmental protection arising from its efficiency. The generation and sale of electricity from CHP plants will be subject to licensing by the electricity regulator.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides me with the opportunity to present a short overview of the electricity sector and the ESB's role within it. The last four years have been a period of intense activity in the energy area. Some of the key milestones have included the CCR process in 1996; the extensive public consultation process in 1997 on the EU electricity directive; publication of the Electricity Regulation Bill in 1998; enactment of that legislation in 1999; establishment of the Commission for Electricity Regulation in 1999; the tripartite agreement of February 2000 on a future framework for the electricity sector; the 30% opening of the market to competition in 2000; the establishment last year of the national grid part of the ESB as a separate independent company, now known as Eirgrid; the joint decision to upgrade the main North-South electricity interconnector, currently in progress; the commissioning last year of the IVO peat plant in Edenderry &ndash; the first major independent generating plant in the country, and the announcement last year that the electricity market will open fully to competition in 2005.</P>
    <P>The foregoing represents the most sustained series of decisions and activity since the days of rural electrification. The ESB has signed up over 200,000 additional customers in the past five years, while the number of units purchased has increased by over 30% in the same period. These are the highest rates of growth in the western OECD countries. To cope with these record levels of growth and the need for upgrading and extension of the networks, the ESB and Eirgrid are undertaking a five year investment programme, totalling over £2 billion, to provide the country with an ongoing electricity infrastructure up to international standards.</P>
    <P>In the tripartite agreement of last year, the State committed itself to continuing shareholder support for the ESB. In return, the management and trade unions committed themselves to a further major round of change and transformation, the ongoing provision of a modern electricity infrastructure and, for the latter purpose, agreement on the use of outside contractors. The rejection earlier this year by ESB network technicians of new work practices and outsourcing was a severe setback. Management and trade unions in the ESB are, however, working intensively to achieve a turnaround and their efforts deserve support.</P>
    <P>In the establishment of EirGrid last year the ESB asked and were allowed to retain ownership of the transmission assets. The company is also <Col N="507" /> the owner of the country's distribution network. Under the tripartite agreement responsibility for the physical upgrading, maintenance and extension of these networks falls squarely on the ESB and the onus for delivery of the new investment programme also rests with the company. The outsourcing arrangement poses no threat whatsoever to ESB workers. The investment programme is of a scale sufficient to keep all of the ESB network staff, as well as outside contractors, fully employed for many years to come and such investment will be ongoing.</P>
    <P>The ESB has been returning record levels of turnover and surplus in recent years. The out-turn for the year 2000, in terms of surplus, is likely to be significantly lower in cash terms than in 1999 in view of increasing fuel costs, etc. The company's headline financial performance of recent years should be seen against a situation of under-investment in the electricity network for nearly 15 years. The company is now facing into a period of sustained investment which is necessary to underpin the national development plan and it will be a matter for the electricity regulator to decide how this investment should be financed and remunerated.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given a reasonable summary outline of the electricity sector and the current position of the ESB. I commend the Bill to the House and will be happy to participate in the debate on it. I thank the House for facilitating me by taking the Bill on the last day of business before the Easter recess, following its completion in Dáil Éireann last week. I appreciate the co-operation of Senators in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I also welcome this short, but very necessary Bill. The ESB is more than a company, it is a national institution and everything that affects it is of national importance. Accordingly, any matters relating to it will be closely scrutinised. It has been a monopoly for many years and, like all monopolies, had its shortcomings. It could be described, however, as the powerhouse of the economy, both figuratively and literally.</P>
      <P>The Bill will possibly take the company half way or perhaps only one third of the way towards full privatisation and liberalisation. One of the downsides of the company was the fact that it was not subject to the cold winds of the free market economy and, consequently, was not affected in the same way as other companies by a downturn in the economy. To a degree, the ESB was featherbedded. The abolition of the break even mandate is very welcome because, in the current economic climate, no company could continue in that type of economic straitjacket. Accordingly, I welcome the liberalising measures of the Bill in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a certain reluctance, however, on the part of the board of the company and, perhaps, management, staff and even the Government to open the door fully to liberalis<Col N="508" /> ation. In that context, we must take note of the companies which have come in in recent years and &ldquo;tested the waters&rdquo; in free market liberalisation, but been frozen out. Some have gone while others are ready to go. That is not a good omen for liberalisation. I have spoken to some directors of such companies who have been disappointed with the official response which they have received in that regard. I ask the Minister to deal with that matter in her reply.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the ESB has employed many workers. It kept thousands of our workforce from emigrating during the lean times of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Many families owe their economic existence to the ESB. As a nation, we owe the company a great deal. One could equally say that the company owes the nation greatly. If we are moving towards a free market economy &ndash; this measure is, possibly, laying the foundation for that process &ndash; I am not entirely convinced that the Government is fully committed as yet to the privatisation of the ESB. There has been movement and this Bill is a step forward. Nevertheless, there is resistance from many quarters and that will continue.</P>
    <P>The west has serious infrastructural deficiencies in terms of electricity supply. Insufficiency of supply in parts of County Mayo means that it would not be possible to cater for the power needs of major new industries. The possibility of constructing a major transmission line from Galway to Castlebar is being investigated as part of the planning process.</P>
    <P>The planning process for ongoing ESB developments is becoming more and more cumbersome. Objectors are jumping on the bandwagon at every turn and have become a serious delaying factor. Requests for planning permission for pylons have become a major issue. We at local authority level have raised the issue of underground transmission lines, which is not a very enticing option in economic terms. However, I ask the ESB to consider underground transmission lines as a means of overcoming the many planning objections.</P>
    <P>The basic problem in Mayo and other parts of the west is insufficient and poor quality power supply. Major IT companies are looking for high quality supply. That can only be delivered by transmission lines, which we do not have. Their absence is a major disincentive for industry considering locating in the region. Moves are afoot to rectify the situation but they are very slow coming on stream. I ask the Minister to examine ways of expediting the planning process. The Government has compulsory purchase powers but there still seem to be inordinate delays in getting transmission lines up and running and rectifying the inadequacies in power supply.</P>
    <P>The ESB has enjoyed a monopoly since its inception in 1927, but that monopoly, like those of many other companies, is being removed. The transition to the free market requires a lean and hungry company. One criticism levelled at the ESB in the past was that it was overstaffed. The <Col N="509" /> fact that any company can lay off 2,000 people in one fell swoop and still maintain growth alongside a high degree of profitability and an increasing number of new connections and services is significant in itself. The ESB is taking the necessary measures to become lean and hungry and compete in the free market. I commend that and the Minister's longstanding interest in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of ambivalence in certain quarters about opening the doors to competition. To many companies, however, it looks like one hand is opening the door, while the other is closing it. Given the culture that has existed in the ESB, resistance of this kind was to be expected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill, limited as they are. The abolition of the break-even mandate will ensure that the company moves into the competitive market with a new sense of urgency and competitiveness. This House looks forward to further measures to streamline this great national institution.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the 5% shareholding for workers and hope that it will have the desired effect. The company is offering the workforce a carrot in the form of a significant portion of company stock. As the major shareholder, the Exchequer will also expect a financial return. This Bill is welcome for all those reasons and I support its general thrust and philosophy. Despite the problems with supply in the west that I mentioned, we will have to move ahead.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the Corrib gas find off the north-west coast and the possibility of building a gas-fired generating station in the west, probably in Mayo. The Minister will be aware that the old peat-fired generating station at Bellacorrick is being decommissioned and will probably cease production in two to three years' time. That places an onus on the Government to put in place an alternative generating capacity in the west. The landfall for the Corrib gas field will be around 30 miles to the north of the generating station in Bellacorrick and its coming on stream offers a great opportunity for power generation in that area.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the ESB will not enjoy a monopoly in tendering for or promoting the project. That initiative should come from the Government. The Minister is well aware of the problems, having received many deputations relating to the Corrib gas find and the possibility of a generating station in Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Caffrey in welcoming the Minister to the House with a very short and simple Bill, which will have far-reaching consequences for the operation of electricity supplies and the ESB in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been particularly adept, during the past few years, at changing the structure of Irish semi-State companies and equipping them to deal with the commercial reality of the open economy. She deserves applause for that. Senator Caffrey has paid eloquent and just tribute to the ESB for the contribution it has made <Col N="510" /> over the past 74 years to the development of the economy. It is interesting to note that in 1927, as noted in the Minister's speech, the mandate for the company was to break even. Nobody setting up a company today would dream of putting such restrictions on the development of a company.</P>
    <P>It was a different Ireland then and it was necessary that the consumers and their rights be looked after in legislation to ensure that an individual's economic state would not be damaged. Some of us are old enough to remember rural electrification and it made a huge transformation in the quality of life of people in rural areas, as did piped water. I remember discussing water charges with someone and arguing as to which of the two utilities they would opt to do without if necessary. It would be a very difficult choice to make and one only realises that when there is a breakdown in the service.</P>
    <P>The company itself has developed well over the period of its operations and has a good culture of meeting the capacity requirements of the economy. When I first entered politics in the late 1970s there was a huge debate at Government level about the provision of a nuclear power plant to meet future demand. Thankfully we did not opt for such a retrograde step. Over the period of our economic development there were challenges to be met in the power supply situation and the ESB has delivered well on those.</P>
    <P>I have always admired the operation of ESBI which has been a tremendous ambassador on the commercial front for this country. It has undertaken developments across the globe and has raised the flag of Irish commercialism at a time when very few were in a position to do so. Things are different today now that our economy is a role model. All over the world people talk of our phenomenal growth and the huge transformation of our economy, particularly since our accession to the EU. We should not forget that this company charted a new vision and extended the boundaries of operation for Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed the issue of the rejection by the ESB of outsourcing. Industrial relations in the ESB have not always been good but it must be acknowledged that in recent years they seem to be managed well. Good industrial relations are essential to any economy and recently we saw an example of how essential they are in another semi-State company. Companies that enjoyed the protection of the State because they were essential services at a time of no competition should recognise that they were in a privileged position. Any such privilege should not be abused. I acknowledge that the ESB has been good in this regard but if people in this age of commercialism set themselves against issues like outsourcing, we are heading back to the dark ages of restrictive practices. There is no future for that kind of mentality.</P>
    <P>Competition has proved to be the engine that keeps companies efficient and effective. It is in everybody's interest to apply that type of requirement. It will be a difficult transition for the ESB <Col N="511" /> and it has gone some way towards preparing itself for competition. We wish the company well. A successful transition will only be achieved if directors, management, employees and the legislative framework have the ingredients to make it happen and partnership is one element of that.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus situation merits comment as a comparison. It would appear as if the issue in Aer Lingus has as much to do with inter-union rivalry as it has to do with the welfare of employees. Many overseas companies have come into our economy and operate without a union structure with in-house employee arrangements. I do not necessarily advocate that but the option should be there. Unions are there to protect the interests of their members and to look after and promote their welfare. There should be no criticism, however, where that is done outside the structure of a union. The union should not be driven by the desire to increase membership or to increase the well-being of the union as a corporate entity. If that is our focus, as it appears to be between IMPACT and SIPTU at Aer Lingus, we are on the road to disaster. The days are gone when such activities can and should be protected.</P>
    <P>Everybody with a stakeholding in the company &ndash; employees, shareholders, directors and management &ndash; has responsibility to deliver a commercial service. Ultimately the strength and survival of a company will depend on in-house co-operation and the quality of product and service delivered to its customers. That should be the overriding consideration. One would hope that the ESB, which as Senator Caffrey said was historically one of the biggest employers in the country, equips itself to meet the challenges of competition. I appreciate the need for an independent regulator in the current set up but I look forward to the day when price increases will not be sanctioned by the regulator because we will have sufficient competition within the sector to determine them. Ultimately market forces are the best regulator of prices and commercial operations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill. The idea of giving employees a financial stake in the company is good. This Bill achieves this but there will be more to be done when the IPO takes place. Michael Smurfit once said that equity was like lifeblood flowing through one's veins. He rated it at that level and he should know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He has the money now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. He has the fruits to illustrate that it is a fact. In Ireland because of the nature of the development of our economy that was not a feature. In the American economy and elsewhere, giving people an equity stake is a progressive driver and motivator in harnessing everybody to achieve success for the commercial entity. It recognises that employees are major stakeholders, with an equity stake or not. The Minister drew up the blueprint with Eircom. The culture of ownership should be developed and <Col N="512" /> encouraged. While the Eircom shares have fallen, the principle and structure established by the Minister will stand the test of time.</P>
      <P>The value, trading in a hundred million shares, the 5% discussed, will be about £10,000 or £11,000 per employee. The ESB has, like other mature industries, employees who gave a life's service to it. It is fair and equitable that they benefit from their involvement and have an active interest in the company's economic and financial success. This is a progressive measure and the 5% in an IPO will follow the Minister's model.</P>
      <P>Our economy requires uninterrupted supply. Questions were raised about capacity, some of which were the result of the shortages in the United States west coast creating problems for businesses. The ESB and the other companies using other methods, such as CHP, which was mentioned by the Minister, will compete before full liberalisation in 2005. The CHP provision might allow waste thermal treatment plants to generate electricity. In this House in the past, I was against incineration. However, this Bill is not about that, although it will facilitate such activity.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to the ESB that it increased significantly its customers over the past five years. It reflects the rate of our economic growth. The rate is slowing because of international factors and the foot and mouth disease outbreak, but it will still create demands on the infrastructure. As a public utility, the ESB is part of that and it must have the legislative framework, the management, and the <i>modus operandi,</i> including industrial relations, to meet the challenge.</P>
      <P>For 74 years it was part of our development. While the company's remit and practices have to change and there is apprehension about competition, those involved will recognise that this is good if positively embraced and pursued dynamically. The ESB can do that and, in future, these changes will be viewed as far-sighted and positive for the economy and the company. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for the manner in which she is dealing with this and other matters within her remit in the commercial semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Caffrey, for Fine Gael, and Walsh for Fianna Fáil. Both contributions were reflective and interesting because they were made in a less frenzied atmosphere than is normally prevalent. Senator Caffrey acknowledged that a great employer like the ESB recognised the need to shed 2,000 jobs, with 2,000 more to come. Acknowledgement is due to the workforce which also recognised this and availed of a good severance package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the transmission line from Galway to Castlebar, which is in the planning stage and was also discussed in the Dáil. The Senators appreciate that I have no role in planning, which is a local issue, dealt with by local councillors and the local community. The Cabinet committee on infrastructure, of which I am a <Col N="513" /> member, is examining delays in electricity supply, roads, bridges, water and sewerage works, which hold up the economy. I cannot say what the result will be because it is the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>People have a right to object. In Kildare a rare snail delayed the bypass for months. I am fond of wildlife, if a snail qualifies as such, but I have doubts about attention being given to such a small detail. Local authority members, as I was myself for some years, have responsibility for planning. As a local authority member, I often found a conflict between getting something necessary for the area and keeping faith with my constituents who, collectively or individually, objected to the development. It is a difficult balance for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Such issues are raised by the building of a plant to deal with the gas find off the west coast. My colleague, Deputy Jacob, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, co-ordinates with Bord Gáis Éireann over it. I hope that an independent company builds the plant, which will help that part of Mayo. The new plant will be welcomed because the Bellacorick plant will close in 2004.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Caffrey's openness but I am not sure about what he said on the ambiguity on deregulation. We might return to it on Committee Stage, but there is no ambiguity. We are ahead of France and other countries which are quibbling with the 2005 liberalisation programme which has been set for us by Europe and which we have fulfilled. The figure is 40% for this year and a continuance down that road until 2005. At the last summit France and other countries said this was too swift. For once, therefore, instead of waiting to be clobbered on the head by Europe we are at one with it.</P>
    <P>Regarding new companies, we have welcomed them and while I meet them on a courtesy level I have no dealings with them as they are subject to the regulator, not to me, in terms of applications. They have justifiable and recognised cause to seek things from the ESB, but that is a matter for the independent regulator established under the law, namely, Tom Reeves, who is doing a very good job. I cannot deal with the new companies on an operational level &ndash; there is no ambiguity in this regard. I understand they get on well with Tom Reeves and I am sure he is extremely courteous and very progressive in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants the situation which developed in California to be mirrored here. We were all very excited by the example in California, where liberalisation and deregulation was too speedy. They went over board and brought in dozens of companies. It is a clear example of how one can lose the run of oneself. As a result California found itself with a distinct lack of supply. There must be a balance and here the ESB, the regulator, the Government and the Opposition have got the balance right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> There is no ambiguity in terms of liberalisation as we are in tune exactly with the timetable set out for Europe and are ahead of some countries which do not agree with the process. Under law we have appointed a regulator who is dealing with independent companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh is correct in what he said about the contribution of the ESB over 74 years. The Senator is from Wexford and spoke about nuclear power. It is amazing how that was a raging issue at the time and how we almost fell for it. There were heroes and villains at the time, as there are in every scenario, and we know who some of the villains were, God rest them. The heroes are still with us. People were willing to chase after something new and to be in at the beginning of what they thought would be a wonderful adventure. Rather it would have been a horrid disaster.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to ESBI which gives great international standing to the ESB. He also extolled competition, and I could not agree more. Senator Caffrey also referred to competition. Where there are monopolies there is no security. A monopoly in terms of buses, power, airlines etc. may give wonderful service and a fine product, but in the end one is at its mercy. If they decide not to provide the service, perhaps for legitimate reasons, we would be in a very serious situation and that is why I fully agree with competition. The market is the best regulator. Etain Doyle, the telecommunications regulator who will soon have responsibility also for postal services, was appointed by the previous Government and is doing a very fine job. The current Government appointed Tom Reeves, the regulator for electricity and gas, and an airports regulator. We must now get a balance between policy formation and the execution of that policy by the various regulators. The Senator is correct in saying that market forces are the best regulator.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffery raised the issue of privatisation, which he clearly understands perfectly. Regulation through the appointment of regulators is one issue while liberalisation opens the market to competition and privatisation is the ultimate step. I wrote to the board of the ESB about a year and a half ago and asked it to give me its ideas on where it saw its future. It had input from management and unions and wrote to me some months ago saying at this point it did not wish to engage in a debate on privatisation before regulation, liberalisation and the £2 billion funding for service enhancement had been undertaken. While I am very open in terms of privatisation, there is a need for the network to be built up. What happened regarding the rail lines in the UK is salutary. I do not intend selling the rail lines. In the UK the lines were sold without investing in the infrastructure and there have been a series of disastrous rail crashes, which is very sad. By law the inspector of railways must inform me as soon as there is an accident. Often I get calls very late at night about a rail mishap. So far while some of them have been serious they have not resulted in loss of life. However, if I get <Col N="515" /> a call late at night I immediately think it might be related to the rail network. I make that point apropos of the £2 billion which is necessary in terms of infrastructure.</P>

I am not sure if there is a programme in terms of IPO. The Minister may correct me but I presume we are going down a route which ultimately will see the company privatised.</P>
      <P>It would be important at that stage that market forces would regulate. I cannot envisage an IPO where the revenue of the company could be restricted in any way. We are changing from a very restrictive regime to a somewhat more flexible one and I wish to elucidate further information on that point.</P>

      <P>The 5% shareholding would be worth, according to KPMG, about £10,700 to each employee. That is at today's values and that is if the company were floated. In the meantime, the employees can trade internally within the company. As I told the House earlier, management and unions have asked that privatisation be put to one side for the moment. They need to implement a liberalisation programme between now and the year 2005. We laid out 30% last year, 40% this year and 50% for next year, and then 70% and 100%. Thankfully, we are ahead of Europe for once, and we are not being reprimanded. When all that is done, I expect they may return to that topic. Legislation dealing with the ESB includes this Bill and that dealing with the regulator. The next Bill will be to make the company a plc. That will clearly give it a commercial mandate in a free market. The onset of liberalisation will mean that the company is moving away from a sheltered environment and it is, thankfully, moving away from the era of hand-holding.</P>

I have adopted the habit of taking points from each speech during the passage of Bills because a point becomes more obvious when one listens to someone else making it. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Whips for the assistance in allowing the Bill to be taken so speedily.</P>
      <P>On a personal note, this is my first time in the Seanad since my bereavement. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Members of the House, for the public and personal condolences to me. I was a Member of this House and that sense of being a Senator has always stayed with me. I am very appreciative of the sympathy shown to me by the House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter today. I also thank the Minister of State for coming here to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the issue of the need for funding to initiate a GP co-operative in north Tipperary because it has been raised with me directly by a number of general practitioners in the area. They have informed me that an application for funding <Col N="517" /> was made through the Mid-Western Health Board to the Government. Funding of between £400,000 and £500,000 was requested to establish a GP co-operative in north Tipperary. Even before that application had been made, a considerable amount of work had been done by the GPs in the area, to such an extent that there is now wide agreement on the need for a GP co-operative. The proposal which went to the Department was comprehensive, and had funding become available, it would have been possible to establish the co-operative immediately. It is a pity the Department did not find it possible to fund the co-operative. I put it to the Minister on behalf of GPs and their patients, particularly public patients, that it is necessary for the Department to re-examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Because of his background, the Minister will be aware that the role and lifestyle of the GP is undergoing great change, particularly in rural areas. The number of women involved in general practice has increased to a huge extent and that is a good thing because gender balance is desirable in all professions. My information is that the number of medical students opting for the GP programme is now hugely imbalanced in favour of women and that the number of leaving certificate students applying to study medicine is again vastly over-represented on the female side. This means that we are rapidly moving into a situation where the majority, between 80% and 90%, of qualified GPs are women. This has changed the whole structure of the GP service.</P>
    <P>I have been told it is very difficult to get GPs to join rural practices and virtually impossible if they are women. Women cannot take on the onerous responsibility of being on call and going out at night on a regular basis. It is not possible to provide that kind of service at the same time as being a wife and mother. Their desire to have a reasonable quality of life results in their choosing not to take on a rural practice.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows the idea of a co-operative is an excellent one, and I do not need to go through the details. Cover is available, as is physical security by the provision of a driver. The quality of the GP's family life is thereby improved. Where the co-operative system is in operation it provides value for money, which is important from the viewpoint of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The provision of a nurse at a central location who can be contacted by phone on a 24 hour basis has reduced the necessity of follow up GP visits from calls made to the co-operative service by up to 40%. This is a very good use of resources.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that other areas of the country were provided with funding this year to establish a service. Even though the north Tipperary model is ready, funding was not provided and it is urgently required. My plea is part of a campaign being undertaken by the GPs of north Tipperary in relation to this.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at how other parts of the country are spending their allocations? If the full <Col N="518" /> amount is not being spent then I would urge the Minister to divert that money to the north Tipperary scheme, which as I said is ready to go. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister on this urgent issue. It needs attention and in the immediate short term it needs funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the Minister for Health and Children is to promote, develop and provide a modern integrated primary care service that is responsive to the needs of patients in a manner that is efficient, effective and equitable. The development of primary care services must, of course, also be consistent with the overall strategic and integrated development of the health services generally. In that regard, further to the review of general medical practice recently carried out by the health board chief executive officers, the Minister is planning to commence a wide-ranging consultative process with all the relevant stakeholders with a view to formulating a blueprint for the future long-term development of general practice.</P>
      <P>The provision of an appropriate general practitioner out of hours service is an essential aspect of moving forward in this area. The increasing public perception of difficulties in accessing GP services at nights, weekends and public holidays has placed growing and inappropriate pressures on hospitals, especially accident and emergency departments. Accompanying this trend has been a very substantial increase in costs for those out of hours GP services that are being provided. Accordingly, the Minister is determined to ensure that the policy response in this area is a national one that ensures a quality based patient service in a value for money framework. The matter of developing GP co-ops or other out of hours structures in the Mid-Western Health Board or anywhere else must be consistent with that strategy.</P>
      <P>The Minister sees the development of the out of hours GP co-operative model as being one way to progress service delivery, meet patients' needs and provide satisfactory working schedules for participating GPs. Such co-ops are backed by strong support structures provided by health boards that facilitate a proper and quick response to calls made. They also offer the opportunity for participating doctors to better organise their out of hours schedules and hence have more time for family and other important social commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, there are two major GP out of hours co-op models being piloted in the North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board areas, North East DOC and CAREDOC respectively. They are undergoing a rigorous and independent evaluation. Following that evaluation, the first stage of which I expect to be completed by late May, the Minister will be in a position to make an objectively informed decision on how <Col N="519" /> best to progress out of hours developments throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>My Department is also organising a national conference, involving all the stakeholders, to discuss all the issues relating to developing appropriate models. That conference was originally scheduled for late March but has been rescheduled due to foot and mouth considerations until May. The Minister hopes that the conference will allow all the parties to identify and consider the range of options that are available to address the out of hours situation and he looks forward to constructive ideas and proposals emerging from it.</P>
    <P>In that regard, it is important to emphasise that the co-op model is only one possible model for providing the required degree of out of hours GP service. In the light of the evaluation and the national conference other more suitable models might come to the fore, either for particular communities, regions or even nationally. For example, in the Dublin area, DUBDOC is an out of hours service provided by GPs from the grounds of St. James's Hospital. As Minister, the important thing is that there is a commitment to address the needs of this area through appropriate means that offer a quality based patient service and meet the needs of participating GPs in a value for money framework.</P>
    <P>The bulk of out of hours funding provided this year was allocated to finance the ongoing costs of the existing pilots in NEHB and SEHB areas. A significant amount was also provided to the Southern Health Board to allow for the next <Col N="520" /> major structured out of hours initiative to commence in that region. That will not happen until the evaluation exercise currently underway for CAREDOC and North East DOC is completed.</P>
    <P>As a means of ensuring tangible progress in this area in every health board region, the Minister has also provided funding to each board in 2001 to facilitate work on progressing the infrastructural issues surrounding the development of out of hours GP models in their regions.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the Mid-Western Health Board received £140,000. It has used some of that money to employ a full-time project manager to oversee the development of an out of hours project in that region and he is currently working with a geographically representative steering group of ten GPs in the region. In line with national policy, that group decided that an incremental approach to developing a working model was the best way to proceed and they have identified five geographic cells, the idea being that the cells would be developed sequentially on the basis of experience, evaluation and funding. The steering group has chosen County Clare as the first cell in the Mid-Western Health Board region. That is their choice. They will also, in the first instance, make the choice on which geographic area will be next. All cell developments will, of course, also be subject to proper evaluation and accountability.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all of the above, the Minister is satisfied that the approach being pursued is the proper one. Accordingly, decisions on future funding and progress will be made in the light of the processes outlined above.</P>
