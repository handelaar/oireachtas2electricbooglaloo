      <P>I have received notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to detail the measures taken by his Department to assist a young Dublin man (details supplied) detained for five months in inhumane conditions in a prison in Thailand; the measures he proposes to ensure that the man does not return to prison in Thailand; and the need for the Minister to ensure that his Department has guidelines and procedures for protecting the civil and human rights of Irish citizens abroad.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government to extend by three months the consultation period on the public consultation paper relating to the potential national ban on bituminous coal and petcoke.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise in conjunction with the Office of Public Works to restore the railway station in Knocklong, County Limerick, to its original and/or modern state and preserve it as a national historic monument.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Rory Kiely as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 1, Industrial Designs Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 15, motion No. 20, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if <Col N="594" /> not previously concluded, is to be resumed thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Order of Business today. I ask the Leader, as I have done on dozens of occasions in the last while, if he will do the Opposition the courtesy of letting us know, even roughly, what the business of the House will be over the next two or three weeks. All his predecessors did that and it would greatly help us to plan our business if he had an indicative set of proposals as to what legislation may be taken. I know it can be changed from time to time and there can be emergencies but it would help.</P>
      <P>I seek an urgent debate on the economy. I know we had one just a few weeks ago, a low key debate which was largely self-congratulatory for speakers from the far side of the House, but even as that debate was going on, things were changing radically. At present the worst enemy is uncertainty. We do not know where all the revenue has gone. We do not know what plans the Government has to deal with the crisis. We do not know how much of the crisis is caused by external events or how much is due to home grown factors such as lack of competition. Most of all, we do not know the Government thinking on the biggest crisis this Parliament has faced. I ask the Leader, as a matter of urgency &ndash; next week at the latest &ndash; to hold a debate on the economy over a full day or as long as it takes, with the Minister for Finance present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a related matter, it is a long time since we debated employment and unemployment in this House for reasons which were touched on by Senator Manning. It appears we need to ensure that the policies in place are appropriate and reflect the current needs. There is a clear need to make people understand the policies in place to ensure that people can be retrained or guided to other employment. Given that the recently released figures for last month are so high &ndash; they will be higher next month in terms of the increase &ndash; we need to create a sense of trust and confidence in people that there is a plan in place and that ties in with the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I would like a clear update on the objectives of the national development plan. Everybody in this House agreed previously that we needed to have that infrastructure in place in order to get out of a recession and it seems the Government is beginning to row back on some of the commitments and objectives of the plan. I raised the question of housing and I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister. Perhaps this will all be wrapped up in a structured debate on the economy as sought by Senator Manning, but certainly those aspects of issues to do with unemployment and the importance of ensuring that the national development plan sticks to its schedule are crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise one other matter. There will be a debate later this evening on the question of drugs and drugs policy. There is an unwritten rule of the House that items which are shown to the <Col N="595" /> House in the course of a speech should in all cases be handed to the Cathaoirleach. That is a long-standing tradition of the House. As we have all received an amount of cannabis resin, which apparently is an illegal substance, and we would like to use this as a leiriú corpach in terms of the point we are trying to make, we are required under the rules of the House to hand it to you, a Chathaoirligh, and I would hate in any way to criminalise you in your position. Perhaps you will give us guidance as to what we should do with these pieces of illegal substance which we have received in the past week.</P>

      <P>I am very appreciative of Senator O'Toole's consideration for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised Senator O'Toole has not handed that illegal substance to the Garda as requested by Ming the Merciless who sent it to all of us in the past few days.</P>
      <P>I fully support the calls for an urgent debate on the economy, the scope of which should be as wide as possible to encompass the issue of job losses, where the economy is going, the national development plan and industrial relations. Much has changed over the past month and there are changes on a weekly basis, with jobs losses almost spiralling. Everything has changed utterly. With the budget coming up on 6 December, at this point it would be most appropriate to have a wide-ranging debate during which we would look at everything that is happening, including the direction in which the economy is going, to ensure that panic measures are not put in place. At least we would put our views to the Minister and give him an opportunity of hearing us, not just on the budgetary strategy but on how in general we see the economy developing.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate with the Minister for Public Enterprise on public transport and what is happening with the light rail project, the port tunnel and the Bord Gáis pipeline on the northside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal for an underground system seems to have disappeared underground and we do not know whether it will re-emerge. In addition, the aviation pipeline is being laid, and all this is happening simultaneously on the northside. The Minister unveiled a light rail carriage on the southside, which is on display for a couple of days. The entire north side of the city is congested with virtually no way of getting through. I would like the Minister to come to the House and explain this in terms of planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The old adage is that for a while no bus arrives, then they arrive in twos and <Col N="596" /> threes. All the development seems to be taking place at the same time and it has a very adverse effect on neighbourhoods and residential areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is curious that one Member on the Opposition benches is worried about non-implementation of the national development plan and another is worried about the consequences of its implementation, which does not make much sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying not to provoke a response. We are all very concerned about the recent job losses and it would be appropriate to have a discussion on the economy. It is also important that we do not talk ourselves into a recession. While there is a slowdown we are not in recession.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong if we did not salute the election of David Trimble as First Minister and Mark Durkan as Deputy First Minister in Stormont. Although we discussed this issue very recently, events have moved on and it might be appropriate to allow time for a debate. In particular I salute the Alliance Party and its leader, Mr. Ford&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the Women's Coalition for what they have done as in both cases they are the only people who can claim to have genuine cross-community appeal. As a result they are vilified by the extremists on both sides. Conscious of that need for cross-community appeal, it was very courageous of them to label themselves as Unionist to ensure the election of Mr. Trimble and Mr. Durkan.</P>
      <P>We do not like to see in any Parliament the scenes we saw yesterday in Stormont. If decommissioning is good enough for General de Chastelain it should be good enough for others. If a person of his eminence and authority says there is decommissioning, that should be taken in good faith. I accept that, irrespective of who made the statement, some people would not take it in good faith. The fact that the IRA took some guns out of commission is of enormous significance and historical proportions, and this has to be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the reason the Cathaoirleach made those remarks was not to try deliberately to curtail me. I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, or more appropriately the Taoiseach, to let us know if he will consider asking the social partners &ndash; if there is going to be a social partnership in the future &ndash; to put in place some means by which people employed in private companies can be allowed not just time off but an assurance that they will not be at a loss of revenue as a result of upholding democracy by being elected to local government. It has become increasingly obvious that, because of the onerous task and additional hours involved, people will not get involved if it means they or their families suffer a loss. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that some system is put in place whereby people would be paid or recompensed in some way for doing the right thing by the country.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning and others in their call for a debate on the economy. Senator Dardis spoke about talking us into a recession. I would not like us to find ourselves in a recession without having talked about it, which may well happen. We are asking for clarity as to whether the steering is broken or the rudder is gone on the ship of State and where it is going.</P>

      <P>In regard to disallowing my matter on the Adjournment, an event took place in Knocklong during the War of Independence which had a great effect on its success. As a result two people were executed and reinterred recently. The place where that event happened is currently a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House provide a forum to debate the unacceptable situation whereby spouses of Irish citizens must queue in the rain outside Harcourt Street Garda station for a stamp on their passport to allow them the privilege of living with their Irish-born husbands or wives for another year? They have been queuing at 5 o'clock and that has now gone back to 3 o'clock. They are mixing with queues of people going into night clubs. As this is unacceptable <Col N="598" /> perhaps the Leader will make time available for either a wider debate, a brief period for statements or a debate on the Adjournment. In the meantime, will he please raise this matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government? I believe it causes a constitutional conflict as it violates marriage.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on litter and pollution. I say this because of a very strong letter in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which was read on radio. A Norwegian environmental assessment officer was sent over here officially &ndash; they send them to different countries to write environmental assessments so that they will know where to send tourists &ndash; and he came up with an extraordinarily negative assessment. He said the country is dirty, polluted, particularly the city of Dublin, and that he cannot recommend it to tourists. I urge a debate to show the significance of this issue. As we have had a catastrophic drop in the number of North American tourists, we are now looking to tourists from Europe and Scandinavian countries who come here for the environment, which we are destroying. It is time for a debate in this House on the issue. We previously had a very useful debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the economy, in particular a debate which would focus on a certain area, the role of FÁS and a review of its policy in the context of the economy. The Leader will be aware that I asked for a debate on this issue before. This issue is very pertinent in light of the current unemployment figures. If we are to have such a debate, we owe courtesy to the many Ministers involved.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the litter problem. All I can do is refer to a particular area in south Dublin where the litter problem must be solved. This is on a main route from the airport and Dun Laoghaire into the country. The litter problem is giving a very negative image of how the country is currently being run. A debate on how to go forward, the solutions, whether there are sufficient wardens and where we go from here would be very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the economy. He is correct to stress the fear of a number of people given the job losses occurring in many sectors.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is in the House to debate the litter issue, I hope he will respond to a call I made two weeks ago in relation to the role of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister. It concerns a particular substance that is currently being dumped illegally and for which nobody is taking responsibility. The problem is being passed from the EPA to local government, but we should know what is the position in relation to this particular substance. Representations have been made to the Minister, the EPA and the local authorities but nobody seems to have responsibility for this area. I would like clarification on that and other issues, and the role of the EPA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House as soon as possible to enable us debate two very worrying trends in education? The first is the steep decline in the number of second level students taking science, physics and chemistry to leaving certificate level, the consequent reduction in the number of students who register for courses in chemistry in our institutes of technology and the inevitable adverse impact that trend will have on our high-tech industry and job prospects for young people who ought to be looking for jobs in that sector. In addition, I am very concerned about the low level of competence in mathematics of the many young people leaving second level, a subject that ought to be central to all education, and the low level of competence, as evidenced by the poor leaving certificate results in pass mathematics in this year's leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>Those two subjects are related to the future of our economy as well as the well being of our young people, and they ought to be debated at the earliest available opportunity. I also support the call for an urgent debate on the litter problem.</P>

      <P>From television and radio programmes and reports in the press we know of the terrible suffering of women in Afghanistan following the application of sharia rule by the Taliban, but Afghanistan is not the only country where this is a problem. In northern Nigeria, sharia rule has been extended to many towns and there were reports recently of a young woman, pregnant following rape, being stoned to death. This is of importance to us because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on the way to the anti-racism conference in South Africa, stopped off in Lagos to finalise arrangements with the Nigerian Government regarding the deportation of Nigerians who were refused asylum status here. Some of those are women who object to the treatment of women in their country. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House so that we can discuss the arrangements he has made with the Nigerian Government&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Leader the introduction recently by Eircom of the practice to charge £2,500 plus costs to move one of their poles on a landowner's land. This new practice brought in by Eircom has serious implications for the farming community. In the past, farmers accommodated the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Telecom and indeed Eircom by allowing these poles to be erected on their land at no cost so that land line services could be provided. This charge is an outrageous attack on the <Col N="600" /> farming community and I ask the Leader to take up the issue with the Minister for Public Enterprise to get Eircom to desist from this practice and withdraw the demands they have already sent to farmers, some of whom may only need to have a pole moved a few yards, for one reason or another, perhaps to develop the land for members of their families. These farmers have been sent a demand for £2,000 plus costs, which in most cases could end up in the region of £4,000. That is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the economy. I had intended asking the Leader for a debate on tourism and certain aspects of the tourism programme. I am sure the Leader is aware that there are five sub-measures of the programme of the national development plan that have not been approved by the EU and that the Department is still in consultation with the EU Commission on them. A year and a half has elapsed and investment is available, but people do not know exactly where they stand in relation to the grants available. It is incumbent on the Minister to go to Brussels immediately to resolve this matter. We cannot allow a situation where investment is&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join those who requested a debate on the economy. Nobody on this side of the House would be worried about a debate on the economy and it is a matter which we have to address. No doubt, there is a downturn in the economy. It is not a recession but we can talk ourselves in. Our politicians can decide that we are doing things we should not be doing or that we are not doing things we should be doing. I see no problem in having a discussion on the economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey has mentioned tourism which is intimately tied into the economy. Throughout the world, there is a downturn in tourism and undoubtedly we are suffering, although not as much as many other countries. Every job lost in the tourism industry is a loss which will be very difficult to make up. We have to be concerned about every job lost in the economy as a result of the downturn in the American economy. It is all tied into the world economy&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask that we agree the debate should take place? I ask the Leader to bear in mind that because of the events of 11 September in the United States, there are issues arising every week in relation to the international <Col N="601" /> economy which we should discuss in this House. There are issues to be addressed in relation to the war in Afghanistan. Maybe we should have an ongoing debate on these matters, including the war and the state of the tourism industry as a result of developments outside our economy. I do not suggest we should be worried about it but we should have an ongoing discussion on it and I ask the Leader to consider that in the context of the present world crisis.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to explain how he intends to respond to calls at the Coastwatch Ireland conference yesterday on the damage being done by current practices on our beaches and coastline. I was not aware of those practices but there appears to be a need for legislation, which was called for at that conference, and for the enforcement of existing local authority by-laws. As a golfer, I do not particularly like sand bunkers but I am told &ndash; it never dawned on me before &ndash; that, apparently, golf clubs are taking sand from our beaches without permission. That is just one of the issues arising from yesterday's conference in relation to damage being done to our coastline. We should invite the Minister to respond to the issues raised at that conference.</P>

We need to allay the concerns expressed by that sector, including hotels and guest houses, in relation to the future development of tourism. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, made a statement recently on the importance of regional airports and the changes taking place in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. Regional airports should play a more important role in future in relation to tourism and the distribution of people to regional areas. A debate is necessary to ascertain the position of the Government, particularly the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, with regard to the promotion of tourism in 2002 and beyond, taking into consideration the current worldwide economic changes.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Manning and other Senators in the call for a further debate on the economy, which is changing daily and sadly not for the better. The Department has no explanation for the huge drop in revenue. It cannot all be attributed to the sad events of 11 September and the Minister has admitted his crystal ball is defective or at least it is no better than that of anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be timely for the Minister to update us. I agree with Senator Ormonde's request to incorporate discussion of FÁS into that <Col N="602" /> debate. Given the huge scale of job losses, FÁS needs to be busy in up-skilling, training and other activities rather than empire building abroad, trying to get non-EU nationals to come here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning's request for a debate on the economy. I want to raise the issue of insurance. On a number of occasions Senators have sought a debate on this matter. Insurance is in crisis. Many small businesses, builders etc. are operating without insurance, not because they will not pay for it, but because they cannot get it. Cartels are operating in the insurance industry. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on insurance as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the deep concern of the people of Louth at the 320 jobs lost last week in Dundalk. Since the beginning of this year over 1,000 jobs have been lost in County Louth for economic reasons and this needs to be addressed urgently. The Government needs a policy to locate new jobs in the regions rather than in the cities that are choked with traffic and pollution. Towns like Drogheda, Dundalk and the other regions need these jobs and can provide the housing and infrastructure needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that on Wednesday morning next, Commissioner David Byrne will address the House and hear submissions between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked for details of business and legislation due before the House in the coming weeks. I will endeavour to have this by next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Ormonde, Jackman, Caffrey, Lanigan, Coghlan, Burke and O'Dowd called for an urgent debate on the economy. We had a lengthy debate on the economy here a few weeks ago. I take into account the serious requests made for a debate on the economy and unemployment as well as on the success of FÁS and its future.</P>
      <P>Many Senators mentioned the downturn in the economies of many other countries. Ireland has stood the test very well. However, all sides of the House must call on the banks to cut interest rates. The banks have had seven to ten years of unprecedented growth and profits. The American Federal Reserve yesterday reduced interest rates to 2% and now is the time for the banks to play their part in assisting businesses in a position to give employment by following the lead of America and indeed the lead of Europe. The reduction has not been passed on by the banks here in accordance with the wishes of the EU or in accordance with what is happening in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what is happening abroad, we must take into account the enormous number of jobs being created by multinational companies and organisations. There is still much confidence <Col N="603" /> in the ability of those companies and of individuals to provide employment. Certainly, those who have funds and who are only getting 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent on deposits will be encouraged to get out and continue the great work that has been going on here under all Governments since 1987. I have no difficulty in allowing time to have the debate which has been called for this morning. Since becoming Leader of the House, I have always afforded the opportunity on budget day to Senators &ndash; particularly to Senator Ross and the Independents &ndash; to have their views reflected during Private Members' time. Those views have been aired fairly by RTE and the media on that day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to talk, once again, about our great economic achievements over the last 14 years and to discuss where we go from here. We are in the fortunate position of having Senator O'Toole as a Member of the House given the great part he played in the PPF. He and other fine people brought together the Government, employers, employees, the farming organisations and all those other organisations that came to the national understanding which has given us our great success.</P>
    <P>Eleven Senators have called for an urgent debate on tourism. I am pleased to inform the House that I will move an all-day debate on tourism on the Order of Business in the morning. I look forward to hearing from the 11 Senators and from many others whom I know are anxious to contribute to a lengthy debate. I will be observing those who have called for the debate and listening to their contributions which I hope will be of enormous benefit to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello called for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come and update the House about the public transport plan. All sides of the House agree that the plan is urgently needed. However, on my return to the country this morning I witnessed the huge investment happening in the Whitehall area, which is adjacent to Senator Costello's constituency. I can only applaud any investment that happens north of the Liffey. It is urgently needed. I agree with Senator Costello and will certainly pass his views on to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis wished to offer our congratulations to David Trimble and Mark Durkan and to wish them well in their new undertakings and portfolios. I join the Senator in doing that. The decommissioning gesture made to General John de Chastelain was truly a historic occasion. I wholeheartedly welcome it. Many of us thought it would be a long time before it happened, but it has and we are all here to witness further progress in the North.</P>
    <P>I will certainly pass the views of Senator Coogan to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. All Senators can agree with the sentiments the Senator expressed regarding the com<Col N="604" /> mitment that public representatives, be they local authority members or others, not be out of pocket because of the enormous amount of time that has to be spent nowadays serving the needs of the people. I will also pass on the views of Senator Norris to the Minister in relation to the long queues outside Harcourt Street Garda station and the number of hours spent there by those queueing. I will ask the Minister to clarify things.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris, Ormonde, Jackman, Quill, Caffrey, Chambers and others expressed their disappointment with the level of litter. That can be discussed tomorrow during the debate on tourism. Today the Minister made a major announcement regarding tourism and he will brief us in detail about that here tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill called for a debate on education and highlighted the decline in the numbers taking various subjects. I have no difficulty in allowing time for this.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senator Henry to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I agree with the sentiments she has expressed. Senator Finneran pointed out to the House that Eircom's charging of £2,500 for the removal of poles is an attack on rural Ireland once again. Corporate decisions being made do not pay sufficient regard to the goodwill and support given by the people of rural Ireland &ndash; the farming community in general &ndash; regarding all the work that was carried out down through the years. I will certainly pass on the views of the Senator to the Minister and ask him to respond.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan called for an update to be given from time to time on the Afghan problem, particularly the events of 11 September. I have no difficulty in allowing time for this. Senator Quinn called for a debate on coastal erosion and matters pertaining to the removal of sand from beaches. This is illegal and legislation pertaining thereto has been passed by both Houses, although the minute quantities of which the Senator speaks that are ending up on golf courses may regard further attention. I know he has expertise in this field and I suffered at his hands on many occasions. I will pass his views on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke called for an urgent debate on the insurance industry. This must happen and I have been endeavouring to have it take place in recent weeks. There are currently people with no public liability insurance, which is disgraceful and appalling. I do not know how the problem will be addressed but it must be done.</P>
    <P>There are people running businesses with no public liability insurance. If something goes wrong, they will be completely wiped out after years of endeavour and effort. We all know the well established families who have made a major contribution to their own areas, employing hundreds of people, particularly in the tourism industry, but some have no public liability insurance at present. We know of some people in manufacturing who have none either. I certainly will endeav<Col N="605" /> our to have the matter debated in the House as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to <i>subsections (3) </i>and<i> (4),</i> an application under <i>subsection (1)</i> may be amended, at the request of the applicant and with the approval of the Controller, at any time prior to registration.</P>
      <P>(3) An amendment to an application for registration of a design under this section shall not be approved of by the Controller if the amendment affects the identity of the design.</P>
      <P>(4) Where an amendment to an application for the registration of a design under this section is made the filing date of the application shall be retained.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is concerned with enshrining in law the current practice which permits applicants to submit amendments to their applications for registration of a design. These amendments may only be submitted prior to registration and with the approval of the controller. They must not change the identity of the design in question and the controller will refuse requests for amendments which affect the identity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This qualification in respect of identity, that is, in respect of the general appearance of a design, prevents applicants from lodging applications for a particular design and then subsequently altering <Col N="606" /> the design, that is, the subject of the application, to a significant degree while retaining the original filing date. If left unqualified in this matter, this power to amend design applications could be used in an anti-competitive manner to lay claim to ownership of others' designs by changing the design and invoking the earlier filing date to claim ownership thereof. This would have the potential to undermine the entire system of registered design protection. My legal advice is that it is advisable to incorporate this provision in primary law rather than relying on provisions in secondary legislation, given the importance of the provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3, as with the final element of amendment No. 2, seeks to ensure that, where the controller has refused an application for registration of a design, as opposed to the previous amendment which deals with requests by applicants for changes to applications prior to registration, and an amendment to the design application is subsequently permitted by the controller which does not significantly alter the design in question, in order that the design may be registered the application shall retain its original filing date. This is necessary to provide clarity in respect of this aspect of the procedure for registration of designs which has not been directly addressed by the terms of Article 11 of the EU directive. It will also facilitate applicants for registration of designs in registering their designs where they have overlooked some aspect of the application or the representation of the design. That is the background. It provides greater clarity in this important legislation.</P>

    <P>78A.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;The copyright in a design document or model recording or embodying a design for anything other than an artistic work or a typeface is not infringed by the making of a product to the design or the copying of a product made to the design.</P>
    <P>(2)&nbsp;The copyright in a design document or a model recording or embodying a design for anything other than an artistic work or a typeface is not infringed by the issue to the public, or the inclusion in a film, broadcast or cable programme service, of anything the making of which is, by virtue of subsection (1), not an infringement of that copyright.</P>
    <P>(3)&nbsp;In this section and section 78B&ndash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;design&rdquo; means the design of any aspect of the shape or contours (whether internal or external) of the whole or part of a product, other than surface decoration;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;design document&rdquo; means any record of a design, whether in the form of a drawing, a written description, a photograph, storing the work in any medium or otherwise;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;product&rdquo; means any industrial or handicraft item, including parts intended to be assembled into a complex product, packaging, get-up, graphic symbols and typographical typefaces, but not including computer programmes; and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;complex product&rdquo; means a product which is composed of multiple components which can be replaced permitting disassembly and re-assembly of the product.</P>
    <P>78B.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;This section applies where an artistic work has been exploited, by or with the authorisation of the copyright owner, by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;making by an industrial process products falling to be treated for the purposes of this Part as copies of the work, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Members' co-operation in regard to this extremely technical legislation. The amendments proposed in respect of paragraphs (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>f</i>) are technical in nature. Paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) simply replace the references in the relevant provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, to the Industrial and Commercial Property Act, 1927, which is being repealed by the Industrial Designs Bill, with references to this industrial designs legislation. They are, in essence, transitional provisions to ensure the safe legal passage between one system of law and another. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) simply extends the protection afforded under copyright law to the designs of typefaces in respect of industrial production of those typefaces on articles from 15 to 25 years to reflect the extension of protection of designs under this Bill to 25 years. Paragraph (<i>e</i>), however, is a substantive insertion into copyright law that it is required to clarify in that law the type of protection that is to be afforded to the documents and models in which designs are first recorded prior to their incorporation in products.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators that the Industrial Design Bill is only concerned with protecting designs once they have been applied to products and does not address sketches, diagrams or other recordings of designs, including electronic recordings, before they are so applied. Under current Irish law, design documents only qualify for copyright protection where they are not used or intended to be used as models or patterns to be applied industrially to products. Where they are so used all copyright protection is denied, giving rise to concerns about compliance with our obligations under the Berne Convention to protect, in particular, artistic works. It is necessary to update the law to deal with this aspect in order to provide greater legal clarity and reflect the experience of legislators, especially in the UK, in this very complex area of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the opportunity to ensure that our copyright law and industrial design legislation are properly aligned. We have also had the <Col N="610" /> opportunity, since the last occasion on which I addressed the Seanad, to consider the UK experience. As already stated, we are concerned here with properly aligning, in a technical context, these two important items of legislation. We spent a considerable period discussing the copyright law in the House and what we are doing today will bring greater clarity and ensure that, from a technical point of view, both items of legislation will fit comfortably together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister of State. I accept that paragraph (<i>e</i>) of section 7 provides substantive clarification and is necessary for the reasons he broadly outlined. As he stated, there is a need to establish clearly in the law the appropriate relationship between the system of copyright protection for design documents and protection of designs by the system of registration as industrial designs. There is also a need to ensure that industrial designs are protected by copyright against reproduction on consumer products for a limited period &ndash; 25 years &ndash; to assist industrial and product development. The sooner designs become freely available to industry in general the quicker they can be incorporated into the field of and contribute to the further enhancement of industrial design. It is also necessary to make clear that full copyright should continue to subsist in works that are of a primarily literary or artistic character &ndash; honouring our commitments under the Berne Convention on Copyright &ndash; and thus draw a line of demarcation between them and commercial industrial designs. The amendment will also help to comprehensively update and improve existing law in this complex area.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State indicated, paragraph (<i>f</i>) of the amendment merely updates the term of copyright protection for typefaces from the existing 15 year period to one of 25 years in order to reflect the extended term of protection to be given to registered designs under the Bill. As I outlined on Second Stage, we support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity, as I did on Second Stage, to acknowledge the contribution of the Minister of State. This Bill is yet another brick in the wall of property protection. The intellectual aspect of such protection is dealt with under the Copyright Act and the creative aspect will be dealt with under the Industrial <Col N="611" /> Design Bill. This sends a powerful message to the rest of the world and particularly to our European Union colleagues that Ireland is the place to be if one wishes to be innovative and creative and have one's creativity protected. I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Mooney. Much good work has been done in this area and due to the efforts of the Minister of State we have greatly improved the law and fulfilled our European Union obligations. As stated on Second Stage, we were obliged to comply with a time limit in passing this legislation but also that we would be allowed some leeway. I believe we have overrun the target date, but not by much. I wish the Minister well with the Bill, which is a necessary measure. I concur with Senator Mooney's assertion that Ireland is the place to be. We have placed ourselves at the forefront in respect of this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said but I wish to make a number of points in respect of the legislation. We have created an environment which proves that Ireland is still at the forefront in the necessary areas in order to ensure that when the current climate of economic uncertainty passes in the beginning or middle of next year, companies that are considering relocating or expanding their research and development or industrial research operations will look favourably on the laws we have put in place and take them into account when deciding where to locate. In my opinion this legislation will be central to ensuring that companies involved in the areas to which it relates will consider Ireland and the favourable environment we have created here.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Coghlan, we were due to complete and pass the Bill by 28 October. We are not doing too badly by passing it today, 7 November, and we have come a close second to the Italians in relation to incorporating the relevant directive in our domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials. I am sure Senator Coghlan will concur that the Minister of State has always been open to allowing Members from all sides of the House access to the advice he receives. It is important to recognise that fact because this is a facility which is not extended by every Department. I wish we could see more progress in this regard from both a Government and an Opposition point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Senators for their comments. I concur with their remarks about my officials. I am privileged to hold quite a busy portfolio which incorporates responsibility for consumer affairs, <Col N="612" /> labour and trade. I have been given the task to oversee important changes in intellectual property legislation and when we began our work on copyright law my first reaction was that it would take some time to meet the challenge involved. However, I agree with Senators that we have been very well served by the relevant officials who have, in my view, provided tremendous help to everyone.</P>
      <P>We ploughed through the copyright legislation but it is important to make the point, as a number of Senators did, that the Copyright Act and the Industrial Design Bill follow on from patent legislation, which protects inventions, and trademark law. We have put in place a good system of intellectual property legislation by passing the Copyright Act and the Industrial Design Bill. In the area of copyright, we have provided protection for literary, music and dramatic works and films, broadcasts and recordings. That was a significant achievement, not just in terms of its importance for artists but also for its effect on the economy. The Bill before us will provide for the protection of the appearance of products and will support product development and design and innovative activity and creativity in general.</P>
      <P>The support and input of Senators is much appreciated. We can be proud of the corpus of intellectual property legislation we have put in place. However, this was not achieved without a great deal of effort on all our parts. I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Members for that because we have done a lot of the ground work in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>We should underline not only the artistic and creative significance of this measure but its economic significance. At a time when the economy is under some pressure, it is important we leave no impediments in the way of going forward. As far as I am concerned we have done our work regarding this element of the Government's programme of work and my officials will support me in that. We have put strong intellectual property legislation in place. As Senator Cox said, the Italians barely beat us to it on this directive but we can be proud of our work and hopefully those who come after us will appreciate that we laid solid groundwork in this legislation. I thank Members for their comments, particularly those relating to my staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the progress made in implementing the national drugs strategy and welcomes, in particular, the proposed establishment of the regional drugs task forces to address the drug problem throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, to the House and compliment him on his <Col N="613" /> work to date. When he announced this in my region, the midlands region, not so very long ago, there was great enthusiasm for what he had to say. Having read what he said that day and listened carefully to him, we look forward to the measures he is putting in place to do something about what is probably the biggest drugs problem facing people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The regional drugs task forces were just one key element of the new drugs strategy, 2001-2008, which was launched in May last. That strategy was about tackling the misuse of drugs in Ireland in the most comprehensive way to date. The new strategy marks a major departure by clearly assigning responsibilities and targets for Departments and State agencies. It also sets out specific objectives and key performance indicators regarding supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation and research. There is now a plan in place. There are indicators and aims to which we must adhere. I am confident that under the Minister of State, who has taken charge in this area, those aims will be achieved on target.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever, there is an integrated strategy covering the entire country. Departments, State agencies, front-line workers, local communities and politicians are working together. In the past the emphasis on the drug problem was mainly in Dublin and the bigger cities. As we are aware, there are such problems in all our towns and villages. The Minister of State was wise to take steps to develop the strategy on a regional basis and, in particular, to involve the health boards. That was an important development.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the nature and extent of the drug problem at that time and stated that, as part of the review, the latest available data on the nature and extent of the drug problem in Ireland had been examined. It showed that the most commonly used drug was cannabis, followed by ecstasy. However, in terms of harm to individuals and to the community, heroin has the greatest impact. For many years people asked what was the real problem. The Minister of State has identified it. The treatment data and data from an important element of the Garda Síochána now indicate that heroin misuse continues to be a Dublin problem, but the problems which have arisen in Dublin have become major problems in a very short time in towns and villages right around the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's research also showed that heroin misuse occurred predominately among unemployed males under the age of 30 and over half of those presenting for treatment had already left school at the age of 16. That is a point which the Minister Department has highlighted and we must all take it on board. There are many organisations doing their best to ensure that young people, and particularly young males under 16, have alternative interests such as sport. Their involvement in sport will ensure that they steer clear of the scourge of drugs.</P>
    <P>While one talks about the Irish scene, the Minister of State highlighted in his statement on that occasion that an international approach is also <Col N="614" /> being taken. It is important that he take account of what is known about the problem in other countries. In some of those countries where they have tackled the problem, he can learn how that was done and how well they are doing. In that way he can see if we have taken their recommendations on board and whether they have had an impact on those problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the focus must be on the drug misuser. He also referred to various enforcement measures and the use of certain agencies to cut off the supply of drugs. Drugs are being brought into the country through our ports. Our extensive coastline makes it quite easy to bring in drugs and from here they can be moved elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the past few days every Member of the Oireachtas received drugs in the post. I had not previously heard of the gentleman who sent them. Very soon after opening the post I had a telephone call from the local newspapers, who were aware of what was happening. I do not know if the person concerned contacted the media to say he had posted drugs to Oireachtas Members. I told the media that documents received by me which are unsigned or without a telephone number or address are binned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator burn it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not burn it, but I said it could end up in a tip head.</P>
      <P>I referred to how easy it is to get drugs into this country because of our extensive coastline. The Minister of State said that central to the current drugs policy has been the bringing together of key agencies in a planned and co-ordinated manner, which is very important. This allows for the development of a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse. I am sure the local drugs task forces, which the Government will continue to fund, will build on the already considerable achievements. While the review recognised that much remains to be done, it is also recognised that the current approach provides a solid foundation on which to build over the next seven years. The new strategy endorses the existing approaches and will expand on the pillars and principles which underpin it. The Minister said that what was proposed was not just a short-term view but an action plan over seven years. That is how we should plan if we are to tackle the real problem of drugs.</P>
      <P>Responsibility is clearly assigned to Departments and agencies in terms of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. For the unfortunate people caught up in the misuse of drugs, treatment is very important. There are people who foolishly became involved in a minor way in the misuse of drugs, which subsequently developed into a very serious problem. The Departments have a responsibility to ensure a proper treatment system is in place to help them get over the problem and return to mainstream living, and this can and will happen for many of those who have taken the wrong road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the strategy is that regional drugs task forces be set up <Col N="615" /> throughout the country to develop appropriate policies for the regions. There is a problem in Dublin and the bigger cities, and it is important that we develop services in the regions so that when the problem presents itself we have in place treatment facilities and people trained to bring those involved in drugs back to mainstream living and out of the drug scene.</P>
    <P>In terms of supply reduction the Minister said the number of gardaí to be deployed in local drugs task forces will be increased, which is very welcome. We must have more gardaí involved in this area and more co-operation between gardaí, health boards and others. Work will be done once a problem is highlighted through people going for treatment to GPs or health boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hopes to reduce the amount of drugs being taken by people over the period, and he has set targets in this regard. The national awareness campaign must be highlighted. I hope that when the Minister of State undertakes the very important task of highlighting that campaign, be it in local or national media, people will not say he is promoting himself for re-election. The national awareness campaign in relation to drugs is very important and I hope that what has been said about other Ministers promoting themselves over the past few days will not be said about the Minister of State in this regard. I ask the Opposition to take this on board.</P>

      <P>In terms of treatment, the number of methadone treatment places will increase to 6,000 by the end of 2001, a major and positive initiative.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his work. He said that over 120 of the original local drugs task force projects have been mainstreamed and that the task forces are currently updating their plans for the next three years, which is welcome. It is very important that the plan has been set out and that progress is being made.</P>
      <P>I appreciate my time is up, but I wanted to comment on the problems being faced by young people because of drugs. Recently the Joint Committee on Health and Children visited Mountjoy Prison and saw the numbers there because of drugs, who have robbed cars and homes to get money to buy drugs. If the Minister of State can put in place a proper action programme to reduce the consumption of drugs he will be doing a good job, not just for those affected by drugs but for many families who have suffered as a result of theft and other serious problems.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his work and wish him well in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister of State to the House. I had the pleasure recently of attending one of the information seminars held in the Dublin North <Col N="616" /> region. I was very impressed by the extent of buy-in shown by all the agencies and the degree of enthusiasm among the staff involved in implementing the strategy. It certainly bodes well for the success of the strategy in the medium and long term.</P>
      <P>One aspect which tends to be overlooked, particularly in light of the publicity stunt pulled earlier in the week in regard to a particular drug, is that of alcohol. All the emphasis appears to be on hard and soft drugs. I am interested to note that alcohol comes under the aegis of the strategy. I welcome that aspect as someone who represents an area which is currently having particular difficulty with alcohol as a drug rather than other drugs. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that alcohol abuse retains its place in the strategy and that it does not lose ground to other drugs. I agree that heroin and ecstasy, by and large, present huge problems of a nature which alcohol does not. Nevertheless, there are areas throughout the country, including my constituency, where there are particular problems.</P>
      <P>There is a recommendation in the strategy that the Garda should be in a position, where necessary, to lodge objections to the renewal of licences for publicans and night club owners where there has been a history of drug dealing on the premises. As legalities would become involved, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove a history of drug dealing on any premises. It is interesting, however, that courts throughout the country are involved on a weekly basis in dealing not just with incidents arising as a result of activities on these premises but also in granting special exemption certificates to these premises to sell a drug which is referred to in the drugs strategy, namely, alcohol. It is an age old problem in this country where there has been a tolerance of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Some might say I am preaching with all the zeal of the converted, and that may be. However, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that we have as big a problem with alcohol as we do with the headline grabbing activities which arise from the abuse of other drugs. Alcohol abuse is also more widespread. It is worth repeating that the problems arising from the abuse of hard drugs are horrific. The knock-on effects on society in general, particularly on communities, are worthy of the highest priority. I do not wish to distract from the objective of the strategy in that regard. All I ask is that alcohol abuse should have its place in the strategy and should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the manner in which investment in sport and recreation has been dealt with in the strategy. We are all aware of the old adage that prevention is better than cure. While the major emphasis must be on curing the ills currently in society arising from drugs, nevertheless it is important that in a strategy such as this there is a balance between cure and prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no better way to prevent a recurrence of these problems in the future than by investment in recreational facilities. To date the expenditure involved in the young people's facilities and services fund amounts to £45 million on 340 <Col N="617" /> projects. That works out at approximately £130,000 per project which is significant funding for any project in the area of youth facilities and services. Long may that continue. I have no doubt we will reap the reward in the medium and long-term.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendation for increased co-ordination and co-operation between the drugs and alcohol strategies. The introduction of the regional drugs task force is indicative of the community-based approach to this problem. Since I became involved in politics 18 months ago I have been very struck by the amount of voluntary work being done in community-based organisations of every type. Unfortunately, as Members will be aware, there is a huge reliance on a very small corps of people in all these organisations. The reality is that there is only so much the State can do. The State agency's role must be one of leadership and resourcing but the initiative and the work must be done on the ground. There must be an integrated and co-ordinated approach from everyone involved in youth work, including State agencies, community organisations and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>We are aware that 2001 is the year of the volunteer. We are equally aware of the huge fall-off in voluntary work and the commitment given by volunteers to the community. It is believed that this is a product of the Celtic tiger and the lack of leisure time, but I believe there is more to it. It behoves all of us involved in the Legislature to ensure that groups involved in good work get every possible encouragement. I congratulate the Minister of State on encouraging the input of such groups in this important project.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on the introduction of the strategy. I look forward to his contribution. When it was introduced six months ago the strategy set out very clear targets and I look forward to his comments on how these are being achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, to the House and join previous speakers in looking forward to his contribution, particularly in terms of the progress made on achieving the targets set last May. It seems a little early to look for results, but given that the Government parties have tabled this motion there are obviously some results to put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion welcomes, in particular, the proposed establishment of the regional drugs task forces to address the drugs problem, but I would like to know the details of what is actually happening across the country and if effective action is being taken. The task is monumental because dealing with the drugs problem is like dealing with the drink problem. It is now a problem as much rooted in our community as addiction to alcohol and anybody who presumes it to be an urban or city problem is suffering from delusions. The reality is that there is not a parish in the country that has not been affected in some way by the drugs problem. The more isolated rural areas first experienced this problem ten or 15 <Col N="618" /> years ago, but there is now a greater focus on it because it has become more city-orientated.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the interdepartmental group and the need for ongoing monitoring by the local drugs task forces in disadvantaged urban areas, particularly having regard to evidence of localised heroin misuse. The reality is that the problem is very evident in urban disadvantaged areas because the people addicted to hard drugs in those areas have to commit crime to secure the funding to purchase the drug.</P>
    <P>There is a drugs problem that we, as a society, may not wish to acknowledge because it might not be seen as kosher. The fact is that there is a drugs problem among the middle and upper classes, but the people involved do not have to rob to obtain funds to purchase the drugs. That topic is not widely discussed. It is not seen as a middle class problem because middle class people do not do things like that. Let us be honest about this. Drug abuse, like addiction to alcohol, spans all classes and creeds and it needs to be addressed in a wider context. To focus specifically on a particular element of our community would be somewhat negligent.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of the fall-out from drug addiction in urban disadvantaged areas such as damage to property, robbery, etc. There is not that evidence in the other areas, but there are all the other fall-out effects within families in particular and on the part of individuals in terms of their work, etc. That is the reality. There may not be many statistics to prove that but it is evident in any town in Ireland and it is something of which the authorities who have responsibilities in this area should be aware. It would not be acceptable to knock on some local professional or businessman's door and suggest there may be a problem. I do not know how the Minister will address that.</P>
    <P>Although I compliment the Minister of State on the work he has done, I am not sure that the strategy outlined in the motion will be effective across the board. For the strategy to be in any way successful, the supply of drugs is the fundamental issue to be addressed. If drugs are not available, people cannot use them. If the problem of supply can be tackled, we will make advances in terms of dealing with the overall problem. That involves putting extra people into the task forces and, in particular, into the section in the Garda which deals specifically with the drugs problem. There is a real need to assign more Garda personnel to this area. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a responsibility to ensure there is a more specific focus on the problem and that more personnel are given the skills necessary to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On the importation of drugs, the Minister of State's aspirations are to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by the end of 2004 and by 50% by the end of 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. That is a commendable aspiration, but how will it be achieved if the personnel are not in place to deal with the problem? <Col N="619" /> The ways in which drugs come into this country vary. They come in by air and sea transport&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and other unusual methods. In Moneypoint a ship arrived from South America with £8 million worth of drugs on board. They are coming in through Shannon Airport and through freight, but in addition to those obvious large seizures there have been much smaller seizures on the small piers in villages along the coastline. I discussed this problem over ten years ago with my local superintendent. Action was taken and drugs were discovered. That is the reality, but the importation of drugs has been happening for years and it is continuing. The issue of supply cannot be addressed until there is a sufficient number of gardaí to detect and seize these drugs. Priority must be given to that.</P>
      <P>In regard to those already addicted to drugs, that is a real problem which is having a devastating effect on the individuals concerned, their families and their communities. I am pleased that proposals are being brought forward to address that problem, and this should be done in each of the health board areas. There should not be a problem in terms of funding because sufficient funding has to be allocated to cure the addiction. The range of people affected by this problem in terms of age and other aspects is dramatic and that should be addressed also.</P>
      <P>I welcome the current awareness campaign in schools, which has been very successful. Garda personnel visit the schools and advise youngsters of the dangers inherent in taking hard drugs, but at some stage they will find themselves in a social situation where they are put under pressure by their peers to take drugs, and that is where the real difficulty arises. From that point on it is a case of pot luck as to whether they actually become addicted to drugs. That is the difficulty. There must be awareness of the dangers of drugs across the community, in the schools, families and society in general, and the current awareness campaign could be heightened considerably. There is a campaign in relation to the dangers of smoking, but we need more publicity about the dangers of taking hard drugs.</P>
      <P>Co-operation with other security forces in Europe and throughout the world is vitally important also. We should interact with Interpol in terms of tracking these drugs from the point of source to their arrival in our ports so that the people can be apprehended and the drugs seized. That is extremely important.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State outline what is being done to strengthen and consolidate existing coastal watch and ports of entry measures designed to restrict the importation of illicit drugs? I am not aware of any major action or coastal watch taking place in the largest estuary in this country, the River Shannon estuary, over and above the traditional level of activity, but perhaps the Minister of State will surprise me by telling me that wonderful things are happening there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" />Another issue which has not been addressed, and perhaps it is a sensitive issue, is that of prohibition, to which Senator Glennon referred. Alcohol was prohibited in the USA in the 1920s but perhaps the temptation of forbidden fruit is a relevant analogy in that regard. Has the Minister of State given consideration to legalising any form of drugs? In 1968, there were 500 heroin addicts in the UK and I understand there are now over half a million. Such a dramatic increase may suggest that prohibition makes drugs more attractive. Does the Minister of State envisage any advantage in lifting the prohibition on some of the milder drugs? Perhaps he will give the House the benefit of expert advice from his Department in this matter. I am not recommending or supporting such a move but it would be useful to find out if there is a particular view on it in the Department. If it would reduce the number of drug users, it may be worth examining.</P>
    <P>On the overall situation, I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say on what has happened since May. I do not believe the number of seizures has increased dramatically or that the number of users has decreased. Indeed, the number of drug users seems to be increasing daily and will continue to increase. The task facing the Government, in particular the Minister of State, is a difficult and challenging one. I wish him well in his work.</P>
    <P>Some wonderful work has been done by voluntary organisations and individual volunteers in local communities. Personnel from the Garda Síochána and the health boards have also done highly commendable work, while operating with very limited resources. Many of them go far beyond the call of duty and work outside their normal working hours. They deserve the full support of the relevant Departments and they should be provided with the necessary resources to enable them to be fully effective in their work. That, of course, will only happen if the finances are provided. In the context of imminent financial restrictions, it would be unfortunate if people with particular problems and the more deprived elements in our community should be the first to suffer. I hope the Minister of State will ensure that the required level of funding will be provided in the Estimates and in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad and to provide an update on the progress which has been made in the first six months of the implementation of the new national drugs strategy. Since the strategy was launched last May, I have been heartened by the interest shown, both by my colleagues in the Oireachtas and the public, in addressing the problem of drug misuse. I am glad this concern is shared by the Government and that is why the strategy will tackle the problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. Rather than being just a noble statement of values, the new strategy contains over 100 separate actions to be carried out by a range of Departments and agencies under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, <Col N="621" /> treatment and research. This is the first time all those involved in drug misuse policy have been brought into a single framework to drive the strategy forward. In this context, Departments and agencies have been working towards meeting the targets outlined for the end of this year. For example, under the supply reduction pillar, Garda resources in local drugs task force areas will be increased by the end of this year. This is an important part of our overall supply reduction strategy which aims to increase drug seizures by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments, I agree with her on the importance of seizures but there are considerable difficulties involved. Most of the drug supplies come into this country in containers, of which there are literally tens of thousands every week, through the ports of Dublin, Waterford, Cork and many other locations. There is a huge amount of money behind this traffic and it is extremely difficult to cut off supply. The United States is virtually fighting a war in Colombia in an effort to cut off supply. There has been some success in cutting down drug supply from Bolivia by getting farmers to grow other alternative crops. I understand that Members of the Oireachtas who visited Bolivia earlier this year regarded that effort as reasonably successful.</P>
      <P>In the Irish context, our enormous volume of imports and exports as a major trading nation makes it a very difficult task to intercept and cut off illicit drug supplies concealed in containers. We will ask the Garda to update us every six months on the level of seizures achieved and I take the opportunity to congratulate it on some recent major seizures of heroin in Dublin. International contacts and liaison with police forces in other European countries is a significant factor in such successful operations.</P>
      <P>The prevention pillar of the national drugs strategy will include the launch of a major awareness campaign. This will be an ongoing campaign, developed by the Department of Health and Children. It will promote greater awareness and understanding of the cause and consequences of drug misuse, not only to the individual, but also to his or her family and society in general.</P>
      <P>Senators referred to prohibition and the possibility of legalising certain drugs. The Minister for Health and Children gave a briefing at a parliamentary party meeting today on a Bill in relation to tobacco. Nicotine in tobacco is causing huge problems, yet some people are suggesting that we should legalise a product which, on the evidence I have read in a number of different reports, is five, six or perhaps up to ten times more carcinogenic than tobacco. Some individuals may dispute that but I cannot envisage any Government legalising cannabis, having regard to the cases in relation to tobacco which are going through the courts in the USA and which will probably follow in Europe also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that no major study has been undertaken since the late 1970s in relation to cannabis, but many of the studies which have been done show that it has definite side effects. Even if it did not have side effects, there are problems in relation to young people, especially in certain <Col N="622" /> areas and in the context of social deprivation and dysfunctional families, which would be further exacerbated by legalising this drug. That would be an enormous step for any country to take and I am certainly not convinced about it. I have read fairly widely on the issue and I am not giving undue weight to the more extreme views. In the United States, an increasing number of people are presenting for treatment for dependency problems in relation to cannabis. That debate continues here, in Britain and other countries, but we are a long way from doing something like that. Much more medical research is required to ensure we do not make a decision that could be very detrimental to people's health.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department of Education and Science is putting in place mechanisms that will support, enhance and ensure the delivery of school-based education and prevention programmes in all schools nationwide over the next three years. The ultimate aim of these programmes should be to ensure that every child has the necessary knowledge and life skills to resist drugs or make informed choices about their health, personal lives and social development. As a first step, the Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet programmes will be delivered in all schools in the local drugs task force areas during the current academic year, 2001/02.</P>
    <P>An important target in the strategy is to increase the number of methadone treatment places for opiate addiction to 6,000 by the end of 2001 and to a minimum of 6,500 by end 2002. This should go a long way to eliminating waiting lists and I am glad to say we are well on the way to achieving this year's figure.</P>
    <P>Methadone treatment places are, however, only one part of our response to treatment and rehabilitation issues. We want to see immediate access to professional assessment and counselling for drug misusers. This will be followed by commencement of treatment not more than one month later.</P>
    <P>A range of rehabilitation and treatment programmes will be put in place in each health board area. These will be designed to re-integrate the misuser back into society and a series of training and employment programmes will also be developed and put in place. The strategy also identifies the critical need to target teenage drug misusers and, accordingly, a special protocol will be developed to allow under 18 year olds to be treated for serious drug problems. This is a radical step forward and will help us to make the interventions needed at this critical time. The Department of Health and Children is working on that protocol and I hope it will be available early in the new year. Co-ordinating the implementation of these actions will be an important task for my Department and it is one in which I will be playing a personal role.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, will co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy in partnership with Government Departments, State agencies, and the community and voluntary sectors. Its role will include bringing to the attention of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion any identified issues which have a detri<Col N="623" /> mental effect on the implementation of the strategy through the provision of a six-monthly progress report. I will present the first of these six-monthly progress reports to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in December.</P>
    <P>In addition a sub-committee of the existing Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, with a particular focus on drug issues, will be set up. I have been in touch with the Chairman, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, and it is hoped to have the sub-committee established before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This was an idea we got from Sweden. Members of the parliament there are able to question all government departments and the people involved. I have had complaints from public representatives that they are unable to get on local drug task forces and from Members of the Oireachtas, who are not in a local authority and are not able to get on regional task forces. From what I saw in Sweden, it is far more effective for members of parliament to be on a parliamentary committee. The debate was extremely good and they were able to question people about how the plan was being implemented and other pertinent issues.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy is built on the premise of developing initiatives which are designed to meet local needs, working in tandem with local communities. The underlying principle of the strategy is the development of an integrated response, which both reflects the multi-dimensional nature of the problem and is informed by the active participation of all the key players. An important element of our overall response has been the involvement of the community and voluntary sectors with the State agencies in tackling drug misuse.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best example of this is the work carried out by the 14 local drugs task forces. These task forces were set up in the areas worst affected by problem drug use. The principal strength of the task forces is that they allow local community and voluntary groups to work hand in hand with the State agencies in responding to the drug problem in their areas. Together they draw up a local action plan for the area, which is assessed by the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    <P>The task forces provide a range of drug programmes and services in the areas of supply reduction, treatment, rehabilitation, awareness, prevention and education and they are currently updating their local action plans for the next three years. The setting up of the task forces has been a positive development and has been generally regarded as an effective mechanism for tackling the drug problem. At the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon recently, I was told that one of the biggest hits on their website was local drugs task force in Ireland, which is very flattering and positive for those task forces.</P>
    <P>One of the conclusions of the review of the strategy was that it was clear the local drugs task forces are operating well in the urban areas where they have been set up. Furthermore, it was recognised that they afford a valuable opportunity for <Col N="624" /> local community and voluntary groups to participate in the design and delivery of measures being put in place to deal with problem drug use in their areas. However, the review group noted that the issue of drug misuse outside these areas is not specifically addressed by the current structures. In this context, the strategy recommended the setting up of ten regional drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>These task forces will be set up in each of the current regional health board areas, including each of the three health boards that comprise the ERHA. The purpose of the RDTFs is to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated response to the problem of drug misuse in the regions. The RDTFs will also provide us with up-to-date information on drug related resources and services, as well as information on the nature and extent of the problem of drug misuse in the regions. Once the service gaps have been identified for each region, the regional task forces will prepare a development plan to respond to the issues identified. These plans will be assessed by the national drugs strategy team, which will make recommendations to the interdepartmental group on drugs and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The secretariat for the regional task forces will be provided by the health boards, but their membership will be taken from the full range of statutory, community and voluntary sectors and will be flexible to local circumstances. To assist in the setting up of the RDTFs, I recently addressed a series of ten information seminars throughout the country. The seminars were designed to provide information on the national drugs strategy and the regional drugs task forces which are being set up. The process is well under way and good progress is being made.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which arose during the regional seminars was that of alcohol misuse among young people, to which Senator Glennon referred. This is not the first time that I have been made aware of this problem. The national drugs strategy is primarily concerned with the use of illicit drugs and those were the terms of reference given to the review group. However, the strategy does contain recommendations designed to ensure there is increased co-ordination and co-operation between the drugs and alcohol strategies. In this context, the interdepartmental group on drugs, in consultation with the national drugs strategy team and the Department of Health and Children, will develop formal links at local, regional and national level with the national alcohol policy by the end of this year. This will ensure complementarity between the different measures being undertaken.</P>
    <P>People, especially young people, often get more courageous when they have been drinking and are then more open to the idea of taking drugs. People are smoking cannabis and taking ecstasy in every town and village. Even though I have been criticised for saying so, thankfully up to now heroin has not gone outside Dublin. However there are signs that it is beginning to creep into certain towns around the country. That is a worrying trend and one that we will have to tackle. We are aware of this and are working on <Col N="625" /> it. Other drugs are very widely used throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out at one of the regional seminars, alcohol is an illicit drug for people under 18. I believe the alcohol and drug strategies will eventually be tied closely together because many of the preventative measures and alternative activities we are putting in place for young people address both alcohol and drug problems. Within towns and villages we need to develop attractions other than the local pub. While the review of the strategy was taking place a number of other initiatives have also been ongoing. I will mention just two of them. The young people's facilities and services fund was set up in 1998. It is primarily focused on the local drugs task force areas and the selected urban areas of Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow where serious drug problems exist or have the potential to develop. The purpose of the fund is to develop youth facilities, including sports and recreation facilities and services. Over £45 million has been allocated to 340 projects which have been developed as part of this fund.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention that there are many young people who would not kick a football if their life depended upon it. They have no interest in sport and one cannot force them to do so. We must therefore develop other initiatives, involving music and computers among other activities. The young people's facilities and services fund has gone a long way towards doing that. However, we need to push it further and to work on it in a more structured way. I firmly believe in the important role diversionary activities such as involvement in sport and recreation can have on young people at risk of drug misuse. I am pleased this fund aims to put those in place in areas where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>I established the National Advisory Committee on Drugs to advise the Government on the prevalence, treatment and consequences of drug use. The committee is made up of a range of academic, community, voluntary and statutory interests and is overseeing a three-year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse. The committee's first publication of research, entitled Prevention of Drug Use &ndash; an Overview of Research, will take place before the end of the year. It should be borne in mind that all this is being done against the backdrop of substantial funding being made available under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for social inclusion measures.</P>
    <P>After six months of the new strategy I hope I am not being too presumptuous in looking at the prospects for the future. There is much work to be done by a range of individuals and bodies, but the foundations are solidly laid. I have been impressed by the dedication, interest and concern expressed to me on this issue. In the new strategy we have a clear focus on what needs to be done. We should not underestimate the task which <Col N="626" /> faces us, but we can succeed and make a measurable difference for the first time. By working together, Departments, State agencies, front-line workers, communities and politicians can stake a claim to a fairer and more socially inclusive society.</P>
    <P>The reason the first strategy was put in place was the huge problem of heroin in certain parts of Dublin, Cork and Bray. If one looks at the profile of heroin users one can see they are predominantly males under 30 years of age who are unemployed and who left school before the age of 16. We can all list, off the top of our heads, ten parishes or communities in Dublin from where they have come. Local drugs task forces have gone a long way towards tackling their problems as has the new RAPID programme for the purposes of which we have identified the 25 most disadvantaged communities around the country. We can make a big difference by putting resources into those areas and giving people the opportunity to stay in school. Staying in school is the key to this. If you talk to most of those who suffer from heroin abuse you will find that they all left school early. Many of them are extremely clever young people. If we can show them the importance of education and give them and their families opportunities we can break the cycle of heroin misuse in Dublin. If one talks to the Governor of Mountjoy, Mr. Lonergan, he will tell one about that cycle. The same people come into prison over and over again. He has seen them before, he has seen their fathers and their grandfathers. It is very depressing, but if we all work together we can make a significant impact.</P>
    <P>The new strategy will open a window of hope to all those individuals and communities suffering because of drugs and will make this a country of which we can all be proud. I look forward to hearing from Members of the House who have not yet contributed and I thank those who have spoken for the views they have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. He is almost of the right generation to deal with the drug problem. He is certainly much closer to being so than I am, although I take a slightly more radical view. However, he is absolutely right about the importance of staying in school. He used the phrase &ldquo;breaking the cycle&rdquo;. I say to the Minister of State that he should go to his colleagues in Government. I have contact with the Breaking the Cycle programme in Marlborough Street and it is absolutely wonderful. The way those kids are looked after is magical, but just at the moment of greatest vulnerability they go into the secondary programme and it is all removed. That is when they are most vulnerable <Col N="627" /> to drugs. Why in God's name is the educational support not continued through the difficult adolescent years when these children are much more liable to drug abuse? Without that these beautiful young kids end up on the needle.</P>
      <P>I advocate the removal of restrictions on drug taking. I acknowledge that the two most serious, damaging drugs, to both of which I am addicted, are nicotine and alcohol. One must look at the social consequences of removing the legal inhibitions on drug taking. It is a long-term notion. While I certainly support what the Minister of State is doing, his is only a medium-term intervention because Ireland cannot undertake alone what must be done. What drives the international drugs industry is finance, profit. The war on drugs, which the Americans laughably engage in, only serves to drive up the profits while being absolutely impossible to win. It is just like prohibition. With regard to heroin &ndash; I take on the hard one first &ndash; if you remove the legal inhibitions, if you allow the possibility for people to take drugs legally, what you will immediately do is decrease crime in our inner cities by about 90%. Anybody will tell you that. The Minister of State should ask his friend Mr. Lonergan about that and he will be told that is the case.</P>
      <P>What happens is that people get hooked on heroin. Fatalities occur by the impure dosages they receive because they are not properly monitored. There is no quality control. The craving then drives addicts to attack old women, bang them on the head and snatch their handbags. That would stop if some of those drugs were legalised. We cannot deal with this on our own, but that is the direction in which we will have to go. There is no doubt that people sustained by medically supervised ingestion of heroin can lead perfectly normal lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We went to look at that in Switzerland. We get complaints here about people on methadone. They have to attend clinics initially every day and thereafter get take-aways whereupon they have to attend two or three times a week. I was very interested to watch the Swiss system in practice. Addicts have to attend the clinic three times a day, 365 days a year. There are no holidays and no breaks. We saw this in action and we all came away saying, &ldquo;What a life&rdquo;. What a life it is to have to go to a clinic three times a day, 365 days a year. Some of them went twice a day, but that was the least anyone attended. Giving somebody that kind of future is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely agree with the Minister of State and I am sure his contribution will be taken out of my time. What he said was most useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting the Swiss system, but I commend the Minister to watch a &ldquo;Despatches&rdquo; programme broadcast recently on Channel 4 television. A constituent has written to me about it <Col N="628" /> and I have also had correspondence from doctors on the issue. According to my correspondent, the programme demonstrated that it is the considered opinion of countless medical experts on heroin that using medically prescribed heroin on a day-to-day basis will have practically no ill effects on a user, who can live a perfectly normal life. I refer to medical ill effects. Obviously, the programme the Swiss have is socially defective. The point was made during the programme that after the First World War heroin was used in hospitals and many people became addicted. They were given prescriptions and lived perfectly natural, normal lives.</P>
    <P>There is a pilot scheme in Plymouth in which a GP has been allowed to administer heroin. The addicts are happy and the police are happy because of the drop in the crime rate. A similar scheme was run in Liverpool a few years ago and the idea was taken up by a priest in Amsterdam. The results were remarkable but the scheme was inhibited by pressure from the United States of America and that was a great pity. Such experiments must be examined so that they can be monitored and we can see how things really are.</P>
    <P>Several people referred to Mr. Ming. He sent me one of these yokes too with instructions to ming off to the Garda with it. I am not a messenger boy for anybody, including Mr. Ming, and I smoked it. I will tell the Senators the result if they want to know. It looked, smelt and tasted like little shredded fragments of lettuce and it had precisely the same effect. In other words, it was a total waste of time. I do not think it has done me the slightest damage; it just gave me a horrible sense of disappointment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, since he approached the matter in this way, we ought to mention some of the counterbalancing arguments that he produced for us. He asked all Members of the Oireachtas, in addition to smoking the cigarette, to put on the record that over a 15 year research period, research has reported no significant differences in cognitive decline between heavy users, light users and non-users of cannabis. His source was the <i>American Journal of Epidemiology.</i> He quotes the Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC, stating &ldquo;There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent use of other illicit drugs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also argued that the US Federal Government has failed to make public a study it conducted in 1994 because it demonstrates that there is no substantial carcinogenic effect. This study cost $2 million. It was conducted by the national toxicology programme, the director of which was John Bucher, who said publicly that there was no evidence of cancer inducing elements, although I presume that if mixed with nicotine, one would suffer the effects of the nicotine. However, I am not a doctor and I do not know.</P>
    <P>In strict medical terms, according to the US Drugs Enforcement Agency, marijuana is far safer than many foods that we eat. It makes the point that if one eats ten potatoes, it could be <Col N="629" /> fatal, but it is impossible to eat enough marijuana to kill oneself. Since 1969, government appointed commissions in the United States, Canada, England, Australia, and the Netherlands concluded &ldquo;after reviewing the scientific evidence, that marijuana's dangers had previously been greatly exaggerated, and urged lawmakers to drastically reduce or eliminate penalties for marijuana possession&rdquo;. I am glad this has been done in the neighbouring jurisdiction. I hope that we watch what is happening there.</P>
    <P>I am seriously committed to the view I have, even though it is controversial. Especially in terms of sufferers from multiple sclerosis and this sort of disease, marijuana clearly acts as a palliative. It is cruel to criminalise people with such diseases. As a first step, this should be addressed. Prohibition criminalises a lot of law abiding people. The source of the material I have alluded to is the Police Foundation of Great Britain. There is no evidence that smoking marijuana exerts permanently deleterious effects on the normal cardiovascular system.</P>
    <P>A US Institution of Medicine report of 1982 states that when examining the medical effects of marijuana use, the US National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse concluded, &ldquo;A careful search of the literature and testimony of the nation's health officials has not revealed a single human fatality in the United States proven to have resulted solely from ingestion of marijuana.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cannabis market in Ireland is estimated to be worth between £150 million and £300 million per year to our economy. Legalisation would remove this market from the criminals. We are funding these big criminals. The vast majority of cannabis is imported. Legalisation would free Irish producers and we would have a tax dividend from it.</P>
    <P>The idea behind prohibition was to reduce supply and demand. In fact, it has increased both. Therefore, it has been a failure. While I welcome the Minister's moves, I regard them as an interim measure. Eventually, if we are to get rid of the problem of drug addiction, we must face it honestly and treat people as adults. If they want to shove a needle in themselves, at least it is the State's responsibility to make sure there will be less social consequences in terms of people getting attacked because of others' addictions, and also to ensure that people get something reasonably pure so they do not kill themselves inadvertently.</P>
    <P>In international politics, the situation in Afghanistan, for example, is horrendous. The Northern Alliance is just as bad. There is a vast reservoir of the poppy crop in warehouses in Afghanistan and it is all going to be dosed. It is a far more dangerous weapon than anthrax, which is really a kind of scare story which originated in the United States. The fact that those who grow this crop, despite their pretended religious belief, are prepared to inflict this degree of misery and suffering on other human beings, including Pakis<Col N="630" /> tanis, is appalling. Pakistan has an immense rate of heroin addiction in the most squalid circumstances. It puts the Afghan regime in a certain light, as it did previously when the Iranian regime used to do the same thing in a deliberate attempt to undermine the West. They felt they were paying us back for what we in the West did with the notorious China war fought by the imperial interests in order to keep the Chinese working class addicted to the smoking of opium.</P>
    <P>We should monitor the situation and look at different experiments, in particular the ones where people are given the dignity of being allowed access to the drugs they need in a controlled way. The only real problem I see is that one might have evil sharks and drug dealers trying to create new markets for themselves and colonising other groups of vulnerable young, vulnerable people. That is where education comes in.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his lenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time. I applaud what the Minister is doing. His efforts are very worthwhile and he is making progress. While I would not go so far as agreeing with everything Senator Norris said, he has made some extremely valuable points, not least pointing out the influence the war in Afghanistan will have on the need for the regime to release more and more of their drugs into the world market so they will have the money to buy the equipment needed to wage this war.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris said the Minister needs to engage his colleagues in the Government to help him. He pointed to the Minister for Education and Science regarding the Breaking the Cycle programme, which should be extended to the secondary schools where there are children from deprived areas who are more likely to get involved in drugs.</P>
      <P>The Minister should get the Minister for Health and Children involved as well. I know the Minister for Health and Children is involved in helping the Minister with the drug problem and he pointed out in his speech that during the regional seminars, one of the issues that arose pertained to alcohol misuse among young people. That is important, but the Minister for Health and Children will have to push forward his legislation on the use of tobacco. Senator Norris said that tobacco is frequently used in a mixture with cannabis when the latter is smoked, which is the reason there are carcinogenic effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the seminar in Dublin Castle on the control of tobacco and smoking. It was an excellent seminar but we really need to get on with the legislation. One of the most serious things we have always known regarding smoking and drug use is that children who are involved in smoking are more likely to get involved in the use of drugs. If they begin smoking at ten, 11 or 12, they are more likely, a few years later, to be involved in the use of illegal drugs. However, we have not known until recently that there are biochemical <Col N="631" /> effects in terms of opening up the receptors of the brain, which are useful in the acquisition of an addiction to drugs. It is not just that the children in question came from lower socio-economic groups where people are more likely to become involved in smoking at a younger age. The Minister for Health and Children should assist the Minster more in this area.</P>
    <P>While the Western Health Board is doing splendid work with test purchases of cigarettes, it is very difficult for environmental health officers to bring charges against shopkeepers for selling cigarettes to children who are under age because one has to have someone in the shop to witness the sale taking place. In the Western Health Board area in particular, test purchases have been carried out and there have been some successful convictions already and there are more in the pipeline. The Minister should ask the Minister for Health and Children to make sure under age smokers are prevented from using what is a legal drug for adults.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure that legalising cannabis would have the effect on reducing crime that Senator Norris thinks. We saw yesterday how a boat load of cigarettes, which entered the country illegally, was seized in Drogheda. The sale of illegally imported cigarettes is one of the main areas of contraband in this country. It may be a bit sanguine to think one could solve crime by simply legalising cannabis or heroin.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for what he is doing but I urge him again to ask the Minister for Health and Children to push forward his legislation regarding the consumption of tobacco because young children must be prevented from becoming involved in smoking it if one is to prevent them from getting involved with illicit drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming here again to listen to our concerns and update us on the progress his initiatives have made to date. He was last in the House in late May and I recall complimenting him then on the launch of the RAPID programme which he had recently launched in fulfilment of a commitment made by the Government under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The purpose of the programme is to identify 25 disadvantaged areas and to target investment at them to improve the environment and, it is hoped, rid them of drugs eventually. The programme should benefit about 165,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan gave a commitment to provide £15 billion over six years and the Minister said on the previous occasion he was in the House that it was intended to front load an element of that money. I remember remarking at the time that that made good sense. It would allow for immediate plans to be put in train whose progress could be examined later and which could be followed through with whatever other funds were available. To front load money, <Col N="632" /> examine the success of consequent initiatives and provide additional finance for the most successful ones is probably the best way forward.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that, despite ongoing initiatives by the Government, many families still suffer the scourge of drugs, especially in my area. Indications are that our problem is on a par with those of our European partners, and that is frightening. When I thought of drugs before this, I thought of Europe and places such as Holland. The fact we are now on a similar level to countries where certain drugs are freely smoked or whatever they do with them in public places is frightening. I know the commitment of the Government to tackle the problem is without equal in any other European country. I am sure other such countries have worse heroin and drug problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the 14 drug task forces in operation, one of which operates extremely efficiently in an area I represent, namely, the north inner city. To date it has facilitated the establishment of 26 innovative community-based projects in the area of drug treatment, rehabilitation, prevention and supply control. The majority of these have been evaluated successfully and I am told they will be mainstreamed by the end of the year. Despite all the problems these task forces face, the one of which I know and which is working in my area is making considerable progress.</P>
    <P>Various initiatives have been taken in recent years by the Government, especially in targeting heroin where it is an issue in certain areas. There has been a great deal of positive feedback about these initiatives. One which struck me was from the international assessment of methadone treatment. It commended the Government highly for the innovative and successful system it has in place.</P>
    <P>The number of treatment locations in the eastern region alone has increased from three to 55 in the past six years. A great deal of effort goes in to siting a treatment location in a specific area. I have been involved in some of these because the health board has not always been absolutely kosher in how it has gone about siting centres, thus causing a great deal of hardship and anxiety for residents in certain areas. I am happy to note that the board appears to have come to terms with this problem, and the manner in which it sites centres now is more efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>Treatment is also provided through general practitioners and pharmacies. At the end of August 2001, 5,605 people were on the central methadone treatment list. That compares with 4,332 at the end of 1999 and 1,377 in 1994. The Minister's indication that this should reach in the region of 6,000 by the end of the year and 6,500 by the end of 2002 reflects further the commitment he has to this important and successful treatment programme. Research has shown that positive results are gained using this method. It has shown that there is improved health, a <Col N="633" /> reduction in crime and an increase in the employment of people on this treatment programme.</P>
    <P>Many programmes in place have developed over a short period and are based on entirely new ways of doing things. It would be foolish of any of us to expect extremely positive results from these in the short term. They are long-term solutions and there will be positive outcomes as we progress.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive review put in place by the Minister and the Taoiseach led to the examination of work in Ireland as against international best practice. It involved possibly the largest ever public consultation in Ireland and also detailed study and consideration of large programmes and projects in other countries. The more we educate ourselves and see how other countries challenge this scourge effectively, the better we will do so as well. The Minister has been doing so and the signs are that it is having positive results.</P>
    <P>Our approach towards tackling the issue, alluded to by Senator Moylan, has developed around supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. I am delighted to see our money being spent under these headings because I see them as being in advance of the problem. To date, we have had by necessity to put our money into tackling crime in the area. Now we are trying to prevent crime. I would also include the heading &ldquo;education&rdquo; because it is important money is invested in that as well. I hope we will see these initiatives progressing successfully.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations I like is the regional task forces the Minister is putting in place. Their task is to develop appropriate policies in their region. There is no one better placed than those working at the coalface in this area, both voluntary and statutory bodies, because they have immediate knowledge of the problems. I know the regional task forces will complement and not replace these. Senator Taylor-Quinn made the point that it is not a problem just for people in the lower echelons but also for those in the higher ones. She also said it is easier to identify those in the lower strata with this problem because they must rob to feed their habit whereas others do not.</P>
    <P>I have five words to say to the Minister regarding how he has done so far &ndash; keep up the good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his extremely hard work in this area and the comprehensive approach he has taken to the national drugs strategy which has evolved into local drugs task forces and, more recently, into the regional task forces to which he referred. I do not intend to criticise any of the Minister's actions but merely wish to highlight the issues I regard as important in the campaign against serious drug abuse. A number of issues need to be addressed, the first of which entails targeting the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to cannabis and alcohol abuse. In Dublin, the essential target should be <Col N="634" /> heroin abuse. We must separate this type of abuse from other types of abuse. I listened to Senator Norris and others speaking about cannabis. We must clearly separate cannabis and heroin abuse if we are to effectively target the latter. People will say that cannabis and heroin are imported into this country together and that it is difficult to distinguish between them. They will also point to the indications that cannabis is a harmful, carcinogenic substance. However, in terms of serious drug misuse which turns people into zombies and causes crime throughout the city, we must focus on the thousands of heroin users in Dublin. We must adopt a deliberate strategy in this regard and the entire thrust of the Minister's efforts should be directed towards this.</P>
    <P>I am not sure we have devised an adequate community, voluntary or statutory response to the problem of heroin abuse. I am a member of the inner city drugs task force which recently reviewed its progress. At this time, many community activists are overloaded with voluntary activities and must attend numerous partnership and task force meetings etc. We must examine the possibility of restructuring voluntary community activities in areas of deprivation because, while I acknowledge that statutory and voluntary services should work hand in hand, a relatively small number of community activists are overburdened.</P>
    <P>Statutory organisations are not pulling their weight. The Department of Education and Science still has not sent a representative to the local drugs task force. I note in the Minister's speech that a major part of the prevention pillar is the educational programme. Prevention programmes are to be put in place in all schools nationwide but the Department has not the slightest interest in what the task force is doing, and that is a scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator but a departmental representative will attend a meeting of the task force shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; but we have had a serious heroin abuse problem in Dublin for 20 years. The representatives of statutory organisations who attend task force meetings should have some clout. I am at a loss to know what some of the representatives of the Department of Health and Children and other agencies do because they do not seem to take action in regard to decisions made by the task force which often ends up being a mere talking shop in which people air their grievances. In many cases, there are no mechanisms through which to address those grievances although there is a mechanism through the youth facilities and services fund to make funding available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People seeking treatment in inner city clinics regularly attend my clinic. They cannot get on a treatment programme in the inner city even though I am informed by a representative of the <Col N="635" /> Department of Health and Children that there is no waiting list. There is also a waiting list at the North Circular Road clinic. Surely, the thrust of the Minister's strategy should be to put in place structures to enable everybody to be treated as quickly as possible. Treatment facilities should be tailored to people's needs and should offer people an alternative to heroin abuse and associated crime.</P>
    <P>Many heroin abusers act responsibly in that they only sell heroin to two or three reliable clients, as opposed to children, to feed their own addiction. They do this while they are trying to get on treatment programmes in the city clinics. I welcome the fact that local areas are now responsible for their own drug addicts but sufficient resources, commitment and personnel must be provided to overcome the waiting lists which exist.</P>
    <P>I attended the AGM during the week of ACET &ndash; AIDS Care Education and Training &ndash; an organisation which provides services to members of inner city families who are HIV positive or suffer from AIDS, or have a heroin dependency or addiction and to their families who suffer illness and bereavement. ACET has links with a similar organisation in Northern Ireland and is the only cross-Border organisation dealing with drug abuse. ACET's entire budget for this year was £113,000, £17,000 or 16% of which it received from the Government. The organisation fundraised to make up the difference. The national drugs strategy does not seem to be designed to provide funding to groups other than local drugs task forces. I urge the Minister to consider mechanisms to directly fund organisations such as ACET which operates on a city-wide basis and should be funded in the same way as local or regional organisations. ACET provides excellent services and is worthy of a greater degree of State funding. Indeed, the majority of its funding should come from the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is clearly wholeheartedly committed to his job but some loopholes remain to be addressed.</P>
    <P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The motion compliments the Minister on the implementation of the national drugs strategy and the establishment of the regional drugs task force. The Minister introduced the four point plan &ndash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research &ndash; that was incorporated in the national drugs strategy which involved statutory, community and voluntary organisations coming together to see how best we might address the social ill of drug abuse. The Minister of State has gone about doing so by introducing the national strategy and he is now introducing the local strategy, which will involve communities and the Garda in self-awareness programmes that will consider how best community gardaí can become involved, and educational programmes that will consider how best to tackle the problem from the point of view of prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" />The Minister of State referred to prevention which, in my opinion, can only be achieved through the awareness programme and the schemes and programmes in place in our schools. We must see how the latter can be used to involve communities and families because we cannot achieve our goals in isolation. We must obtain full backing from parents, communities and voluntary groups. The drugs problem will not disappear simply on foot of our taking action, particularly if there is an absence of will on the part of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that the strategy is beginning to work. The Government is showing the necessary commitment, particularly in terms of the funding it has invested in youth services, and consideration is being given to how best to incorporate new initiatives in recreation and leisure activities. I welcome developments such as the introduction of prison-based treatment, improved counselling techniques and the putting in place of programmes for those whose involvement with drugs is identified at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the county development board that deals with the RAPID programme. In my opinion it is best to liaise locally in order to discover how social inclusion can be achieved &ndash; be it through education, prevention, the provision of recreational activities or leisure facilities. The key issue here is the necessity of holding ongoing meetings with the various bodies involved in order to obtain feedback about the weaknesses that exist and possible ways to move forward and discover how to address this problem. The Minister of State is going about matters in the right way. As a careers guidance counsellor, I have obtained feedback from members of the community to the effect that the programme is beginning to work. However, this is only because we have alerted the public at large. Unless we deal with this issue on a joint basis, we will not make progress.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the funding it has allocated and I congratulate the Minister of State on the commitment he has shown in this area. In my opinion, what he is doing will work in the long term.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to this matter, namely, how to tackle drug barons. An ongoing problem is the fact that drug pushers operate in residential areas between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. when there is a lull in activity and when young people leave school and loiter about because both of their parents are still at work. These children have time on their hands because their parents do not return home until 6 p.m. and drug pushers are exploiting this fact. I have experience of dealing with this problem and I believe we must target drug pushers who operate in areas such as those to which I refer. Community gardaí must be alerted to their activities. Young people are particularly vulnerable during the period to which I refer because of the absence of a parental presence.</P>
    <P>Drug barons must be dealt with and publicans who entertain drug pushers on their premises or allow drug abuse to take place there should have <Col N="637" /> their licences taken from them. I accept that initiatives in this area are part of the overall plan. That plan must ensure that the strategy of the health boards works in tandem with the national, regional and local strategies. This system is well structured and will surely reap rewards. With the RAPID programme also coming on board, I have no doubt it will be a success. I compliment the Minister of State who has shown a great knowledge of this subject.</P>

      <P>When problems arose in this area in the past, everyone discussed the need for fire brigade action. That is no longer the case, particularly in view of the Minister of State's plan which will encourage the various organisations involved in this area to work in co-operation with each other in dealing with the difficulties caused by drug abuse.</P>
      <P>I did not refer to alcohol abuse, which is a serious problem, when I made my initial contribution. However, all substance abuse is being considered under the auspices of the programme and we wish the Minister of State well with the various proposals he has put forward. I know that with the co-operation of all right thinking people, this programme will be an excellent success. We wish the Minister of State well with it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a request on behalf of various coal distributors, particularly those in the mid-west area who are known to the Chair. Those in the industry are looking for a three-month stay to make a case, which is very important given the chronology of events.</P>
      <P>On 25 September the Solid Fuel Industry Association met the Department, at which time there was no reference to the proposed ban on bituminous coal and other alternatives, such as petroleum and coke. The next the industry heard was a telephone call on the evening of 16 October, and on 16 November, a month from that date, the Minister and the Department expect those affected to have their submissions together. That is not a viable timeframe. My simple request is that the Minister give the industry an extension of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying I want environmental pollution. Everyone is in favour of good air quality but we have been subjected to mandatory limit levels since 1987 and we are doing well. That does not mean we stop at that but I am concerned by the effect of this on coal distributors as there may be 1,500 jobs at risk. There are 150 jobs, if not more, at risk in the Foynes and Shannon estuary area. One coal distributor who contacted me has <Col N="638" /> 29 people working for him, sales representatives, administration and baggers. He has a large number of bank loans. He believes that his business will collapse totally if the proposed ban is enforced. All he and others are asking for is that the Minister look again at the proposal.</P>
    <P>In the context of actual emissions to the atmosphere, only a tiny percentage of emissions come from heating. The biggest percentage of emissions come from transport, as we know, and power production. Moneypoint has received an extension of time to 2008, although it is a major contributor to environmental problems.</P>
    <P>Small fuel distributors do not have replacement solid fuels. Those needing heat would have to depend on gas and electricity but if one has problems in that regard, there will be no heat. The fuel distributor who delivers fuel to elderly people in remote areas will no longer call to the door. When there is an expensive alternative, prices rise, and it is estimated in this case that prices will rise by approximately 25%.</P>
    <P>To recap, elderly consumers, the lower income group, cannot afford central heating. In the council of which I am a member, Deputy Neville asked what is the number of people in local authority housing who have central heating, but he has not received the figure yet. I am inclined to think it will be a very small number. There is no choice for such people.</P>
    <P>The lasting benefit to the environment, which we all want, is very little in comparison with the levels of emission into the atmosphere from the production of energy and the transport sector. I am surprised the Minister has not emphasised those issues but has left it to a small group of people with no alternative jobs. The Minister should look at a number of areas in relation to this matter, how we fare in comparison with Northern Ireland, the licensing of fuels, who will check that banned substances are not present and regulation of the situation. In the 1999 and 2000 EPA reports air quality was satisfactory and suppliers and users of bituminous coal and petroleum were not singled out.</P>
    <P>I have not even touched on the issue of Bord na Móna. This is a major national issue. It is certainly a major issue in the mid-west. The Minister should give the industry three months to make submissions. I know the Department of the Environment and Local Government will do its bit to ensure proper air quality. However, it is the wrong time of the year for this. I presume steam trains which are used in rallies like that in Stradbally are exempted from this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. On 17 October I launched a one-month consultation period in the form of a paper on the potential national ban on bituminous coal and petcoke. The consultation paper can be obtained free of charge by contacting my Department. Alternatively, copies can be downloaded from the Department's website. The official closing date for the receipt of responses is Friday, 16 November 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" />There has been widespread coverage of the proposals on the radio &ndash; I have been interviewed several times around the country &ndash; and in the print media. Advertisements were placed in the newspapers and the widespread media coverage alone is proof that this issue is being aired far and wide.</P>
    <P>The consultation paper allows the public and all interested parties to consider the issues concerned and to respond to my Department. All the feedback received will be fully evaluated by Government before any decision on proceeding with a national ban is taken. In keeping with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium I was pleased to make regulations extending the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal to ten additional urban areas since coming into office. The time is now right to consider whether the ban should apply on a national basis. The localised bans have proven beneficial to all persons but particularly to the more vulnerable sections of the community such as the young, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory illnesses. Everyone should receive the benefits of improved air quality, reduced polluting emissions and an enhanced quality of life. We are also facing challenging targets on the reduction of overall national emissions of sulphur dioxide by the end of this decade. We must reduce these emissions by 76% below 1990 levels under the Gothenburg Protocol and a directive on national emissions ceilings recently agreed between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons we must intensify our efforts to reduce the pollution from solid fuel use. My Department has issued nearly 1,000 copies of the consultation paper. Sections of the solid fuel trade have reacted strongly to a perceived threat to their industry. However, our proposals are not intended to undermine this industry. In fact, action of the kind outlined in the paper would strengthen it against those who are eroding business by trading in illegal fuels such as high sulphur petcoke. Nor am I singling out the solid fuel trade. The Government is seeking and will continue to seek to reduce national emissions of sulphur dioxide across a range of sectors. Already I have made regulations reducing the sulphur content of both petrol and road diesel by between 30% and 70% in the past two years and placed for the first time a mandatory cap on the amount of sulphur in heavy fuel oil used in industry and for power generation.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the consultation paper puts forward proposals which are challenging for the trade. However, l am confident on the strength of responses to date, including a meeting of the Solid Fuel Industry Association with my officials on 31 October, that we are making progress.</P>
    <P>As regards extending the consultation period as requested by Senator Jackman, I am willing to do so for some weeks to help the trade and other interest groups to continue to engage constructively with us and to finalise their own views. <Col N="640" /> However, I do not think it necessary to extend the consultation period by three months. This would prolong uncertainty in the industry, which has already made clear to me that it wants maximum certainty as soon as possible. I will be reasonable regarding an extension of a few weeks to allow the trade finalise its views, and in this spirit I expect the industry to respond to the consultation paper as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. I would of course prefer to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs present because this is an issue which has been very much in the public domain and it would be of considerable concern to him.</P>
      <P>A young Dublin man went on holidays to Thailand in May and he ended up being robbed of £500 and arrested and remanded in prison charged with the theft of a camera valued at £100. He spent the following five months in prison in grossly inhumane conditions where international standards of human rights were obviously not observed. Approximately 180 other prisoners were detained with him in a room, which was not very large and in which not everybody could sit or lie down at the same time. He was manacled for considerable periods in those circumstances. He lost a lot of weight and his teeth were in a very bad condition and were very painful as a result of the diet. He could hardly digest much of the food given to him. Many of the prisoners were receiving food from outside, but of course he could not speak the language and he knew nobody in the country. He was held in desperate conditions.</P>
      <P>His brother and mother did everything they could. His brother, who had been there with him, tried to get some legal representation before he returned to Ireland. The system operating in Thailand required one lawyer to deal with bail and another to deal with the charge. Between the jigs and the reels, a number of bail applications were made. Originally the court indicated that he would be let out on bail of £4,000, but then bail was refused. Then the sum was raised to £8,000 and again it was refused, and the matter dragged on. Court hearings were scheduled which never took place because the prosecution witnesses did not seem to be available. As a result this young man spent more than five months in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was great difficulty in getting much contact with the Irish authorities because of course there is no Irish embassy in Thailand and the nearest embassy is in Kuala Lumpur. At the time that embassy was not fully staffed and it was difficult for it to make contact. Therefore the pursuit of the matter was left in the hands of the Irish community, who heard about the travesty taking place when his mother and brother were interviewed by Joe Duffy on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;. Indeed, I thank RTE radio for the extent of its coverage on the matter, which resulted in international <Col N="641" /> communications between Ireland and the Irish community in Thailand. As I understand it, due to the almost instantaneous manner in which such communications take place, the Irish community in Thailand were made aware of what was happening. They came together to help a fellow Irish citizen and pulled out all the stops to ensure he would be released on bail. Fair play to them. This would not have happened, as I understand it, were it not for the existence of a vigilant Irish community in Thailand and the fact that they became aware of what happened. Were it not for their intervention he could still be in prison in deplorable conditions in Thailand with no indication of when the case might be heard.</P>
    <P>The question which therefore arises is the position regarding Irish people in such difficulties in far flung countries. Thailand is becoming increasingly popular as a holiday destination for Irish people, yet we do not have an embassy there. Arising from this unfortunate incident, which is still not resolved, where somebody was kept in such conditions, I ask the Minister what steps are being taken to provide guidelines and procedures to ensure that Irish citizens aboard are not subjected to conditions which infringe on international civil and human rights. In countries where there are systems operating which are not fully democratic, our embassies should monitor situations causing difficulties for Irish citizens and make available legal services.</P>
    <P>Persons abroad who do not speak the language could find themselves at the mercy of whatever legal person they might be put in contact with through a native contact in the country concerned and they might not know what the legal system entails. This poor family had two lawyers dealing with the case and it just went on and on. It is important that there should be good legal services available in those circumstances and that, where the person is such a huge distance from home and when civil and human rights are being infringed, the embassy should have the means to make such services available at a very reasonable cost, if not free of charge.</P>
    <P>When there is no Irish embassy in a country, surely we can provide an Irish honourary consul. There is no Irish honourary consul in Thailand, although there is a British representative. Why can we not appoint an Irish man or woman who would represent the interests of the Irish people in Thailand? If there was such a person, there would be a far greater degree of networking within the Irish community and if such incidents occur, which should not occur in any case, they would be able to deal with them in a more expedient fashion.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply regarding what the Department has done and what I hope it will do in the case of this young man, and also what it intends to do on a general basis for Irish citizens who find themselves in similar circumstances while abroad in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister <Col N="642" /> for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I thank Senator Costello for bringing this issue to the attention of Seanad Éireann and for giving me the opportunity to outline the approach followed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in this case.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the person in question has been released from custody. I know that this has been a great relief to his family and particularly to his mother who campaigned very effectively for his release. This has been a very difficult and stressful period for her and I am very happy that it is now reaching a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been actively involved in this case from the outset. The House will, I am sure, appreciate that consular cases by their nature are very personal matters and the involvement of the Department is, accordingly, subject to a high degree of confidentiality. Furthermore, in the present case, the person in question has not yet returned to Ireland. For these reasons, it would not be appropriate to go into all of the details of this case. Nevertheless I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline in general terms the contribution made by the Department to protecting the welfare and interests of this person.</P>
      <P>The consular section of the Department was informed of the arrest of the person in question a few days after he was taken into custody. By the time they approached the Department, the person's family had already arranged for a lawyer to represent him and did not request assistance in arranging legal representation. The consular section informed the embassy in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, which is also accredited to Thailand, of the case and liaised with the family in Ireland. In the weeks that followed, the Department had numerous contacts with the person's family in relation to the first application for bail and other aspects of the legal process and the person's conditions in custody.</P>
      <P>Through the Irish Honorary Consul in Bangkok, the embassy in Kuala Lumpur made contact with the person in question to provide such assistance as was possible while he was in custody awaiting trial. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the honorary consul who works energetically and with great effectiveness on our behalf to assist Irish citizens in Thailand. Because of the distances involved, the embassy in Kuala Lumpur relies very heavily on the honorary consul to support them in providing consular services to Irish people in Thailand. We are very fortunate to have a representative of such a high calibre working on our behalf in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the assistance of the honorary consul, the embassy in Kuala Lumpur arranged for the person in question to be visited in custody. Subsequently, a consular official from the embassy paid a special visit to Thailand to meet the person and to see what further steps could be taken to assist him. While this official was able to satisfy himself that the person was being treated as well as other detainees in the prison, it was clear that the conditions in which he was being held were <Col N="643" /> extremely difficult. The official took some steps to alleviate the person's conditions by arranging for money provided by the family to be available to the person to purchase extra food and medicines in the prison. The consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Kuala Lumpur were later involved in assisting the family with the second bail application which was also unfortunately unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, senior officials from the Department met with the person's family to discuss what further support could be provided and a consular official from the embassy in Kuala Lumpur paid a second visit to the person in custody shortly thereafter. Since the man's release from custody, the embassy has provided further assistance to him.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general questions raised by Senator Costello, the function of the Department of Foreign Affairs in cases such as this is to ensure that the consular needs of Irish citizens overseas are fully met. If an Irish national is arrested or imprisoned abroad, our consular representatives can help ensure that the person is treated no less well than other nationals and that basic rights such as the provision of humane custodial conditions and adequate access to legal representation are respected. Our embassies can visit Irish people who are arrested, provide lists of English speaking lawyers and act as a channel <Col N="644" /> for communication between them and their relatives at home. On the other hand, it is important to note that embassies cannot provide legal advice directly or intervene in the legal process nor can they provide financial assistance towards the cost of bail applications or other services.</P>
    <P>If the conditions in which an Irish person is being detained fall below what we would regard as an acceptable minimum level, our officials can seek to have them improved. However, it is difficult in some cases to do more than ensure that Irish nationals are treated at least as well as nationals of other countries.</P>
    <P>In the present case I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs afforded every possible consular assistance to the person in question and to his family. The Department regards the provision of consular services to Irish citizens as one of its most important functions. In both the consular section in Dublin and in our missions abroad there is a proud and honourable tradition of doing everything possible to respond to requests for assistance from Irish citizens. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to assure the House that this level of service will be maintained and that Irish citizens, such as the person in the present case, who experience difficulties abroad will continue to receive the consular protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 November 2001.</P>
