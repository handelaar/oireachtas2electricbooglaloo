      <P>I have received notice from Senator Joe Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to ensure that the National Theatre is re-developed at its present location in Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Electoral Amendment Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and Senators may share time; No. 2, Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 4 p.m.; No. 18, motion 31 to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and No. 2 to be resumed thereafter, if not previously concluded. Business is to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Order of Business. I want to send our good wishes to Archbishop Connell on his elevation today to the rank of cardinal and to note that the House is represented in Rome by Senator Joe Doyle who, I am sure, will represent us with suitable style.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no problem with the Order of Business. I add our words of congratulations to Cardinal Connell. I was not aware the House was represented and I am delighted to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report concerning statutory drafting and interpretation &ndash; Plain Language and the Law &ndash; was published yesterday. The Attorney General held an international conference on this some months ago in Dublin <Col N="454" /> Castle at which he asked me to speak. My eyes were opened at the opportunities to make the law much more accessible to the general public. This is something we should discuss here. I know that Senator John Dardis, whom I do not see here today, has views on this. I recommend that we have a debate.</P>
    <P>I also raise the huge number of road accidents, a subject on which we have had discussions in the past. I believe there is a link between this and an item I have raised before, the large number of provisionally licensed drivers who have not passed a test. The last time we looked at that figure it was 400,000 who are allowed to drive but have not passed a driving test. On the Continent there is a system whereby a speed limit must be displayed on the back of a car driven by someone who has not yet passed a certain level of test and there is a similar system for trucks. There are things we can do to reduce the number of deaths on the road. We should debate this in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to facilitate us with a debate on the European schools survey on alcohol and other drugs as published in the newspapers today. The statistics show Ireland at the top of the league on drugs, drink, binge drinking etc. Other studies done in Limerick and the inner city in Dublin showed a huge drop in youngsters going to school in deprived areas, accompanied by a high level of alcohol consumption. Now that we have the material, we should debate the issue. The Minister for Education and Science has been doing some spin doctoring. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is known for zero tolerance, tried to explain why there has been only one conviction for under age drinking, which is outrageous. It is time we had a debate in the House on this.</P>
      <P>The Labour group is opposed to the Order of Business. We propose an amendment on the Order of Business to delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; on No. 1, Electoral Amendment Bill&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying now is different. We are opposing the Order of Business because we do not want the Bill to be dealt with in this House until that section dealing with 50% increased spending&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the Order of Business. I am not speaking to this amendment. The reasons we are opposing the Order of Business is that we want No. 1, the Electoral Amendment Bill, deleted entirely from the Order of Business and taken back to the Department of the Environment and Local Government until the section dealing with increased spending at election time is deleted. We see this as a smoke screen&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a guise to enable the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to bring in increased spending. He is the national treasurer for Fianna Fáil and he is using this legislation as a guise&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Senator moving an amendment that No. 1 be deleted from the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that No. 1 be deleted from the Order of Business. I am explaining why it should be deleted from the Order Paper entirely. It is inappropriate to have a Bill of this nature on the Order Paper because the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is the national treasurer of Fianna Fáil. It is inappropriate that the person responsible for fund raising for Fianna Fáil should introduce a Bill which will add £1 million to the coffers of that party for the next election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when opposing a Bill with which there is something fundamentally wrong to put on the record the reason for doing so. There is a serious fundamental conflict of interest in the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the national treasurer for Fianna Fáil, introducing a measure whose main function is to increase the funding which will be available to that party for the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is talking about the merits of the Bill, something he will have an opportunity to do on Second Stage, if the Bill comes before the House. The Senator has moved an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 1 be deleted from the Order of Business. I have given him an opportunity to outline briefly <Col N="456" /> why he is moving the amendment and he has done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ethically wrong that this Bill should be before the House. There is a fundamental conflict of interest. Fianna Fáil is seeking to buy voters in the next election.</P>

      <P>There is a request for an Adjournment Debate on the relocation of the Abbey Theatre. A number of Senators have already asked for a wider debate, incorporating the relocation. We also want to debate the role the Abbey Theatre plays in cultural life. Members of the House seem to think they have an ownership on the Abbey Theatre in their little patch in Dublin. Those of us oafs who come from the provinces believe that we have a right to have access to&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senator Quill to bear with me for a moment. The taking of an Adjournment Matter on the Abbey Theatre does not preclude further major debate on the issue. I cannot allow the Senator to pre-empt the matter tabled for the Adjournment Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I reiterate that a request was made by me and other Members to the Leader some time ago that a day be devoted to discussing the role the Abbey Theatre plays in cultural life. I again ask that this be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of Fine Gael in congratulating Archbishop Connell on his elevation today to the rank of cardinal.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my delight, if that is not too strong a word, that eventually the long running saga concerning the single regulatory authority for financial institutions appears to have been resolved. In that context, I congratulate the great Kerryman, Maurice O'Connell, on his reappointment as Governor of the Central Bank for a second term&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate if the Leader could arrange for a debate on what I consider to be a very serious issue, that is, the ever increasing number of missing persons. There is not one county which has not been affected by this modern tragedy. At railway stations and bus stations there are notices from families looking for information on their loved ones. It would be helpful if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform came into the House to discuss this matter with us. It is possible that we have not yet realised the seriousness of the matter and how fast it is growing. It is not sufficient to record these people as statistics and this House would do a great service to families if it made them a priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House to debate the relationship, or lack of one, between the Depart<Col N="458" /> ment and the National Roads Authority? At a briefing session yesterday morning on the proposed motorway between Nenagh and Limerick I learned that the existing bypass will be dug up and modified to join the new motorway. When I asked who was responsible for the lack of co-ordination I could not get an answer. It is shocking that these roads are developed in the context of the national development plan but nobody seems to have responsibility for digging up a bypass a few months after it has been completed.</P>
      <P>I support the points made by Senator Costello in relation to the survey in the Limerick area carried out by a team from the Mary Immaculate College of Education. The level of absenteeism among children of five, six and seven years is a shocking indictment of primary schools in disadvantaged areas. These children will have no opportunity of leading a fulfilled holistic life. It does not relate solely to education; it also relates to social, health&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that we have a debate on it. We hear of the interventions made by the Department of Education and Children in other areas. If there is such a high level of absenteeism in Limerick the Minister must introduce the necessary interventions and supports for teachers and parents so that there is a high level of attendance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent comments by the Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Thomas Mitchell, a Mayoman, on the abolition of education fees and the State's investment in third level education deserve to be responded to. His criticisms are strong and stark in relation to disadvantaged students and the Minister for Education and Children should outline the Government's commitment to third level education and adult learning. It is important that his comments are responded to and that the Minister is invited to outline to the House the Government's commitment to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business. I join with other Members in congratulating Archbishop Connell on his elevation to Cardinal. I also look to another day when we can discuss the important sensitive issues on relations between the church and State which were raised by the archbishop in his recent interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader indicated that he would enter negotiations to try to ameliorate the position of members of the staff of the House who are described as our secretaries but who prefer to be called our political assistants. I understand there <Col N="459" /> will be a go-slow on Tuesday. I was served with notice &ndash; I think everybody was &ndash; that our telephones will not be answered on Tuesday. This is industrial action which will have an effect on us. We look to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to resolve this matter before Tuesday. The people involved were subject to much disturbance.</P>
    <P>In response to the statements of the provost &ndash; his views are well known and were ventilated in a debate on education in this House within the last ten days or so &ndash; certainly those of us on this side of the House representing the universities made a point of quoting what Dr. Mitchell had to say with regard to grants and the Minister had an opportunity on that occasion to put the points of the Government.</P>
    <P>I would modestly point out that it was I who raised the issue of the Abbey Theatre and I am delighted so many of my colleagues have taken it up. The House may be interested to learn of a close relationship between the theatre and this House because I have just got a letter from John Arden, the playwright, indicating that a complete re-enactment of the debate that took place last year in this House on the subject of a national paid holiday for women took place in Galway with both professional and semi-professional actors and was regarded as quite a dramatic highlight. Mr. Arden expressed himself as surprised at the dramatic content of Seanad Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I support Senator Quinn on his point regarding the number of deaths on our roads. While we have had debates on this matter in the past, the debate should be broadened. I ask the Leader for a full debate at an early date on the current status of the national development plan. While there are many contributory factors to the deaths and accidents on the roads, one which is not featured sufficiently is the poor condition of many of our roads.</P>
      <P>The national development plan has within it the potential to create a whole new infrastructure. I ask the Leader to broaden the debate because this morning I heard people seeking compensation in regard to Dublin port tunnel. People with private residences talked about compensation of £1 million. Obviously that stands in the way of the port tunnel achieving its potential. I ask the Leader to arrange for a full debate on the progress of the national development plan, the agencies associated with it and the capacity of some of them to deliver the plan.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the effects of the proposed motorways and dual carriageways etc. on the life of people in rural Ireland. There are farmers in places such as Lisheenkyle, Castleampert and Athenry in Galway who will see their farms divided in two. The content of the debate should be on the package of compensation that is likely to be put in place for those farmers and the facilities that can be created by underpasses, overbridges and so on. While we do not want to stand in the way of progress we should not cut off the lifeblood of the nation, the farming community. A debate on motorways, dual carriageways and highways would be of great benefit and I ask the Leader to facilitate same.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Chambers who called for a debate on free third level fees. I do not want to get involved in controversy here, and there is no controversy about it. Specifically because that issue has been raised, particularly by the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, it should be debated in this House as there is a misconception about it. People are of the view that fees contribute towards equality and fairness, but they do exactly the opposite. They benefit the better off and deprive the worse off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>An ongoing review of the electoral legislative code is essential to ensure its accuracy, consistency and workability. In view of the changing lifestyle patterns of the electorate and the disappointing downward trend in turnout at polls we must continuously examine the operational procedures of registration and polling to ensure that any obstacles or inflexible practices are remedied. We must ensure that the integrity and security of the registration process and of the voting and counting procedures are not diminished.</P>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000 is the outcome of this ongoing review. It seeks to improve the registration process, revise the conditions for registration of political parties and to clarify, amend and improve other aspects of the electoral process. It includes an important new provision for electors to decide that their names and addresses in the register of electors should not be used for a purpose other than electoral or other statutory use. It contains a number of other amendments including provision for the display of a large print copy of a ballot paper in the polling station to assist electors, especially visually impaired electors.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997 to improve the working of that Act for political parties, public representatives, the Public Offices Commission and others. It will also revise expenditure limits for candidates at Dáil elections to more practical and sensible levels than were set out originally in the Electoral Act, 1997. I will come back to this point later as there has been much comment on this single issue and an attempt by the Labour Party to create a climate of hysteria in relation to it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise the Labour Party was so sensitive to criticism. They are pretty good at dishing it out.</P>
      <P>The Bill does more than revisit and up-date the existing electoral code. It is also forward looking legislation which could have a profound effect on the way in which elections are held. In December of last year I approved the appointment of a Dutch/UK company, Nedap/Powervote, to deliver an electronic solution for the current manual voting and vote counting arrangements. The Bill will provide the statutory basis for the use of voting machines and electronic vote counting at elections. It will provide for the inclusion of photographs, first used at European elections in 1999, and political party emblems on ballot papers and will include provision for earlier opening of polling stations. It will also allow poll workers working outside the constituency or local electoral area where they are registered to vote.</P>
      <P>Senators will find details of the individual sections in the explanatory memorandum. I will now deal with the main elements of the Bill which contain 57 sections set out in four parts.</P>
      <P>Sections 1 and 2 are standard provisions dealing with citations, construction, commencement and interpretation. Subsection (9) of section 1 provides for the Minister to make orders for the commencement of the Act. This subsection is required because some of the Bill's provisions, especially in relation to the register of electors, require a lead in time to become effective. It is my intention that all of the Bill's provisions will be commenced as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Part 2 of the Bill amends the Electoral Act, 1992, which is the principal Act providing for the registration of electors and political parties, the conduct of elections to Dáil Éireann and the arrangements and rules for the counting of votes. Sections 3 to 34 make a series of amendments to the code ranging from relatively minor technical adjustments to a number of new provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 32 and 34 introduce the first major change in relation to the register of electors providing electors with the opportunity to decide whether or not they wish their names and addresses to be used for a purpose other than an electoral or other statutory use. The edited register will exclude the names and addresses of electors who indicate that they do not want this information used for commercial purposes. Registration authorities will have three years to contact all electors on the register before the pub<Col N="468" /> lication of an edited register is mandatory. If a registration authority is in a position to publish an edited register before the expiration of the three years it may do so. Commercial use of registration information excluded from the edited register will be an offence under section 32.</P>
    <P>Why produce an edited register? The register of electors is a public document and is not covered by the data protection legislation. However, once it passes outside the hands of the registration authority and is held on computer the person concerned may have to register with the Data Protection Commissioner. If public representatives add personal data in relation to racial origin, political opinion or religious or other beliefs to a copy of the register they would be required to register with the Data Protection Commissioner. The register can be bought by anybody and modern technology allows personal information in the register to be more easily processed than previously.</P>
    <P>Anecdotal evidence available from complaints suggests that the sale of the register for commercial purposes may act to discourage some individuals from registering. In addition there is an emphasis in data protection legislation that persons should be able to withhold their consent to the use of personal data for a purpose other than that for which it is collected.</P>
    <P>In providing for this matter the choice had to be made whether to make it illegal to use the data in the register of electors other than for electoral or other statutory purpose or else seek to make it available subject to the consent of the elector. The Government has opted for the latter course in which electors are able to register their wish to restrict the availability of their personal details at the point of data collection. If it is found that most people do not wish to be included in the edited register or there is no demand for such a register then its discontinuance will be considered in future legislation. It is a matter I will keep under review. Section 55 provides for similar provisions for the Seanad university electoral register.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides an enabling power to create a national register of electors which may be required in the future for further developing electronic, Internet or telephone voting and which will facilitate the on-line updating of the different individual registers of electors countrywide. There is also a provision that the preparation and maintenance of the register of electors can be assigned by order of the Minister to a body other than a registration authority. This would enable other organisations besides registration authorities to be involved in this process. There have been complaints over the years about the accuracy of the register and perhaps other bodies could bring new ideas on how to improve matters. Such a ministerial order would have to be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 includes two important and worthwhile changes. The first provides that a person <Col N="469" /> who is on a register of electors and moves residence from one constituency to another or from one local electoral area to another can apply for entry to the supplement at their new address. This is subject to their authorising of the registration authority to delete their name from the register of electors for the area in which they are registered.</P>
    <P>This is a measure which I am sure all Members will welcome as particular annoyance is expressed at elections and referendums by people who are on the register but have moved residence to another constituency or local electoral area. Under current law such persons cannot vote in their new constituency and must travel to their old constituency, with the associated cost and inconvenience, to vote for candidates who do not represent their new area.</P>
    <P>Section 6 also provides that persons who reach 18 years of age between the date the register of electors is published and polling day will be eligible for entry on to the supplement to the register. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the position that a person who becomes 18 years old on or before polling day, including the period after the cut off date for applying to get on the supplement, can apply on or before the cut off date for entry on the supplement for the poll in question.</P>
    <P>Section 10 replaces and extends section 16 of the Electoral Act, 1992, to provide that electors lists can be compiled in place of the draft register, register and supplement to the register. The use of lists would provide an opportunity to have a rolling register where it would be possible to add and delete names throughout the year. While the current supplement facility provides for additions, electors' lists could be a more efficient way to keep the register up to date. It would be an interesting exercise to try out electors' lists again using current technology. Following enactment of the Bill, I intend to consult with one or more registration authorities concerning the use of electors' lists. It is envisaged that the use of lists would be introduced on a limited basis, initially as a pilot scheme which could be reviewed in light of the experience gained.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a comprehensive revision of section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992, concerning the preparation and maintenance of the register of political parties. Most of the amendments have been sought by the registrar to assist him in carrying out his functions as registrar and to provide for the registration of political party emblems. A review of the conditions for registration are also necessary as registration now covers more than just putting the name of a political party on ballot papers. Registered political parties are entitled to State funding for the administration of the parties if they obtain not less than 2% of first preference votes at a general election. The parties have certain disclosure and other obligations under the Electoral Act, 1997, and have certain rights under the Referendum Acts as regards &ldquo;approved body&rdquo; recognition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The main changes proposed in section 11 to section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992, are: the introduction of criteria which new parties will be required to meet in order to be registered; a party can register an abbreviation, acronym or party emblem; the name of a party cannot exceed six words; a party can apply to amend its name in the register; and an application for registration and amendment of entry in the register will not be effective if the final decision is not given before the movement of the writ or the making of a polling day order.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 devolve power in relation to polling schemes to local authorities. A polling scheme divides a county or county borough into polling districts and appoints a polling place for each polling district for the purpose of holding elections. Under current arrangements, the Minister confirms or otherwise a polling scheme prepared by a local authority and submitted to him. However, this is a function which should be determined locally, where the detailed local knowledge resides, rather than centrally in the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a small but important clarification that a person who reaches 21 years on or before polling day is eligible for nomination for election. The current legislation does not specify the precise date by which a person must reach the age of 21 years. It is desirable to clarify the matter, as a doubt in one case ended up in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23 provide for the inclusion of photographs and political party emblems on ballot papers and related matters. Photographic ballot papers were used for the first time in the June 1999 European elections to give voters additional information to assist them in making their choice. It was also anticipated that the measure would be of assistance to those with low levels of literacy. To assist in the assessment of the use of photographs, I commissioned Lansdowne Market Research to carry out research into the European election experience. The results of its research appeared to confirm anecdotal evidence at the time of the elections and since that people are generally well disposed towards the use of photographs. The survey results revealed that the attitude to their future use was overwhelmingly positive and there was also a fairly strong belief that photographs were of assistance to electors in casting their vote. Likewise, the feedback from people with literacy problems was positive. The Lansdowne report, however, cautioned that the use of photographs could introduce a bias in favour of candidate-centred criteria and I have decided, therefore, to include party emblems as a counterbalance to candidate photographs.</P>
    <P>Section 17 removes an anomaly in relation to the recoupment of deposits and election expenses. At present, an unsuccessful candidate at a Dáil by-election can qualify for the recoupment of his or her election expenses up to £5,000 based on a quarter of what would have been the quota in the constituency had the by-election <Col N="471" /> been a general election. At the same by-election, however, a candidate may not qualify for a refund of their deposit of £300 as this is based on obtaining a quarter of the quota at a by-election. Section 17 will apply the same conditions to both the return of a deposit and the recoupment of expenses to a candidate in a Dáil by-election. Similar amendments are repeated in sections 29, 30 and 31 dealing with the count rules which include provisions for the transfer of votes if it would enable a candidate to qualify for a refund of his or her deposit.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 26 provide that persons who are unable to read or write to the extent of not being able to vote can have a companion vote for them &ndash; at present this facility is confined to electors with physical or sight disabilities. Its extension to persons with literacy problems is justified and will complement the use of photographs and party emblems on ballot papers which will also be of assistance to such electors.</P>
    <P>The proposed change in section 25 is in response to a considerable number of representations I received to the effect that polling day staff who are registered voters in a constituency other than the one in which they are employed are unable to vote. Section 25 will allow such persons to vote by post provided they are included in the supplement to the postal voter's list.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is concerned with the secrecy of the ballot, particularly on islands where there are a small number of voters but also in other areas where there is a small turnout. This section provides that ballot boxes with 50 or less ballot papers should be opened in view of the public, including tally persons, but at a distance to ensure the secrecy of the ballot. Its purpose is to ensure that an agent or other person present at a count cannot identify the preferences of voters whose ballot papers are in a ballot box containing a small number of papers. An agent could surmise how a person voted from local knowledge or from the marked copy of the register of electors. Such a scenario is potentially in conflict with the constitutional requirement that &ldquo;voting shall be by secret ballot&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 33 will allow a registered political party or a non-party candidate to display one poster within 100 metres of a polling station on each approach road but outside the curtilage of the building in which a polling station is located. Complaints were made about the 1992 Act's requirement which prohibits persons from canvassing or interfering with electors within 100 metres of a polling station, to the effect that it is difficult to identify polling stations and this may discourage electors from voting who might find it difficult to locate their polling building. The use of a small number of posters near the polling station may remind electors of the poll as it has been pointed out that polling buildings have become less visible.</P>
    <P>I turn now to one of the more innovative aspects of the Bill, the provision for the introduc<Col N="472" /> tion of electronic voting and counting. As announced in last December's budget, the Government provided £500,000 in 2001 for the first phase of a programme to introduce electronic voting and counting for elections in Ireland. Following extensive research by my Department into available technologies and an international tender competition, a Dutch-UK company, Nedap-Powervote, has been chosen to deliver an electronic system. Phase 1 of the project is under way and will involve extensive testing of voting machines, election management software and PR-STV count software. When testing establishes that the system operates satisfactorily, the Government will consider using the equipment in a number of constituencies at an election or referendum, provided of course the legislative provisions are enacted.</P>
    <P>The Nedap/Powervote solution will provide a large screen voting machine, which is successfully used in the Netherlands and in the German cities of Cologne and Dusseldorf. Election preparation will be run from an industry standard PC system and the completion of the count, using PR-STV, will be carried out on a standard PC and programming unit. The emphasis in the chosen solution is on security and simplicity. The system will be simple to use both for voters and for returning officers and their staff.</P>
    <P>Vital functions will be available for authorised staff only and a new version of the election management software is provided for every election. Electors will register in the normal way at the polling station. They will record their preferences by pressing a designated space beside the candidate's details on the ballot paper displayed on the voting machine and vote by pressing the vote cast button. There is a facility for an elector to correct or change a preference recorded before the vote cast button is pressed. Votes cast are always securely stored in case of a machine or power failure.</P>
    <P>The introduction of electronic voting and counting is a large and challenging project at the end of which, I am confident, we will have a system that will make it easier for the public to vote, provide election results within a few hours of close of poll, improve the efficiency of electoral administration and support a positive image of the country in the use of information technology.</P>
    <P>Sections 35 to 48 provide a statutory framework for the use of electronic voting and vote counting. The number of sections may appear small but Part 3 will be applied along with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, modified as necessary. One of the comments most frequently heard is that elderly electors may have difficulty using the system. Experience elsewhere, and the small pilot study of the Dublin South Central by-election, does not support such worries. If electronic voting is used successfully in countries with large populations and high illiteracy, I have no doubt that the Irish electorate will not have any difficulty with the system. As far as the elector is concerned, he or she will be replacing the use of <Col N="473" /> a pencil for marking preferences with a finger touch. There will be local and national educational and publicity campaigns on the introduction of the system.</P>
    <P>I will table some textual amendments on Committee Stage to the sections in Part 3 to improve the text of the sections as they were drawn up and drafted before the preferred supplier was appointed. The changes will be as a result of discussions with the supplier.</P>
    <P>Despite the innovative measures contained in the Bill, it is fair to say that a small paragraph in Part 4, to which I now want to turn, has attracted the most comment. The Electoral Act, 1997, was amended in 1998 to deal with a number of difficulties that arose in applying its provisions. This is not surprising given the complex reporting and administrative procedures that the legislation entails. The experience gained by the Public Offices Commission since 1997 has, understandably, given rise to a number of further operational difficulties. Section 49 revisits the Electoral Act, 1997, as amended in 1998, to provide for a number of amendments, most of which have been requested by the commission. The changes are listed in the explanatory memorandum and deal mainly with operational difficulties encountered in regard to the application of the legislation. The amendments proposed will help the commission, political parties, public representatives and others in making the legislative provisions work more smoothly.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficulties, I suggest, may not have arisen if the original expenditure limits were set at reasonable levels. Candidates and Members of both Houses should be able to go about their daily business, whether acting as representatives of the people or campaigning at an election, without the need to carry a calculator or engage an accountant to ensure that every penny spent is accounted for. I have, therefore, taken the opportunity in this Bill to revise the expenditure limits at Dáil elections to what I believe are realistic levels. Section 32 of the Electoral Act, 1997, set the original expenditure limits for candidates at a Dáil election at £14,000, £17,000 and £20,000 for a three, four and five seat constituency, respectively. I increased these amounts in line with increases in the CPI on 13 October 1999 to £14,453, £17,550 and £20,648. I have always believed, however, that the original limits were inadequate and I am now proposing to increase them to what I believe are sensible and workable levels of £20,000, £25,000 and £30,000.</P>
    <P>My position on this issue has been consistent. When the Electoral Act, 1997, was being discussed on Committee Stage, I proposed amendments to increase the limits to £20,000, £22,500 and £25,000 which, when updated for increases in the CPI to 2002, are comparable to those I am now recommending. Indeed, the two lower amounts I am now proposing are less than what the updated amounts would be in June 2002 if my original proposed limits had been accepted in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> At that time the Minister refused to accept my amendments replying that the limits in the Bill &ldquo;are reasonable and it will be good for politics and good for our pockets when they are put in place&rdquo;. Interestingly, since those limits were set and in the only practical application of their adequacy, candidates from Opposition parties have exceeded the statutory amounts in no less than three instances in five Dáil by-elections. The House may also be interested to know that the Labour Party had a total spend in those by-elections of £86,925 compared to £86,862 for Fianna Fáil &ndash; not quite the difference that some commentators might have expected.</P>
    <P>The lesson from the experience to date is clear and should be a pointer to what will occur at the first general election where these limits will be applicable. It is important that expenditure limits be set at a level which will permit the running of an effective campaign without the need to engage an army of accountants and financial advisers to keep within unduly restrictive amounts. Following the next general election I do not want Members of the Dáil from any side to be under investigation by the commission for moderate expenditure over the limits, which I am sure would happen were the present amounts to remain. The revised limits I am proposing are based on the principle that an effective election campaign is an essential element in the democratic process. Clearly, the determination of appropriate limits is a matter of judgment. My judgment is that the proposed limits in the Bill are reasonable, balanced and workable and provide an appropriate framework for the regulation of election expenditure.</P>
    <P>I note that one of the criticisms levelled at me was that there was no rationale in the documents released under the Freedom of Information Act for the increased limits I proposed. I have carried out a fairly extensive examination of the files for the 1997 Electoral Act and there is no rationale for the limits set in that Act, except the Minister's own judgment at that time. I say that merely in passing.</P>
    <P>There are some pertinent facts which the Labour Party, and indeed some elements of the media, have overlooked in their comments on the limits proposed and it is important that I put them on the record. I accepted, as did my party, the principle of election expenditure limits in 1997 but at reasonable levels. The inadequacy of the current limits have been demonstrated by the inability of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to remain within them at by-elections.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution, which was sounded in 1997 also. There is a major problem in relation to third party expenditure. There are constitutional issues in relation to imposing limits on third party expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> the right of freedom of expression. My own view, however, is that if a third party campaigns against a candidate, that candidate should have a reasonable opportunity to defend himself or herself within reasonable <Col N="475" /> expenditure limits. The limits I am proposing may not be adequate in such circumstances but they will help, especially when a single advertisement in a newspaper can cost thousands of pounds. While a third party has a constitutional right to freedom of expression, a candidate at an election also has a constitutional right to vindicate his or her good name. For example, the weekend before the next election any group can register with the Public Offices Commission and produce an onslaught in the media or through literature and leaflets, making all sorts of statements in relation to a party or an individual candidate. The issue which arises is whether a candidate has the right to place ads in newspapers to defend and vindicate their good name. It will be interesting if it arises and while I do not want to raise hares about it, it is a possibility. There is already evidence of it in some areas in relation to different issues. There exists a right to freedom of expression, but there also exists the right of a person to vindicate their good name.</P>
    <P>The new limits are the same for all candidates and do not provide additional funds to Fianna Fáil. It is worth emphasising that what Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party are entitled to spend at elections is determined by the number of candidates nominated. It is open to the Labour Party to nominate as many candidates as Fianna Fáil, or more if it wishes.</P>
    <P>Section 50 is largely concerned with consequential amendments to the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997, following the amendments in Part 2 of the Bill. One substantive extra amendment provides for the transfer of responsibility from the Clerk of the Dáil to a chief returning officer for a number of matters at European elections, including forwarding the election results to the European Parliament and receiving, storing and destroying documentation. Essentially, I am restoring the pre-1997 position as the Clerk of the Dáil does not have adequate storage facilities in Leinster House or the resources to meet the various demands that arise from his responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Sections 51 to 54 provide for consequential amendments to the presidential, local election and referendum codes following the amendments in Part 2.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 and 56 make amendments to the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act, 1937, and the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947, to provide for photographs on ballot papers, an edited university register of electors, an advance to the returning officers for their expenses before the election orders are made and for producing the Seanad register of electors in electronic format. Section 56(c) repeals Rule 23 in the First Schedule of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947. The Clerk of the Seanad has requested the repeal of this rule as it cannot be complied with. It was linked with entering numbers on ballot papers, which was terminated in 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I hope to be in a position on Committee Stage to bring forward amendments in relation to the issue of donations. I may also move amendments on Committee Stage to delete the provisions of this Bill in relation to referendums as I may be including these and certain other provisions in a separate referendum Bill subject to the views of the other parties. The Government Whip will be raising this with the other parties this evening.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House can be characterised in two ways &ndash; it is innovative and forward looking in terms of electronic voting and counting, the provision of photographs and party emblems on ballot papers and provision for earlier opening of polling stations. However, it also revisits the existing electoral code to streamline registration arrangements, to clarify provisions in relation to age and eligibility to vote, to expand and update the conditions for registration of political parties and to improve the working of the Electoral Act, 1997, for the Public Offices Commission and elected representatives. Like all politicians and commentators I am concerned at the trend towards declining voter turnout in recent years. We must continually examine the statutory and administrative arrangements in place for elections and remove difficulties where they arise. The Bill addresses such issues and will help to modernise our democracy. Accordingly I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning at the instigation of Senator Costello and members of the Labour Party we asked that the Bill be removed from the business of the House today and returned later. The Bill is in two separate Parts. The first Part is quite good and contains much good housework and tidying up in terms of the Electoral Acts. It has a sexy provision regarding electronic voting which is very attractive to the media and the public and other provisions regarding the register of electors, all of which are worthy of debate in the House. In fact I would have liked the opportunity of talking about the system of electronic voting on its own and how we can ensure people's votes are protected and remain secret. Unfortunately, such issues were used as a subterfuge, a ball of smoke, a sleight of hand, a case of watch my left hand while my right hand is increasing donations. It reminds me of the sausage maker who wants everybody to buy the sausages but does not want them to know how they are made. The Bill is a trojan horse, with attractive provisions to hide Part 4, the miscellaneous section. God may be in the detail but the devil is in the miscellaneous section.</P>
      <P>The first Part of the Bill deals with registration. I would like an opportunity to discuss the abuses which have crept in over the years in terms of the collection of names and how we can ensure the collection of names is correct and that the person collecting them does not have a political bias. I also want to tease out the list system and how the Minister intends introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The Bill allows for a person who was registered in one area to apply to have their name included on a supplementary register in a different area. How do we ensure their name is removed from the first register? What proof is there that the person's name does not appear on both registers? Will there be an indication beside a person whose name appears on a supplementary register saying they were registered elsewhere so the presiding officer can ensure the name no longer appears on the original register? This could be wide open to abuse and I am sure the Minister will answer these questions in his response.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to party emblems and ensure that particular emblems are not used. For example, have we the right through legislation or regulation to prevent the use of extreme right wing logos, such as the swastika, or emblems of extremist movements? Does the Minister ever say a particular emblem should not be used or can anybody just push his case by standing for election? In the past if you wanted cheap advertising and were opening a venue called Discomania, all you needed to do was change your name to Discomania and stand at the local or general election. That would ensure publicity. This practice started with Dublin Bay Loftus but is now used in many areas. I want to ensure we do not have emblems that call on people for revolutionary purposes, either extreme left or right. We have the right to prevent that.</P>
    <P>I move now to the issue of the use of photographs. Regarding the local government Bill, there is debate concerning the possibility of single issue candidates. We can draw a parallel between that and the candidate centred criteria. If somebody is photogenic and somebody else, like myself, is a little battered over time, will there not be a degree of influence in terms of the attractiveness of the photogenic rather than the battered? </P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Senator would walk away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Senator nor I would fit into these categories. We are somewhere in between. There is, however, a more serious aspect that concerns the Seanad. I understand that when the person makes their nomination and pays their deposit the photograph will be attached to the form. In the Seanad elections it may not be so easy because it is not the candidate but the nominating bodies who hand in the nomination papers. This creates another layer to cause confusion.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister propose another way round this? I am sure the Minister with such a well known face and happy smile would beat me hands down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point to consider is that nowadays photographs can be enhanced. A fel<Col N="478" /> low could be given nice clear eyes after a late night.</P>
      <P>Electronic voting is another matter I have questions about. I have a personal rather than academic interest in technology. I am curious to know how this will be introduced and how security will be ensured. If someone walks into a polling station with their sheet of photographs of 12 candidates, will the electronic display also show the candidates? Will there be perhaps photographs on the wall of the 12 candidates which could be tampered with by someone placing them numerically in their own order of merit and leaving them on display for other voters? These details need to be thrashed out.</P>
      <P>The tallymen will be sadly missed when electronic voting is introduced. These extraordinary characters have added excitement over the years with their ability to predict patterns and transfers and explain the nuances of the process. It is also intended to do away with posters and the distribution of leaflets outside polling stations. These changes are dehumanising the election process and the excitement. I hate to see these traditions go. At least we will have our results earlier.</P>
      <P>I wish to return now to the meat and gravy of this Bill and I am sorry that the Bill was introduced in this manner. The general statement in the explanatory memorandum implies there is only good in the Bill. It states that the purpose is to improve the registration of the electoral process; provide for the inclusion of photographs and political party emblems on ballot papers; revise the conditions for registration of political parties; provide for miscellaneous amendments to the Electoral Act, 1992; provide for the use of voting machines and electronic vote counting at elections; and provide for amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997, to improve the operation of that Act. This all seems fairly innocuous but it is not when one turns to the miscellaneous section. God may be in the detail but the devil is in the miscellaneous in section 49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said today that when he checked back on the deciding of the initial amount that could be spent at elections there was no rationale behind it. Does the Minister not consider that it is up to him to introduce a rationale? It is our belief that the initial sum, which in the 1997 Act was £14,000, £17,000 and £20,000, was sufficient. Whoever breaks the limit should be penalised. Penalties are there to be imposed and the degree of penalty could be increased with the amount of expenditure over the limit. In the 1997 Act the limits depend on whether they were three, four or five seat constituencies. If we were to base an increase in limit on the cost of living index the new amounts would be £14,453, £17,550 and £20,648. That is a reasonable increase. The Minister intends to introduce an increase of up to 50%. Who can spend this money? Only those who get it and the largest party will get the most. They will then spend the most and again get the most. Do we forget what is going on in Dublin <Col N="479" /> Castle? We again leave ourselves open to being declared bent, takers and users.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we in the Fine Gael Party have decided that we will not accept any donations from any company, building society or friendly society. In this Bill it is stated that only disclosures of more than £4,000 have to be declared. We are totally against any donations of that nature and we believe smaller donations will enhance democracy. Has the Minister ever seen poison belladonna? It is quite colourful and attractive. It was in a beautiful bottle the only time I ever saw it. Like this Bill, it might have been beautifully packaged but it was still poison. This Bill is poisonous to the belief people have about democracy.</P>
    <P>If we wish to re-establish trust in democracy we should remove this section completely. We should return to the 1997 allowances. Increased allowances will be seen as beneficial only to the largest party. The Minister is aware of this probably more than anyone as he is the financial trustee of the largest party. I ask the Minister to remove the section completely. He said he has advised the House that he hopes to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage regarding donations. Why not have an all-party agreement and then deal with the matter directly at a later date? </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>I am not in the Lower House, not yet and possibly not in the future, depending on my photogenic attractiveness. However, had I been there I would have had something to say about this matter. I plead with the Minister to help remove the public cynicism. Last night I met a young couple, one of whom had been in my college in Galway. She expressed the view that politicians are all on the make and on the take. Because of what is happening in the tribunals and what is happening here today, I was unable to convince her that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister once again to review his position regarding donations and to do the same as everybody else. Let the Government's policies and choice of candidates decide whether it is re-elected. We should not allow corporations with no allegiance to any political viewpoint except their own pockets to make political donations.

      <P>I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad inniu. Táimid buíoch den Aire go bhfuil tús á chur leis an mBille sa Teach seo. I welcome the Bill and am pleased the Seanad has been chosen to debate the Bill in the first instance. Given the tenor of the debate in this House and what has been happening in the Lower House recently, the Bill will receive more considered deliberation here.</P>
      <P>I will take up the point made by Senator Coogan &ndash; no doubt the Labour Party will also take it up &ndash; the issue of integrity in politics. Public service is not held in the esteem to which it is entitled because of various controversies and the need to establish tribunals of inquiry. Feigned indignation and political posturing, particularly during the Order of Business in the Lower House, serves no useful purpose and adds to the cynicism to which Senator Coogan referred.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has made much play about this subject and it is ironic that it has the gall to do so. Its record is unparalleled in politics, with a total disregard for expenditure limits currently in place.</P>

      <P>Every political party has an obligation to act responsibly on such issues. A party whose leader was the recipient of donations to the value of £27,000 in his final year in office and which failed to report a £27,000 donation from SIPTU in 1998 to the Public Offices Commission is not in a position to cast aspersions. All political parties have a case to answer and so have individuals within parties. We are all obliged to ensure that the integrity of politics is restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Attempts to muddy the waters and to confuse the issue of candidates' expenditure limits with corporate donations is disingenuous. People will see through that. Is the Labour Party endeavouring to restrict donations to other left wing parties in the future as it moves towards the right? That does not serve democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that during Committee Stage of this Bill in the Seanad, he will introduce amendments on the subject of donations. I fully respect the right of the Labour Party to have a position on this, but I disagree with it. Political parties should not be 100% funded by the taxpayer and by the Exchequer. A combination of funding is my favoured option and I hope the Minister will impose limitations on the level of donations to be permitted. I hope these will be at realistic levels and that they will not be totally prohibited.</P>
    <P>There is a need to make politics relevant in society, especially in a time of economic growth when our actions contribute to public opinion. I was recently told by a secondary school teacher that he asked the students in an exam class to name the political parties and their leaders. Fianna Fáil was named with Bertie Ahern as leader. Sinn Féin was the second party named with its leader as Gerry Adams. After a considerable pause, the Labour Party was named with its leader as Tony Blair. They could not name any more after that. This is indicative that people are not aware of political parties. We think everyone is interested in politics. I suggest that democracy is a very tender flower which needs to be nourished and pruned from time to time.</P>
    <P>I join Senator Coogan in asking our colleagues in the Labour Party to urge their leader, who seems to be keen to make a political football of this issue, to participate with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the other parties in formulating a common policy on donations. I make that appeal as a rather new Member of this House.</P>
    <P>There are other points of electoral reform which I wish to see included in this Bill. Talk of Dáil reform has arisen because of controversies surrounding the Order of Business. Local government reform is long overdue and I hope the Bill dealing with that will be in this House soon. There is a need to separate local and national politics. A significant shift is needed from the bureaucratic approach in local government to a more democratically-based one. This would help restore the image of politics.</P>
    <P>There are many issues, including whether there should be a change from multi-seat to single-seat constituencies, which are not included in the Bill. I hope they will be addressed in future electoral reform legislation.</P>
    <P>There is recognition in the Bill that Ireland has changed and is now a leader in the technology sector. It is appropriate that we should consider the use of electronic voting in place of the ballot paper. I know the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is keen that this is achieved under the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> In Part 2 of the Bill, the move to introduce an edited register is a good one. Because of the number of mailing lists dealing with different issues, junk mail is now a feature of everyday post and is something we should try to avoid. People should not have to plough through myriad letters and envelopes to get to the issues they are interested in. This edited register will prevent abuse of the system and the Minister was right to provide for it in the Bill. How well it will be policed is another matter.</P>
    <P>I note a suggestion in the Bill which the Minister did not allude to in his speech. This is that the functions of the current registration authority might be transferred to other bodies. If this is the case what expertise will these other bodies have over and above local government systems? There are three years in which to contact all electors before the edited version is published. Perhaps there should be a copyright on published registers and draft registers to add security to the process. People may decide to opt out of the edited register and if that happens the Minister should abolish the edited register so that it is not available.</P>
    <P>There is a procedure to delete out-of-date electoral details and the Minister's liberalisation of the supplementary register is welcome. The purpose of the Bill should be to facilitate those in a position to vote and if the person drafting the register makes a mistake it is important that voters do not suffer as a consequence. Within the supplement of postal voters there is provision for diplomatic and Defence Forces staff, and those provisions are also welcome.</P>
    <P>To register as a political party, current legislation states that members must be over 18 years of age and at least 50% of recorded members must be included in the register of electors. There must be 300 members in the party or alternatively it must have one TD, one MEP, or three local authority councillors. It must also have a constitution or a memorandum of association. I wonder if the figure of 300 members is too low. The proliferation of small parties concentrating on single issues in local areas might not be a great basis for democracy.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill proposes that a person who reaches 21 on or before polling day is eligible for nomination for election. Given the youth of our population and as people have the right to vote at age 18 as well as being legally recognised as adults, there is a case for 18 to be the eligible age to be nominated for election.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the return of deposit in a Dáil by-election similar to that in a general election, and the Minister is to be commended on this change.</P>
    <P>Opening polling booths at 7 a.m. is a good idea. It will facilitate people travelling to work but it raises the issue of proper manning of polling stations. Election day is exceptionally long for polling booth staff and many with experience of election polling know that issues of heating, seating and other arrangements have often been unsatisfactory. Much preparation has been left <Col N="483" /> very late and problems were only addressed following staff complaints on the day of the election. Local authorities who will have responsibility in this area must play their part in addressing these problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in section 24 and section 26 of the Bill but I would enter a caveat where the Bill provides for an illiterate person to avail of a companion to vote. We should be conscious that this is open to abuse and there may be need for a verification process so that the vote cast reflects the view of the voter and not the companion. Those with experience of these cases often wonder if the disabled or illiterate elector's view is correctly represented. I suggest that the residing officer verify that the view of the elector is being fully complied with.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea that voters working in a polling station outside their own constituency will have the opportunity to be on the postal voters' list. I hope this will also apply to urban and local council elections. People who value the franchise and wish to exercise it have often lost their votes due to their work, and this will remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister says about the secrecy of the ballot in section 28, but I have some misgivings. The Bill provides that a ballot box with less than 50 ballot papers will be opened in view of the public, but at a distance to ensure secrecy. There is an area in Donegal where great lengths were taken to determine the direction of one vote, but I will not relate that anecdote here. It might be very difficult to determine whether a person properly marks the ballot paper unless they put an identifying mark as to how they voted.</P>
    <P>The tallying of votes is of assistance to the democratic process and to political parties, and with electronic voting there will be a return from each polling station which would clearly identify the number of votes received in each of the polling stations or ballot boxes. The current tallying exercise undertaken by all major parties will continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in section 33 from a position where no posters are allowed adjacent to a polling station. This creates a less than active environment around polling stations on election day and has given rise to a measure of apathy among potential voters. One poster may not be sufficient. I suggest that up to three would be best as often there will be different approaches to the polling station. Anything that ensures a greater profile for an election and entices or encourages people to vote is welcome.</P>
    <P>I would go further and support a penalty for those who do not vote. People gave their lives so that we might enjoy freedom and democracy and the least voters can do is exercise their franchise. There should be as many inducements as possible to encourage voting.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 47, one of the vagaries in the current system is the mix and the random selection of papers for transfers, particularly for <Col N="484" /> surpluses. With a computer system, it should be possible to eliminate that completely to reflect the precise composition of the votes and the onward preferences. The software should enable that calculation to be done.</P>
    <P>The miscellaneous section has come in for adverse comment. Some aspects are to be welcomed. Extending the number and types of statements the public offices commission can return for correction of minor errors or omissions is good. There should be some flexibility in that.</P>
    <P>The provision that persons should act in accordance with guidelines issued is essential and is now to be enshrined in legislation. The Minister made a very good point about third party expenditure in the context of election expenditure not being regarded as a donation and this will be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a downward trend in the turnout at polls. We have seen this to some extent with referenda where an energetic case put by politicians is almost neutered and there is now just a debate by somebody for and somebody against. This has led to confusion and impacted on the interest in a referendum.</P>
    <P>The amount of £30,000 needs to be viewed in the context of the Dáil election being the most important. It is the one that decides who will govern and that impacts on every citizen. A European Parliament election has a limit of £150,000. Admittedly the constituency is bigger, but there is not the same level of competition. There are no limits on local government elections. The limits which are mentioned are reasonable but they may not be high enough.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sure that we will be able to further examine the detailed issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to this Bill as being innovative and forward looking. I agree. I have listened very carefully to the Minister and there were some aspects that I had not noticed or understood before. I am particularly impressed that the university Seanad register will be in electronic form. I was impressed with the way the Minister explained the ability to use electoral lists in general for commercial purposes with the option for individuals to exclude themselves. I am one who in business terms has used that list over the years. I am also one who has received what others, before I became chairman of An Post, used to refer to as junk mail. There we refer to it as direct marketing. Using lists like that it is possible to identify whether something was coming from the electoral list or whether it was a genuine letter.</P>
      <P>The right for someone with reading difficulty to be accompanied was referred to by Senator Walsh. I agree with him. We must be very careful about this. The secret ballot was established more that 130 years ago and we must ensure that there is no repeat of the abuse when the first Irish voters went to the polls knowing that their landlords could watch whom they voted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> We recently mentioned age discrimination in this House. I am delighted that people can now vote on their 18th birthday and that it is possible to stand for election at 21. Some of my children had difficulty voting because an election occurred in that in-between period. I think the Constitution states that a person needs to be aged at least 35 to stand for President and 21 for other elections. I am not sure if that really stands up any more. We do not have the right to say we know what age a person should have attained to be elected. Such conventions are from the past. I agree with the Minister that the new provisions are innovative and forward looking.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill makes provision for electronic voting. While welcoming electronic voting in principle, I have grave doubts about whether the full impact of this revolutionary change is appreciated. We run the risk of messing the whole thing up through insufficient preparation.</P>
    <P>I make a plea to consolidate all our electoral legislation. This Bill makes massive changes to several electoral Acts. It does so in the usual way, by means of amendments. What we have is what I call the patchwork quilt where we legislate by making changes on changes on changes. The original legislation is then virtually smothered under all the amendments.</P>
    <P>During the Order of Business today, I asked the Leader to take into account the document published yesterday by the Law Reform Commission on statutory drafting and interpretation &ndash; Plain Language and the Law. At the request of the Attorney General, I spoke some months ago at an international conference at Dublin Castle on the topic of making language more easily read and understood and accessible to the public. If ever something should be accessible to the public, it is the area of electoral law.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where we could benefit from consolidating legislation, for example family law. There is a special reason for doing so in this case. Electoral law unlike other types of law is a highly practical thing. The Electoral Acts are actually used in real life to make important decisions by people who are not lawyers. I am talking mainly about returning officers. These laws need to be consulted by people who are affected by the decisions returning officers make, the candidates in elections, their agents and their helpers. When we pass an Electoral Act we are not just creating another tome to gather dust on a lawyer's shelf, we are creating a handbook that will have to be consulted, usually in a great hurry, by people within a wide range of legal ability.</P>
    <P>When I first ran for the Seanad election in 1992, I went to register and one of the other candidates discovered that he had not read the details correctly. I had to propose him, even though I was opposing him. This person was a professor who should have been well able to handle it, yet that sort of thing can happen.</P>
    <P>In this case, above all others, we should aim to bring together our electoral law between the covers of one single Electoral Act. We should not <Col N="486" /> send people on a wild goose chase looking at a series of amendments. I do not blame the Minister for not doing this now. I would prefer to see this Bill go through. However, the Minister should take up this challenge. As an important aspect of democracy, the law relating to the central democratic act, our electoral process, should be simple, clear and accessible.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill proposes to delegate to the Minister the power to amend by order several Electoral Acts, other than the principal Act, to bring them in line with the changes that this Bill proposes to the principal Act. That is a step too far. The purpose of delegating powers in legislation is to allow Ministers to regulate the details of implementing a policy and a framework that the legislation sets out.</P>
    <P>This is different from giving a Minister power to amend primary legislation by way of order. I am sure the House will vigorously resist such an attempt to circumvent its powers and the powers of the other House and will insist that the place to amend the other Acts is in this Bill, not by orders made by a Minister under the Bill. I recall the fuss Senators correctly made during the debate on the restatement of legislation Bill which gives the Attorney General unlimited powers, including the power to print consolidated versions of Acts. Section 48 is much wider-reaching than it needs to be and is a step too far.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the substance of Part 3 which makes provision for electronic voting. Senators who are aware of my enthusiasm for the information age will no doubt expect me to welcome this development with open arms. While I welcome it, I do so with caution as I am not convinced that the implications and practicalities have been fully thought through. I wish to look at the issue from two perspectives, first, a conceptual viewpoint and, second, the practical viewpoint of making it happen in real life with real people. Both perspectives offer food for thought.</P>
    <P>At a conceptual level, what we are talking about is not a shift from paper-based voting to electronic voting. What is really at stake is a move from voting with an audit trail to voting without an audit trail. That is the basic difference. Let us consider the present system, old fashioned as it is. Its key characteristic is the physical existence of a vote on a piece of paper which is tracked at every single stage. Before a vote becomes a vote, it is counted in the sense that the number of ballot papers is carefully controlled. The issue of each piece of paper is recorded and takes place in full public view. A vote becomes a vote when a voter records his or her choice on that physical piece of paper. The voter can look at the paper and handle it before giving it up to confirm that the paper reflects his intentions. The fact that the vote is secret does not mean that it disappears from view. It is counted going into the ballot box and again when it is being taken out and it is guarded while it is in the box. The counting takes place in public so that everyone can see it and if <Col N="487" /> there has to be a recount the physical evidence is there to do it.</P>
    <P>The entire process is so open and visible that the voter has total trust in the integrity of the system. To the best of my knowledge nobody has ever questioned the integrity of the balloting. Any accusations of fraud generally centre around the issue of personation, using a dead person's name etc. No one has sought to question the integrity of the ballot process. The fundamental reason for this is the existence of a physical audit trail from start to finish. Our unquestioning trust in the system rests on that foundation.</P>
    <P>In the 1965 or 1967 election &ndash; I cannot remember the year &ndash; Eugene Timmons won a seat on the 14th count by four votes. Two friends joined my wife and me in casting our votes. When we heard that Eugene Timmons had won by four votes we felt pleased that our four votes had counted, that is until we discovered the following day that the two women had voted one way while the two men had voted another way. The point is that there was a piece of paper which could be repeatedly recounted on that occasion. I physically create my vote by marking the ballot paper and from that moment on the ballot is handled in a way which virtually eliminates the possibility of fraud or error. There is no fraud because the ballot is watched over, while there is no error because the raw material is there to recount if there is any question of doubt.</P>
    <P>I want to compare that system with the one being put in place. Under the new system a voter will indicate choices by pressing the relevant parts of a touchable screen &ndash; I assume that is how it will work &ndash; and these presses will be electronically recorded on a medium such as a cassette or cartridge. The voter will not see the record and he must trust the technology to ensure that his voting intentions are fully and correctly recorded. There is no feedback, confirmation or guarantee that the voter's intentions have been properly translated into digital impulses. There is not even one of the notorious &ldquo;hanging chads&rdquo; to chew over &ndash; I only heard the term for the first time in December in regard to what happened in Florida &ndash; because there is no punchcard for a chad to hang on to. Our confidence has been shaken by what happened in Florida, but at least those chads existed and could be checked. I do not understand why they did not check every single one of them, but clearly the Americans have a different system. The case was made and the secretary of state for Florida decided that only a certain number had to be counted. At least it is possible to examine these chads and decide the voters' intentions.</P>
    <P>Under the new system the moment of truth, the instance of voting, will disappear into a black hole and, to the best of my knowledge, it can never be retrieved from it. The Bill provides for detailed regulations for the care of the recording medium before and after the voting has taken place. The regulations will ensure that the counting process <Col N="488" /> can be done repeatedly. However, it does not provide for any means &ndash; I stand to be corrected &ndash; to allow us to inspect whether the translation of the voter's intentions into digital impulses was properly carried out. The new system will require an act of faith that the current system does not require.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people will make this act of faith but whether they are right to do so is another matter. Nobody who has ever been involved in the commissioning of a major computer system would put much faith in any system ever getting it perfectly right on the first occasion. Developing software is notoriously a matter of trial and error. However, in most projects it is possible to build in space to undo mistakes. The Minister spoke with confidence about what will happen, but I wonder whether that space will be built into this project.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in <i>The New York Times</i>, Edward Tenner, a researcher at Princeton University, stated: &ldquo;Many independent voting security specialists doubt that any electronic system can be both secure and anonymous&rdquo;. He was making the point that the audit trail an ATM machine creates as a back-up against fraud is not possible in a secret ballot. Maybe we can prove him wrong, but this is also my concern. Electronic voting systems are, therefore, inherently open to fraud since a fraudster could easily bury among several thousand lines two lines of code which would affect the way votes are recorded. I am not so worried about fraud as I am a trusting person and am sure nobody here would attempt this. I am, however, scared stiff about the possibility of mistakes being buried in the software.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me shift perspective and raise a totally different set of concerns from the practical, human and usability dimension I covered earlier. For more than 25 years, I have sat down once a week with a group of customers who very generously tell me what my company is doing wrong. They tell me about small practical issues relating to trolleys, queueing and the way in which goods are displayed and offered. Whatever some people might think, I am not totally stupid. One would think that after 25 years I would not have to go back to customers week after week and ask what are we doing wrong. However, the truth is we keep making mistakes all the time. We keep making mistakes because it is virtually impossible to anticipate exactly how things will work out in practice. We design something using the best knowledge available to us yet, from a user's perspective, it always looks different. Matters we think might cause problems turn out to be no problem, other matters where we see no problem turn out to be real sticky points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this to emphasise just how steep the learning curve will be for voters during the transition from the present voting system to electronic vot<Col N="489" /> ing. We need to have the system thoroughly tested from a usability point of view and we then need to invest massively in educating people to come to terms with the new approach. The approach will neither be quick nor easy. It will be much more difficult than just signing a cheque for the machinery. I am not implying the Minister suggested that would be the case because he certainly went further than leading us to believe that it is just a matter of ordering the equipment.</P>
    <P>We must introduce electronic voting in a way that will make it equally acceptable to everyone, whether young, old, a technical whiz kid or mechanically averse. I am old enough to recall when ATMs were introduced. Older people would not touch them and would prefer to go inside the bank to cash their cheques, as they had always done. A number of them still do that. I believe there will be no choice in this instance. We expect people to adopt the new technology regardless of whether they like it. All the more reason, therefore, to invest in getting it right the first time.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Walsh referred to the disappointingly downward trend in turnover in politics, therefore, one of the objectives is to ensure we overcome that. I fear that if electronic voting is such that it turns off those who are computer averse, we may discourage people from voting. I appreciate that during the break the Minister's advisers gave me an opportunity to look at a sample of how the electoral system will work. I was impressed because it answered some of the concerns I expressed before lunch. One of the challenges for us is to ensure we do not dissuade or discourage some who might have voted from doing so. We must ensure we take all the steps in a logical and careful way and in a manner we are fairly sure will work. I do not know the history of this in countries with similar systems to ours because our PR system is probably different from most. Therefore, it may be that we are the guinea pigs in this area. I fear the assumption that technology always works first time.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he called a forward looking and innovative concept. I believe a great deal in the Bill is worthwhile. The words I used indicate this but they also suggest where we might be able to improve the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan said it was a sleight of hand type of Bill and that the Minister was trying to hoodwink people. The document is in black and white and can be read quite easily. The legislation to change the voting system while at the same time increase the amount of expenditure one can spend during an election campaign is quite open and transparent. I do not see any three card tricks or underhand tactics being used. It was very unfair for anyone to make such a comment in this <Col N="490" /> House. All the print is the same size and we can all read it.</P>
    <P>There was mention of other legislation being introduced in the dark of night. Recently legislation relating to the increase in the salaries of TDs, Senators and public servants was introduced at 7 p.m. Everyone said this was rushed through at the last minute. I do not know what time of day these announcements should be made; perhaps we should pick a time of the day to make announcements on every issue. Twelve o'clock, whether day or night, might be a good time to make all these announcements and no one could say they are being hoodwinked. It is totally unfair to make these allegations.</P>
    <P>Almost two years ago, I fought a local election, following which I had to submit my statement of expenditure. I did so quite openly. During that local election campaign I spent in the region of £4,500. To be limited to £14,000, including what headquarters might spend, is very little. I believe the Minister has not gone far enough in relation to what one might spend during an election campaign, given the cost of posters and other literature. Perhaps people are not submitting all their costs. The Minister is proposing to increase the expenditure limit to £20,000, £22,000 and £25,000, which is reasonable. Other parties say that just because Fianna Fáil puts up more candidates they get a bigger slice of the cake. There is nothing stopping other parties from putting up whatever number of candidates they wish. It is an open democracy and parties can put up as many candidates as they wish. Fianna Fáil assesses the situation and decides to put up what it believes is the correct number of candidates to fight an election campaign in each constituency. That is very open and democratic.  </P>
    <P>On the Order of Business the Labour Party criticised the proposed expenditure limits in the Bill, yet in the last three by-elections it was the only party to break financial guidelines. It is ridiculous to suggest that the biggest party can buy votes by spending more money. The Labour Party candidate won the 1990 presidential election despite the fact that it spent only a fraction of the amount spent by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, although it secured much free advertisement from various sections of the media which the other parties had to pay for.</P>
    <P>There is much in the Bill I welcome. However, like Senator Quinn, I am concerned about the proposals on electronic voting. This must be given careful consideration and, if adopted, the proper procedures must be in place. It should be used on a trial basis for a by-election. The recent experience in the US is not encouraging. In the most advanced country in the world dispute centred on the status of chads on ballot papers in the Florida count of the presidential election.</P>
    <P>The hand counting system has been honourable and effective and I compliment all those involved in it. I was involved in the count in the North Kerry constituency during the 1987 general election when, after two recounts, a mere four <Col N="491" /> votes separated Deputy Spring from the late Tom McEllistrim. We were able to analyse the votes as they were counted, including the spoiled votes. Each candidate had a representative present and the count was open and transparent. If the result in other constituencies were to be as close as that we must be satisfied that the electronic method of counting is accurate and satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to include photographs of candidates on ballot papers and to provide for a new edited version of the register of electors to be produced on a supplementary list. That is important because registers are not being kept up to date. They often overlook population movement from one constituency to another.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 26 make provision for the use of a companion voter by people who are unable to read or write to the extent of not being able to vote. At present this facility is confined to electors with physical or sight disabilities. I am concerned that a companion of an illiterate elector may not vote as instructed. Normally disabled or physically handicapped voters are accompanied by neighbours and the voting takes place in accordance with the rules. I have been involved in many elections and have rarely seen a companion vote gerrymandered.</P>
    <P>This and other provisions make it easier for people to vote, unlike in the past where the register of electors had to be scrutinised to ensure that all eligible voters were registered. For example, when people reach the age of 18 years they are now automatically included on the register by the local authorities and people moving to live in another constituency can register at their local post office.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister intend to operate the supplementary postal voters list? It is a good idea and should work well. He indicated that the proposed change, provided for in section 25, was made in response to the considerable number of representations he received. What proposals are envisaged to deal with people who work away from their constituencies, such as truck drivers?</P>
    <P>Previous legislation rightly prohibited party supporters soliciting votes outside polling stations and stipulated that election posters should be kept a minimum of 100 metres away from polling booths. The Minister has indicated that he favours a relaxation of this rule, especially where polling stations are located in big towns and cities, on the basis that voters may be unaware of their location. This should not be overplayed. It would be wrong if there was a return to a bombardment of election literature outside polling stations. Perhaps a restriction of one poster per party or candidate could be imposed, although that may create difficulties where a party has a number of candidates. The Minister needs to give this issue careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, including the proposals on expenditure limits. They are badly needed. It is unrealistic to fight elections, even local elections, on small budgets. Gone are the days of relying on <Col N="492" /> budgets of £300 or £400 or relying on farmers to take time off to canvass. We must adopt to modern realities, when electioneering has become more professional and the emphasis has shifted to communication by post, advertisements and leaflet distribution. Daily contact is being eroded.</P>
    <P>People should be allowed conduct their campaigns as they see fit and in this context the expenditure proposals in the Bill are modest. I welcome the Bill and I look forward to contributing further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this mainly good Bill has been marred by the insertion of section 49 which proposes to greatly increase expenditure limits. Many aspects of the Bill are to be welcomed, including the proposal to improve the registration of electors' process, to provide for the inclusion of photographs and political party emblems on ballot papers and to revise the conditions for the registration of political parties. That is the way to proceed in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The provision to allow for the earlier opening of polling stations is also welcome. Given the recent American experience, there may be doubts about the use of voting machines and electronic vote counting in statutory elections. It is anticipated that voting machines, except for postal and special votes, will replace paper ballots while the manual count of ballot papers will be replaced by computer software. On balance that is to be welcomed. The more traditional among us will probably greatly regret the passing of the tallymen and the good humoured banter associated with counts. However, this is the way we have to move and we will get it right just as we got counts right in the past with the use of tallymen. We will adapt. There may be some teething problems, but they will be surmounted. I welcome those provisions.</P>
      <P>The donations issue is the most crucial and most important matter on the political agenda at present. There is no doubt that there is a widespread belief that contributions from the corporate sector have influenced policy in favour of the interests of those who contribute and to the detriment of the interests of the wider public. That is something about which all politicians must rightly be concerned. One of the key lessons to be learned from the work of the tribunals, if nothing else, is that politics has to get rid of corporate donations. Ideally, we should collectively draw this line. I am sure the decent people in all the parties would subscribe to the view that politics must be seen to be clean, as anything else is to dishonour our democracy. I was glad to note recently that Deputy Fleming fully supports the banning of corporate donations and I look forward to his contribution when this Bill reaches the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State contributes about £3 million annually to the funding of political parties. An appropriate increase in that figure would compensate for a total ban on corporate donations. There is such <Col N="493" /> public outcry about donations that I am sure the majority would accept increased State funding of our democracy. The perception is &ndash; I am sure this was the reality in the past &ndash; that companies and individuals involved in them always got something in return for their corporate donations. There is an old saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune, and I have no doubt there was an element of that. Is the Minister happy that this proposed measure will allow his party to spend about £3 million or an estimated £1 million extra in the next election?</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from an article in the opinion column in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 24 January 2001 on funding politics. It stated:</P>
    <P>But the evidence that has been emerging from Dublin Castle and the work of the Moriarty and Flood tribunals about the grubby interface between business and politics has generated public pressures and concerns that cannot be ignored. The political mantra &ldquo;no favours asked and none given&rdquo; no longer satisfies the public. The very existence of large corporate donations is regarded as suspicious in a climate where politics and its public image require urgent refurbishment.</P>
    <P>We must restore trust in politics and I very much admire the stance taken by Deputy Noonan, the leader of Fine Gael, on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from saying it, I believe it. Those who know me will know that I have been preaching this for some time &ndash; I would say, since I came into this House. I do not know why any party fears treading the country on the small contributions of ordinary people. I pose the following question to the Minister. Does his party wish to be seen to fund its next campaign with the help of large corporate donations? This would be akin to putting one's hand in the jaw of the tiger and I would not recommend it.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote from another opinion column in <i>The Irish Times </i>of Wednesday, 14 February 2001 on business and politics. It stated:</P>
      <P>It is time the Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, recognised the unambiguous message that has come from the work of the various tribunals at Dublin Castle and cut the umbilical cord between business and politics. During the course of the last fours years, the public has been appalled by a succession of disclosures made to the McCracken, Moriarty and Flood tribunals about political donations, the buying of political influence, the rezoning of land and the subversion of the planning and political systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the response of the political establishment has been slow and grudging. That is to be expected, given that corporate funding has traditionally conveyed a considerable advantage to the largest and most business-friendly parties. But times and circumstances change. Democratic politics is now under such threat <Col N="494" /> from a public perception of sleaze and corruption that nothing less than a clean break will do.</P>
    <P>As we can see, the tide of public opinion is flowing very strongly against corporate funding. I note that my fellow county man, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, recently acknowledged the shadowy role of big business in politics.</P>
    <P>I again quote from that article in the opinion column of <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 14 February 2001 on business and politics. It stated:</P>
    <P>Enough is enough. This issue is far too important to be treated as a political football. The public is punch-drunk from revelations of backstairs dealings and corrupt payments in the political and planning arenas. There is a crisis of confidence in the democratic system. And there is a need for a comprehensive renewal of Irish politics. Introducing new disclosure and donation limits for the corporate sector &ndash; as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats propose &ndash; would not clear the fog of suspicion that has invested this grey interface between politics and business. The clearest and simplest solution would be to ban all corporate and foreign donations, as with the Quebec system in Canada, while capping contributions from party supporters and making up any shortfall through State funding. Already, the State provides about £3m in political funding through leaders' allowances and election spending. It would be a simple matter to add to that and it is highly unlikely there would be any Constitutional complications. Tricking around with a discredited system, while attempting to distract public attention by attacking Fine Gael, does not wash. The Government should recognise its responsibilities and end corporate funding.</P>
    <P>Surely, the Minister must accept that we must now end the potential to corrupt the political process by banning all corporate donations. The Minister, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government bear a heavy responsibility to get this matter right and to be seen to give leadership and do the right thing. Politics must be renewed and democracy must be properly restored.</P>
    <P>In many respects, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been a reforming Minister. He has made many worthwhile reforms and has more in mind in the local government Bill which is about to be brought before both Houses. However, that makes it all the more difficult to understand his thinking on this proposal. No rationale has been provided for this proposal. I would say to the Minister that the public will think the Government is seeking these huge increases to buy votes, thereby increasing its dependency on wealthy donors. I urge the Government to desist from this course of action and bring about an immediate change. The Minister said something about possible amendments on Committee Stage. I hope the <Col N="495" /> Government will take on board the widespread views and fears that exist and which will further discredit politics. I do not think any of us in this profession want to point-score on this issue and I hope we will not do so. I sincerely hope the Government will make the appropriate changes which will meet the circumstances of the time so that we can go forward in a clear and clean way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who has been to the House on several occasions. A lot of changes have been made in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which have not been mentioned, but I suppose they will be on Committee Stage. The first things that come to my mind when we speak about an electoral Bill are the register, voting, the rules and regulations, the small poll and so on. I can never understand why the register is not accurate. Why on the day of the election do I find my friends saying they are not on it? I suppose it is my fault as well as everyone else's that there are quite a number of people not registered. If this happens in small country towns, what is it like in cities? Enumerators are employed by our county council, people such as retired gardaí or teachers who know everybody in the parish.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to keep up with people coming of age. People who leave to work in other parts of the country may be permanently away in the eyes of the enumerators but in fact return on a weekly basis. One must be vigilant. A member of my family was taken off the register. I had to explain that he returned home every weekend and that his permanent address was in Dingle, though it might be easier for him to stay in Galway and vote for Senator Coogan. The Senator would probably like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is awkward if voting takes place on Thursday and someone working in Galway wishes to vote at home in Dingle. He has to travel down and back. We should look into the proper registering of voters.</P>
      <P>Some welcome changes have been introduced over the last couple of years. When an election is called there is an opportunity to check whether someone is on the register and if not to include them. One of the most welcome factors is that the presiding officer, secretary and polling staff come from outside a community. I always though it was a fairer system where staff came from a different part of a county, but they lost their right to vote. The Minister has provided for staff to have the right to vote wherever they are working on the day of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about using the register for commercial purposes. He does not say that he wants to use it that way but I would ban anyone from using the register for anything other than voting. It is totally wrong. Like most Irish homes, <Col N="496" /> my own receives five or six pieces of junk mail every day. Letters inform you before you even open them that you have won £40,000. If you follow that up you will end up buying something because that is part of the deal. The register should therefore not be used apart from for voting, excepting certain legal instances like the area of passports.</P>
    <P>I have seen an example of how the electronic voting system works. People look at the system in the way I looked at the first car I bought that had no place for a starting handle. At that time people were so used to having cars with run-down batteries that they would automatically start them with the handle. Without the handle I asked myself how I was to start the car. Then I started relying on the battery. You could take that a step further by looking at parking. People have to put their money into a vending machine, press the right button and get their ticket. Therefore I see no problem with an electronic system such as I have seen which displays a photograph of the candidate.</P>
    <P>Of course we will all miss the day of the count. That was always the best day in my life. Elections to me were the day of the count, not the rest of it. The best fun we got was in being so accurate in the tally down to couple of hundred votes. I am reliably informed that in the new electronic system each polling booth will give an accurate read-out of what each candidate got. That will be better for each party because up to now if there were a bad vote for Fianna Fáil in a booth that I was counting there was no way I was going to up it in favour of my view.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of electronic voting. It would be no harm to hold a mock election. There are issues in a lot of towns that people are trying to resolve with votes and plebiscites. That would be one way of introducing the system.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems is the decreasing turn-out at the polls. The interest in voting does not seem to be there. This is down to the failure to bring in a reasonably compulsory voting system. I regularly visit Crete and was there during an election. One man there nearly broke his neck trying to get to the polls. I asked him what difference it would make if he missed a vote. He said it was the law that if he did not vote and sought unemployment benefit or a driving licence he would not get it. If you have not voted you do not belong to the system. That is what I was told.</P>
    <P>We should look into that. I have a feeling that quite a number of the unemployed do not vote. In my town they do not. Some of the people who benefit most from political representation seem to be those least inclined to vote and we must consider ways of encouraging them to do so.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition look across at this side of the House and urge Fianna Fáil to ban corporate donations as if they never accepted such donations. What has funded political parties over the years? I will accept any changes made in this area but we must be honest and accept that political parties must be funded. I wish Deputy <Col N="497" /> Noonan &ndash; whose wife I believe once voted for me in Castlemaine &ndash; well in his new role as Leader of the Fine Gael Party. It is unrealistic to expect ordinary people to provide donations up to £1,000. In south Kerry, we collect between £10 and £100 from members of the party who wish to contribute.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas Members receive requests in the post on a daily basis to contribute to a race night in Donegal or some other function in Sligo. I wrote cheques totalling more than £700 in January alone, all for very worthy causes. However, I cannot afford to do this. Politicians are constantly targeted by organisations ranging from the St. Vincent de Paul Society to local schools. I am not targeted because I am Tom Fitzgerald; I am targeted because I am a Senator. Why should politicians have to use their salaries, to which they are entitled, to try to get re-elected? We must devise means of ensuring that a reasonable amount of money is set aside for people who wish to contest an election. I feel very strongly about this issue. I do not want to talk about hypocrisy but all politicians are in the same boat and require money to fund their election campaigns, however small. People running for election to an urban council, town commission or county council should be funded.</P>
    <P>I urge all of the political parties to come together on this issue without any preconceived agenda. The differences between parties should be explored in an attempt to iron out the problems which exist. We would not have peace in Northern Ireland but for the fact that members of political parties there sat around the table together, having sworn they would not look at each other or shake hands with each other, never mind talk to each other. Great progress has been made in the North as a result of their discussions.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that Deputies and Senators who argue with each other in the Chambers can subsequently go to the Dáil bar and enjoy a pint together. The funding of political parties is an important issue. Members of the media are going totally overboard in regard to the funding of political parties and the branding of politicians. I have heard and read in the various media that all politicians are crooked; that is a very unfair comment. People in all walks of life behave improperly but that does not mean anyone in this House is doing wrong. It seems to me that political parties are merely throwing mud at each other in an attempt to curry political favour and that is a sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I hope all political parties can come together around the table and agree that a reasonable level of funding will be provided to election candidates. Election expenses should be jointly funded by the State and through fund raising efforts. I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann, believing that the pro<Col N="498" /> posals in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, providing for an increase of up to 50% in the amount that may be spent by candidates at a general election and which will allow the Fianna Fáil Party to spend almost £1m. extra, will seriously undermine the reforms introduced in the Electoral Act, 1997, encourage the wasteful expenditure of money at elections, and further undermine public confidence in the political system, declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech and the contributions of Senators on the Government side, one might be forgiven for thinking that this Bill is purely a technical amendment to the 1997 legislation, designed to facilitate the introduction of electronic voting, curtail the number of posters outside polling stations, etc. Until recently, we believed that was the Minister's intention but this Bill clearly represents a fundamental shift in electoral law as it has been constructed in recent years. That electoral law was passed as part of a package of measures to modernise our democracy and make it accountable and fair but this Bill fundamentally alters the spirit of ethics and accountability legislation and is a major policy shift. We should not be surprised.</P>
    <P>The Government obviously feels it must introduce this legislation. The Minister believes he is restoring an equilibrium but his version of equilibrium gives Fianna Fáil an advantage over other political parties when it comes to a general election. It is interesting to note that no general election has been fought under the terms of the 1997 legislation. By-elections were, however, fought under its provisions in which, for the first time, there was an level playing field. I do not need to rehearse the results of those by-elections.</P>

      <P>I will come to that in a moment. I am tired of listening &ndash; and I will be gentle in this remark &ndash; to totally misleading statements by members of the Opposition who are clearly in such a pathetic position that all they can do is suggest that minor overspends are major breaches of the law, which they are not. A £200 overspend hardly compares with an extra £1 million in the Fianna Fáil coffers to spend on a general election. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about Fianna Fáil restoring its strong, unfair position in a general election and, in so doing, undermining our democracy and the framework of ethics and accountability put in place in this House mostly at the behest of the Labour Party and against a continuing background of revelations of connections between business and politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked on the Order of Business whether we had any regard for what is happening in the real world, and in particular in Dublin Castle. Clearly those on the other side of the House do not. They <Col N="499" /> see the tribunals as an unwelcome but necessary investigation.</P>

      <P>I took note of Senator Walsh's remark that tribunals were set up to ensure that politicians adhered to standards. I would remind him that they were set up to investigate certain matters. It is up to those of us in this House to construct the framework of standards in public office, but we are not doing that. With this legislation we are setting aside a set of principles which we put in place in the past ten years specifically designed to combat the golden circle of business in politics and to establish a clear space between business and politics. That is what is necessary to underline our democracy, not undermine it.</P>
      <P>We are fundamentally opposed to this legislation which is not about electoral reform, electronic voting, posters outside election stations or who should have access to electoral registers. Let us stop pussyfooting about this matter. Let us be absolutely clear what this legislation is about. It is about giving Fianna Fáil an unfair advantage.</P>

      <P>That Fianna Fáil is attempting to enshrine this outrageous undermining of democracy in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill shows how deliberately unseeing it is to the public reaction regarding golden circles and business funding on display in Dublin Castle every day of the week.</P>
      <P>I have spoken about the background to the Bill. The fact that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, should have been so sparing in his information with regard to his intentions on this legislation up to his publication of it strikes us as strange. Last October the Taoiseach said, in reply to a question on the Order of Business on this matter, that the Bill would make simple amendments to electoral legislation such as photographs on ballot papers and so on. Even at that stage in October, no hint was being given of the bombshell this Bill was to contain. We would go as far as saying that since last autumn the Taoiseach and the Minister effectively decided to keep this information to themselves and to hide it from the Dáil and the public, yet documents released since then under the Freedom of Information Act show that the Minister had every intention of increasing the limits as far back as February 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the changes in this legislation are anything but minor. The Bill passed in 1997 allowed for indexation for inflation and so on and despite the fact that we have higher inflation than <Col N="500" /> we would want, the increases contained in the Bill are well beyond that and beyond what is required on the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Walsh's comments are getting a little worn. As the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, rightly pointed out, the Minister who introduced the original legislation in 1997 refused to accept amendments to increase the limits because he said the limits were reasonable, good for politics and good for our pockets, which the current limits clearly are not. The Minister said in the House this morning that he had always believed the original limits were inadequate, and he did not need any other justification. As the freedom of information request showed, there were no other justifying arguments in the files. The Minister clearly believed from 1997 that the original limits were inadequate and it was always his intention to increase them. He did not need any justification so he just went ahead and increased them. However, those increases will have the effect of eliminating the level playing pitch and giving the larger party, Fianna Fáil, an unfair advantage.</P>
      <P>For instance, in a three seat constituency such as my own in Tipperary North, the limit would increase from just over £14,500 as it currently stands to £20,000. We have already done our budgeting for the next election and we are happy that we can operate within those limits and run an effective campaign but we will not waste money. We will not engage in last minute vitriolic attacks by virtue of leaflets, etc., on our rivals and the other candidates nor will we lash out money on a slush fund basis around the constituency as Fianna Fáil generally likes to do, and we will not buy votes. A limit of £20,000 will generate wasteful spending and will allow that margin for vote buying. The Bill is clearly designed to do that.</P>
      <P>The other provision in the Bill, which I consider to be an insidious amendment to the original 1997 legislation, is what the explanatory memorandum calls clarification that minor expenditure is expenditure not exceeding £100 in any one payment. It is creating a situation where any number of unlimited £100 payments can be made without recording and without having to be disclosed. That is one of the most abhorrent elements of this legislation because that is where the slush fund really operates. That is where someone can really go to town on vote buying exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to tell the Minister or any other Member of this House the kind of practices we have seen taking place at election time, where drink is bought wholesale in pubs, bills are paid <Col N="501" /> for people in households and various other practices that are engaged in to create an unfair advantage and buy votes. Is that good for politics? It is not. That provision, which is anything but a clarification, seems to be designed specifically to allow for the throwing around of money at election time and is an invidious element to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate aspect of this is that there are some welcome provisions in the Bill, such as the introduction of electronic voting, which I saw a demonstration of last year by officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That is an excellent idea. The introduction of photographs on ballot papers is similarly a welcome proposal which went down well with the electorate, including elderly people, and not just those who would have literacy problems, as the Minister mentioned. People reacted very favourably to the inclusion of the photograph and the party insignia, which is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>Regarding posters outside polling stations, I concur with what the Minister said in that many people do not know where the polling station is located. Sometimes they are moved from one station to another and even people who have been voting at the same station for many years can become confused, particularly when they do not have children in school and are not familiar with the location of a school. However, I accept the provision is balanced and there will be no massive proliferation of posters which we had in the past, nor the necessity for voters to run the gauntlet of party workers, especially from teatime, cajoling people to vote for their candidate. A polling station will still remain a quiet place but people will know where it is located. However, there might be a role for local authorities and those charged with stating where a polling station is located to advertise the location on the roadside as well as the door of the polling station.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to comments made by Senator Fitzgerald on State funding of political parties. I agree with him, but do not agree with a two-tier system. There should be full State funding of political parties as it is the only way to guarantee transparency and a break in the link between business and politics. Senator Fitzgerald asked how we should fund elections. If the taxpayer funds political parties in elections and there is an even playing pitch for every party, we would all know we were voting for the candidate and not the person who gave £50,000. It would be a very good day for democracy if such was provided for, but this Government will never allow it to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald raised some valid points about the costs of politics and the extreme pressure that being in politics puts on individuals in terms of expectations of the public etc. I and my party believe that in the interests of good politics we must have proper public funding of politics and the associated process. I am talking about money being provided by the State which is accounted for through the Public Offices Commission and which is used exclusively for the purposes for which it is given to politicians, that is, for the pursuit of politics, not for the purchase of expensive shirts in Paris. We have a very clear view on this. The difference is that we believe politics should be fair and should have rules which are enforced by an impartial body, namely, the Public Offices Commission. The Public Offices Commission said the Labour Party did nothing significantly wrong.</P>

      <P>They are in a frenzy about £500, but they will happily socialise in the House with a man who spent a week in jail because he deliberately obstructed a commission of inquiry into precisely the sort of activities which have brought politics into disrepute. They think he is a hero and treat him as such. They socialise with him and listen to his stories. The same people turn on us <Col N="505" /> and talk about £500, the sort of money that the individual from the Fianna Fáil background who ended in jail would not think of spending because it was such an insignificant sum in his personal life and in his political career. They then turn on us as if overspending by that sum was the gravest mortal sin.</P>
      <P>I have no problems with people who make mistakes or with the fact that Fianna Fáil makes mistakes. At present it is running what is perhaps the worst Government in the history of the State. I accept that it does not deliberately make a mess of it. It just happens because it is not able for it. I do have a problem with the deliberate attempt to change the rules because it knows it can get its hands on sums that nobody else can. It has succeeded in doing that in recent years.</P>
      <P>There was a time when they were a small party with little money who relied on the ordinary people and their voluntary effort to build what was a great movement. They had values, principles and believed people went into politics to make a sacrifice and do good. They would have found the idea that a person enters politics to become rich repulsive. My own father would have been repulsed by the idea that there was money to be made out of his involvement in Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by Fianna Fáil's obsession with the £500 that the Labour Party overspent and also by their apparent belief that this is the greatest offence that has happened in the last three years. This is a party which did not notice when Ray Burke was snaffling £30,000 or £60,000. They did not notice that their party leader for 12 years was living a lifestyle which necessitated an expenditure annually of about ten times his Oireachtas salary. It never crossed their minds nor did they even wonder about it? Everybody in this House except the members of Fianna Fáil was asking how he could afford the lifestyle. Nobody among the mostly decent members even noticed.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's problem is that the party comes first. It is about time the party emerged from its cloud of confusion into the real world. It must realise that it is obvious to the people what is going on. Whatever global opinion polls say, real tests of public opinion in general or by-elections show their vote is slipping yet they do not understand why. It is because it has walked away from what it once stood for.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that a Bill that could have produced significant and sensible reforms has been spoiled by what is a clear attempt to restore an advantage to Fianna Fáil, which is hurting from the fact that it cannot swamp the place with money. It cannot swamp a by-election with resources and with money because the law says no. One of its problems is it has difficulties with laws that are enforced. Laws to them are nice gestures but you must be able to get around them. Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil culture promotes the idea that things can be &ldquo;sorted out&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic issue here is how much money we need to spend in an election. This was argued in the Oireachtas during the period of the rainbow <Col N="506" /> coalition. The Oireachtas voted then in favour of a certain figure but now that Fianna Fáil is again in power it wants to change it. They suggest that because the smallest of the three major political parties overspent by the sort of sum that many people in Fianna Fáil would spend on a good night out that justifies allowing them to raise and spend £1 million. I know people in Fianna Fáil are both literate and numerate but how many times bigger than £500 is £1 million? It is 2,000 times higher, yet they continue to divert public attention so they can hold on to their sources of funds, the corporate sector they have looked after so well. Those speculators who were threatened with 60% capital gains tax and who have had that threat removed in the last two weeks will troop in to contribute to the coffers of the party that saved them 40% in capital gains tax on their scandalous speculation in people's need for housing. All the bookies and gamblers will contribute because they abolished a large part of the betting levy and also the very rich who have had estate duty and other taxes reduced.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will, as a result, have its slush fund for the next election. If only Fianna Fáil was swamped I would not mind but its slush fund will taint all of us. Its great political achievement over the last number of years is to imply that what is going on is somehow a reflection on the corruption of a small number of politicians in all parties. There is only one person from outside Fianna Fáil in the political system being investigated by any tribunal. In the period from 1977 to 1997 when certain people became leaders of Fianna Fáil and the world in many ways fell apart, the party that spent most time in Government was the party of which I am a member. Fianna Fáil was in Government for less time in that 20 years&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have seen enough of Westminster to know that I am well within the bounds of Westminster behaviour.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why a party that is allegedly sophisticated and used to have the capacity to win votes and to have a feel for the mood of the people has got itself into this situation. Once, on the Order of Business, I suggested that Fianna Fáil had only one core value left and that was money. This particular exercise suggests that. They have recognised that the restriction on their ability to spend money is affecting them electorally. They have calculated that the damage this will do to them politically is less than what they believe they can buy with the extra expenditure. They have spent the last month or two trying to defend the indefensible and turning on this party. This party spotted what they were at, this party told them and the public what they were at, and this party will continue to inform the public.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business today my party and I suggested that this Bill should not be taken. A few small sections of this Bill crystallise something which is not just a matter of political dispute but which has been a fault in politics in recent years.</P>
      <P>I refer to the increased permitted expenditure and the definition of minor expenditure as £100. There are at least 500,000 people in this country to whom £100 is an enormous sum of money. Many people have been told by this rich State that they should be able to live on less than £100 per week. To classify this amount as minor expenditure is designed to leave the Government another escape route and at the same time to insult half a million people at least.</P>
      <P>I have never understood when it came to pass that Fianna Fáil decided it was the party of the moneyed classes&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is most regrettable that we have this legislation before us, tainted as it is with the worst side of Fianna Fáil. It taints us all. Notwithstanding what has been said, both in this House and by media commentators, Fianna Fáil is determined to spend, spend, spend in the next election. This determination has allowed that party to ignore the reality that not only itself but also politics is being damaged. It brings us all into disrepute, just as vulgar expenditure on by-elections and general elections did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party recognise clearly, as do Fine Gael and most people, that it is an era which <Col N="508" /> is in the past. The new era is one of limited expenditure, transparent expenditure and of clean politics in which the public are not bombarded with expensive advertising. The Labour Party is fundamentally opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just listened to what can only be described as a diatribe from a man for whom I have always had a great deal of respect. I thought he would have raised the level of debate by making what would be termed a valuable contribution. All he has succeeded in doing is insult about 40% of the population who consistently vote for Fianna Fáil. He has accused them of being crooked, corrupt money grabbers, only interested in lining their own pockets. I find it offensive. If Fianna Fáil were to use Senator Ryan's speech as its election manifesto in the next election, its vote would easily be increased by 50% and the Labour Party would find its vote reduced from the measly 10% where it currently languishes in the polls.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of becoming involved in a low level, low rent contribution to this debate and I am appalled at Senator Ryan. I should not be surprised. Ever since I was a child, I have learned to live with the reality that the Labour Party has always felt the need to attack Fianna Fáil. Perhaps it finds this necessary to make up for its own shortcomings in electoral terms. Strangely, the more it attacks Fianna Fáil, the better Fianna Fáil's results in the polls. My mother advised me many years ago to turn the other cheek when faced with a bully. The Labour Party is merely trying to entice us into the same low level of debate that it engages in.</P>
      <P>I will not attempt to clamber up on the high moral ground that Senator Ryan and his colleagues occupy. The Senator has spent 15 minutes talking about a Bill which contains very important and innovative proposals, yet he merely launched a personalised attack on Fianna Fáil Members in this House and on the wider Fianna Fáil family. To seriously suggest that the Fianna Fáil Party is wholly concerned with guarding its own interests flies in the face of history and in the face of its record in government. Fianna Fáil has consistently been returned to Government.</P>
      <P>I find it rich that Senator Ryan talks about the £100 and he is not only a Member of this House but also a full time third level lecturer. Very few of us have the luxury of two or three jobs and can operate&mdash;</P>

The Labour Party will get far less votes than Senator Ryan thinks it will get.</P>
      <P>What has really annoyed me so much is that the Senator has attacked ordinary decent people, the people I and my colleagues live among. I would suggest that Senator Ryan and his colleagues also live among these people.</P>

We could conveniently forget that in government the Labour Party supported a tax amnesty. It supported the very thing that it did not support when going around the country. Many of us in the Fianna Fáil Party were not in favour of the tax amnesty but the Labour Party in government supported it.</P>
      <P>A Labour Party Minister of State sent invitations to meet the then Minister for Finance, also a Labour Party member. The catch was that £100 had to be paid for the privilege.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot compare Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael with the Labour Party in discussion on the increase in election spending limits. The Labour Party nearly always nominates one candidate per constituency contested. Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael nominate an appropriate number of candidates relative to the number of seats that are available in a constituency, which inevitably means that there will be greater expenditure. Logic dictates that more will be spent by Fianna Fáil than by Labour and I do not know what is wrong with that.</P>
      <P>The Public Offices Commission that came into being in 1997 is of great concern. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, referred to the fact that he did not want Members of the Dáil under investigation by the commission for moderate expenditure above limits. This will happen if present spending limits remain. What concerns all Members is the way in which the Public Offices Commission has operated regarding spending limits. It did not, as is the norm, set out the rules and regulations to be followed in adhering to legal limits and constraints. When a query has gone to the commission in relation to expenditure at election time it has tagged that on to the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give details applying directly to the Labour Party when there was a query put into the commission at the Dublin South-Central by-election. The candidate and now Member of this House, Deputy Upton, asked if child care costs would be included as election expenditure. The answer from the commission, to its eternal shame, was yes. We should not allow that to continue. <Col N="511" /> The legislation was introduced by politicians of all parties and it is time to regain the ground lost.</P>
    <P>This House is the legislative power, rather than an un-elected commission that seems to interpret every query as an additional constraint on the exercise of democratic activity. I do not believe Senator Ryan or his colleagues agree that should continue, irrespective of what view they may have about increased spending limits. There is an inherent threat to democracy and the Minister should get off the fence on this and limit the power of the Public Offices Commission to tag on extra expenditure based on queries coming in from candidates.</P>
    <P>It is time to bite the bullet. In the past decade, parliamentarians have allowed a slow haemorrhage of power from this House to third agencies which are unaccountable, apart from presenting an annual report which is often buried. I hope the Minister will address the powers of the commission, or at least clarify what the limits or parameters of its powers are when it comes to queries on election expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, and it needs to be re-stated, that the new limits are the same for all candidates and do not provide additional funds to Fianna Fáil. It is difficult to raise funds to fight an election campaign whether at local council, Dáil, Seanad or European level. The vast majority of candidates seeking election at any level are ordinary, decent, hard-working people who do not get the corporate donations that Senator Ryan suggests.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that Senator Ryan can twist logic on its head by suggesting that all such donations are flowing to my party, Fianna Fáil. On the current statistics, nearly half the people of this country vote consistently to re-elect Fianna Fáil Administrations. It is inevitable that there is an attractive outlet for those who wish to take advantage of people in power. To put the matter at its bluntest, while not trying to defend the practice, it is inevitable that the party in power is going to attract those with bags of cash who think they can buy their way into power. I have no more time for carpetbaggers than anyone else.</P>

I would not say it was unusual for a person who wanted to advance a personal agenda to approach a Labour Minister in Government. They might be prepared to put money on the table to do it behind closed doors. Do not suggest that Fianna Fáil is somehow corrupt or weak or pursuing self-interest simply because it has been in Government as long as it has. It has discharged its responsibilities according to the mandate the people have repeatedly given it.</P>

      <P>I applaud the Minister for introducing electronic voting as it is past time that the measure was brought in. I would like clarification on section 6 of the Bill, which relates to the deletion of names. There is a question mark about how the names are deleted.</P>
      <P>In section 24, the Minister refers to proposals where persons unable to read or write to the extent of not being able to vote can have a companion vote for them. In section 25, those who are registered voters in a constituency other than the one in which they are employed may use the postal vote. Both of these sections are open to abuse and I hope they will be strictly monitored, particularly in relation to those who have literacy problems.</P>
      <P>Sadly many who have literacy problems do not admit this and there are unscrupulous people in all parties who will take advantage of that by voting against their wishes. There will be people in flatland who will stuff letter-boxes with ballot papers to take advantage of section 25 and I hope that situation will be monitored.</P>

It is sad to see my colleagues in political parties knocking sparks off each other in this undignified way. It will only serve to disillusion voters, in the unlikely event that they watch recordings of the proceedings. It is also unlikely that the Seanad will be covered in the media due to the violently partisan type of debate and that is a real pity.

      <P>I felt that Senator Tom Fitzgerald was a reasonable voice from the Government side and it is a pity there were not more along those lines. He seemed to suggest a fairly civilised way of dealing with things without this kind of acrimony and spite. There is suspicion, as there always is when people are dividing out money. I know the term gerrymander; some people would regard this as some kind of &ldquo;moneymander&rdquo; by Fianna Fáil. Whether or not it is, this certainly lies behind the amendment tabled by the Labour Party which, having listened to the arguments, I am more inclined to support than I was before the debate began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the new leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Michael Noonan, for his action on corporate <Col N="513" /> donations. I look forward to the other parties following suit. It is a pity that the Minister was only able to promise something about donations in his speech. He did not do it in the Bill and I wonder why he did not hold on to the Bill until he could do something. This would have been a very positive moment to do it, particularly with the scandals that are going on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so too and that is what Senator Fitzgerald was saying. Party politics should not be played with this issue because the credibility of the public, the belief in the political system, is far too important. There was a young lad in the Gallery and I asked him had he ever voted. He said he was 16 and had never voted. I asked him if this debate would make him more or less likely to vote and he said definitely less. It was really a case of a plague on both your houses. That was just one little voice, but we need to be aware of that. Let us, as politicians, not disillusion the public any further.</P>
      <P>We should get rid of corporate donations. I have no doubt that they have always been made and that they were made to Governments and parties who had the capacity to ignore them and lay them to one side. However, by giving large sums of money a context is created in which there is a likelihood of an even unconscious prejudice in favour of the person who made the large donation. The whole thing is unfortunate and should be addressed directly.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a little bit coy in listing out, during his speech, all the technical changes that are provided for in this legislation, most of which are welcome. The miscellaneous provisions deal with the really contentious issues. It would have been better, even if only for the optics, if he had contained those in a separate Bill, held it back and dealt with the question of donations. As he says, there may have been some kind of political difficulty.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what Senator Mooney said. He is a very fine speaker. I do not always agree with him but I like somebody who can take up a challenge on his or her feet and deal with it by producing evidence and statistics. The kind of thing he said, for example, about tacking on the expenses of child minding is absolutely outrageous. We should be encouraging people to stand for public life. We should be facilitating them and not hindering them in this mean minded and niggardly way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of this stuff is window dressing, cosmetic and utter hogwash. I am fed up getting knocked out of my bed, when I have just flown for 14 hours, to get a registered envelope containing a list of demands where I have to say that I did not take money for this, that and the other bloody thing. I have never got a penny in my life and I <Col N="514" /> have to get out of bed to fill up this thing. Then I have to take it to a solicitor and get it sworn. That costs me a fiver, unless the solicitor is a friend and does it as a nixer. I suppose it is illegal for me to say that too in these frightfully pure days. Then I have to send it by registered post, which costs another couple of quid. All this to say I got nothing. If I had been on the take, could anybody think I would be such a complete imbecile that I would say that under section 6, yes, I took £75,565 so that I could change the planning on this or that? They must be mad. It is like the British Prevention of Terrorism Act where someone going through an airport has to sign a form stating the purpose of their visit. I do not know anybody mad enough to say that they really wanted to put a bomb under the Queen Mother. It is idiotic. It is just for window dressing and it means sweet damn all. Anybody who is really on the take knows at least the basics of how to cover their tracks. It is an insult to our intelligence and it is a waste of money. I am mean minded enough to say that I resent being bothered with this sort of rubbish.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he mentions the edited register. I find this of interest. It is an intrusion for this material to be made available to commercial companies. I always tick the little box in anything I am on saying I do not want this. I already get enough tripe through the letterbox, including the stuff from the ethics commission or whatever they are. He said a choice had to be made whether to make it illegal to use the data in the register of electors other than for electoral or other statutory purposes. I looked at the section of the explanatory memorandum of the Bill and it is quite clear that it is perfectly reasonable, valid and legal for candidates to make use of the information compiled on the register. This is very important, especially for the university candidates because of their method of reaching their electorate, which is very widespread indeed. For example, in the next election Trinity will have about 40,000 electors and each must be sent electoral material in writing. Without using this material, how can candidates spread out their wares in front of their potential electorate?</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address this because it would be <i>ultra vires </i>for it to look at election expenses for the Seanad. That is fine with one exception. When all serious candidates are compelled to write to as many of those 40,000 as possible, that is an expensive business which should be allowable as an expense against tax. This should apply not only to sitting candidates but we should equalise the playing pitch for people who want to come and take our seats.</P>
    <P>For sitting Senators, this should be a business expense. We are paid by the people to represent them. That is our business, trade or profession. I enter that as my occupation: public representative. Surely it is a legitimate business expense to spend a certain amount of money on re-election. I believe that the electoral system should be supported by money from public funds. Both inde<Col N="515" /> pendents and the political parties should get a certain amount of money. We should also be allowed to write off some of our expenses against tax. It only seems fair and in any other business it would be possible.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the question of funding. It is not just a question of the individuals involved but also the parties. This is what lies behind the rancour on this side of the House. Because Fianna Fáil is the largest party, and I do not want specifically to attack Fíanna Fáil, if they have for example 100 candidates they would get £1 million. They can decide to allow £400,000 for central party purposes and that means they can buy enormous amounts of advertising. I would hate to see us go down the American road. We have not done it yet but that has vitiated politics in America. Elections are quite plainly bought. America is no longer a democracy. People buy their way into power. That is perfectly, absolutely and stunningly clear and it is a tragedy. We want to avoid that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tragedy and we must avoid it. In so far as the Bill seeks to address this I am all for it. However, it does not do so satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill contains a provision on the inclusion of photographs as a surprisingly large number of people have difficulty in reading and absorbing information. People with reading difficulties, for example, dyslexia, etc., are disadvantaged and it is useful to have a photograph on the ballot paper. I have campaigned for this in the House, as the Minister probably knows, having been briefed by lobby groups in this area. I assume that the photographic reproduction will be limited to the candidate. I suppose, legally speaking at least, I am a bachelor or a spinster of this parish and it galls me to see children, spouses and God knows who else romping around in photographs. It is bad enough to see them on the campaign literature of my opponents but if they are also on the ballot paper I will be ill from fury. I hope photographs will be limited to a visual reproduction of the features of the candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>That is splendid &ndash; we can follow the hair line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one aspect which worries me about electronic voting is whether it is user friendly. I am becoming elderly and have always been a bit thick as far as mechanical and electronic issues are concerned. I am a little worried, particularly in light of the Florida situation in the United <Col N="516" /> States, that people might be confused and find it difficult to operate. The Minister appears to suggest by shaking his head that this will not happen. I hope it will not happen and that the advice he has taken is accurate.</P>
    <P>I am also worried, given that I know so little about electricity and other new fangled inventions, about whether it is possible to hack into this system. I suppose one would be suspicious if the Socialist Party of Ireland, Marxists-Leninists, suddenly got 45,000 votes in County Westmeath. I hope that it will not be possible to hack into the system and interfere in this way.</P>
    <P>It is important that we address these issues. It is a pity there was a mix between the clear, efficient and practical steps such as electronic voting, photographs and the use of large print &ndash; this is a wise and good provision for people who are visually impaired &ndash; and something which has a much more ideological flavour to it and which has led to a display of bad temper and ill manners in the House. This is regrettable.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and thank the Minister for initiating the legislation in the Seanad. We are always most grateful when legislation is initiated in the House.</P>
      <P>This is a wonderful time to be in public life. It is the greatest singular honour for an individual to be elected to represent his community, constituency or county. Those of us who have been Senators for a long time will recall when it was difficult to achieve anything as a public representative due to a lack of resources. This is an exciting time to be in public life as we can improve our areas, update and amend legislation and work to assist future generations.</P>
      <P>The legislation updates the necessary requirements in many areas. I welcome in particular the suggestion made by Senator Norris that the money expended by those who wish to serve the public should be tax allowable. All candidates have to spend money at election time. Those of us who were unfortunate enough to be around in 1981, 1982 and 1983 when there were three general elections remember that families had to contribute to the funding of candidates. I salute those people who stayed in public life during this difficult time of economic depression and massive emigration.</P>
      <P>The country's future generations will inherit has been made what it is by the people of all political parties who have been in power, particularly those who have been in power for the past 13 years. The chief executives of any major company would be proud of the job done on behalf of Ireland plc in terms of our economy. Many other countries are trying to copy our example and it is important to record our congratulations to all former Taoisigh, Ministers for Finance and the other Ministers for the terrific job they have done, particularly since the mid-1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill. Section 28 provides for the inspection of ballot papers. <Col N="517" /> Sometimes this can be difficult and it may not encourage people in small areas or island communities to vote. However, it is important that the paper should be in view of the party tellers. Even if they cannot be within a yard or four feet, they should be within five or six feet of where the votes are counted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which will allow posters to be displayed within 100 yards of a polling booth. Those of us who live in remote areas know that the excitement of election day has been practically eliminated because no activity is allowed near polling booths. Previously people took time off work to serve the candidate or party of their choice on election day. I have seen few polling stations with only one road leading to it; there is always another road to the east, west, north or south. This means there will have to be a poster on each road approaching the polling booth. The Minister was a TD for the area for a considerable time and he knows that there are three roads leading to Castlepollard national school &ndash; one from Glenview, a second from Ballycomoyle and Water Street and a third from Castlepollard town. One poster will be allowed on each road, which is not too many.</P>
    <P>We have all seen on CNN what happened in America in regard to electronic voting. It should be indicated to voters that they can only mark the ballot paper on the left hand side of the photograph or logo. I welcome the provision regarding photographs but they should be photographs taken within the previous three months. The photographs of some of my colleagues in the<i> Westmeath Examiner</i> were taken ten or 12 years ago. I do not know how the editors can stand over that. It may be that they consider them more attractive. I agree with the Minister that a current photograph should be provided. I would go so far as to suggest that he include a provision on Committee Stage that the photograph must be no older than three months.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He looks as though he is in a good natured humour and that he will accept all suggestions with an open mind, as he has done in the past. I have no doubt we will have an interesting afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> All my amendments have the same purpose, which is to beef up the independence of the appeals process so that it is clearly seen to be fully independent and, in the case of appeals, that the decision-making process will be known to be conducted in an independent manner. I was encouraged to table these amendments by what the Minister said when introducing the Bill on Second Stage:</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view that it is a very good procedure to introduce legislation in the Seanad. [We all agree with that]. Having it debated by the learned Senators and having some public debate on it before it goes to the Dáil, it is much better to accept helpful amendments and amendments which strengthen the legislation here.</P>
    <P>On the basis that the Minister has come in with an open mind, we all know him well enough to know that when he utters such sentiments, they are not plámás but he means what he says. I remember how he listened to our reservations on the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill. Instead of rushing it through before the summer recess he agreed to hold off Report Stage until after the autumn when the matters could be raised and more fully considered. From that point of view I am further encouraged in tabling these amendments because we all seem to be agreed &ndash; the Minister, myself and all the Senators who contributed on Second Stage &ndash; that the heart of this Bill is the issue of independence of the appeals process. I know that is what the Minister wants to achieve.</P>
    <P>Apart from myself, many of the Senators on Second Stage expressed reservations about whether the proposed body was sufficiently independent. The Minister said the independence of the agriculture appeals office is its crucial aspect. Where the Bill can and needs to be improved is in strengthening this crucial aspect of independence. Senator Callanan spoke about his unhappiness at taking power away from the elected representatives and placing it in the hands of someone else. I can understand that view but we are talking about independence. Unless the perception of independence is total on the part of the people who will use this service, the whole operation of the appeals system is pointless. In drafting the Bill, the Minister and his advisers appear to have taken a minimal approach. I am sure the Bill will not end up as an Act in that way and that its independence will be strengthened. I would like it strengthened in this House rather than wait until it gets to the other House.</P>
    <P>The example of the social welfare appeals office, which has been operating successfully for over ten years, has been followed. Some Senators spoke approvingly on Second Stage of the work of the social welfare appeals office and I have no doubt they are right. What is undoubtedly true is that it falls at one end of the independence spectrum, at the minimal end. It would be more prudent to choose instead a model from somewhere <Col N="519" /> else on that independence spectrum to remove the risk of the minimal approach being taken. That risk is quite large for the reasons I gave on Second Stage. I pointed out that section 2 gives the Minister totally unfettered power to appoint and remove appeals officers at his or her whim. There is no safeguard against being removed because the Department does not like the way an appeals officer is performing. To be credible, there has to be a safeguard against that.</P>
    <P>I drew attention also to the undermining of the role of the Director of Agriculture Appeals. In this Bill the key people are the appeals officers, one of whom the Minister chooses to be director. This is crucial. The director should be the lynchpin of the operation and the appeals officers should be clearly seen to be under his or her command. That point covers all the amendments but specifically these four amendments.</P>
    <P>In my amendments I have set out another way of setting up the appeals system, one based on examples that are further along the spectrum of independence. The Office of Director of Consumer Affairs, the Office of the Data Commissioner and the Office of the Ombudsman were set up differently from the social welfare appeals office. I tabled the amendments to illustrate the many differences between the minimalist approach set out in the Bill and the more prudent approach I am suggesting. No doubt they could have been better drafted and I would not go to the stake over wording of any of them, particularly these four. What I am trying to demonstrate is that there is a better way than that put forward by the Minister. In considering this matter we should remember we are not dealing with trivia.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum informs us that the agriculture appeals office will have 32 staff and will cost £1.5 million per year. Clearly agriculture appeals are big business and we should be sure of the structure we put in place to deal with them. The best reason to consider beefing up the independence of the appeals office is to ask what will change if the Bill is enacted in its present form. I suggest to the Minister that nothing will change. The existing appeals system will continue. It will continue exactly as heretofore, the only difference being that it will now be on a statutory footing, whereas that was not the case in the past. What difference will that statutory footing make to the appeals process? What difference will it make in terms of how the clients of the system perceive it? My concern is that they will perceive it as making no difference.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe the need which gave rise to the Bill in the first instance, and which led to a commitment being written into the Programme for Partnership and Fairness, will be satisfied by this legislative figleaf. If there is a real demand for an independent appeals process, let us satisfy that demand with a system that is clearly independent, without any possible doubt whatsoever. Given the minimalist approach in the Bill as it <Col N="520" /> stands, it runs the risk of leaving that demand unsatisfied and possibly frustrated. Why should we take that risk? </P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House. Amendment No. 1 proposes deleting lines 13 and 14 in page 3 which read, &ldquo;&lsquo;appeals officer' means an appeals officer appointed under section 2&rdquo;. Amendment No. 2 proposes substituting line 15 with the words, &ldquo;&lsquo;Director' means the holder of the office of Director of Agriculture Appeals as appointed under section 2 of this Act;&rdquo;. Amendment No. 3 seeks to almost copy the sort of structure that exists in setting up the data commissioner, the Ombudsman and so on. I have attempted here to say that instead of a figleaf, we should ensure we set up a statutory structure which corresponds to the other appeals commissions. Instead of taking the minimalistic approach of the social welfare appeals process, we should go for something along the lines of the other three. On that basis, I believe the amendments will strengthen the credibility of the office and will, therefore, be regarded with far more confidence by those who must appeal to it.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments tabled by Senator Quinn. The demand for this Bill is huge and has been spoken about for some time. I referred in detail to the need for the Bill during the Second Stage debate, which we all accept. Given that we are going through the process of putting this legislation in place, we need something that will work. For it to work, trust and independence are needed. The basic problem is that the office is not seen as independent and that is why I support Senator Quinn's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendments on the basis that they address key issues in the legislation identified on this side of the House as requiring to be strengthened and amended. During his closing remarks on Second Stage, the Minister appeared to indicate that he would bring forward proposals in that regard.</P>
      <P>In the intervening time, I spoke with an individual about whom I have written to the Minister on more than one occasion. This person has had the experience which Senator Doyle described and which I termed the ground hog day experience, whereby every year the same problem pops up in exactly the same form, the same query and the same issue from the Department, in a manner which seems to hit individuals in an extraordinary fashion. I discussed the outline of the legislation with this person and, although neither of us is an expert in parliamentary drafting and so on, we simply considered how the principle of the independence of the office would operate. This is the core issue because the office must not just be independent, it must be seen to be independent and must have the statutory power to operate effectively and independently.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will support the spirit of what Members on this side of the House are trying to achieve. I support the amendments.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendments. A criticism of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is that all too frequently it polices itself. This has led to a loss of trust in the Department. It has also led to many problems in relation to the BSE crisis because it is felt there is not sufficient clarity of the divisions between the various agencies which no longer come under the Department, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food Safety Authority. I recognise the need for an agriculture appeals office because people's grants are delayed for a considerable time or are sometimes refused for quite minor mistakes. However, I believe it is a mistake to have one section of the Department policing other sections of the Department. It would be better if it were a stand alone authority.</P>

      <P>When we debated the Bill last week there was a general welcome for it even though it went to a vote afterwards. I had difficulty understanding this because the legislation had been sought for a couple of years and we welcomed the fact that the Minister had now brought it into the House for consideration and hopefully for adoption.</P>
      <P>I asked that two issues might receive further consideration. Senator O'Meara refers to the issue in her amendments. This relates to section 9 which states that an appeals officer may hold an oral hearing. We would have substantial support to meet requests that that read, &ldquo;shall, if required, hold&rdquo;. I believe I used these words on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>On the independence of the appeals board, while we support the principle of the independence of the board, we support it in the context in which it is framed in the Bill. I said the last day and I repeat it here today that I would not be party to moving away from the ultimate authority of the democratic process. The Oireachtas had a tendency in the past to set up independent commissions, bodies and so on. The debate which took place here half an hour ago equally referred to a non-elected person having a determination right and not being answerable to anyone. Anyone engaged in the democratic process ought not accept that final principle. For these reasons, I will argue adamantly that we retain in the Bill the final democratic principle.</P>
      <P>Many non-elected European agencies require that their regulations be adhered to in this country. That is not what democracy is about. It is not for me to preach about democracy as we are all within the democratic system. I support the democratic system and the democratic principles in the Bill. Accordingly, I have difficulty with some of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps an amendment should have been included to the effect that where independent people, be they independent planners, people from Teagasc or the person who the farmer visits in the evening who draws up a plan at a cut price rate, draw up plans that are required to be sub<Col N="522" /> mitted for aid, the purpose of which is to augment farmers' incomes, and farmers lose money, the people involved must carry some responsibility. This may involve the establishment of a register of planners who should be required to have an insurance policy. It would mean that if a wrong is committed and a farmer is denied income aid because of a badly or wrongly drawn up plan he and his family will have a means of redress. I accept that plans are not intentionally badly drawn up, but stories have been told of plans drawn without the farmland being walked, although some farms are difficult to assess. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have circulated the Bill to the relevant farming bodies and the industry, introduced it to the Seanad and considered the public debate following Second Stage debate in the House. The legislation was agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and has been well received. When drafting the Bill I considered other organisations, models, and legislation, including the social welfare appeals office, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Refugee Appeals Board, the Labour Relations Commission and An Bord Pleanála. I used as a model the legislation establishing the social welfare appeals office, not only because I am familiar with it, having dealt with it for over a decade, but because I considered it to be the fairest in its scope. I found it to be a considerable improvement on the old system. Most of my colleagues and Senators would accept it has worked well, especially when 12 or 15 years ago most public representatives had big problems with difficulties and delays involving social welfare.</P>
      <P>The model proposed in these amendments by Senators Tom Hayes and Quinn is closely related to that of the Director of Consumer Affairs. I do not object to that approach, but I am unsure if it would generate a better result. Senators on all sides of the House would agree that the social welfare appeals office has been very successful in providing an appeals service to its clients. Its independence is not in question and it operates within the Vote of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The structure I propose in the Bill is identical to that of the social welfare appeals office. Appeals officers will be appointed in exactly the same way. The role of the director and the reporting arrangement between the new office and the Minister are identical. The decisions of the director will not need the approval of the Minister, indeed he will have no truck with interference in the day-to-day operation of the office, which will be a matter for the director and the staff. The Bill provides that he or she will be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn expressed concern that appeals officers will be directly appointed or dismissed by the Minister. The recruitment of the director and <Col N="523" /> the officers will be conducted by the Civil Service Commission, which is completely independent. Most public representatives know if they try to interfere with the commission they will be quickly put in their place. The appeals officers will be permanent civil servants. In all my years in public life I am unaware of any Minister who was foolish enough to try to sack a civil servant.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry alluded to BSE. I thought I might have a safe haven here from that topic, but there is no getting away from it. Another problem has arisen with foot and mouth disease. Senator Rory Kiely expressed concern about that. He also expressed concern that an event to be held in the middle of next month in the Cotswolds, England, might possibly be jeopardised. I hope it will not.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals office has stood the test of time for a decade. When dealing with social welfare appeals, social welfare officers do not encounter the wrath of the Minster for Social, Community and Family Affairs. In the case of the agriculture appeals office, the Minister will have no role or function in the day-to-day determination of appeals.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to Senator Henry's suggestion that the appeals officers should cover the entire public service and that they should not be confined to my Department. That will be considered when we deal with amendments Nos. 4 and 5. I am unable to accept these amendments for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Civil Service Commission will act independently in making appointments and that it will not be possible for the Minister to dismiss officers. Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may appoint such and so many of his or her officers as he or she thinks appropriate to be appeals officers for the purposes of this Act and every person so appointed shall hold office during the pleasure of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;during the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; concern me, especially when the Minister says the appeals officers will be selected by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>I could not remember Bernard's name in &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; but Senator Henry reminded me of it. The Minister no doubt will have been interested in &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; at the time when Sir Humphrey Appleby was the permanent secretary general of the department and the private secretary to the Minister was Bernard. It was made very clear to Bernard that his future promotional prospects and his position in the department-&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much that it was fictional. It was made very clear to Bernard that his future promotion would depend on his position in that department. That is the aspect which <Col N="524" /> shakes my confidence in the independence of this body.</P>
      <P>Maybe this is an exact replica of the social welfare appeals office, but I did not understand that. I spoke to somebody who knew something about the social welfare appeals office and they said they were very attracted by the quality of the people there. I got the impression that those people were brought in from outside and that they were not employees of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. One was a barrister who was seen to have had no great loyalty to the decisions that had been made by the Minister and, therefore, when the Minister made a decision, this barrister, who was working for the social welfare appeals office, did not feel threatened if he did not support the Minister.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will put my mind at rest in this regard. I hope he will be able to assure me that this is an exact replica of the social welfare appeals office. If that is so, I would say it is only a minimalist approach. Let me take the example of someone appointed by the Civil Service Commission to the social welfare appeals office and who comes from outside that office. I do not believe they become part of that Department, they are independent of it. In this case, someone recruited from outside to this appeals structure will become part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Perhaps the Minister will put my mind at rest that there is no difference between the two functions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is identical. I inquired as to whether this was lifted word for word from the social welfare legislation and I received confirmation that it was. Some of the words are archaic, old fashioned and unhelpful. Maybe the words &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; were the order of the day in Sir Humphrey's time. I confirm that this is an exact replica but I will look at the wording. I give an assurance to the House that I will seek to couch it in more modern and helpful language because the words &ldquo;at the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; are not the order of this century and millennium.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;of his or her officers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment Nos. 4 and 5 are simple amendments which seek the substitution of certain phrases for phrases in the Bill. In the case of amendment No. 4, the insertion of the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; would increase the pool of personnel eligible for appointment to the position of appeals officers. People throughout the wider public service would, therefore, be entitled to apply for these positions. The amendment seeks the deletion of the requirement that appeals officers would be officers of the Minister or of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have had dealings with the social welfare appeals system are very laudatory of that system in which appeals officers are drawn from the wider public service. This Bill, as currently drafted, means that appeals officers can only be recruited from the Department of Agri<Col N="529" /> culture, Food and Rural Development. This is a small but important amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 5, I am seeking the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; which is archaic and simply should not appear in modern legislation. I hope the Minister will agree to its deletion. Under the legislation as it stands, an officer could be dismissed at will or at &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; but the acceptance of this amendment would result in a definite term of office being stipulated. It would also have the desirable effect of emphasising the office's independence. This is a reasonable and important amendment which would be welcomed by anyone working as an appeals officer under this regime.  </P>

      <P>I support these amendments, the first of which would go some way towards redressing my criticism that officers within the Department would be policing other officers. At least, there would be a possibility of people outside the Department being appointed if amendment No. 4 were accepted. The Minister conceded that the phrase &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; harks back to grace and favour days and the phraseology contained in amendment No. 5 would be a far more suitable way of prescribing the period of appointment. It would also make the office appear more independent.</P>

Therefore, I expect he will support the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; in amendment No. 5. The phrase, which sticks in my craw, is an exact replica of a phrase which appears in the social welfare appeals legislation. I am sure the Minister will find a way to meet our concerns.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill as currently drafted appeals officers must be civil servants working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and they will be assigned to work in the agricultural appeals office. I am assured that social welfare appeals officers are recruited from within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, not from the wider public service. Acceptance of amendment No. 4 would mean that the Minister could appoint any person to the position of appeals officer because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo;. Members of the party faithful and my local cumann chairman would be eligible to apply for the position &ndash; as it happens, my local cumann chairman would be a very good appeals officer. The wording in the amendment is somewhat loose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> I am not averse to the members of the wider public service being eligible for appointment in this area as that would create a bigger pool of people from which to select appeals officers and would offer opportunities to people throughout the public service. A certain degree of interaction and cross-fertilisation &ndash; to use a hackneyed phrase &ndash; would not be at all detrimental. However, there are some industrial relations considerations which must be borne in mind and I must consult with staff associations and trade unions in this regard. Social partnership dictates that such issues must be discussed and I am prepared to give a commitment to the House that I will broaden the pool of eligible people to include people working in the wider public service, following consultation with the above organisations. The structure proposed in the Bill is identical to that which has been tried and tested in the social welfare appeals office for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I conceded that the phrase &ldquo;the pleasure of the Minister&rdquo; is an unhappy form of words which does not reflect modern English language usage and I am prepared to reword the provision. However, I am not convinced that the proposed rewording is the most appropriate. There is no need to prescribe a timeframe on an appeals office warrant of appointment as imposing strict time limits would interfere with the building up of a core of expertise in the cadre of appeals officers. Social welfare appeals officers do not have fixed terms of appointment on their warrant cards and I do not see any benefit in imposing a limit on such appointments.</P>

My amendment No. 26 seeks to substitute the phrase &ldquo;the establishment of an office to be known as the Director of Agriculture Appeals&rdquo; for &ldquo;appointment of appeals officers&rdquo;. I envisage an <Col N="531" /> office closer to that of the Director of Consumer Affairs, Data Commissioner or Ombudsman. On that basis, it would not be the Minister who would decide who the director's deputy would be, rather it would be the office of the director. That is a much healthier way of handling this process to ensure it is totally independent rather than simply having it at the Minister's whim. If we are really to have an independent office, the appointment of a deputy director should not be handled by the Minister but by the director. I urge the Minister to consider that.</P>

On the question of the director, the model we are using is the social welfare model, which I believe has worked well, and after ten years there is no clamour for its replacement or modification. The director of this office will be appointed on similar lines but the role will be extended to include the public service rather than just the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which I intend to examine. That is the appropriate way to proceed in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Regulations under <i>subsection (2)</i> which delete a scheme or part of a scheme from the Schedule shall not be made unless the regulation is laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving such draft is passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan spoke today and also on Second Stage about his concerns regarding the whittling down of the democratic role of the Oireachtas and the independence we give to bodies, not only this body but others also. The National Roads Authority springs to mind in that regard. It is important that the essential democratic role of a House such as this is retained in legislation. This amendment seeks to ensure that there is reference to the Oireachtas in the event of a Minister using his power of regulation to delete a scheme or part of a scheme from the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deletion of a scheme or part of a scheme from the Schedule is an important issue. The list of schemes is comprehensive and it potentially affects a large number of people. One could understand why the Minister would delete a scheme which is mentioned in the Schedule but is no longer in operation, but a situation could arise where a substantial scheme could be deleted for <Col N="532" /> some reason from the Schedule. As Members of this House, we should not only know about that but should have a view on it and have an opportunity to make that view known. I am sure the Minister will say that this provision is to give him ease of action in the event of a small scheme no longer being applicable and to make the bureaucratic operation a little easier. This is a small but important point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 sets out the functions of appeals officers. They will deal with appeals under any of the schemes listed in the Schedule. The Bill provides that the Minister may amend the Schedule by making regulations. That raises the question of how these regulations are made and when a scheme is removed from a Schedule. As the Deputy knows, there are more than 20 schemes, including the deseasonalisation premium scheme and the suckler cow scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in principle with the proposed amendment but it is far in excess of what might be required in this instance. The procedure being put forward is normally reserved for major issues which require debate in the Oireachtas. Every time there was a change in the suckler cow scheme, it would have to go back to the Oireachtas and that would be a little cumbersome and unnecessary. For example, we used to have a compensatory payment scheme which generally was called a headage scheme. Recently that headage scheme was changed to an area based compensatory allowance scheme, which means the same except that instead of having payments on the headage, it is now based on area. The changeover has caused me some grief because it is like the old cliché, &ldquo;If it is not broken, don't fix it&rdquo;. We had no option but to change it and the changes are minimalist. The idea that one would go the cumbersome route of going back to the Oireachtas to make those changes is a little over the top. I assure Senators of my good faith in this matter. The only time a scheme or part of a scheme will be removed from the Schedule is when the scheme in question becomes obsolete.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the schemes change from time to time. All the old schemes will remain on the list for as long as applications are processed in the Department. They may not all be removed at the same time, but one or two of the 28 may be deleted from time to time. The effect of this amendment would mean putting down a number of draft regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It would generate a whole sequence of events for which there is no real necessity. I have no difficulty in principle with that, provided fairly major undertakings are given, but in this case I assure the Deputy there is no need for that. It can be done by way of regulations. For that reason, I find it impossible to accept the amendment.</P>

The amendment concerned a scheme or part of a scheme being removed from the Schedule. The Minister said he is acting in good faith and it would only be in the event of a scheme becoming obsolete that it would be removed. I accept the Minister's bona fides in that regard &ndash; I thought that is what he would say. At the same time he will accept that there is a specific point being made in the amendment.

I am sure the goat headage scheme in disadvantaged areas is of particular interest to the Minister and to all Members of the House. One could make the case that if there were many appeals in relation to a particular scheme, the Minister might wish to remove that scheme and not allow appeals, but he knows well, as we all know, that the vigilance of the farm organisations, the Farm Centre and others would ensure that could not happen.

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 27, to delete &ldquo;to the Director&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of what I am trying to achieve in this amendment, that is, instead of referring in legislation to an appeals officer, the director should make the decisions. In section 8 I suggest that the words &ldquo;the decision shall, on notice of appeal being given to the Director&rdquo; be <Col N="534" /> deleted and that it read &ldquo;on notice of appeal being given within the prescribed time and in the prescribed form, be referred to the Director&rdquo;. That same concept is everywhere else. I know the Minister is anxious to almost replicate the social welfare appeals system but I do not think it is necessary to make things exactly the same if we can improve on it and it would be improved if the changes I suggest were included.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 suggests that &ldquo;An appeals officer&rdquo; be deleted in section 9 and that it be substituted by &ldquo;The director or an officer acting under his or her delegated authority&rdquo;. It is exactly the same concept. It would give a strengthened independence, even if it does not go as far as I would like it to, that is, as far as the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Ombudsman or the data commissioner. I will withdraw the amendments in the belief the Minister will reconsider them, give them his attention and that the provisions will be improved before the Bill is finally enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look further at these amendments. Our difficulty stems from the fact I set out to have a body replicating the social welfare appeals body in every respect, and I want to remain faithful to that concept. I want an appeals body which is seen to be independent and which provides an efficient service to the various clients. The social welfare appeals office has been doing this for a decade and its structure is based on a director who acts as chief appeals officer who assigns various cases to appeals officers who are independent in their functions and whose decisions can be reviewed by the director. The Minister will keep his nose out of it and will have no hand, act or part in the process. It would not be his or her role or function to interfere in any way with the determination of appeals. Therefore, the day to day operations would be under the exclusive control of the director and his or her officers, and I want to retain this structure. Accepting these amendments would mean no separation of functions between the director and the appeals officers, and their independence would be weakened as a result. However, I will further examine the amendments in the light of the case made by the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise that I could not contribute on Second Stage. I wish to raise the issue that the appeals officer can determine a case &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;. Experience suggests to those of us who have had to deal with the Department that a time limit should be imposed. Section 10 says the Minister may issue guidelines with respect to the time within which a decision of an <Col N="535" /> officer should be notified to an appellant. It might be no harm if the length of time for an appeal was specified. The experience of those of us involved in these schemes is that the difficulty is often getting a decision, not the nature of the decision. Frequently one can live with the adjudication but getting it is a problem. Providing that it be made &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; leaves it open ended. There is a very significant aspect to this as moneys due to the complainant can be held up for a very long time. In some cases these moneys are the only source of income for the farmer &ndash; on occasion they constitute the entire disposable income deriving from the farm.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is correct in saying I noted what the Law Reform Commission said about the language used in legislation. The language in this Bill is reasonably clear and straightforward and the old campaign I conducted while on the other side of the House against the term &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; is beginning to pay off. However, it still creeps in on occasion. Section 14(2) for example states &ldquo;The Director . shall furnish to him or her information in relation to such matters .&rdquo;  What is wrong with saying &ldquo;about such matters&rdquo; or &ldquo;regarding such matters&ldquo;? I do not understand why we must include such jargon.</P>
      <P>One difficulty with many of these schemes is the forms used. I have a third level qualification in agriculture and find it difficult to ensure my area aid form is filled in and returned accurately. I often wish that even a humble journalist was asked to cast their eye over these forms&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; in section 8(4) was referred to on a number of occasions on Second Stage. I understand the point being made very well as there is money involved and the length of time in determining an appeal is very important. We do not want bodies to have an indefinite time when considering and determining an appeal. I looked at other bodies, including the social welfare appeals body, which does not have a time limit. I also looked at An Bord Pleanála where a number of years ago an appeal could take months, or up to a year and a half. Projects, which could provide a few jobs in a village for example, were held up almost indefinitely. To address this they set an objective to get appeals through the system within a number of weeks. On Second Stage I stated I would draw up guidelines under the Bill to set such an objective, with a maximum period of 12 weeks. I wish it was far shorter, but was reminded by my very efficient and professional officers in the Department of the dangers of setting a statutory limit. <Col N="536" /> For example, under the REP scheme if two neighbours had a problem with a boundary ditch or if there was a problem with the local corporation or county council, the process could drag on for a while and there would be fairly serious difficulties if a statutory time limit was imposed.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems clients have with the Department are fairly simple and are sometimes described as innocent errors. Some farmers wrongly identify the sex of an animal and may put the wrong entry on what is called the blue card. This is not done deliberately, but is a serious problem for the farmer as they could lose a considerable amount of headage or premia payments, with a two year deduction in some instances.</P>
      <P>The most frequently recurring problem is the farmer forgetting to sign forms. He just fills up the form, posts it off and forgets to sign it. That causes problems. In all of those cases the turn around time should be quite rapid. I cannot specify it in the Bill itself but I will do so in the guidelines. I have searched for a way to make sure that turn around time is as short as possible. I have been advised that we cannot have a statutory length of time but the guidelines will be very tight in this regard.</P>

      <P>At Second Stage we talked about the whole area of oral hearings. I have some experience of attending social welfare appeals and I believe the oral hearing is critical. It is an essential and very important event in an appeal. So much can be put on paper but many people cannot put the full story, particularly if some event has led to a mistake leading to an appeal. In my experience, the opportunity for a person to attend an oral hearing and fill in the gaps makes a huge difference.</P>
      <P>I asked at Second Stage for clarification on what discretion the appeals officer would have in relation to holding an oral hearing. I am anxious that this amendment be accepted because if people request an oral hearing they should get it. They know when they need one.

The question of a hearing being held in private is in the same context. <Col N="537" /> It may be in the best interests of the appellant that it be held in private but having it as an oral hearing will strengthen people's ability to make an appeal.</P>

I know people will suggest there may be frivolous requests for a hearing but it is only if a person has bother with a Department that they will go through this procedure. In most cases we hope conscientious and fair minded officers will determine the appeal and send the money to the client.

      <P>At the rate at which the Minister is taking amendments I had better support this one. When I was on the other side of the House I had a lamentable record with regard to the acceptance of amendments. It may have been due to the Government of the time rather than my inability to argue my case.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara has a reasonable point. I am a member of the same committee and she is correct that we have suggested it should be by oath or affirmation. It should not be by substitution of one word for the other. I do not expect the situation will arise often, if at all. As the Minister is in such a mood of largesse I hitch my wagon to the proposals for amendment. I will be very disappointed if the Minister does not accept the amendment. It will be known then that it was my intervention that ensured its rejection.</P>

      <P>I think that good run is over. At first sight, these amendments seem to be uncontroversial. The advice I am given may be a little different from the advice given to Senator O'Meara. I have checked this matter with the Attorney General's office. My advice is that the courts are now accepting an affirmation and that extends to this office as well as to the courts. I see no reason why the agriculture appeals office should not cater for citizens who prefer this form of declaration. However, it should be noted that under the Interpretation Act, 1937, the word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; includes the word &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo;. Therefore, Senators can be assured that their concerns in this matter have already been met and there is no need to insert the word &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; for this purpose means oath or affirmation.</P>
      <P>I will double-check just in case there is any difficulty between Senator O'Meara's advice and mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with this amendment. To accept it would involve a fundamental change in the rationale for setting up the appeals office. This stems from my original premise that this office should be identical to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>The point in setting up an expert tribunal is to enable people who are specialists in the schemes and the issues involved to review decisions on the basis of expertise rather than having to gear up from first principles. Courts have to do this. By the time a decision has emerged from the appeals process, the issues will have been considered twice by specialists, once by the original decision-maker and once by the appeals office.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in section 11(2) whereby the director may at any time revise a decision of an appeals officer if it appears the decision was wrong either in law or in fact. The purpose of the appeals process is to bring some finality to the matter. Obviously it is necessary to provide for error within the appeals process.</P>
      <P>This is covered by section 12, which provides for appeal to the High Court on a point of law. If the appellant feels that the appeals office has made an error in law, and this includes unreasonableness or lack of fair procedure as well as misinterpretation of the rules, then he or she may appeal to the courts.</P>
      <P>I feel that this is a preferable way to deal with these issues. There seems little point in building up this administrative appeals machinery if its decisions can be appealed on merits. If an appeal were to be brought to the courts on the merits of the case then the Circuit Court rather than the High Court would be the appropriate body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In view of the serious lack of confidence in consumers of beef internationally, Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House and discuss the BSE crisis from a public health point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for State. I was very careful about the wording I used in this motion. I used the words &lsquo;internationally' and &lsquo;discuss'. I am disappointed at the Government's amendment. I believe that my motion is not contentious, yet the Government proposes to delete everything after the words &ldquo;In view of&rdquo; and then substitute something else. Having listened to what is said and having looked at my motion, I hope the Government side will not push the amendment. I would <Col N="542" /> have some difficulty withdrawing what I have put down.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we are now well used to discussing the BSE crisis in this House; we have done it so often. However, we usually do so from the producer's viewpoint rather than from the perspective of the customer. For once, I would like to approach this question from a different angle. To ask us to look at the BSE crisis from the viewpoint of the customer is not in any way to denigrate the size of the problem from an agricultural perspective. I am on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I find that often I am the one that thinks of the customer first because of the business I am in rather than those who think of the farmer's interests. Both are important.</P>
    <P>As I said in this House before Christmas, the recent turns in the BSE story have made it not just an agricultural problem but a problem of national significance. I can fully understand and empathise with the feelings of the farmers. At the Joint Oireachtas Committee we recently had a delegation from the workers in the processing plants who feel hard done by in this matter. Nevertheless it would be of benefit to look at the problem from the customer's point of view. That benefit will go to the agriculture sector as well. My motion was purposely worded to look at it from the customer's point of view as opposed to the producer's point of view.</P>
    <P>The one lesson which emerges above all from this sorry saga is that we have moved to an age where the market for food in general, and meat and beef in particular, is firmly driven by customers rather than producer concerns. We have got to get that message across to everybody. The sooner we all face up to that change, the better we will be able to cope with the situation that results from that very change. The traditional position which held until quite recently was that the market followed the producer. The producer produced the goods and then looked for somebody to buy them. The customer featured in this scenario only incidentally as the person who actually consumed the meat at the end of the chain. That applies not just to meat but to the whole production of food in general. The tradition was so producer driven that at times it sought to do away with the customer altogether. If customers would not buy, goods would be produced and put into storage rather than into the market. We did that for so long. Those days are gone forever. We have to get that message across, particularly to the farming community and to those in charge of that area.</P>
    <P>The change to a market focused industry might have happened gradually over many years if it were not for one thing. The BSE problem identified on 26 March 1996 changed everything. It was a wake up call for customers throughout Europe and further afield. Suddenly overnight they were thrust from a situation where they never questioned the safety of the beef they ate to one where there were major question marks <Col N="543" /> over it on an international basis. Within the space of a few months in 1996 customers showed that they were calling the shots. In the face of the BSE threat they responded with the only power available to them &ndash; they stopped buying beef altogether or stopped buying it from places where they thought it might be infected with BSE.</P>
    <P>One can say their reaction was unjustified and was created by scare stories in the media. However, that is beside the point. Within a matter of months the balance of power in the European food market had changed decisively and customers were calling the shots. Governments were slow to respond to this change while producers were even slower. Once the change had been made there was no going back. The days when the public took the safety of food for granted were over and they were no longer prepared to take the say so of the producer.</P>
    <P>At that stage they wanted an independent scientifically based voice to tell them what was and was not safe. They no longer believed what producers or the Department of Agriculture told them. They felt, rightly or wrongly, that the Department was a spokesperson for the producers. Out of all this emerged the realisation that food safety was not an agricultural issue to be decided on agricultural terms but that it was a customer issue and, more precisely, a public health issue.</P>
    <P>What does this mean now? It means that our approach to food safety issues like BSE should be driven from the perspective of the customer, not from the perspective of the producer. It should be driven from the perspective of public health, not from the perspective of farmers. If it is driven from the customer angle all the focus should be on getting it right from the customer's point of view. I strongly believe that if we succeed in getting it right from the customer's point of view the producer's side will look after itself. In other words, what is in the customer's interests is also in the interests of the food industry, certainly in the long term and maybe also in the short term.</P>
    <P>The biggest task in Ireland and across Europe and, to some extent, across the rest of the world is to rebuild confidence in the safety of meat. In 1993 I was a member of the expert committee on food which established An Bord Bia. When we put forward the proposal to establish An Bord Bia my proposal was a minority one and I did it with reluctance as I was not able to convince the rest of the committee that An Bord Bia should be placed under the aegis of any Department other than the Department of Agriculture. I knew then that this was right and that if we wanted to have a food industry we had to be careful to ensure it was driven by customers, the market and those who buy rather than by those who produce. We are again making the same argument in strong terms. Rebuilding confidence depends crucially on what producers do and how they behave. They cannot expect to be judges in their own case. Customers want an impartial <Col N="544" /> intermediary to tell them what is right. This is why the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible to the Minister for Health and Children, not the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I was delighted the Government made that decision when that case came up. This is why David Byrne is the EU Commissioner responsible for food safety, not the Commissioner for Agriculture. That is the system we have to work with and the system we have to work to.</P>
    <P>One of the questions which arises is whether we are working well enough to it. A fortnight ago &ndash; this is what really galls and worries me &ndash; the EU decided to ban the sale of T-bone steak in several countries, including Ireland, but not including Britain or Portugal. The customers I met on the shop floor had full confidence in Irish beef before they read that a scientific veterinary committee based in Europe with no bias had said that Britain and Portugal are okay but Ireland and a number of other countries had not convinced it. This is what has worried and frightened customers. Unless the Minister tells us something else, we have nobody to blame but ourselves. In 1996 we, like the rest of Europe, recognised the crisis. However, what we did was not enough to convince the veterinary people in 2001 that we took the right steps.</P>
    <P>This ban two weeks ago created a furore among the agricultural community. I want to focus on its effect on customers who were devastated by the decision. They were devastated because from the beginning of the BSE crisis they had been encouraged to see Britain as the main source of BSE. During the early days most people were prepared to buy beef as long as they were sure it was Irish beef, that is, beef from the Twenty-six Counties, the Republic. It was a firm part of the public's picture of events that while we had a limited BSE problem it was nothing compared with that in Britain. However, suddenly a few weeks ago we heard the reverse, that British beef was safer than Irish beef. This single piece of bad news had a more devastating effect on the public than anything else over the past several years. It totally conflicted with what they had firmly believed up to then and it seemed to come from an authoritative source. Of course it is not true that Irish beef is less safe than British beef. I certainly do not believe that, but given the enormous damage such a statement can make there is something wrong somewhere along the line that mistakes of this kind can be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>This goes back to what I said earlier &ndash; the new situation demands that everything is driven from the perspective of the customer which crucially includes how the customer perceives the situation. An added difficulty is that once the customer's perception on an issue shifts, it is difficult to shift it back, regardless of the truth.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an interesting debate on this important issue. I look forward to a debate from the customer's point of view and from the point of view of trying to find out what went wrong. How is it that such damage has been done in the <Col N="545" /> public's mind and how can we correct this? In 1996 we had the ball at our feet and Britain was in trouble. However, four and a half years later we are the ones who are told by an independent committee of veterinary scientists, &ldquo;You have a problem, you have not convinced us that you have solved it but Britain and Portugal have convinced us&rdquo;. We have a case to answer in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil tabled an amendment to the motion. Instead of showing it as an international problem, we are grappling it to our chests once again as another Irish problem, which it is not. It is an international problem and we are trying to manage it as well as we can, and are probably doing so better than most. This amendment once again makes it a national problem.</P>
      <P>This is a health problem. If it were not for the fact that there is transmission to humans of this disease from infected animals we would not be sitting here with the beef markets having gone down the way they have and with the markets in Egypt and other places closed. We should stop addressing this solely as a beef trade problem, which it is, and address it as a health problem. If we eradicate BSE we will not have the problem. Why can we not concentrate on this aspect?</P>
      <P>There are many problems for people regarding BSE in cattle but it is the development of new variant CJD in humans which is the real problem. It is accepted universally that a link exists and that the main route of infection is oral. We know that Kuru, a form of CJD, existed some years ago in a tribe in Papua New Guinea where the funeral rites involved the eating of the dead person. The men ate the muscle, the meat, while the women and children were relegated to eating the brain and other organs. It was the women and children who frequently developed a form of CJD. When the tribe was persuaded to stop the practice of eating human meat the disease died out. They eradicated the disease.</P>
      <P>The ingestion of infected beef, not healthy beef, appears to cause new variant CJD. The disease has not been around long enough for us to know all about it internationally, not just in Ireland. We have no test for it and we do not know the incubation period but it seems to be quite long. The extreme precautions now being taken in the production of beef here, if they are adhered to by all farmers and meat processing factories, must mean we are on the way to the eradication of BSE and the transmission of prions with or without viruses to other animals, including humans who eat beef. The risk of getting infection with verocytotoxic e.coli is probably greater than getting an infection from BSE. That has already had lethal effects on at least one and maybe two children in Ireland. There has been one case of new variant CJD here from a person who had lived most of their life in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem I want to address for the medical profession and I am pleased the Mini<Col N="546" /> ster of State, Deputy Moffatt, is present. Can BSE be transmitted through blood transfusions or the use of blood products or corneal grafts? We know that a form of CJD was transmitted to children of small stature who were treated with growth hormones obtained from human pituitaries from cadavers. One definite case and two possible cases of the transmission of old style CJD have occurred through corneal grafts. We get our corneas either from people in Ireland or from people in the United States where there is no problem with BSE. We are refraining from bringing in corneas from the UK where the problem with CJD is much greater.</P>
    <P>Trying to communicate properly when one is uncertain is very difficult but the Department of Health and Children needs to make more of an effort to try to reassure people. The precautionary process is there and something has to be done about risk analysis. I think the risk is much less than most people think.</P>
    <P>The knock on effect in terms of blood transfusions is serious and it needs to be addressed here as well as internationally. The advent of safe blood transfusions and blood products has been extraordinarily important in saving lives in the last century and we want it to continue into this one. Recent serious problems with infected blood products in this country and others have naturally made people nervous that the same could happen with BSE.</P>
    <P>Experimental work on mice showed that blood extracted from mice which had been infected with BSE and which were symptomatic, when injected intra-cerebrally into healthy mice caused BSE. If the infected blood was given intravenously the infection rate was much lower. Where sheep were fed BSE prions and their blood was transfused into healthy sheep, some developed BSE. Therefore, even though there is no evidence of new variant CJD being acquired by blood transfusions in any of the known cases in the UK, where most cases have occurred, we have to take precautions with blood. The careful selection of donors has become even more rigorous and given that only 3% of the Irish public who are suitable give blood, maintaining the blood supply is difficult. The most infective part of blood is considered to be the buffy coat, where the while cells and proteins are, and this has been removed from all blood here for some years.</P>
    <P>A number of countries, including Belgium, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have banned donations from any person who has spent more than six months in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996. If we in Ireland did that immediately we would suffer a 13% loss of donors. Such would be the decrease in our supply of blood, some people would almost certainly die, most elective surgery would be cancelled and there might even be the postponement of surgery for non-trauma cases. Even if we did that there would not be much benefit because people here have eaten imported beef products from England <Col N="547" /> during that period so that we could set up a smookscreen for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Now everywhere in the world is in trouble with blood supplies. We can buy in a certain amount of blood products such as solvent-detergent treated plasma from the US and use fibrinogen instead of cyoprecipitate. Surgical techniques are constantly monitored to reduce loss of blood and the need for blood but in some cases it is the only remedy for haemorrhage, not least in maternity cases. Blood loss is a major cause of maternal mortality, the death of women in childbirth, in countries which do not have a good blood transfusion service.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to initiate and sustain a campaign to increase the number of blood donors here and to encourage lapsed donors to give blood again. I ask him to give full support to the education of hospital personnel in the optimal use of blood and to help them ensure efficiencies at all stages of the blood transfusion chain. Not one good drop of blood can be lost.</P>
    <P>Alternatives to blood can sometimes be used and a small amount of blood products can be sourced from countries which are BSE free. Only a national effort in the promotion of blood donation initiated and sustained by the Minister for Health and Children will address the serious shortage.</P>
    <P>I hope speakers will address this issue other than from the beef producers point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, my primary concern is public health and the safety of food consumed by the public. I welcome this opportunity to discuss the public health aspects of BSE in the Seanad and thank the House for affording me the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to BSE, I am concerned with the public health implications of this disease and any risk it poses to humans. BSE was first identified in the UK in 1986. From the outset of the epidemic in the UK, Ireland acknowledged that it might have a BSE problem in the national herd and has been introducing a series of risk reduction measures since the first case of BSE was identified here in 1989.</P>

    <P>Ireland's BSE controls are among the strictest in the world and include: a legal obligation to notify the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of any animal affected with BSE or suspected of being affected; the culling and destruction of all herds and birth cohorts of BSE animals; the removal and destruction of specified risk materials, highly infectious material such as brain and spinal cord &ndash; this measure was <Col N="548" /> introduced in Ireland in February 1997 and was not introduced on a horizontal basis across Europe until October 2000; the introduction of comprehensive and effective licensing and control measures to prevent feed mills which manufacture rations for ruminants from using meat and bonemeal in the manufacture of feed for other species &ndash; this measure, taken here in October 1996, effectively prevented the type of cross-contamination which a number of other member states have freely admitted was still occurring in their feed mills up to last year; in September 2000, Ireland began using one of the then recently validated rapid diagnostic tests to test all casualty animals at factories and in October began testing a random sample of fallen animals &ndash; the EU requirement was that member states should commence this targeted active surveillance from 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>In response to consumer concerns about food safety, including the emergence of BSE, the Government decided to establish an independent, science-based consumer-oriented food safety agency, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is accountable to the Minister for Health and Children. The FSAI was formally established in January 1999 and it is developing a seamless inspection service from farm gate to the point of sale to consumers via a series of service contracts with all the official regulatory agencies. It audits the control measures in place. It has set up a sub-committee of its scientific committee which specifically addresses BSE issues and it is currently performing a risk assessment of beef on the bone. In view of the European Commission decision last week on T-bone steaks, we eagerly await the advice from the Food Safety Authority on the matter.</P>
    <P>To reassure Senators in relation to this matter, particularly Senator Quinn, the UK and Portugal received a derogation from the recent Commission decision to ban the sale of meat containing vertebral column, that is, T-bone steaks, because they had put in place traceability measures. Under the terms of the decision, Ireland can apply for such a derogation. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is currently performing a risk assessment of beef on the bone. The results of this risk assessment exercise are expected in March. This data will be used in Ireland's application for a derogation. When the initial vote on the issue was taken by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee, Ireland abstained in protest at its very strict controls not being considered in regard to the Commission's proposed decision. The fact that Commissioner Byrne is an Irishman played a part in this because he did not like to show favouritism towards Ireland. However, when our assessment takes place we believe we will get that derogation because we have been ahead of the posse in all matters relating to BSE in Europe.</P>
    <P>Most recently, a number of additional measures have been adopted at EU level to address the consumer concerns across Europe in <Col N="549" /> relation to the safety of beef. These included the banning from 1 January 2001 of the feeding of meat and bonemeal to all farm animals until 30 June 2001 and a requirement that all animals over 30 months entering the food chain be tested for BSE using one of the rapid diagnostic tests. In this regard, there has been some discussions in recent times about the usefulness of these tests. What is clear is that each of the tests validated by the Commission proved extremely accurate in identifying the infective agent in samples from diseased animals in the course of the Commission's validation exercise. All three validated tests have also detected BSE in some clinical animals. However, none can be taken as providing an absolute guarantee that BSE is not in the very early stages of incubation in tested animals, although to date none of the BSE cases detected in Ireland has been in animals born since the enhanced controls adopted in 1996 and 1997 began to take effect. The rapid tests, therefore, should be seen as a very valuable addition to the existing range of BSE measures which remain in place &ndash; no more and no less. In this context, it is undoubtedly reassuring that more than 46,000 animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption have been tested since 2 January 2001, all with negative results.</P>
    <P>The list of specified risk materials has been extended. It is now acknowledged that feeding of contaminated meat and bonemeal is the most likely mode of transmission of BSE in cattle. The feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants was banned here in 1990, four years before the EU-wide ban. Unfortunately, this ban was not fully complied with until 1996. Opportunities for cross-contamination in mills and on farms existed until dedicated mills for ruminant feed were introduced, specified risk material was excluded from the manufacture of meat and bonemeal, rendering at high temperatures and pressures was installed in Irish rendering plants and meat and bonemeal use was confined to 17 pig farms under licence from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The incubation period for BSE is said to be between two and ten years. The incidence of BSE in Ireland indicates that all new cases were born in or before 1996 with the age profile continuing to rise. This gives confidence in compliance with the meat and bonemeal ban since that date.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Ireland's BSE controls have been judged by the EU scientific assessors as &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; from 1 January 1998. This means that all three main stability factors, feeding, rendering and SRM removal, are in place, well controlled, implemented and audited. Animals born after this date would not have had access to contaminated meat and bonemeal, therefore, beef from these animals should be as safe as beef has ever been. Since 1996 we have been aware of the link between BSE in cows and new variant CJD, commonly known as vCJD, in humans. In relation to the source of vCJD infection, the most <Col N="550" /> likely explanation is the ingestion by humans of BSE-contaminated food.</P>
    <P>CJD is a rare transmissible encephalopathy in humans and is the collective name for a group of diseases which can cause progressive dementia and a loss of control of movement and balance. There is a number of categories of this condition, including sporadic or classic and new variant CJD or vCJD as it is known. Until recently, the overall global incidence of CJD was approximately one case per million per year. However, this has increased in recent years, with the increase most likely due to greater awareness and active surveillance, as well as improvements in diagnosis.</P>
    <P>New variant CJD was first described in Britain in 1996. Clinically, these cases present at an earlier age and are different from classic CJD. The presenting features include behavioural disturbances followed by difficulties with balance and walking. The average survival time from diagnosis is approximately 13.5 months, which is longer than in the case of classic or sporadic CJD. Confirmation of vCJD is by post-mortem neuropathological examination. There has been one confirmed case of vCJD in Ireland. This individual had resided in Britain at the height of the BSE epidemic there.</P>
    <P>Humans may have been exposed to the BSE agent through different routes, including consumption of contaminated food, contaminated pharmaceutical products, medical instruments, transplants, blood donations and cosmetics.</P>
    <P>The consumption of beef is not a risk factor for vCJD, rather it is the consumption of contaminated beef products. Current information indicates that BSE infectivity resides in brain, spinal cord and other specified risk material. The consumption of this material is high risk and possibly exposure to BSE may only have occurred in those who may have eaten such material.</P>
    <P>Some meat remains on carcase skeletons following deboning by conventional techniques. In the past, additional meat was removed from the skeleton mechanically. This practice involved putting the skeletons into machines, which using high pressure removed residual meat and tissues. This mechanically removed meat, known as MRM, would have contained spinal cord and other SRM and was used for economy burgers, pies and other low grade meat products. This may have been the most infective material entering the human food chain in the UK. The practice, rarely used in Ireland, was banned in May 1996.</P>
    <P>The belief that consumption of BSE-infected material has led to the onset of vCJD in humans has led to theoretical concerns that vCJD could be transmitted to humans by other routes such as blood, as stated by Senator Henry. While there is no proven instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products, the theoretical possibility associated with variant CJD cannot be excluded at this time. There is currently no screening test to detect the presence of vCJD. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has stated that he <Col N="551" /> will ensure the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has adequate resources to introduce proven new technologies in this area.</P>
    <P>Strategies are in place and further strategies are planned which address this possible risk. For example, plasma-based factor 8 and 9, which is used by the vast majority of haemophiliacs, has been replaced with recombinant products which are genetically produced and are not manufactured using human plasma. In addition, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has introduced leucodepletion for all blood donations, a filtering process that removes white cells which are suspected of containing infected material.</P>
    <P>On 12 December 2000, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, met the chairperson, chief executive officer and the national medical director of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and was briefed concerning a number of strategies which the board is considering to further reduce or minimise the possible risk of transmission of new variant CJD by blood transfusion. One of the measures under consideration concerns the deferral of donors who resided in the United Kingdom for a cumulative period of six months or more between 1980 and 1996. The IBTS is also considering the deferral of donors who have had a blood transfusion. Such donors are deferred at present for a period of 12 months after a transfusion. Deferrals of donors in such combined circumstances would reduce the current donor pool by approximately 20% to 25% which would have serious implications for the hospital services and consequently for patient care. Other measures are also under consideration, such as the replacement of products currently manufactured by the IBTS, including red cells, by products sourced in BSE free countries, and optimal use of blood components.</P>
    <P>In considering additional measures to reduce or minimise a possible risk of new variant CJD there is a balance of risks involved. Implementation of measures outlined above could result in a sustained shortage of blood which would have significant implications for patient safety. On 5 February 2001, the Minister announced the issue of the paper, A Guideline for the Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients, produced by the National Blood Users Group, a multi-disciplinary group of experts from hospitals nationally. The guideline states that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to donated blood should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss. My Department is currently making this guideline available to all hospitals, general practitioners and medical schools.</P>
    <P>Given the need to take full account of the balance of risks involved, the IBTS arranged a special conference on 15 February which involved national and international experts on new variant <Col N="552" /> CJD and blood transfusion. The conference considered existing and planned strategies relevant to new variant CJD and a special board meeting has been arranged for 28 February to consider the outcome of the conference and decide on the most appropriate strategies in the light of the expert opinion. The IBTS will also liaise with the CJD advisory group in relation to any proposals relevant to new variant CJD which it proposes to implement.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that concerns have recently been expressed regarding vaccine safety and the theoretical transmission of new variant CJD. The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. My Department has requested the IMB to identify from its licensed products those which are derived from bovine and human sources.</P>
    <P>In September 1996, to be in a position to respond rapidly and in an appropriate manner to the issue of CJD, the Minister for Health and Children established a CJD advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall of the virus reference laboratory in UCD. The other members of the group are drawn from experts in the fields of veterinary science, food safety, neuropathology, haematology, infectious diseases, medicines, and public health. The group's function is to advise the Minister on all issues relating to CJD and to provide advice to him on specific issues referred to it from time to time. The group meets approximately six times per annum and has to date provided advice on risk management strategies in relation to food safety, transplants, blood products, vaccines and medical instrumentation and has overseen the establishment of an active surveillance system for CJD based at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children and other medical experts are also represented on the separate BSE advisory group which has been set up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The best way to ensure that the health and safety of our citizens is protected in relation to BSE and new variant CJD is to base the measures we adopt on the best scientific information available and to enforce controls effectively. I have outlined the control measures on BSE taken by this country since the first emergence of the disease here. I have also described the measures taken by my Department in relation to new variant CJD on human health.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion and am pleased we were in a position to accede to Senators Quinn and Henry on the issue. We all have one concern. We know we have the safest and best quality meat. That is the message we want to go out loud and clear. I have outlined the reason we did not get the derogation but I have no doubt we will do so when the full facts are drawn to the attention of the Commission's veterinary surgeons.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support the motion. I compliment Senator Fitzpatrick on his common sense in withdrawing the amendment. As a medical doctor he probably did not want it to be tabled. At least he had the initiative to withdraw it.</P>
      <P>My party's spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Dukes, has been very proactive in addressing the issue of BSE and CJD. He organised a consultative forum on BSE in the Green Isle Hotel last month which I attended and found very informative. Deputy Dukes brought together the main players from the veterinary world, the medical world, the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited and many others. It was a most enlightening day in terms of the exchange of ideas, questions raised, fears expressed and in addressing the concerns of the two farming organisations who, like us all, are very concerned about the effects on farming, public health and consumers.</P>
      <P>Dr. Michael Farrell, consultant neurologist from Beaumont Hospital, explained in a simple way what is CJD and the conditions from which it can emerge. He said there is a personal genetic susceptibility to CJD in people occurring by sporadic mutation, with no outside agent involved, at a rate of approximately one person per million, although the incidence might increase. He also pointed out that it may arise from accidents in medicine as through the use of growth hormones.</P>
      <P>Dr. Farrell went on to explain that new variant CJD, or vCJD, as discovered relatively recently in Edinburgh, is different from previous forms of CJD and affects people under the age of 30, which is alarming. Previously CJD was a disease of older people. I believe a friend of mine was diagnosed as having CJD. It was shocking and frightening to see a strong, intelligent individual deteriorate so quickly to his death over a period of 18 months.</P>
      <P>Dr. Farrell referred to the fact that all victims of CJD have a specific genetic make-up, but there is no test to discover this susceptibility. In his opinion it would be pointless to try to develop one due to ongoing mutation of the agent. His last point was that given that the agents in BSE and vCJD are the same, they can mutate sporadically and it is likely that we will continually see new versions of this type of disease. That is quite frightening and it has come from a medical expert like Dr. Michael Farrell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to a presentation by Dr. John Griffin from the epidemiological unit in UCD who is vet. He referred to the fact that most animals get the disease when young due to the nature of the digestive tract at that age and the ongoing development of the brain and that cows in Ireland aged five and six years show by far the highest incidence of BSE. Even when allowance is made for normal culling of older animals, the older animals show less incidence than the five and six year olds. He also referred to the fact that the <Col N="554" /> increases in Ireland could, at least in part, be due to increased awareness and surveillance, that the number of 1,000 cattle was very low and that incidence of BSE in younger cattle is declining showing that the underlying level of infection is declining in Ireland. That is all fairly positive. However, he then referred to the fact that there is a greater incidence of BSE in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, as we know from reading reports. The hypothesis is that it is caused by cross-contamination from pig and poultry feed to ruminant feed since these areas have very big pig and poultry industries.</P>
    <P>The main question or query from the various people participating in this very interesting forum was, is our definition of specified risk material &ndash; SRM &ndash; wide enough? The question of expanding it to intestines and spleen, even though there is no evidence that these are infected, was raised. Another question raised was, is it confined to the nervous system? As we know from the debate on the Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001, the T-bone steak issue is problematic due to the connection with the spine. I am very anxious that we get feedback on the examination being done by the Food Safety Authority. I do not think we should have to table motions in Private Members' time, as the Independent Senators did. There should be ongoing debate in the House with the various Ministers involved. Fine Gael would prefer to see agriculture and food as a separate ministry. So much has arisen in the food area that it needs to be dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as well as the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who we would like to have seen here tonight.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether humans are susceptible to BSE in its incubation stage was raised. That is a very important question since animals get it at a very young age. Dr. Farrell replied that there is little to no risk and that BSE has very little infectivity in the non-clinical form.</P>
    <P>The question as to how we rid ourselves of carcasses, etc., was raised. It was suggested that incineration was possibly the best method of destroying the prion but that one needed a temperature of 1,000 degrees centigrade. It was suggested that perhaps we should look at gasification, which is done in Scotland, where there would be no dioxins and that this would be a better option for incinerating biological material.</P>
    <P>To put this issue in perspective, what we really need is education for farmers and consumers. We must identify and learn from errors in the past. Future action must be based on best scientific knowledge and more money must be devoted to research. We must reduce fear by providing authoritative, credible and scientific based information for consumers and move away from headline gripping media. Top class scientific resources have to be put in place because this will go on and on. I agree fully with Senators that we cannot keep people in the dark. We must educate farmers and consumers and put money into research which must be credible and science based.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to make a contribution to the motion tabled by Senator Quinn who has long been involved in the food trade. He knows what he is talking about more than most of us here. He has been talking about the farm to the fork for years. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who gave an excellent speech &ndash; an overview of the state of safety in relation to CJD. We can be assured that he and his Department are taking all steps to ensure the food chain is as safe as is humanly possible. However, I was glad I had something to eat before I came to the House given a few of the points he raised. I did not know about this mechanically recovered meat. I will never look at a burger in the same light as I have heretofore. In fact, I do not think I will ever be able to face a burger again.</P>

      <P>This debate has been going on for a few years. When putting a few words together for this debate, I asked myself how did we get it so wrong. We joined the EU and, as Senator Quinn kept insisting tonight, this is an international problem. It is not an Irish problem <i>per se</i>, although it does have Irish ramifications. How did we get it so wrong in the early years? If one puts it in the context of the time, there were good reasons for supporting farmers, the producers and the processors. There were political, industrial and economic reasons to so do. Maybe at some stage we took our eye off the food safety ball or perhaps we did not know enough to keep our eye on it at the time.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made another point he did not labour, although he could have done so, about how the climate has changed. The political power has moved from the producer and the processor to the consumer. This is a huge shift in my lifetime and in that of everybody here. I remember when the producer was the only one who was listened to but now it is the consumer. That is the way it is and it is a very good thing. It has made us all look at how our food is produced. People are taking a deeper interest in food and I am not talking about the food magazines or the long learned articles in <i>The Irish Times </i>on a Saturday about wine, where best to eat or who is the most fashionable chef at the moment. The relationship between the consumer and the producer has changed with a vengeance.</P>
      <P>There are a few things that have drip fed into the people's mind over the years such as the overuse of fertilisers, the abuse of growth hormones &ndash; although I believe they are quite acceptable in the United States but not in Europe &ndash; forced raising of beef, pigs and chickens, fish farming and finally the arrival of BSE/vCJD. These things have made consumers sit up and pay attention and have changed our attitude towards the food industry. The food industry has to pay attention and realise these new realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> There are ironies in this as well. The Minister of State and Senator Henry spoke about blood transfusion and blood products. Last year one of the main items of discussion was genetically modified food. This raised quite a furore at the time and I am not sure the issue has gone away. In medicine, however, we use genetically modified drugs, mainly for diabetes. The Minister of State mentioned genetically produced recombinant products. We cannot ignore genetically modified drugs and foods. We have to have an open mind on them, but at the same time we have to exercise care in their development and use.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 people have died from new variant CJD in the UK. One is too many. One has died in Ireland and that person appears to have picked it up in England. However, that is an Irish statistic.</P>
    <P>I am glad this is not a confrontational debate because it is ongoing. It is about one of the most important areas in our lives, that of food, and the care we take in growing it, processing it and putting it on the table. I am glad Senators Quinn and Henry put down the motion. The Senators raised the matter of legal problems they felt were facing us. I am also glad the Minister came here to discuss the matters raised in an open way and to reassure the House that the problems would not be put on the back burner. There will be continuing vigilance by his Department in the pursuit of the aim of a safe food chain.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak to this motion and to support Senator Fitzpatrick in the withdrawal of the amendment. It is incumbent on us as public representatives at all times to ensure that matters of this nature are considered on an ongoing basis. The Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, Deputy Moffatt, is here to assure us and the people we represent that the measures that needed to be taken have been taken.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to express my deep appreciation to the farming community for providing excellent beef. To a certain extent the farming community has been treated rather unfairly. There are of course rogues in every walk of life and farmers would be the first to say that theirs is no exception. When the news of BSE broke farmers were treated unfairly by RTÉ. We saw <i>ad nauseam</i> the famous image of the cow, which I am pleased to say has been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The measures taken by the Government, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, have been proactive and appropriate. I underline a phrase uttered by Senator Quinn who said that this whole debate is public health driven. It should be public health driven.</P>

      <P>&mdash;which is recognised as one of the major beef producing areas. Whether it be heifers or bullocks, we can produce them and are proud of them. Cattle were never meant to be cannibals. From a layman's point of view, the feeding of meat and bonemeal to cattle was certainly not right. A point made by Senator Fitzpatrick was that we have got into the business of force-feeding and force-producing, not only in the area of beef production but in other agricultural areas.</P>
      <P>CJD is a collective name for a group of diseases which cause progressive dementia and a loss of control of movement and balance. Until recently the number of cases of CJD worldwide was approximately one in a million per year. This has increased recently, most likely due to greater awareness, vigilance and a better diagnostic process. That has to be recognised. Experimental evidence shows that vCJD and BSE are caused by the same agent.</P>
      <P>The brain tissue from vCJD patients and BSE infected animals show similar features. That is an established scientific fact. The most likely source of vCJD in patients is the ingestion of BSE-contaminated food prior to the ban on specified bovine offals. In September 1996 the Minister for Health and Children established a CJD advisory group. Its terms of reference included surveillance of CJD in Ireland, assessment of the scientific developments nationally and internationally, the provision of advice on research strategies for BSE-CJD and the provision of advice to the Minister for Health and Children and of information to the media and the public.</P>
      <P>The protection of Irish food is paramount. As the old saying goes, we are what we eat. Control of the disease in cattle and the protection of the food chain from contaminated material is imperative. In Ireland the reporting of CJD has been mandatory since 1989. This places a statutory obligation on farmers, veterinarians and all others handling animals to notify the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of all animals showing signs of BSE. Prior to slaughter animals are examined for signs of disease, including BSE.</P>
      <P>Upon confirmation of BSE all animals at risk of having been exposed to the BSE agent are traced and slaughtered. That includes the herd of the animal where all under the age of six months were on the same farm at the same time and the off-spring of that animal. The collection, transport, slaughter and destruction of the animals takes place under the direct control of the veterinary office. Production, movement and storage of meat and bonemeal are carried out under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A BSE surveillance programme has been in operation since July 2000. Since 2 January 2001 all animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption have been tested for BSE. BSE was declared a class A disease under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, to benefit from <Col N="558" /> the powers of compulsion in relation to restriction controls and slaughter provided for by it. BSE is compulsorily notifiable under the same Act.</P>
    <P>The feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminant animals directly or through feeding stuffs has been banned since 1990. Since 1 January 2001 the feeding of meat and bonemeal has been banned from all farm animals intended for human consumption. Importation of cattle and bovine products from the UK is prohibited in accordance with EU legislation. Animals imported prior to this are being traced. Veterinary surgeons and farmers have been alerted to the symptoms of the disease.</P>
    <P>A special information campaign was organised. A comprehensive series of controls is in place in relation to BSE which go beyond what is recommended by scientific evidence or international organisations. All beef comes from animals that are slaughtered in approved premises subject to official veterinary supervision.</P>
    <P>This is a debate that will go on. I compliment Senator Quinn for putting down the motion and affording me the opportunity of saying a few words on it. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and all others who have been proactive in ensuring that the food chain in this country is beyond question. In relation to the BSE crisis, they have stepped into the breach and taken a hands-on approach to ensuring that the food we eat is safe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank Senator Quinn for tabling this motion which provides each of us with an opportunity to contribute to the very important ongoing debate on BSE, a debate which I feel is at times over-emphasised in the media. There are food safety issues other than BSE which are probably far more serious from a health point of view but these are not receiving the attention they deserve. Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister's contribution.</P>
      <P>The consumer chain &ndash; I will not call it the food chain &ndash; extends from the primary producer, namely, the farmer, to the processor, distributor, retailer and consumer. I am aware of Senator Quinn's deep commitment to quality as represented by his crowning of the customer but he did not use the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; at any point in his contribution. Instead, he used the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; throughout. I do not wish to nit-pick but we must focus on consumers' needs and provide them with the best quality product we can produce, be it at home or internationally. If we do that, we will build up a very important international food business. Ireland must become a centre of excellence in food production and that will require action in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must adopt a less adversarial approach to food production. Unfortunately, when a problem arises in this area, fingers are pointed and blame is apportioned. Food safety is everybody's problem and we must approach it in that manner. Dis<Col N="559" /> tributors and consumers can help primary producers to overcome problems and <i>vice versa. </i>Beef production in Ireland is primarily grass based. We are not forcing beef production in the manner it is being forced in other countries. We do not have big feeding lots in which animals are chained down and held indoors all their lives. Our animals graze for nine months of the year and are fed silage during the winter months. In a small number of cases, supplementary feed is provided. Irish beef production is quality all the way.</P>
    <P>Primary producers must, however, change their attitude in many areas. Senator Quinn was correct when he said that the structures of the CAP, the intervention system being a classic example, resulted in a focus on production for which farmers received support. A greater focus is required on the production of quality beef. We must insist on better quality animals being bred. Unfortunately, our beef herd is, to a great extent, a derivative of the dairy industry. We do not have the right breeds for beef and we are not focusing sufficiently on that in terms of what the consumer wants.</P>
    <P>We have moved forward considerably over the past decade from the point of view of processing. However, there is still a need for further improvement in this area. It is alarming to think that meat was mechanically recovered in the past and used for consumption. The process even continued for a certain period following the discovery of BSE in the national herd. This cannot happen in the future.</P>
    <P>We must base our practices on the best scientific information available at any given time. Scientific information changes on an ongoing basis and we are learning all the time. It is imperative that we move away from the practices highlighted in the beef tribunal some years ago.</P>
    <P>There is room for improvement in the area of distribution in terms of strengthening the consumer chain. It is vitally important that when a product with a sell-by date is ready to go to market, it is placed on the shelves as soon as possible rather than delaying the process by a week if the sell-by date is not imminent. We must ensure the food consumers buy is as fresh as possible.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that BSE, CJD and new vCJD pose great dangers and can have appalling consequences, as pointed out by Senators Henry and Jackman. However, there are other problems and diseases associated with the food industry which we should not overlook.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the food industry should be taken out of the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and that the activities of all sectors in the consumer chain should be licensed. If primary producers, distributors or retailers breach their licence, they should be barred from engaging in the activity ever again. That may appear to be a overly strong reaction but we are all aware of cases in which farmers injected animals with slurry to produce BSE symptoms. Anybody involved in such prac<Col N="560" /> tices should not be allowed to own an animal ever again.</P>
    <P>As Senator Jackman stated, we need far greater independent State investment in research and development and staff training. In order to inculcate a culture of food safety, traceability is vitally important. This should not be used as a stick with which to beat people, rather as a tool to build consumer confidence. If properly used, it would protect all of the interested parties in the industry.</P>

      <P>I may be the only beef producer to contribute to this debate. I listened with interest to the Minister's address &ndash; I will not call it a speech &ndash; which was the most informative one I have ever heard in regard to the action the Department of Health and Children, as represented by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is taking in this area. I am curious to know whether the newspapers will carry this story on their front pages tomorrow or whether they will give preference to some nonsense about somebody being seen somewhere he or she should not have been saying or doing something he or she should not have said or done. Will RTÉ news programmes carry the detail of information that was given here this evening, which is readily available to both the print and electronic media, on what the State and the Department of Health and Children are doing relative to ensuring the health and safety of people?</P>
      <P>I thought Senator Henry put down the motion because she has been raising this issue for some time, but it is immaterial whether it was Senator Henry or Senator Quinn. The motion was tabled and I have no problem with the amendment being withdrawn because the original motion was of significant importance. It gave an opportunity to everybody to have their say here, including the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. That is important. I emphasise that the media, both print and electronic, has a responsibility in this regard but, unfortunately, it has not been responsible. It is with some regret that I say that in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>The issue of BSE is important to the consumer, the producer, the processors and Irish trade. A total of 90% of our beef is exported so we have an in-built discipline, even if it is self-imposed, to produce and deliver to the consumer, both nationally and internationally, a product for which they would come knocking on our door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987, the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, was appointed the country's first Minister for food. I congratulate him on that and ask people to think back to that time in terms of production and processing levels and our general attitude to presentation to the customer and the consumer &ndash; I agree with Senator Gibbons on the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; because we are talking about all consumers. He geared the industry towards higher standards and better quality. I ask people to think <Col N="561" /> back to pre-1987, to the early 1980s and even earlier and the conditions of production and processing that existed then. Thankfully, we have moved on from that and regardless of whether we have BSE, we need high standards of production. We need to ensure that the consumer is getting a product that he or she requires.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the reaction in the media to the serious BSE issue and what I see as an over-reaction. If we examine the official records of what has happened in this country we see that one person has died from the human form of BSE, CJD. That person lived in England during the height of the problem in that country. I am not saying that is where the blame lies but do we have a responsible media? I pose the question because what is said in the electronic and print media is transmitted to all the countries with which we trade, and it must be remembered that we trade with approximately 68 countries throughout the world. We sell a quality product and for the second time in the past two weeks I can say that I have no problem eating a T-bone steak tonight.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked why Ireland lost out on that issue in Europe recently. Have I faith in the scientific body in Europe? I have no faith in it because information has been available to the effect that there have been incidences of BSE in European countries for a considerable period of time but what did that body do about it? The Irish Commissioner, Commissioner Byrne, put emphasis on high quality food and I hope he will bring into being a Europe-wide food safety authority. We need such an authority. We have a food safety authority in this country under Dr. Patrick Wall and it is doing a good job but we do not have a Europe-wide food safety authority. We are allowing food to be imported into this country from countries that are not in the European Union. Can anybody here, even the Minister of State, tell us that meat from South America, for example, or from the southern hemisphere has a safety factor 20% or 50% lower than ours? I can say without fear of contradiction that the meat from South American countries is not 10% of the standards here, it does not reach our quality standards.</P>
    <P>As a primary producer, we support fully a programme being put in place to regulate quality but there are a number of areas between production and the fork. Senator Quinn represents an organisation. Can we trust all of them? Can we trust the restaurants or people who have engaged in importing cheap, poor quality meat? I challenge anybody to contradict me on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak. I am appreciative of the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, came to the House to make his contribution. I was pleased to listen to all the contributions. I support them, but there is something we have to do. A research package has to be put in place and there has to be some form of licensing. Senator Gibbons mentioned that and I totally support it. Everybody has to be licensed to ensure <Col N="562" /> people take responsibility. We have no problem with being licensed. If there are rogue farmers they have to be stopped in their tracks. If there are rogue processors, they must be stopped, and if there are rogue retailers or otherwise, they must be stopped also.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said about the reaction to the BSE problem but I wonder would the media pay the same attention to those of us who smoke tobacco, for example? Would it pay the same attention to the under age drinking problem, which is causing carnage every day of the week? I ask the media to wake up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief input to the debate. I do not put myself forward as an expert on any aspect of the food industry but I want to raise one issue, which I always raise in this debate. The Abattoir Act is the root cause of many of the difficulties we are currently experiencing. The Abattoir Act was passed in 1990 or 1991 and when it was going through this House the issue of the traceability of meat was raised. That Act, the result of a demand from Europe under the guise of health and safety, created a huge ignorance of the origin of meat. Today many better quality shops and outlets, including those of Senator Quinn, go to much trouble to indicate the farm which is the source of their meat. The impact of that Act was to raise the bar so high in terms of requirements for slaughterhouses that most small operators went out of business and had to buy meat from a central point in the county with no idea as to its origin. Previously, many butchers who had land either produced their own meat or bought beasts from farmers they knew and whom they could trust, resulting in a far cleaner operation. I felt at the time that the Act as a serious mistake. We are spending billions of pounds in Europe each year to trace meat and to convince consumers it is therefore safe.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to again examine the Abattoir Act. The Act is necessary, but the qualifications necessary to slaughter one's own beasts in it should be changed. There should not be a huge cost for small communities, be it Belmullet or Dingle, to have a place where the local butcher can slaughter animals and do what was always done prior to that Act when people had total confidence because they knew the farmer who raised the animal, the grass on which it was grazed and the butcher who slaughtered, prepared and sold it. That previous system cannot be beaten. It is a matter of building simple bridges so people can have trust and confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistical argument just does not work and there is no point saying it is the fault of the media, though it may be. I have not stopped eating red meat &ndash; getting to this House from Kildare House for a vote is more risky than having a T-bone steak. The best way to bring back trust and confidence is to ensure the route from grass to table is short and recognised by people. Supermarkets in the city writing down the name of the farm and <Col N="563" /> farmer where the animals or vegetables originate gives a sense of confidence. It does not matter who the farmer is or where the farm is located, but one believes that supermarkets have checked the farm thereby giving confidence in the product.</P>
    <P>I know I have strayed somewhat from the core of the motion, but the issues I have raised relate to the problems which have arisen. We should have a continuous check on what is happening and how things are being dealt with. I ask the Minister to put pressure on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to consider looking at the Abattoir Act so people can again have the right to determine the source of their own food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found the debate very educational. I thank Senator Fitzpatrick and those on the Government side for withdrawing the amendment. I recognise that it is not easy to do so and it is much appreciated. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, not just for his speech but for its openness and honesty. As Senator Callanan said, it contained a great amount of information and reality, and I was impressed by it.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to relay a point made by Senator Henry to the Minister for Health and Children, namely, the need for an immediate and sustained campaign for blood donations, particularly in the context of the recent problems of the BTSB.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman gave a very clear account of the Fine Gael conference organised by Deputy Alan Dukes and her references, particularly to the expertise of Dr. Michael Farrell, were most useful. I admire Senator Glynn's knowledge of the history of BSE and CJD and what he said about the need for trust and confidence. Senator Gibbons talked about quality and the benefits of having a grass based production area. Senator Callanan mentioned the onus and responsibility of the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not aware the abattoir legislation had the implications outlined by Senator O'Toole and I agree it is very valuable to take into account how trust and confidence can be lost and generated. On a number of occasions recently I had the experience of customers saying to me in the shop &ldquo;I trust you&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Don't let me down&rdquo;. We heard these concerns in 1989 and put in place a traceability scheme which has since been extended, rather similar to that described by Senator O'Toole. We should picture what Ireland could achieve if the citizens of the world could say to us &ldquo;I trust you; I trust the products you produce&rdquo;. We have an opportunity to do that but have not sufficiently focused our attention on it. A report I received last week spoke of the panic sweeping through many European consumers leading to a drop of between 30% and 40% in consumption in France, a 40% reduction in Greece and 50% in Germany. This gives some idea of the concerns which exist and the oppor<Col N="564" /> tunity we have if we could convince people of the quality of Ireland's product.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan spoke of the southern hemisphere, and the same report said that, as could be expected, the wave of panic has crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Canada, Mexico and the US have suspended imports from Brazil due to a fear of BSE, although no cases of BSE have been identified in Brazil. Picture what could happen if we could create confidence among our own people about our own products. The issue is in our hands, and not only in the hands of the Government. We cannot ask why the Government does not do something about it and then sit back.</P>
    <P>Senators Gibbons and Callanan talked about the rogues in society. For over 50 years we have tried unsuccessfully to get rid of bovine TB. In World War II people spoke of the enemy within, the spies for whom people were to keep their eyes open. The enemies within our society are those who continue to breach the standards we have set.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the best way to ensure the health and safety of our citizens is protected in relation to BSE and CJD is to base the measures we adopt on the best scientific information available and to enforce controls effectively. It is in our own hands, as is the answer to the problem. The Government can only do so much while the rest is in the hands of the nation, and we must ensure we grasp that opportunity and create the necessary confidence among our own people so that they know when we say something we have scientific backing for it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and Members have found the debate useful as I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am sure she has heard all angles concerning the proposed relocation of the national theatre, but I have a proposal which may be new to her. The theatre is in a central location on the north side. It is only a stone's throw from where I have lived since I came to Dublin and I used attend it quite frequently in the past. It is in my constituency and also that of the Taoiseach. We are very reluctant to see a cultural resource and institution being relocated. O'Connell Street and the area around it, including the theatre, is the most central area <Col N="565" /> of the city not just for the residents but also for visitors. Busáras, Connolly Station and the DART are close by and within easy walking distance of the Abbey Theatre. It is ideally located. The new Luas nexus will also converge on O'Connell Street. That will enhance public accessibility and should be taken into consideration when considering a future location for the national theatre.</P>
      <P>The role of a cultural institution is not just a cultural matter. It depends very much on accessibility. There is not much sense in having a wonderful cultural institution if it is an ivory tower at a distance removed. Neither of the dockland proposals before the board, one on the south side and one on the north side, merit as much consideration as either a rebuilding or reconstruction and expansion of the current building or a move to an adjacent location. It is not a question of whether it is north side or south side but of what will be best in the future. How we see the development of our national theatre as a central cultural resource is important. Dublin is the place for it, particularly the environs of O'Connell Street.</P>
      <P>I am chairman of the monitoring committee of the integrated area plan for O'Connell Street. It is a £35 million development scheme and its purpose is the revitalisation and reconstruction, where necessary, of O'Connell Street and the surrounding area. The Abbey Theatre and its environs come within the remit of the committee. We discussed it at length last Monday and I put forward the following motion:</P>
      <P>This monitoring committee views with dismay the decision by the board of the Abbey theatre to relocate. It is strongly of the view that the decision is damaging to the work of the committee in ensuring that the O'Connell Street area is revitalised and is restored as the central hub of the capital city and invites the Abbey board to a special meeting to discuss the future of the national theatre.</P>
      <P>We hope to have that meeting. I do not consider that the board should determine the future location of the national theatre. It is the Minister's remit and the final decision will be taken by the Department. The board can only make a recommendation.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that the Abbey Theatre building is an ugly building and not of great architectural merit. It requires both reconstruction and expansion. We have two alternatives. The adjacent VHI building could be purchased or what may be even more advantageous is to consider O'Connell Street itself. There is a series of developments taking place in that street. At the lower end the EIS has been accepted and on 20 December 2000 the Minister gave the go-ahead for the construction of the spire monument. That will be accompanied by the central plaza, an area for open air restaurant and cafe activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> At the other end of the street there is the old Carlton cinema site opposite the Savoy cinema and the old Fingal County Council buildings, both of which are lying idle, and the surrounding derelict buildings. There are five or six large spaces facing on to O'Connell Street. This area could be purchased from the Carlton consortium for use by the Abbey Theatre &ndash; the site stretches back into Henry Street. There are plans by the Shelbourne owners for a top of the range modern hotel at the corner of that street. The ILAC Centre at the other side will be totally revamped with a new library and other development. There will be a cluster of new developments at that corner of O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The Gate Theatre is also at that end and the old Ambassador cinema building is awaiting redevelopment. This area could become a centre for culture and entertainment. The Carlton consortium had difficulty with planning permission because it was opposed by another consortium and it went to a judicial review but that has been resolved. However, the consortium has been dragging its feet. At Dublin Corporation's last meeting we considered the possibility of a compulsory purchase order for that whole area if there was no progress.</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street is soon to receive an area conservation designation and it will become a special building control area. This will put O'Connell Street on the map and to move the Abbey Theatre from Abbey Street to the centre of the capital city would effectively turn O'Connell Street into the Broadway of Ireland. This would be the means whereby O'Connell Street would at last be reinstated as the prime street in our capital city and in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to respond to Senator Costello's motion regarding the redevelopment of the national theatre. The Abbey Theatre and Peacock Theatre, which constitute the national theatre, are housed in three buildings on Abbey Street. In 1994 The National Theatre Society commissioned an architectural review of the buildings which concluded that as a highly mechanised building of the 1960s, its plant and machinery is becoming obsolete and, consequently, in time the building will become unusable. The report went on to state that the inherent inadequacies of the 1960s design are undermining the experience of audiences and artists who expect a higher level of comfort, service and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 the Board of the National Theatre Society Limited submitted a number of options to me which it had considered to obviate the inadequacies that the architectural review of the buildings had highlighted. At that time its preferred option was for the redevelopment of the theatre at its existing location. While it was clear in the proposals that the existing site was limited in size and scope, it was intended that these limitations would be minimised with imaginative <Col N="567" /> design and the maximum use of space. This option was in keeping with my preference of retaining the theatre at its present historic location at Lower Abbey Street. This continues to be my preference.</P>
    <P>While my examination of these proposals was proceeding, I received word from the board of the national theatre that it was re-evaluating its options in response to intimations that sites at several other locations, including one owned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority at Grand Canal Basin, were likely to be available. Accordingly, the board advised me on 27 October 2000 that its preferred option was for the redevelopment of the national theatre at the Grand Canal Basin site.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Office of Public Works carried out an analysis of the merits of this option and its report was submitted to me on 6 February 2001. There is concern in the report that the site on offer at Grand Canal Basin may not fully fulfil the brief of requirements as outlined by the board of the National Theatre Society or provide the scope for any future possible expansion. I have asked the society to revisit this option and to advise me further. In light of the Office of Public Works's report and given my preference, which I have expressed on a number of occasions in the past, that the national theatre should if at all possible remain at its present location on Abbey Street if design constraints could be mitigated, I have asked the Office of Public Works in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and in consultation with the National Theatre Society to explore and to report to me on the options that exist in the matter of acquiring additional site space adjacent to the existing Abbey site with a view to developing a new landmark theatre at this location. This report will also consider other possible city centre relocation options and will inform my consideration of the future development of the national theatre, including the proposals which I will bring to Government in due course. I hope to receive the report from the Office of Public Works by the end of March.</P>
    <P>The National Theatre Society estimated a cost of £50 million in 1999 for the carrying out of a full redevelopment of the existing building and site. The costs of a development on an expanded site at Abbey Street have yet to be advised to me and there would also be costs associated in acquiring additional site space at this location. The estimated cost of building a new theatre on the Grand Canal Basin site has been set down by the National Theatre Society at between £75 million and £90 million The cost of developing on any other greenfield site in a suitable and central location in the city would be of a similar amount. Site acquisition costs would also have to be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> There can be no doubt that from an operational and artistic point of view, our national theatre, encompassing the Abbey and Peacock venues, requires a major programme of redevelopment and refurbishment. I have made clear my wish to support the board of the national theatre in its plans to create a national theatre which can look with confidence to affirming its role at the heart of theatrical development in Ireland as the theatre approaches the centenary of its own foundation.</P>
    <P>The Abbey Theatre is a &ldquo;landmark theatre&rdquo; in internationally recognised theatrical terms. It has won international acclaim over many years for its high standards of writing, productions, and performances. It is of national significance in giving cultural expression to Irish values and nationhood, and conveying those sentiments abroad when on tour.</P>
    <P>The importance of the national theatre, therefore, must be reflected in any redevelopment decisions from suitable site selection to proper public and performance spaces, with access for all as well as high architectural and design standards.</P>
    <P>If the national theatre is to be relevant to audiences in the 21st century and to reassert itself on the national and international stage, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that the best possible development is undertaken. In bringing any proposal to Government I will be cognisant of this responsibility.</P>
