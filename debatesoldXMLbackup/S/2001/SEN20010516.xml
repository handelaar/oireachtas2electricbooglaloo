      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; and No. 17, motion No. 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Business, if not previously concluded, will resume thereafter.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time today for a debate on the health services. It is very important that the Minister for Health and Children or the Taoiseach is given an opportunity to come to this House to elaborate in full as to what went on in Ballymascanlon. It appears from the information available to date that it was nothing more than a PR sham. While a bullish Minister for Health and Children went into the meeting, he came out in a rather sheepish fashion. Unfortunately for many ill people, it was not very encouraging in view of the prior publicity prior suggesting that something positive would emerge.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the current state of industrial unrest and the difficulties arising with regard to the future of social partnership, which is critical to the future of the economy. Will the Leader provide time to debate this issue and invite the Minister to come to the House to address it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has raised a number of issues recently and requests have been put to the Leader on health, education and other services, so perhaps it is time to have a more fundamental debate such as what to do with tax revenue. Should it be used to reduce taxes or improve social services in health, education and housing? That would be a significant issue to put on the record of the House, rather than for people on both sides to stand up with shopping lists of what they want. It would be a more sincere debate if the Leader would encourage the broader debate on the redistribution of the tax revenues of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I raise another issue advisedly and in the sense of trying to be helpful. It is important in these days of pluralism to reflect on the openness and honesty of the Taoiseach in terms of his personal relationship. I feel uncomfortable discussing somebody's personal relationship, but it is important for this House not to pass judgment on how people run their lives. There should be parity of esteem in terms of relationships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The office in terms of public representation has got a lot of unfair criticism. This has nothing to do with parties or taking political shots, but it is important that as public representatives our private lives are protected. It is the precedent of the State that the Taoiseach and partner host receptions, and the partner is the choice of the Taoiseach, be it wife or husband or whatever other partner that happens to be.</P>

      <P>Senator, this House is not involved in the protocol to which you are referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, a Chathaoirligh, and will say no more than that the House has a duty to protect public representatives and to ensure that their profile and reputation are protected. Were any other Member of the Oireachtas involved, whether in this or the other House, or indeed the President, I would make the same case. These matters are important and I would like that message conveyed to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the call for the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House, following the Ballymascanlon fiasco. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, certainly said so. He wanted to have nothing to do with the multi-billion&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing any other meeting. I assume the Senator is calling for a debate on health matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion is coming from the other side of the House. I am calling for a debate on the health services and I want the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to come into the House. It was trumpeted that a huge amount of money was to be injected into the health services as a result of this meeting. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has firmly slammed the door on that. The health service is in a shambles and I would like to hear how the Minister for Health and Children proposes to proceed now. I am entitled to ask for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House to facilitate us with a debate on the question of the price of drink and the licensing of licensed premises. Members of the vintners' federation are meeting at present and we have the usual bleatings from <Col N="943" /> them that any increase in licences would ruin the fabric of society, would be counterproductive and would not result in any reduction in prices. Then we have the Minister calling on the same people for a voluntary price freeze, which is like calling on a piranha or shark not to use its teeth. It has never happened in the past and is unlikely to happen now. I would like an opportunity to see what the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, proposes to do because he has been issuing these bleatings for the past 12 months and has taken no action on the exorbitant price of drink in public houses since the price freeze was lifted.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, clarify the situation in relation to the proposed sale of Clancy Barracks. There is a contradiction between the statement of the assistant city manager that Clancy Barracks has not been offered to Dublin Corporation for purchase and the indication by the Minister for Defence that it has. I ask the Minister to make it clear whether the local authority was given first option on this very important parcel of land, which the councillors unanimously agreed to use to deal with the homeless and to alleviate the housing crisis in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the request that this House should have a comprehensive, preferably all-day, debate on health and the delivery of health services to people in need. Delivering a decent health service to all our citizens will be very challenging and will require putting in place our best ideas. Members of this House will have to put their heads together in a constructive debate with a view to bringing about long overdue improvements in the delivery of the health service.</P>
      <P>No purpose is served by describing the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, as being sheepish on any occasion or by calling a meeting a fiasco. This House owes it to patients, who are getting a very poor service for the taxpayers' money put into the health services, to debate the matter calmly and reasonably with a view to bringing about badly needed improvements.</P>

      <P>As Leas-Chathaoirleach, I express my good wishes to the Leader of the House and the members of the Fianna Fáil group opposite on the 75th anniversary of the founding of their party.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to update the House on the timescale for taking the Local Government Bill. Many of the matters raised in the Ombudsman's report relate to local government and Departments. Has a date been set for taking the report? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to come to the House to debate some of the changes occurring in the area of the environment and local govern<Col N="944" /> ment, in particular the housing strategies currently before local authorities. The debate should include the inequity between funding for county councils and city boroughs. Most cities are being strangled because they lack adequate funding and as they are the country's flagships that issue must be examined seriously.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his good wishes on the 75th anniversary of Fianna Fáil. On such an anniversary it is time to look at the balance between the east and west coasts and to get rid of the Pale. I look forward to a better balance in terms of distribution of funds.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senators join me in welcoming a group of visitors to the House from the Limerick area who are asylum seekers from Nigeria and Bulgaria, among other places. They are accompanied by Sister Anne Scully, co-ordinator of an anti-racism organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>A request which I previously made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relates to refugees and asylum seekers, namely that those who have been here six months prior to December 2000 should be allowed to work. This would certainly reduce tremendously the level of racism. They do not want to avail of the weekly £15 social welfare payment; they want to contribute economically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not debating this matter now. I take it that you are seeking a debate on it. Please address your request to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I address myself to the Leader of the House. I ask for the Minister to accept the right to work of those who have been in residence for six months prior to December 2000. They do not wish to avail of social welfare and want to contribute economically and socially to the life of the country. I also ask that the Minister expedite the processing of applications. I cannot believe, given the small numbers, this cannot be dealt with&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should make a speech about it tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a motion tonight and I ask if the Minister will be prepared to answer those questions when he comes in to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to motor insurance premia and a recent report by the department of statistics in DCU which reveals there to be a profit of £211 per policy relating to young people. Even more interestingly, female drivers produce a profit of over £730 per policy. Over the years, the insurance federation has assured us that it approaches insurance on a purely equitable basis. This report shows that it is not equitable when some are being overcharged. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the motor insurance industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Liam Cosgrave in congratulating Fianna Fáil and I extend my congratulations to the Leader of the House on his safe return from the long march to the Mansion House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House about progress, if any, on Government plans to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It is particularly important that we do so as a copper-fastener, especially in light of the activities of the French, which are still being revealed as I have said before. In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is an article about a retired French officer, General Paul Aussaresses, in whose name the double consonant SS appears twice. He praises what he calls the efficacy of torture. These are the people we will be in cahoots with militarily if we pass the referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>Although we are not to recognise our friends from Limerick formally, because it was not done in the proper way, they might be glad to know that we will discuss tonight the issue of racism involving asylum seekers. I hope there will be a very full attendance and that the kinds of question there was an attempt to raise can be directed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to an issue I have raised before, asking the Minister for Public Enterprise how her Department intends to provide broadband services within the BMW region. Some companies, such as Eircom and others, have decided not to take up their contracts on the first round. It is important that when the next round is presented to those companies the Minister outlines to the House how broadband services will be spread throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on how we spend our resources in the future. That is important, particularly when one hears some unions talking about the future of national pay agreements and how resources will be spent. It is important to address that issue. Money is not the answer to some of our problems, but it is important to discuss how it should be spent and to plan for the future. This issue should be dealt with in a balanced way for all the people of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Taylor-Quinn in calling for an urgent debate on health, partic<Col N="946" /> ularly in view of worrying recent developments and the contrary signals which emanated from a recent Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Is the independent consultants' review of the stadium project, which was announced by the Government, merely a cosmetic exercise? The Government announced that it would also review the cost of relocating the State laboratories in Abbotstown to County Kildare. As all Members of the House are aware, advertisements by the Office of Public Works appeared in yesterday's newspapers inviting contractors to indicate their interest with a view to tendering during June and July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter. The independent consultants will not be commissioned until June and a report is not expected for three months. However, the advertisements suggest that contractors could be on site in August. Is the Government continuing with this project regardless of the review? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is right about the need for an urgent discussion on how we spend our money. Our health system is diabolical. More than £5 billion has been spent on it, but the problem has still not been solved. There is agreement, particularly with the unions, about how our money should be spent. It is well worth this House's time to say where we think it should be spent. In the early 1990s people with hip problems were sent to other parts of this country for operations. Perhaps we should consider doing that again if operations cannot be done in the Republic as a matter of urgency. If money is available, we should spend it wisely to ensure that people are kept in good health. It is a serious issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Fitzpatrick for a debate on the motor insurance industry. I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister the abhorrent practice of automatically loading penalties on drivers when they reach 70 years of age. This loading is imposed without reference to a person's state of health or driving record. No calls are made for medical records. Drivers on meagre incomes, who have been driving all their lives with a clean record and are in perfect health, attempt to bargain down the loading, but find themselves unable to move to another motor insurance company. It is blatant discrimination and an abhorrent practice. I call for a debate on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a wide-ranging debate on the health crisis. One cannot deny that we have a major problem on our hands when it is reported that a public patient must wait three years for an appointment.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House inform us when it is planned to publish the legislation on money advice bureaux? This legislation will place on a statutory basis the money advice bureaux which are run by health boards across the country and help those suffering poverty. Despite the economic boom which the majority are experiencing, many remain in difficult circumstances. The Government Whip indicated that the Bill was to be published in mid-2001, which is rapidly approaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have a debate on the situation in the Middle East and the position of the Palestinian people? The Leader of the House promised that a debate would take place soon. The situation in the Middle East is out of control, as is the Israeli Government. The Israelis are attacking police stations and children and it is time for somebody to shout &ldquo;stop.&rdquo;  I want to have a good debate and if there are contrary ideas on the issue, it would be good to hear them in the House.</P>
      <P>There are many foreign affairs matters that could be addressed if we were to have a day-long debate, which could be compartmentalised into discussion of various issues which should include the diabolical situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the problems in Angola, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, much of west Africa and the Great Lakes area. There is a need for debate among the representatives of a country which has the privilege of having democratic government, even though at times it appears that the Government is doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the health service raises issues which are being addressed by the Government, although the demographic changes are creating new pressures. The population rise forecast for the next 20 years will create problems. We should congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on his achievements in the past two years and the amount of money spent. We must, <Col N="948" /> however, address equally the politics of the medical profession&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be done in the debate which has been sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Leader of the House that it is best to strike when the iron is hot. This is an old adage, but a true one and I use it with regard to the Ombudsman's report. The further we move away from that report, the less effective any debate in the House will be. Will the Leader of the House bring forward the debate on the matter to which he committed two weeks ago? </P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of radon gas. While it is not a sexy subject for the media, it is important to recognise that there are dangers involved. I ask for a debate on the matter to be held as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Fianna Fáil Members on the occasion of their 75th anniversary celebrations. It was on this date that the party was founded by Mr. Éamon de Valera in La Scala on O'Connell Street. While I would fall out with Fianna Fáil Members on 99% of the matters they suggest, which is my role, it is only appropriate to wish them a happy birthday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on the health service. The issue is not, simply, one of resources given that the Government has increased funding by £2.5 billion. Will the Leader, in arranging this debate, ensure that it is not just a party political exercise but that it is a constructive debate? The motion framed for the debate should encompass value for money and quality of management. Those are serious issues in the public service and of immense importance in the health services where there are serious deficiencies. Huge resources have been gobbled up by vested interests, rather than focused on the patients. This House should convey to the Minister for Health and Children that a renowned international consultancy agency should be employed to undertake a root and branch analysis of the health services to ensure that value for money is achieved. Ultimately it should be the patients, and the public, who benefit from the huge resources &ndash; almost £5.5 billion &ndash; which are now spent on public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the health services, in which we should point out that health care is needed by young families in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increasing number of young parents are coming to my clinics who cannot secure accommodation because they are receiving rent allowance. Landlords are discriminating against people who are in receipt of that allowance. Some accommodation advertisements in the newspapers state that rent allowance applicants are not welcome. It is totally unacceptable. Young families now go into bed and breakfast accommodation and live in despair<Col N="949" /> ing and desperate conditions. This needs an urgent debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the call for debate on the health service. As someone who has worked in the health service for most of my life, I believe it is high time that a Government followed the money through the system in order to bring about greater efficiency. As Senator Walsh said, it is not good enough to throw money at it. Over the last four years £3 billion has been spent in addition to what was allocated. It is difficult to reconcile expenditure of that magnitude with a public patient waiting three years to be seen, as claimed by Senator O'Meara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the state of our non-national roads. We hear about the Luas light-rail system and all sorts of motorways. Our minor county roads are in poor shape. With all that is being spent, are we getting value for money? It is worthy of a debate in this Chamber. It has nothing to do with the National Roads Authority. The minor roads of rural Ireland and the peripheral areas which I represent are not improving. We should have a debate on this, possibly before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>Senators Taylor-Quinn, O'Toole, Costello, Coghlan, Cregan, O'Meara, O'Dowd and Kett have all called for a debate on the health service. I have no difficulty in allowing time for this. As has already been said, £5 billion per year is now being spent on the health services. The annual allocation to health has been doubled since the Government came to power in 1997. An additional 80,000 people annually are availing of the services. With the increase in population, demands are much greater. This debate will also have to include the hepatitis inquiry. I will certainly allow an all-day debate on it.</P>

      <P>I look for full co-operation and the attendance of all Senators at that debate.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Chambers called for a review of how the Government should spend its tax revenue in coming years. Time can be allowed for this. I will pass on to the Taoiseach Senator O'Toole's views on protocols, which I share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Costello and Bohan have informed the House that there will no price increases by the Dublin vintners for the remainder of the year. Senator Costello also requested a debate on drink prices. In my opinion, the delay in issuing ID cards to young people must be investigated as a <Col N="950" /> matter of urgency. I understand there have been delays of 12 to 14 weeks on the part of some Garda stations in this regard. The Minister and the Government might consider allowing commissioners for oaths or peace commissioners to assist the Garda Síochána in issuing ID cards.</P>
    <P>The Senator also requested a debate on the sale of Clancy Barracks. This issue was raised during the Private Members' debate on Defence Forces modernisation last week. However, I will review the matter in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators Cosgrave, Norris and Coogan offered their congratulations to the Taoiseach, the Government and Fianna Fáil members in the Seanad on the 75th anniversary of the Fianna Fáil Party, which was founded on this day in 1926. I thank the Senators for their comments. My party's great leaders &ndash; Éamon de Valera, Seán Lemass, Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern &ndash; have given great service to Ireland and its people. We have been looking forward to this day for some time and we hope that the party will continue with the good work it has been doing in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave also called for a debate on the Ombudsman's report. I have already given a commitment to make time available for this, but I must give consideration to when debates of this nature can be held. Due to the amount of legislation &ndash; three Bills per week &ndash; that will be introduced in the House during the next four to five weeks, I will be obliged to discuss with the Whips and the leaders the possibility of sitting until 10 p.m. on Tuesday evenings to try to facilitate calls on the Order of Business for urgent debates.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox requested a debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on future housing strategy and on funding for councils. I will make time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Norris expressed their views on refugees and asylum seekers. A debate on this issue will take place during Private Members' time this evening and I look forward to the participation of all Senators.</P>
    <P>Senators Fitzpatrick and Liam Fitzgerald called for a debate on the cost of motor insurance premiums. The Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business is currently investigating the motor insurance industry and is expected to complete its report in the coming weeks. When this happens, I will make time available for a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on the UN Convention on Torture and I will make time available in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers requested that the Minister for Public Enterprise come before the House to debate the issue of broadband services. I have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Dino Cregan welcomed the Government's major investment of £60 million in Cork <Col N="951" /> Airport. I informed the House and the Senator a number of weeks ago that I understood such an investment was about to be made. I share his pleasure, and that of Senator Quill and other Members from the fair city of Cork, at this massive investment which is a vote of confidence in the city of Cork, its airport and the people who work there, who have given dedicated service over the years.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan expressed views on a number of matters, as he always does so well, and I will communicate them to the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>The first matter raised by Senator O'Meara is more relevant to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs rather than the health boards. I will pass on her views to the Minister. Senator O'Meara, in supporting the call for a debate on the health services, informed the House that she knew of a patient who had been on a waiting list for three years. If she passes on the name of the patient concerned to me, I will use my position, as Leader of the House, to see what I can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy this important legislation is being introduced in the Seanad. I always try as far as possible to introduce my Department's Bills in the Seanad before bringing them to Dáil Éireann. The Bill provides for the establishment of an independent statutory State body, the railway procurement agency; a single statutory railway order procedure for the approval of railway infrastructure projects, including light rail and metro; and the regulation of light rail services when operating on-street. Before going into the detail of the Bill, I will give some background to its introduction.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to providing the country with a more modern and efficient transport infrastructure through the national development plan and the proposals in the DTO strategy, A Platform for Change. The NDP sets out a public transport investment strategy for the period 2000-06 designed to achieve, <i>inter alia</i>, a radical transformation of the public transport system. Investment of £2.2 billion is provided for in the plan for public transport. This is an unprecedented level of funding, which will enable significant advances to be made in the coming years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report progress to date in delivering a number of public transport projects, including, the acquisition of 225 buses by Dublin Bus in 2000; 26 new DART carriages delivered to Iarnród Éireann; 60 Arrow rail cars ordered, with delivery commencing in 2003; and 148 new buses acquired by Bus Éireann in 2000 with 40 for the greater Dublin area and the remainder for use in provincial cities and on rural services.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go in providing the public transport infrastructure and services required by our expanding economy. The development of the rail system forms an important part of our transport proposals. In addition to the significant investment being made in an enhanced suburban and mainline rail system, a light rail system and a metro system for Dublin form an important part of the strategy, as Dublin in particular faces a rapidly increasing demand for travel, particularly public transport, as congestion increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant advances have been made to date on the Luas light rail project: a preferred bidder has been selected for the main construction contract involving track laying and cabling, which will <Col N="954" /> commence shortly; construction of the depot at the Red Cow will be completed in July 2001; 40 trams have been ordered, the first will be delivered in October of this year; a competition for the award of the operator's contract for the first lines commenced in December 2000. The contract will be awarded in September 2001 and services on all lines remain on target to begin in 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has approved, in principle, the development of a metro system for Dublin. The metro will represent the single biggest infrastructure project ever delivered by the State. The introduction of the metro and the extension of the light rail network will require the particular focus and attention of an implementing body and that is why I propose, under the Bill, to establish the Railway Procurement Agency.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that preliminary preparatory work on the metro has already been commenced by the light rail project office of CIE. This office, suitably restructured and expanded, will form the starting point for the new agency.</P>
    <P>As ever, finance will play a vital role in determining the priorities for the introduction of projects. The magnitude of the public transport infrastructure projects identified and associated costs means that the Exchequer alone will not be in a position to provide all the funding required. Alternative means of finance must be found and in this regard, the proper application of public private partnerships offer huge potential benefits to the State. The emphasis in any PPP should be on real partnership where public sector values are combined with private sector efficiencies.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the success of the overall PPP programme must also be rooted in our social partnership model. This system of delivering stability through consensus on major economic, social and other issues is one of the main reasons for Ireland's recent economic success. Successful PPPs must also be built on the development and maintenance of trust between key stakeholders and on shared objectives for the delivery to the public of quality public transport.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the work being done by the public-private informal advisory group on PPPs on developing a framework for public private partnerships will be extremely important. Once agreed by all parties, this framework will represent an important step in clarifying guidelines for participation of the public and private sector in such arrangements. The Railway Procurement Agency will be required to conform with these agreed guidelines.</P>
    <P>The main advantages of PPPs, namely, value for money, optimum risk allocation and the inherent focus on services, have considerable appeal for major transport projects. To advance the application of PPPs for rail-based projects, my Department recently began a consultation process in relation to the framework policy to be applied. This consultation process is an important part of the development of a PPP approach to the delivery of our key projects. It is important to provide an opportunity for all interested partners <Col N="955" /> to contribute their views on the formation of policy. As we are at the early stages, we need to develop our thinking on the optimal approach to public transport PPPs. We are also keen to learn from alternative approaches based on the successful experience of potential partners. The Railway Procurement Agency will be the vehicle for financing major new transport infrastructure such as Luas and metro.</P>
    <P>My Department undertook a consultation process on the proposals contained in the general scheme of the Bill and those views are reflected, in the main, in the drafting. I will now outline briefly the main provisions of the Bill. There are five main Parts. Part 1 contains standard sections &ndash; Title, interpretations, repeals, continuations etc. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the Railway Procurement Agency. Part 3 details the statutory approval procedures for any new railway infrastructure project. Part 4 deals with the on-street regulation of light railways and Part 5 contains miscellaneous provisions. Each of the Parts are dealt with in more detail in my script, which is available to everybody. I would prefer to hear people's contributions.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agencies are set out in section 11. Provisions in relation to the composition of the agency, its chief executive and staff are dealt with in sections 20 to 29.</P>
    <P>Railway developments, as authorised by the Minister and specified in a railway order, are to be exempted developments in the context of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Before making a decision on whether to grant a railway order, section 43 obliges the Minister to consider the application and accompanying documentation. Where the Minister is of the opinion that an application for a railway should be granted, he or she will make an order authorising the construction, maintenance etc. of the railway.</P>
    <P>Among the safety matters covered in Part 4 are speed limits, qualifications and competencies required by a driver of a light rail vehicle. Provision is also made for CIE, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, to set up one or more subsidiary companies under the Companies Act. Section 71 amends the Transport (Re-Organisation of CIE) Act, 1986, to allow for an increase in the number of board members of the three CIE subsidiaries &ndash; Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Bill plays an important role in providing a structure under which railway infrastructure can be developed. With the prospect of the Luas vehicles arriving in the country later this year, the moment has come to focus on their operation. As the House may be aware, in a little over two years' time, a light rail service will begin operating on the Sandyford and Tallaght to city centre lines. In the meantime, a franchise will be allocated for their operation and I want to see the contracting body, the Railway Procurement Agency, in place later this year to allow for full <Col N="956" /> testing and commissioning prior to the commencement of operations in 2003.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with the operation of Luas and the metro, although I am more than willing to listen to the views of all Members who contribute, and is not concerned with heavy rail. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes but, like many areas in CIE, it does not go far enough. At first glance I thought the Bill was major legislation which would overhaul the entire railway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that now from reading the Bill but that would be my main criticism of it. I am looking at it from a western standpoint and, unfortunately, we will have to endure the current set-up for many more days to come.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not confer new powers on the existing agency and board of CIE rather than set up another board with a new chief executive and all that entails in terms of money, responsibility and accountability? On reading the Bill one would think that powers could be transferred to the existing machinery in CIE, unless it is an attempt to give a new image to the light rail and the metro systems. Perhaps it is an attempt to lay the Percy French ghost of the railway system to rest as far as new infrastructure is concerned.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reference to the role of public-private partnerships in terms of future infrastructural development. Such partnerships have great potential and will significantly impact on the further development of the light rail and metro systems in Dublin. However, apart from this section, the Bill fell short of what I anticipated.</P>
      <P>In the old days, CIE had a monopoly on commercial and passenger transportation and no other operator could carry commercial produce or passengers without a licence. Private hauliers required a plate to carry anything. If a dozen boxes of matches had to be transported from Dublin to Ballina, Westport or Castlebar, the owner of the vehicle had to own a plate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liberalisation of the industry in the mid-1980s opened up new opportunities in the commercial sector. At the time CIE lost much of its business as it was unable to provide services due to bad management, inter-union rivalry and industrial disputes. This business was lost because private enterprise took the initiative. If a farmer baling hay broke a piece of machinery which had to be replaced by a part from Dublin, CIE would not deliver the part if it was later than 5.30 p.m. Private operators seized such opportunities, bought vans, collected parts from Dublin and delivered them to farmers who could be back in business by that night. Such operators may now have ten articulated trucks on the road. This busi<Col N="957" /> ness has gone to the private sector and CIE lost all its commercial business.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s and 1970s CIE delivered supplies to public houses, hardware stores and garages. However, this practice has now ceased because of the poor quality of service, inter-union rivalries, industrial disputes, inefficiency and bad management. Roads are now full of articulated vehicles transporting hundreds of thousands of tonnes of produce while the railways remain idle. Some stations in rural areas may only have two or three trains per day. This is an anomaly in a developing economy which I hoped would be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hoped the Bill would bring CIE into the modern era in terms of providing facilities, effective management and a quality delivery service for the public. The public requires such a service and wants goods to be delivered on time. People do not want to know whether a business closes at 5.30 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. They want the goods they need to run their businesses. Given the competitive nature of business, one cannot be idle for one hour, let alone one day. The Bill does not address these issues.</P>
    <P>One of the important elements of the Bill is the use of the word &ldquo;new&rdquo;. The Bill is concerned with everything new, not with anything old. The Minister clarified that nothing will change with regard to heavy rail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing with regard to procurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that with two agencies running the one system, they may get their rails crossed. There will also be considerable concern about the management demarcation lines.</P>
      <P>I referred to the fact that the powers contained in the Bill could easily be conferred on the existing agency. The Minister may offer an explanation as to the reason a new agency, controlled by a chief executive and seven board members appointed by the Minister, is being established on a statutory basis. As with the Sustainable Energy Bill debated in the House last week, the Bill excludes all Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities from the new agency. Is there a suspicion in the public service or the Department that there is no talent in the Oireachtas or local authorities? There are Members of both Houses and local authorities who have particular expertise in this area and could contribute to the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also referred to the manner in which the liberalisation of the transport sector in the mid-1980s revolutionised commercial activity. It is regrettable that CIE lost this business. If a private company is losing business, its management sits back, tries to identify the reasons and usually comes up with a strategy to reclaim lost business. There is an opportunity for the Minister to examine the commercial decline of CIE. It may not be possible to deal with the issue in the Bill, but I hope <Col N="958" /> she will introduce further legislation regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she proposes on Committee Stage to insert an additional subsection in section 11 to clarify that the agency will act as a railway operator only in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Minister. Will she clarify that amendment? Is the Minister concerned that demarcation lines could become blurred with two agencies running the railway and light rail systems?</P>
    <P>We may be walking into another union minefield in terms of representation. It is important the Minister lays down the demarcation lines so we do not have a repeat of the inter-union rivalry of the past two years. The service to the west has been riven in recent years by inter-union rivalry and disputes of all kinds.</P>
    <P>I mentioned commercial activity in CIE. Passenger numbers are dropping because the public is disillusioned with the public transport system, especially in rural Ireland. One cannot be given a guarantee whether a train will run or if it will reach its destination on time. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Last week, I spoke on the Order of Business on the dispute that was taking place. I did not criticise the Minister, the Department or the Government for the problems that had arisen. I placed the criticism where the problems lay. The unions realised their position and, at the eleventh hour, sensibly called off the dispute. Where tourism is concerned, the country is going through a difficult period. Tourists could not get from A to B because of the problems with the unions. I was particularly scathing of this last week. I do not believe in criticising people for the sake of doing so.</P>
    <P>At first glance I thought I had before me important reformatory legislation concerning the public transport system, but unfortunately I do not. As I said, my main concern is that the demarcation lines are not clouded by too many agencies running the system and that union rivalry does not arise as a result. The real substance in the legislation is in the section dealing with public-private partnership. The Minister is wise in recognising that this is the correct approach. However, public-private partnership in the transport system in rural areas is not viable and may not be in the foreseeable future. The public transport system that has been inherited, with all its deficiencies from the past, is not enticing to the private sector. In Dublin and major cities, things are different. Private partnership will be the way forward and will reduce the financial burden on the public sector. Public sector expenditure will be matched by investment from the private sector. I see merit in the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was hoping the Minister would tackle the whole public transport system head-on. I know that privatisation of the public transport system is not an option. We have seen what happened in England because of privatisation and we do not want to follow suit. The critical mass in England <Col N="959" /> is very different from that here. If privatisation did not work in England, it certainly will not work here. Therefore, State involvement in our transport system will continue. Nevertheless, some liberalisation may be necessary. The Bill before the House is cautiously liberalising. Before this time next year, I hope we will have a substantial body of legislation concerning the public transport system, and I will be the first to welcome it. I welcome the Bill, but it does not go far enough for my liking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend the initiation of this Bill in the Seanad. The Minister and Senator Caffrey both agreed it is not major legislation, but it is significant in the sense that it is another step in the progression of the Minister towards the complete overhaul and revitalisation of the public transport system. The Bill, as the Minister said, proposes to establish a new Railway Procurement Agency, which will be an independent, commercial statutory public body. This wording is important because while the agency will operate under the aegis of the Minister, it will have a degree of independence that will be important in the context of its work. That is laudable.</P>
      <P>The principal function of the agency will be the procurement of new railway infrastructure. It will allow for private sector participation in the construction operation. From the Minister's speech, we know that this is already well under way.</P>
      <P>The construction and maintenance of new railways is facilitated in the Bill. The Bill replaces the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, but re-enacts many of its provisions, although in a modified form in some cases. It provides for the regulation of the light rail system when running on the street.</P>
      <P>The revitalisation of the country's public transport system is a vital task, especially in the greater Dublin region. The Bill is consistent with the Government's vision for the public transport system. It moves the whole programme forward and I commend it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the economy is enjoying phenomenal success. To maintain this growth, a radical overhaul of our infrastructure, especially our transport infrastructure, is imperative. There are a few self-professed experts on public transport in the media, most of whom are extremely positive with regard to the developments carried out by the Minister. I did not realise that those few, whose names are familiar to us all, had such expertise in public transport strategy development. Who am I, being uneducated on the whole Government transport area, to offer to contest their views? They are expounding on the subject in a very assertive manner.</P>

      <P>I would not include my esteemed colleague who has been ongoing and determined in his commitment and support for what the Minister is doing. Since I have been a Member of this House, the Senator has been consistent in supporting the issue of light rail and of the underground element of this in the inner city. A man of his learning and interest can appreciate, perhaps far more deeply than others, the significance of that and the enhancement it will provide for the historical, architectural and other riches of the Dublin inner city.</P>
      <P>Despite all the criticism at the time suggesting that it would be a white elephant, when the Minister came to office, there was no vision or sense of direction regarding the development of the public transport infrastructure. In a sense she is perversely accused of being one of the guilty parties for creating this problem because her actions helped to bring our thriving economy into being. All the young people in cars complaining about the gridlock on our streets should realise that if there was not such a thriving economy they would not have cars in the first place.</P>
      <P>Far be it from me to knock our enthusiastic, vibrant, dynamic young people who are earning a good living and buying cars. Unfortunately, the negative side of this is that we have congestion and gridlock, and when one is in a hurry to work, in many instances to a good job, one has to blame somebody. There is no instant, quick-fix solution and the Minister does not need my support or that of Senator Norris, but we are very happy to give it. The Minister has been criticised and asked to wave another one of her magic wands to solve the problem overnight. That is folly and the height of naiveté.</P>
      <P>The system was loaded with deficiencies and awash with weakness. Senator Caffrey, in commending the Bill, stated that there were certain aspects of it that would encompass more progress in the area of legislation. I am not quibbling with that, he is entitled to his point of view, but I thought I heard him say he would have preferred more power to be conferred on CIE. If he did not say that, I apologise, but from my perspective I am extremely concerned that not alone were more powers not conferred on CIE, but that the process has begun to significantly dilute the powers invested in them. I am not sure the Minister would agree with that point, but it is my opinion that if any company bled the taxpayer over many years and abused and distorted the power invested in them by successive Governments, it was CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I spoke about CIE, I think I quoted from Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>&ldquo;There is something rotten in the State of Denmark&rdquo;. There was and is something very strange about the whole CIE culture and this is a positive way of sending a clear message to CIE that thus far has it gone with taxpayers' money, thus far has it gone with quibbling and internal squabbling and an abject lack of ability to deal with industrial relations in the company. It is high time that we <Col N="961" /> as responsible legislators deliver a quality service in the interests of taxpayers. The Minister does not need lectures from me to tell her of her responsibilities in this regard or to ensure that a company under the aegis of her Department delivers a quality service in the most efficient manner possible, and to root out the needless and negative squabbling that has been going on.</P>
    <P>I commend the approach of this Bill which provides for an agency to deliver the 21st century service that is required throughout the country. This Bill specifically deals with the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, referring in particular to the Luas and metro. I could go on <i>ad nauseam </i>about the history of the past few years &ndash; it seems a long time ago since 1998 when the Minister decided, with the approval of the Government, to launch Luas. There was an overwhelming welcome for her decision, but again I refer to some of our media friends who put themselves up on pedestals. They suggested that she was putting herself on one, but it was they who were doing so. They told the people in their newspapers and other media fora that it would not happen. The Minister was busy at that time answering the critics to reassure the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly shown that not alone can she talk the talk, but she is walking the walk. She is responsible for the progress that has been made since 1988 in pushing forward this programme, including the variations that have had to take place since the initial announcement and the comprehensive additions which have been made. When the announcement was made to include the underground element and to link the system to the national network, there was a hue and cry from three or four prominent media names, suggesting that it was a fudge and that the Minister would not bring forward a Bill to have streets torn up before a general election.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives the lie to that. It is not necessary to add much comment to that. These people are very silent now and are no more to be heard shouting from the rooftops. They are no longer promulgating their heresy because they know the lie has been unambiguously nailed. I do not want to go into the statistics of what the Government has committed, through the Minister, in terms of the development and revitalisation of the public service infrastructure, with specific reference to the Dublin area and surrounding counties. It is not just a promise as the money is up-front.</P>
    <P>There is progress regarding the construction of the early Luas lines. I assert that the timetable is very much up to speed. I commend Padraic White and his team for the tremendous work they are doing. I understand from reading the report last night that there has been a slight delay in construction. There has also been a difficulty in getting outside agencies to give the same kind of focus and priority to the full synchronisation of the work. I know that the Minister<b></b>for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and her Department are working vigorously to ensure that focus and priority, which are essential, will be given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The indicative timetable of 2003 for completion of construction of the three lines was announced by the Minister in 1998. The setback of four to five months was outside the control of the Department and of the advisory action group, whose task is restricted to monitoring, flagging and signalling difficulties in synchronisation and other roadblocks &ndash; if that is the correct term &ndash; on the way. It is very heartening to learn from the report of the advisory action group that despite that setback the preferred bidder has already been selected.</P>

      <P>I understand that the agency will be signing the contract. Tremendous progress has been made despite a necessary and massive programme of public consultation. There were people here, and in Dublin Corporation, shouting about the need to railroad this project through. In the next breath, however, the same people would have damned and indicted any national or local authority that would have dared try in the slightest way to ride roughshod over the democratic rights of individuals, community groups or industrial and commercial operators.</P>
      <P>The Minister listed the areas of progress made and I will advert to one or two of these. Last night, I looked at some drawings of the Red Cow depot, the interchange on the Tallaght line. It is progressing very satisfactorily. The construction of the depot at Sandyford has also started. The first tram is scheduled for delivery in October and further trams will be delivered every six months from next January onwards. Many other services will have to be put in place so that passenger services can begin on schedule.</P>
      <P>It is not just a matter of building the lines. We think purely in terms of putting in the lines and the Minister making available sufficient money to finish them, buy the trams and run them. We dismiss all the other essential elements that have to fall into place in tandem with the construction programme. The railway inspectorate, for example, has to see to the commissioning and ensure that safety standards are looked after. The watchdog appointed by the Minister, the advisory action group, is working extremely hard and is in constant contact with the Department to ensure that the Minister is alerted to any hitches that are developing. The manner in which the Minister widened the scope of monitoring, which is a word that CIE might be somewhat sensitive about, has ensured that the various elements of the project are coming on stream within the time schedules laid down. That is marvellous considering the enormity of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While listening to the admirable and positive contributions made by Senator Norris and others, I was struck by the controversy surrounding the Government decision to include the underground section in the inner city. I recall that three, four, maybe five, geologists popped up back then to tell the Minister that it could not be done. It was, <Col N="963" /> they said, financially and geologically prohibitive and the Minister would be absolutely daft even to contemplate it. Despite that, she took the consultants' reports &ndash; a number of geo-technical studies and other reports were produced at the time &ndash; and decided that the proposal was feasible, logical, sensible and reasonable, not alone from the point of view of delivering on schedule and efficiency, but also from the perspective of the quality of life and quality of the environment in the inner city. The project was commendable, admirable and imperative on those grounds and on many others, which my esteemed friend, Senator Norris, is more than able to articulate.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the conviction to go forward with it. At that time, we asked why London and Paris have tunnels and even the Eiffel Tower. Why are these engineering problems so difficult in the 21st century? How come we have not advanced in the past 100 to 150 years, given that engineers then, who found it almost impossible to study at university, could design and deliver these projects? At the time, it was regarded as ludicrous and irresponsible that these projects should be contemplated, let alone put in place.</P>
    <P>This is not a technical or geological problem but a matter of where there is a will, there is a way. Some of our best experts who positively welcomed it pointed out that ultimately it comes down to the sponsor. If the sponsor is committed, the project will be delivered. Those of us who are reasonable and fair about the matter will agree that this Minister, as the project's sponsor, has the commitment and will deliver it.</P>
    <P>I wanted to speak in detail about public private partnerships, which were referred to by Senator Caffrey. I too am very interested in this very exciting development. I note also the consultation paper launched by the Minister last month and the options being deliberated by the Minister as to how we move forward, using a step-by-step approach, towards a point where partnership in public transport can work, not alone in the interests of the taxpayer but in the interests of greater efficiency and continuity of service. The relationship between the various parties to the partnerships will be worked out and defined before the programme is up and running. I commend the Minister on that initiative.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity to talk about the metro which is being looked at as a public private partnership. This legislation is not extensive but it is significant and will give further impetus to and greater focus on the realisation of the three Luas lines. It will also provide significant guidance and legislative direction for the completion of the project. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed. It is always a pleasure to take part in a debate like this with a Minister as skilful and as much on top of her brief as this one. It was also interesting to hear the stimulating comments of Senator Fitzgerald. I was overwhelmed by his flattering comments about myself, especially when I was rude enough to interrupt him. I only did so to find out if he would give an indication of which people he was thinking of. I have no such bashfulness. It amuses to find the environmental correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, who is so passionately pro-Luas, to be equally antagonistic to any suggestion of putting anything whatsoever underground, trotting out all the arguments that were derided and rubbished when I put them forward in this House as amendments to the Dublin transport Bill in 1996. Now, however, it is called metro so there is a slight saving of face. One would think that the metro did not go underground, but thank God it does because it is the only way to solve many of our transport problems.</P>
      <P>We certainly have transport problems, which are the creation of a complex variety of factors including, as Senator Liam Fitzgerald said, the boom in the economy. One of the reasons this House is a useful place to discuss these matters is that there is not the normal shrill partisanship and blaming of one Government or another. The problems in transport have built up over a lengthy period and I am glad that we now have a determined Minister, clearly intent on cutting through the difficulties. I want to mention a couple of those.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of last Sunday, Colm Kenny had the following to say:</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday I sat in the reality of jammed traffic wondering why Ireland is unable or unwilling to provide itself with a public transport system that works. Just two DART drivers had gone on strike, but it was enough to reduce the service to a shambles. By Wednesday I was back on the DART now wondering why some windows on the new DARTs are kept locked. It may seem a small thing to someone who does not travel by public transport but it is another irritant to those who do, as bad as being stuck in a car in sunshine and unable to open a window.</P>
      <P>He then detailed how he approached various sections of what used to be CIE, now in Iarnród Éireann, looked for explanations and got three or four different and mutually contradictory ones. In transport, particularly in rail, there is undoubtedly chaos and a really severe management problem. The recent strike was appalling, the result of an inter-union dispute, and the Minister was quite correct in not becoming involved. It would have been disastrous had she enmeshed herself in it. However, it indicates something seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretaries, or political assistants as they <Col N="965" /> are now called, are extraordinarily capable people. Mine lives in Skerries and she related the following story. The train this morning was 15 minutes late because the doors failed to open and it just shot through without explanation. A replacement was sent from Drogheda which had only two carriages, so people were squeezed in like sardines. When the driver got to Connolly station he simply parked the train and got out, though most people wanted to go on to Pearse station. No announcement was made but eventually someone said that they should all get the DART, which led to a rush.</P>
    <P>Most of the time it is impossible to get a seat from Skerries and half the time people are put into the luggage compartment. I am sure the Minister is aware of the wheelchair-bound woman in Kerry who was stuck into the engine room of the train. That tells us there are serious problems with management-staff relations, infrastructure and inadequate rolling stock. The Minister has indicated that there is very substantial investment and I am glad of that. A theory has been sketched out by the Minister and there were sceptics but we are beginning to get the nuts and bolts. It is all working, very much of a piece. There is a document from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Public Enterprise on new institutional arrangements for land used in transport in the greater Dublin area, which I read in conjunction with the Bill because there is an integrated approach in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has approved, in principle, the development of a metro system for Dublin. The metro will represent the single biggest infrastructure project ever delivered by the State.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the use of the phrase &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;. I hope it does not mean there is a suggestion of the Government's commitment being fragile. The Minister is shaking her head vigorously. I really want a commitment and a timescale because this metro system could be installed on a much more rapid basis than is being projected. I am not normally a conspiracy theorist, but I had experience, when we were fighting to get an underground, of the obfuscation within certain sections of the bureaucracy. There are still those committed to frustrating it, to long fingering it and to delaying it. Thank God, we have this Minister because she is the lassie that will stop that little game. I appeal to her to keep that monitored.</P>
    <P>Preliminary and preparatory work on the metro has already been commenced by the late light rail project office of CIE. I hope it is given urgency because I am worried about some of the people against whom we had to fight to get the thing in the first place. The Minister must not let them put the brakes on or allow it to be put on the long finger. That would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the prominence given to public private partnerships. The Minister will <Col N="966" /> remember that back in 1996 this is what I was saying. I am not going to take the credit, I was simply throwing snowballs made by other people. My instinct was always that we must go for an underground, but we lacked the technical resources. The Minister has met the people involved in the integrated proposal, Rudi Monaghan and Cormac Rabbitte. She will be as sorry as I am to hear that Rudi Monaghan is seriously ill. I hope the Minister will be encouraged by this debate and encouraged that the proposal, in which she was so instrumental, is taking a significant step forward with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill, though not perhaps with sufficient attention to all the technical details, and I have also read the explanatory memorandum. In the memorandum the metro scarcely merits a mention and I am not sure that it is mentioned in the Bill at all. I would like to see specific mention and copper fastening of the metro, even if only to provide an outline sketch, a hook on which to hang the practicalities of the metro. It is in the Minister's speech but it is damned difficult to find it anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Where it does come in is in the question of public private partnerships, both in terms of the Minister's speech and the consultation paper for new institutional arrangements for land use and transport in the greater Dublin area. It is referred to there, and that is certainly welcomed, but in the principal body of this document it is not given any real mention at all. We are told a railway procurement agency will be established by statute to procure the implementation of defined rail infrastructure and other transport projects, principally on a PPP basis. The agency will have to act in a way that is consistent with the land use and transportation strategy and within the market regulatory framework determined by the strategic body. However, the metro is not specifically mentioned at that point. Perhaps it is just the result of my experience in trying to promote the idea of an underground. The Minister will be aware that, in a very useful debate some years ago, we in this House opened up its possibility.</P>
    <P>While I am at it I permit myself the aside that one of the things we should look at as early as possible is the location of the stations. Though it is a minutely parochial point, I hope there is one at the northern end of O'Connell Street, partly for the James Joyce Centre. Imagine how marvellous it would be to get off a plane at Dublin Airport and get right into the centre of the city, not just to the southside. The southside will probably be favoured in this as in all other matters. Somebody from America who has booked into the Gresham, a very fine hotel, wants to be able to get into an underground at the airport and come out almost opposite its door. I even have a name for the Minister, the James Joyce station. They do it in Paris on the metro where they have the Victor Hugo and others.</P>

      <P>It is well known. It would be a wonderful idea to honour someone on the north side of Dublin and close to the Joyce centre. It is only an accident that it is also close to my house.</P>
      <P>As regards public-private partnerships, the consultation paper states that it is proposed to establish a separate statutory body, the Railway Procurement Agency, which will have responsibility for procuring and negotiating public transport public-private partnerships in possible areas, such as metro, light rail, new suburban railway infrastructure and integrated ticketing. I am delighted that for the first time metro is listed first. I presume it will be groups, such as the Mitsui Corporation, which will be involved. The Minister will remember that I said that there would be a queue of people interested in tendering for such public-private partnerships. Some of the self-appointed experts dismissed this out of hand and said that it was not the case. We knew, however, that there were people interested and I understand there are still a number of groups interested in tendering for these partnerships.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a separate agency will be established in this area. It is important that it is established properly and efficiently and that it has the right personnel. Some of the elements in our existing transport networks have shown themselves to be incapable. We need new blood. I support the Minister who has gone into the marketplace to get it.</P>
      <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum outlines the main purposes of the Bill. These are to:</P>
      <P>(i)establish a new independent, commercial, statutory public body to be known as the Railway Procurement Agency whose main function will be the procurement of new railway infrastructure;</P>
      <P>(ii)allow private sector participation in the construction, operation and maintenance of new railways;</P>
      <P>(iii)repeal the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, and re-enact its provisions, in a modified form, to provide a single statutory railway order procedure; and </P>
      <P>(iv)provide for the regulation of light railways when running on-street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the metro had been mentioned because that is important. Perhaps it was not technically <Col N="968" /> feasible to do so. The main purposes of the Bill are clearly established, particularly when read in conjunction with section 11 which outlines three main functions. It states:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)to secure the provision of, or to provide, such railway infrastructure as may be determined from time to time by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)to enter into agreements with other persons in order to secure the provision of such railway infrastructure whether by means of a concession, joint venture, public private partnership or any other means; and </P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)to acquire and facilitate the development of land adjacent to any railway works subject to an application for a railway order under this Act where such acquisition and development contributes to the economic viability of the said railway works.</P>
    <P>When read in conjunction with the explanatory and financial memorandum and the land consultation document, the Government's policy is clear and extremely logical.</P>
    <P>There are areas of difficulties, such as public consultation and planning procedures. I have been told that the principal difficulty in accelerating the programme in order that these new transport mechanisms will be in place within a reasonable amount of time is the planning delays. This must be looked at. Everyone must have the right to safeguard their own interests. However, inordinate delays which lead to enormous snags for the rest of the community should not be permitted. I heard someone say on the wireless the other day that he was looking for £7 million compensation for his little house on the north side of the city &ndash; I cannot remember the exact district &ndash; because of these type of works. It was a corporation house which was bought for £10,000. People's attitudes are amazing. This type of thing holds up developments <i>ad nauseam</i>. I do not want to have to wait until 2012 to get on an underground train in this city and do not see why we should have to. We should put our backs into trying to get the situation pushed forward as rapidly as possible, while allowing for people's democratic right to make their case if their property rights or their enjoyment of their houses are being interfered with.</P>
    <P>One cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs. I love trees but note that one of the provisions is to allow trees to be felled, lopped and removed. I hope this will be done sensitively and we must watch to ensure that happens. However, I recognise the fact that even people who believe it is important to have an environment in which there are green spaces and trees are prepared to accept that some trees must go. I am prepared to accept that there will be major disruption. That is the reason it is courageous of the Government to take it on. I hope I have proved in some of the previous debates that because of the new techniques and advances in tunnel building the disruption caused by the creation of the metro or <Col N="969" /> underground system will be less than the Luas, but it will still be there. I made it clear in 1996 that I knew there would be disruption. Even if Luas had been scrapped and we had gone for a full underground system and nothing else, there would be considerable disruption and the people who proposed it would be blamed. There will be always be people who want to bellyache and only see the disruption. They only see the short-term nuisance; they do not see the long-term gain. That is one of the things which has held up progress in the transport area because, for political reasons, few Governments have had the foresight or the altruism to take on a scheme which would undoubtedly cause disruption. There will be complaints and articles in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>At last the Government has the money to do it. There will be overruns, but there have already been projected overruns on Luas. There were huge overruns on the DART. That is the nature of the game. At this time in the development of the country and of Dublin as a capital city, we are entitled to expect a first rate transport system, partly because, above everything else, we can afford it. I remember at the end of lengthy arguments and discussion with the principal antagonists to the underground system they said that they proposed an underground system in the beginning and knew it was the best system. However, they were told that they could not do it because of the money and that was the reason they committed themselves to the on-street tram vehicles. They had such an emotional commitment to the trams alone that they were incapable of regearing themselves to take on board the fact that one can have an underground system as well.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the system is properly integrated and that people can go from one system to another. I know the Minister has tried to incorporate this. We do not want self-contained units with no meshing. We need a system where people can move easily by either one means of transport or a combination of means of transport from any point in the city.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant advance. I would have liked greater concentration on the metro, but I presume legislation will follow which will deal specifically with it. I urge the Minister to use her clear and undoubted intelligence, her commitment and her energy to ensure the metro project is not sidelined and that it is fast-tracked, to use a metaphor which is appropriate to the transport circumstance, in order that we can all enjoy a cleaner and better city in which it is easier for the citizens to move around.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of public transport but there must also be a place for the car. It is a mistake for the public authorities to show antagonism toward the private motor vehicle, as Dublin Corporation is now doing. This will only disillusion citizens and it will lead ultimately to road rage. What about those who live in cities? Public policy has been directed towards bringing people back to live in the inner cities, yet the large new apartment blocks have no provision for car parking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> If Dublin Corporation was serious about transport policy, it would do something about its new 850-place car park for Dublin Corporation staff. The corporation is attempting to put everybody else off the roads but it is happy enough to keep using cars itself. I doubt if many of those vehicles have more than one passenger in them on their way to the Civic Offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her and her officials on the marvellous progress that has been made over recent years in the development of various transport initiatives, not only in the Dublin area but around the country. It is a sad indication of the state of the national rail network that when the Minister was appointed to her Department four years ago, it was necessary to immediately invest £400 million to render our rail network safe. It says much for the lack of investment in the preceding century that such an investment was necessary. To the best of my knowledge, from 1900 to 2000 not one mile of new rail track was laid while over the same period several hundred miles of track were lifted, to the regret of all concerned. There is no more striking example of this practice in the Dublin area than the lifting of the Harcourt Street line.</P>
      <P>That mistakes were made in the transport policy of successive Governments since the foundation of the State is agreed by all sides. If any lesson is to be learned from that, it is that foresight and vision are vital to proper planning. At a time when the resources are available to invest in major capital projects, we must look further ahead. We should not simply be content to make up lost ground but must also try to envisage the situation for future generations. The lead-in time for the implementation of any capital investment programme such as we are discussing is a lengthy one, for a variety of reasons. However, we should, where possible, look beyond that.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put this debate in historical context. The arrival of the railways in Ireland in the 19th century was mainly due to the industrial revolution in Britain. The first line in Ireland ran from Westland Row to what was then called Kingstown. That line was soon followed by the development of the Dublin to Drogheda line and then a further line to Belfast, and in due course the line to Rosslare. The remainder of the system developed from that eastern line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to look back at that history at a time when public transport has become a matter of hot public debate and see that it is over one century back that the major investments were made. Now, having suffered the century of the motor car &ndash; if I can refer to the 20th century as such &ndash; the cycle is turning again. The novelty of the motor car appears to be waning. That is putting it mildly from the point of view of those who sit in traffic jams as they commute in and out of Dublin on a daily basis. The mood of the public is moving towards a return to public transport. It is remarkable to look at the progress made over <Col N="971" /> the previous century, the revolution brought to so many lives by the motor car. Now, for a significant number of people, public transport is back in demand. It is good that is the case, but also unfortunate in that the problems caused by lack of investment are now only too clearly seen.</P>
    <P>The Bill debated here refers entirely to the greater Dublin area. However, the lack of infrastructure is not a problem confined to greater Dublin or the Pale. It is one which requires investment around the country. We should not talk of merely closing the gap, but look to the future and ensure that there is a viable system put in place to enable development. This should occur with a minimum of disruption and, to use Senator Norris's analogy, with relatively few eggs broken to make the omelette.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and her officials well in their work. Progress is already visible on the streets of Dublin and this is heartening. I refer particularly to the huge advances made at the Red Cow roundabout on the M50. All concerned are to be congratulated. I have a particular interest in the issue as in my home area, north County Dublin, from where I travel daily to the city, the majority of people are dependent on public transport to get to and from their work. To say that it is an area in need of attention is a gross understatement. The vast majority of the working population in north County Dublin commute, particularly towards the city and the airport, on a daily basis. The lack of infrastructure is a major handicap and a daily debilitation of quality of life for thousands of people in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>At a function today, the Taoiseach referred to the 1980s as having been the decade of debt reduction, to the 1990s as having been the decade of unemployment reduction and to the current decade as the decade of infrastructural development. I could not agree more, and the most basic infrastructure of all is transport. Other investment would be wasted if transport was not sufficiently well established. There is no point investing billions of pounds in the health services, developing our third level education system, and attracting major overseas investment in industry if our population cannot move from their homes to their work, education and hospitals. We must have the transport infrastructure in place to render other infrastructure investments viable. Significant priority investment in transport infrastructure is an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>We have before us elaborate plans for investment in this infrastructure in the Dublin area, and this is to be welcomed. I would argue strongly, however, for the prioritisation of investment at a level above and beyond what is currently envisaged. The plan, A Platform for Change, launched in September last year, outlines a strategy which will operate for the period 2000 to 2016. As stated, work is already under way on this plan. However, since it was published, other developments have taken place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I wish again to refer to Senator Norris's contribution and the story he related about his secretary's experience in travelling to work this morning from my home town, Skerries. The events outlined by the Senator are, unfortunately, all too common. At the risk of being accused of being parochial, I suggest that anyone who looks at the colour sketches in the various plans relating to the development of transport infrastructure in the Dublin area will see that the area between Malahide and Gormanston has been forgotten. These sketches show spur lines running to Maynooth, Athy, Navan&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not say anything about Athy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and other towns in each county adjoining Dublin. At the same time, however, the plan contains no investment for the area between Gormanston and Malahide in which Gormanston railway station &ndash; only 23 miles from Dublin on the Dublin to Belfast rail line &ndash; is located. Funding for development in this area is worthy of prioritisation.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that a train can travel from Drogheda to Connolly station in 29 minutes but that it takes twice that length of time for a train to travel from Gormanston, which is situated ten miles nearer to Dublin, to the same station. Senator Norris's secretary's experience is, unfortunately, all too common, but it serves to emphasise the necessity for the investment to which I refer. I am a reasonably regular user of the train service but, unfortunately, it is simply unreliable and probably functions at only 20% to 30% of its potential.</P>
      <P>The train service is absolutely essential because people must be able to travel to and from work. I accept that we have been spoiled in the past by the lack of overload on our roads and railways. At present, however, both our roads and railways are completely overloaded. There is a need to take action, preferably through investment in public transport, in order to rectify matters.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to suggest that there are a number of areas which, in terms of making investments above and beyond those outlined in the plan, are worthy of prioritisation. The Minister is aware of my views in relation to the necessity for a second bridge over the River Liffey to service the railway lines. Provision for such a bridge is contained in the plan, but it will be some time before it becomes a reality. The bridge is pivotal, crucial, vital &ndash; it is whatever Latin scholars refer to as a <i>sine qua non</i>. Without it there will be nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have to consult the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, about the bridge to which he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to do so. The bridge to which I refer is an absolute essential. The loop<Col N="973" /> line bridge over the River Liffey dictates the volume on our railway lines &ndash; not only the line to which I refer but also all others running south into the city. It is simply not acceptable that the line to which I refer should still be carrying the same capacity it carried over 100 years ago. At present, 12 trains per hour can travel over that bridge in a southerly direction and, equally, 12 trains per hour can make the journey in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, for those living on the north side, the problem is that there are four major lines feeding into those 12 slots heading south while there is only one line feeding into the 12 slots heading north. There is, therefore, only one quarter of the capacity available for each of the lines heading into the city from the north. That is a major difficulty.</P>
      <P>I assure the Minister that her colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is fully aware of this problem and will continue to be made aware of it because I do not intend to let matters lie. The bridge to which I refer must be built. I acknowledge that provision for it is contained in the plan but it is worthy of prioritisation.</P>
      <P>Another area worthy of prioritisation is that of the acquisition of properties in areas immediately adjoining rail lines and railway stations. People's ability to avail of public transport is being obstructed by the lack of auxiliary facilities, such as car parking facilities &ndash; better known as &ldquo;park and ride&rdquo; facilities. There is a serious lack of integrated commuter bus services to and from railway stations and an absence of car parking facilities immediately adjoining those stations. I recall that, as a young boy, I rode my bicycle to the railway station, parked it there and travelled on the train to the city. At Skerries and other railway stations 12, 14 or up to 20 little huts were provided to allow people to park their bicycles. Regular commuters used to rent a hut, lock their bikes there during the day and collect them in the evening. Obviously, the era of the automobile led to changes and the huts have disappeared. However, additional car parking spaces have not, to any great degree, been provided.</P>
      <P>There are major problems in housing estates on the Skerries to Dublin railway line, which are being illegally used as car parks. Emergency services &ndash; such as the fire brigade and ambulance services &ndash; are being handicapped in terms of gaining access to houses as a result of this illegal car parking. I am aware that, in the depths of last winter, one house in Skerries was obliged to go without home heating oil for five days because cars parked by commuters using the railway station had jammed up the access roads leading into the estate to such an extent that nobody could get in or out. God only knows what would have happened if the fire brigade or ambulance services had needed to gain entry to the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters I have addressed are worthy of serious consideration. It is the Minister's intention to propose amendments on Committee Stage to the effect that the agency's functions will relate <Col N="974" /> to the metro system and the light rail network only. I urge her to reconsider the position in the interim. The stretch of line to which I refer is the forgotten piece of the jigsaw. The area in which it is situated is part of the greater Dublin area and much closer to the centre of the city than some of the areas dealt with in this praiseworthy plan. While geographically it is much more adjacent to the city, the area is much further away in terms of the time it takes to travel to and from it. The question of providing funding for the rail line servicing this area is worthy of reappraisal. I urge the Minister to carry out such an appraisal. As Senator Norris stated, one cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her courage in bringing forward such a radical plan. Something must be done and this is the time to do it. If we purchase the land to which I refer and develop this most essential infrastructure, which is fundamental to all other infrastructural development, we will have spent our money well. Senator Norris's omelette might take some time to cook, but it will be all the more enjoyable to taste when it is finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers should not be flattered too much as it is probably bad for them. It is, however, always a pleasure to have the Minister in attendance because, while she might argue so vigorously as to almost intimidate, she does hear what one has to say. She never ignores a person although she might beat him or her over the head for what he or she has to say. I have experienced Ministers whose technique is to pretend not to hear what one has to say and to leave it out of their replies. It is a much more frustrating experience to have a Minister in attendance who will not deal with the issues than it is to have a Minister who deals with them vigorously and vocally. The latter is much easier to deal with and it is for that reason it is a pleasure to see the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is strange to wonder how we got to where we are in this crisis in transport. There is an excuse to a degree that what happened happened suddenly. Listening to the Government, one would imagine the economic boom began in June 1997 or a week later when the Government changed. In reality, a number of factors were involved, among them a considerable consensus about the fundamentals of economic growth. We did not have ideologically different Governments changing the education system inside out every time there was a change of Government. Neither had we ideologically driven Governments bent on nationalisation or privatisation, at least until now, a matter to which I will return. There was also a consensus about the use of foreign investment. The upshot is that we have had the signs of considerable economic growth for the best part of nine years. I heard the person who will soon be Italian foreign minister using us as an argument for the European Union to leave them alone for a while and he mentioned the nine or ten year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Two Governments straddled this period and, therefore, I am, to a degree, fireproofing myself. However, we sat on this problem for the best part of seven years and watched it worsen. The most basic principle of science I know is that, short of a nuclear reaction, one cannot make matter less. To put it in simple terms, one cannot fit a pint in a half pint glass or a litre in a half litre glass. We sat and watched an explosion in the numbers of cars and people at work. It was wonderful, and the greatest achievement the country has had in its history, much more than our affluence, is the fact that such a huge number are at work. The most socially progressive thing that can be done is to get people working in decently paid jobs. It is the thing which will, more than anything else, change society. However, we sat and watched and waited until the crisis literally hit us between the eyes. It hit Dublin first but we should never for a second imagine that the crisis in public transport is exclusive to Dublin or the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend that we sat through a deliberate neglect of the railway service dating back through a succession of Governments. The carriages on the train service I use almost every week between Cork and Dublin, which are among the best Iarnród Éireann has, are 20 years old. Imagine driving cars which are 20 years old. I am aware that Bus Éireann has a good line in using 20 year old buses to transport schoolchildren, but do not imagine many of us approve of this. We sat and let this neglect happen for 20 years. A good number of eminent economists, one of whom, Seán Barrett, was placed on the board of CIE by the founder of Senator Quill's party, told us that there was no future for railways. In Seán Barrett's case, he said so because railways did not compete. I will return to the economics of the railway system. The Department of Finance loved it and there was clearly, through a succession of Governments, a resistance on the part of that Department to the idea of investment in infrastructure, public transport infrastructure especially and public transport generally.</P>
    <P>From that came the first major railway crisis which is that the railway system has turned out to be profoundly unsafe. It is a little disingenuous to tell the public that the huge amount of money being invested in the railways will produce a spectacular improvement in what the public sees. Most of it will go to ensure the public is safe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I am investing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one disputes that, but we need much more if we are to see a transformation in the service. What we will get from current investment is a reduced risk of some of us getting killed, which is very welcome, but it will not make any difference to those who use railways if we do not have better railways. There is a difference and the Minister can argue about the details. The decision <Col N="976" /> to rectify the appallingly unsafe condition of many railways is a correct one. However, even if all that is done, there will not be an obvious huge difference in the railways unless more money is spent on them. That said, I recognise that we are making progress.</P>
      <P>The trade unions in the public transport sector are not doing very much to help. It is too trivial to describe it as an inter-union dispute. I remember a Mr. Walsh, formerly of Hibernian Insurance&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Eamonn Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a famous memo of whose was leaked concerning the attitudes of management in CIE to its workforce and concerning the quality of canteen and other facilities available to workers. It was obviously one of the greatest shocks of his business career for a person who came from the private sector. While the trade unions need a much more enlightened view of how to deal with the public and public transport, they come from a situation of profound neglect and indifference, apparently on the part of management.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing what we never did, such as there being no rail connection between the national airport and the centre of the capital of the country and our not thinking about it until recently when it will cost a fortune to acquire the land to do it. I am aware that it will be done at some stage and, like Senator Norris, I hope we are not in the world of aspiration and that these are firm decisions with capital resources allocated to them. It is ludicrous that it is not possible to travel on a rapid, frequent and comfortable rail service from various places in the city centre to the airport. The extraordinary services from Gatwick and Heathrow airports to the centre of London are examples of efficiently run railways which make a huge difference to the public and reduce one of the great consumers of taxi services. I get the feeling from talking to taxi drivers that they would be happy at this stage to see the back of Dublin Airport. Where they once saw it as a major source of funds, they do not see it that way any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is to be done? Much of what must be done will be in the medium to long term. While we have decided to focus on the long term and grin and bear it in the short term, an enormous amount could be done in terms of traffic management, especially in regulation. I am sick of the spectacle of intersections of major roads being blocked because people do not observe simple things like yellow boxes. I am tired of intersections of motorways, such as a roundabout on the M50, being blocked by the extra cars which shoot on after the lights have changed and which block everyone else. They all feed back into gridlock. They can be disposed of by proper enforcement of the law, as it stands, which involves personnel and a willingness to do it. While I do not have to suffer their ministrations, most people say the <Col N="977" /> introduction of clamping in Dublin has had a salutary effect on parking habits. Our reluctance to observe inconvenient regulations has been changed by that system. There is a need to enforce similar regulations in many areas.</P>
    <P>Why can hackneys not use bus lanes in Dublin? Why can a service which has provided huge numbers of people with reasonably low cost transport not use bus lanes or turn left at the bottom of Dawson Street? Senator Quill and I were in a hackney recently whose driver was reprimanded by a garda for turning left there. What logic is there to these regulations in a city whose transport system is stretched to the limit? These can only be regulatory leftovers which have gone unnoticed.</P>
    <P>We want a public transport system which is integrated, fast, frequent, reliable and safe. I have no ideological obsession with how that should be provided. I merely wish to be sure that no one else is attempting to enforce an ideology. We want the system which can best provide the conditions I have mentioned, the most important of which is safety.</P>
    <P>The public transport system must also be cheap. By this I do not mean merely not dear. The successful transport systems I have seen throughout Europe are comparatively cheap. This means they are heavily subsidised. It is impossible to run a profitable public transport system on prices which would make the system attractive to the public.</P>
    <P>We do not have time for a long debate on environmental economics but it is relevant to this question. What are the environmental costs of private transport compared to those of public transport? It is difficult to measure these things, although an interesting economist called David Pearce has made efforts in this direction. If one contrasts even the most global estimate of the environmental damage caused by our obsession with the private car, with the environmental savings gained from a greater use of public transport, the comparison is made more meaningful if a value is placed on quality of life. It does not matter how one estimates that value. If the cost of damage to people's health and quality of life from the use of private cars is calculated, a completely different economic argument can be made. Such a cost cannot be estimated as precisely as the price of eggs or milk. Nevertheless, the argument for subsidising public transport is overwhelming. It will be more difficult for the Minister to persuade the Department of Finance to provide money for a long-term commitment to public transport than for a single capital project, but commitment to an ongoing public transport system is more important than large capital projects.</P>
    <P>I do not object to public private partnerships, concessions or joint ventures if they work for the benefit of those for whom the service is being provided. I am not convinced that the private sector is more efficient. Those of us who have lived at the receiving end of a private sector monopoly might agree that they are worse than public ser<Col N="978" /> vice monopolies. I am thinking, in particular, of cable television companies. I contrast the service they provide with that provided by the ESB, which is a public service and, effectively, still a monopoly. Public private partnerships must be cost efficient but they must achieve cost efficiency in a transparent way and clear performance criteria must be laid down for them. This is currently lacking in public private partnerships. The Eastlink and Westlink toll bridges are operated by public private partnerships. If a partnership is given a cash cow such as the two toll bridges, cost criteria should be laid down for it. One of the criteria ought to be the length of queues at toll booths. One should not allow someone to build a bridge across the Liffey on the busiest motorway in Ireland and have motorists wait 20 minutes for the privilege of going across. If an operator cannot provide a service which makes things better for people it should not be providing the service. This rule should apply to all the Minister's new ideas. I do not object to any of them, provided they meet criteria which are clearly focused on making life better for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Experiments in privatisation in terms of the railways in Britain have left the public with the worst of both worlds. Fares have increased dramatically and co-ordination of services has disappeared. It is a salutary experience to walk around a British railway station looking for an information desk. Each railway company runs a different concession from a different platform and no one can give one all the information one needs. Let us not be driven towards adopting systems which do not work because someone has an ideological preference for them. The majority of public opinion in Britain favours renationalisation of the railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is true. Most people in Britain wish it had never happened. Let us use what works, provided we have a clear view of what that is. What works is getting more at a price which is attractive to consumers. Rail fares have risen in Britain, efficiency has got worse and accountability has gone. At the same time many senior people in the privatised utilities are being paid salaries five times those of their predecessors in the nationalised railways which provided at least as good, if not a better service. I do not have to remind the Minister of the Californian electricity experience. If I were the Minister for Public Enterprise with responsibility for deregulation of the electricity service, I would be very nervous about pursuing any course unless I knew it would work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not object to having a variety of arrangements provided they work, are driven by clear and transparent criteria and have been proven to do things better. In my place of work, the Cork Institute of Technology, I have seen two public private partnerships. I have been impressed by <Col N="979" /> the speed with which things proceeded from the ministerial announcement that the nautical college in Ringaskiddy could go ahead to the stage of a contract being signed. This worked extraordinarily well compared to the painstaking process of getting agreement with the Department of Education and Science for similar projects. There is much to be said for public-private partnerships, provided they are transparent and above board.</P>
    <P>The more I live in politics the more I realise that the public needs the political system to defend it. I am less and less happy with agencies and bodies which are not accountable to the Oireachtas. Senators repeatedly raise questions about the National Roads Authority and are told, correctly, by the Cathaoirleach that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not responsible for the NRA. The authority appears before the joint committee once every six months, makes its presentation and everyone thinks it is wonderful.</P>
    <P>What can I do about the insanity of the current position of the National Roads Authority which has discovered that the main Dublin-Cork road through County Kildare is too crowded and has decided to make an alternative route through my home town? The junction at which traffic from the main Dublin-Cork road arrives is ten metres wide, at most. Nobody thought of restricting it to light vehicles only with the result that the road in front of my mother's house now thunders and rattles with heavy vehicles and cars all day, every day. This has occurred because the National Roads Authority decided to send the traffic that way, assuming there was zero cost involved. All this investment is wide of the mark, however, because it is not a case of zero cost. I am saying this for the benefit of the Department of Finance as much as for the Minister. I do not know if my own party's spokespersons approve of the metro project, but I have to say that I do.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be wary of consultants. I read a newspaper report about somebody she engaged to advise her about overcrowding on the Arrow service.

      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate, including Senators Caffrey, Liam Fitzgerald, Norris, Glennon and Ryan. As always, debates in this House are reasoned, instructive and interesting. I thank Senator Ryan for acknowledging that I genuinely do listen. I find the debates on legislation, both in this House and the Lower House, fascinating. Views in this House are expressed in a much less confrontational way, which is a mark of honour for the Seanad. In Dáil Éireann one hears views and ideas from people all around the country. Many things can strike one in listening to such debates. Matters I recall in discussions on radio and television or in preparing legislation come from things that have been said to me during debates in the Dáil and Seanad. I cannot understand Ministers who do not pay attention to the debate being held. Apart from anything else it is very interesting. It must be terribly boring to put one's head down and not listen.</P>

      <P>I will not go into all that. Senator Caffrey proposed a western point of view &ndash; as he always does in dealing with legislation &ndash; which is interesting to hear. He asked the reason the rail procurement agency could not be given to CIE. Our ideas on that matter are clear. A rail procurement agency would be swifter in doing its business concerning projects such as the Luas and metro. That is not to decry, however, the long years of service that CIE has given.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey mentioned that bit by bit during the years CIE got out of the haulage business through bad service which included stopping work and leaving leaving goods that had to be delivered. For a number of years when in my early twenties, I was a licensed haulage operator along with my brother, Paddy. We bought a plate for a huge amount of money and ran services between Athlone and other areas. That continued for about 14 years until the beginning of European transit operations.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey asked about the running of Luas. We had a competition to decide who would run it and approximately 20 companies applied. They were whittled down to five. CIE was one of the applicants. An outside group decided on the whittling down from which CIE did not emerge.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey said that liberalisation was good and I agree with him. He also mentioned inter-union rivalry in the west. Last year, in particular, the west had a huge dose of ILDA, if Senators will excuse me being brisk about it, but that is exactly what it was. The rail lines were held up by the dispute. It is heartening to hear the general consensus on public-private partnerships which the Senator strongly endorsed.</P>
      <P>I also thank Senator Liam Fitzgerald for his contribution. He said, quite rightly, as did Senator Caffrey, that this legislation is significant, although not major. On the face of it, I accept what the Senator said. At the same time, however, it marks a huge departure from what would have been an earlier way of doing things and so, in that way, it is significant.</P>
      <P>The Senator anticipated matters about which Senator Norris also spoke. He mentioned raucous commentators &ndash;&lsquo;raucous' is a lovely word &ndash; and young people in their first or second jobs who are keen to have a car to show off as a status symbol. They want to be part of the general modern tempo of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the criticism made when we announced that part of the Luas project was going underground. I was amazed by that debate which I remember both here and in the Dáil. Several people said: &ldquo;You'd let a woman go underground?&rdquo; which was the daftest thing I had ever heard because women have been using the underground systems in London, Paris, Moscow and elsewhere for the past 100 years. The idea that, in an age of equality, one would not let a woman go underground was a negation of the opening up of society. The Senator rightly praised Padraic White who heads up the advisory group <Col N="982" /> to the railway inspectorate, for which safety is a priority.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris had a right to crow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know enough about him in that respect, but he certainly had a right to crow on this matter. I remember the debate which Senator Avril Doyle took in this House. I was not the shadow spokesperson in that area but I remember the debate. He strongly supported an underground element to Luas and the notion of a metro. At the time there were procedures involved whereby it was said it could not, would not and should not happen. However, it will happen. The Senator called for the speedy implementation of the metro and referred, as did Senator Liam Fitzgerald, to public private partnerships. I am sorry to hear Rudi Monaghan is not well and I offer him my best wishes because he is one of those behind underground public transport and metros in city centres.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris claimed there was not sufficient reference in the Bill to the metro, but we will introduce an amendment define &ldquo;metro&rdquo; and copperfasten it. He suggested that the proposed station in O'Connell Street should be called the James Joyce station. Metro will go to contract and its objectives are quite clear. Senator Norris referred to inordinate delays. I fully agree with him and other Senators who mentioned the need for integration of public transport whereby one can easily transfer from one form to another.</P>
      <P>Senator Glennon referred to the historical position regarding railways. In the 20th century no new track was laid and a great deal of track was taken up. Rail transport was the great white hope of the 19th century. There was a great deal to be said for colonisation in that respect as investment in rail transport was secured.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I only referred to public transport. Senator Glennon quite rightly mentioned his own area in north county Dublin where there is a lack of infrastructure and people are hampered on a daily basis. He referred to the capital projects in the health and education spheres in the area which will fail if people cannot get from A to B in a reasonable time. He is from Skerries and echoed Senator Norris's comments about his Skerries experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Glennon said the Malahide to Gormanston stretch of countryside had been ignored and investment in public transport is needed there. He referred to the need for a second bridge to service the M50 and a second loopline bridge on the River Liffey because the rail lines travelling through the north side of the city are only operating at one quarter capacity. Pat Mangan in my Department and the officials present with me are aware of that and there are plans afoot. <Col N="983" /> However, the problem lies with the speed at which they can be implemented. I appreciate the Senator's comments and will get back to him with the detail of those plans, which have been drafted in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of property at railway stations and the provision park and ride facilities highlights another anomaly. Many of the issues raised by Senators Glennon and Ryan are the preserve of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but there is a need for a transport Department which will deal with rail and road transport because they are interlinked. I will make that proposal when we produce our general election manifesto in 12 months because it makes a great deal of sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have a busy summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be an election in the autumn unless all of us suffer sunstroke if we get the good weather we are supposed to throughout the summer.</P>
      <P>I hail from a railway town, Athlone, which is a major crossing point. Senator Glennon related how people used to ride to railway stations on their bicycles. They parked them in individual sheds for which they had a lock and key and continued their journey on the train. Those sheds have disappeared and there are not enough park and ride facilities at railway stations. Nearby housing estates are clogged up with cars which are parked there illegally and which block ambulances and other emergency services from getting through.</P>
      <P>I thank all Senators for their welcome. It is a lovely sign of respect. Nobody ever thanks one for coming to the Dáil but it is nice trait of this House. Senator Ryan correctly said the public transport problem straddled a number of Governments. The expansion of the economy came rushing at us with annual growth rates in excess of 7% since 1993. We saw it all coming but we waited until it hit us in the face to address public transport. The growing economy has meant increased numbers of cars and congestion, which necessitates the provision of more public transport.</P>
      <P>Change takes time and, unfortunately, the measures we have taken will take time. One cannot go to a supermarket and pick up 20 DART carriages. They are not sold like that as they take two to three years to produce once they are ordered. The implementation of transport plans and necessary legislation take time and in the meantime, absolutely correctly, there has been growing impatience regarding proper public transport provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in the Department of Finance find it very difficult. When I became a member of Cabinet for the first time in 1987 the Department of Finance made a proposal for the railway line to <Col N="984" /> end at Athlone. It was about to re-engage in its favourite pastime of taking up rail lines, which had been the case in previous decades. Thankfully, that did not happen. I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance because he has been generous with his purse in regard to public transport.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan felt our strategies were for the medium to long term and that there were no short-term strategies. However, the provision of extra carriages and safety measures which have been taken are part of our short-term strategy. There has been significant change in bus transport. There will be 300 new buses in Dublin by the end of the year, all of which will have low floors and will be accessible by disabled people. New buses have been provided in Cork, Limerick and Waterford. The provision of such buses was a short-term strategy because people would not use the older vehicles, many of which had become belching Bessies producing high levels of emissions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan's comments on public transport integration, safety, speed and cost. It is amazing that countries which were subject to the much derided Stalinist rule have marvellous public transport systems. One can travel anywhere underground or overground on their systems, which are fast, reliable, cheap and subsidised. People did not have cars and, therefore, a decent public transport system was necessary. We fell in love with motor cars and thought we would never have enough of them, with one, two, three or four in the driveway if it could hold them.</P>
    <P>When I attend my round of talks with the Department of Finance each year, the officials are not interested in the environmental costs of decent public transport because, as Senator Ryan said, such costs cannot be quantified similar to buying a bag of sugar or a loaf of bread. I agree that, environmentally, it is enormously beneficial to be transported on a train from Cork, Skerries or Ballina to one's destination rather than to drive in one's car, which produces emissions, and be frustrated and befuddled with worry and tension.</P>
    <P>On the question of the efficient use of capital resources and performance criteria, there will have to be performance criteria in respect of the public private partnerships. In regard to the Californian example, I talk about that on a daily basis. I smiled when I heard it mentioned because in the debate in the other House on the Nice summit, Deputies Noonan and Quinn spoke about the need to deregulate the electricity industry earlier than planned. That is what happened in California. They went at it bald-headed. They kept prices down and deregulated at an unbelievable rate, but what happened? They did not have the capacity to cope with that. California is a prime example for us.</P>
    <P>Generally the PPPs can be worked through much quicker. I remember in schools there were many stages as one planned something and each stage took so long, so there are efficiencies as the <Col N="985" /> example of the Marine College in Cork highlights.</P>
    <P>Senator Glennon talked about safety and I accept the point about the £400 million that was necessary just to make the lines safer. One could not put hand on heart and say there will never be an accident. That would be foolish. I remember the day Mary McAleese became President, it could have been a day of burials and lamentation throughout the land because of the train crash just beyond Knockcroghery in Roscommon. That train crashed at a point where there were very high embankments, which were laid 130 years ago, against which the train came to rest when it came off the line. The crash was not Iarnród Éireann's fault. The investment was not being put into that area. Those trains were safe because they were being run so slowly that if a crash happened, the train would come to a halt, but we were lucky the Knockcroghery crash happened at that point. Iarnród Éireann has a safe record and I commend it on that, although we will have a rail safety audit.</P>
    <P>The first action I had to take as Minister was to initiate an independent rail safety study and implement its recommendations. One could not remain as a transport Minister if that had not been done. One could not have the responsibility. To this day there is a rule under the old legislation that the railway safety officer &ndash; we will bring railway safety legislation to this House in the autumn &ndash; has to inform the Minister immediately when there is an accident. When my telephone rings late at night or very early in the morning, I immediately assume there has been a rail crash. Thankfully, that is not often the case, although there are many sad cases of people committing suicide &ndash; I understand there was one recently in County Cork. Above everything else the safety of passengers is the main responsibility. I take the point that in tandem with that, we have to have better carriages, more and improved services and additional areas served, but the first priority was to make the rail line as safe as possible. I am sure all Cork Senators would agree with that. The LUTS study, which is ongoing with the local authorities and the results of which are awaited, will show us what needs to be done in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for going on. I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate. As always, the views were informed, interesting and worth recording.</P>

    <Title>Racism Awareness Programme: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's lack of movement on the promised racial awareness programme.</P>
      <P>I am happy to propose this motion. Although we may have strong disagreements, I am pleased to welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the House.</P>
      <P>As regards Private Members' Business, will the Government organise matters more efficiently so there is a roster? Such a system would give Members, including Government Senators, time to select relevant issues and to brief themselves and their supporters. It is unsatisfactory that Members are given notice at the last minute of the opportunity to raise matters. I was informed last Thursday that I would have an opportunity to raise this matter because Senator Henry was unable to be in the House tonight. Luckily I was able to select a subject which struck a chord, namely, the issue of racism and the Government's responsibility in this regard. I am not criticising Members or the staff of the House, but I am suggesting that there should be a roster at least one month in advance.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has launched a campaign which has caused some controversy. The campaign poster has caused some offence as it shows pictures of the Minister, the Taoiseach and, I think, the Tánaiste and includes words to the effect that, &ldquo;Some people say these people are involved in racism, others say they could not care less&rdquo;, or something like that. Offence was taken at the use of the word &ldquo;involved&rdquo;. This is a clever poster as it attracts attention and ruffles a few feathers. However, the poster has a double meaning. It suggests that political leaders have said they are committed to combating racism, yet the performance on the ground has been, by and large, thin. I have no doubt that is the case.</P>
      <P>In launching this campaign, Amnesty International stated that it was up to those who raised these issues in the past to show their consistency by continuing to raise them. That is sufficient justification. I have repeatedly raised this issue in the House, and nowhere is an awareness campaign more necessary than in this House. I will not name anyone, but in the ante-chamber one of my colleagues asked me if I had been to the pub in Parnell Street which is run by black people who do not allow white people in. Only one pub in Parnell Street is run by black people and I know it well. That pub is run a lot better now than when it was run in the interests of the absentee landlord who lived in Manchester and when every down and out dope pusher in Dublin was allowed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This pub is now owned by a Nigerian businessman and is open to everyone. The pub offers appetisers. I had a glass of wine in the pub a few days ago and I was delighted by the truly multicultural atmosphere and the welcome I received. If an informed Member of the Oireachtas can, by <Col N="987" /> hearsay, be given such an impression, what chance is there for the rest of the population in the absence of a committed programme of education?</P>
    <P>We in the South are shamed by virtue of the fact that the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness MLA, has just launched his programme. It is not often that I get the opportunity to praise a member of Sinn Féin and someone who has been honest enough to acknowledge that he is a former gunman. However, I do so, and more power to him. He is living up to what was suggested.</P>
    <P>This motion will result in a vote as it condemns the Government. No Government can just sit there and agree with being condemned. However, I wished to see what the motion would draw out of the woodwork. The motion comprises one and a half lines, yet it drew an amendment running to about one and a half pages. This is interesting as it suggests that I struck a nerve.</P>
    <P>The amendment deletes all the words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo;, endorses the Government, recognises that Ireland is an increasingly multicultural society and so on. It also applauds the Government and welcomes the national anti-racism public awareness campaign. The Minister is nodding. How can the Government welcome something about which it knows nothing? How could the Government know anything about this campaign as it does not exist. It has only been formally acknowledged &ndash; it is a dead letter.</P>
    <P>I am asking that the Government live up to its promises and reveal what the Minister has done in light of the announcement in October 2000 of a propaganda campaign to combat racism. The Minister was widely and justly praised at the time for this initiative which was seen as something significant to which the Government would live up. There was a kind of contract with the people. However, that contract has not been delivered on. I am looking for, in legal terms, specific performance in terms of this contract. I would be very happy if the Minister could satisfy the House that he has performed specifically.</P>
    <P>The matter is made more urgent by the daily spate of attacks, and later on I will put some of these on the record. I am sure the Minister is familiar with them and I know he deplores them as much as anybody else in the House. These have happened in our cities to people perceived to be different. If intelligent people believe the kind of hogwash that I have just mentioned about a pub in Parnell Street, many other resentments spring up &ndash; that people are getting freebies here and there, that they are being housed in luxury accommodation and that they are being given cigarettes, etc. Jealousy sets in very rapidly.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Mr. McGuinness, has lived up to the promise of doing something in the absence of anything being done here. In January 2001, we finally ratified the UN convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. We were the 157th <Col N="988" /> country to do so. That is not a position on the league table of which we can be particularly proud, but at least we did it. This has consequences. It means that the activity of the Irish Government will now be supervised by a UN committee, with formal reports required every two years. Our first report is due early next year. It will be a great pity if we have not implemented the promised programme.</P>
    <P>Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the following in Strasbourg in October 2000:</P>
    <P>Politicians should lead by example. This is an issue which calls for a strong stance and a transparent approach. Some leaders have had the courage to speak out clearly and show solidarity with victims of racially-motivated attacks. We need more of that &ndash; and not only after outrages are committed. We need to hear our political leaders championing diversity, extolling the virtues of multicultural, multi-ethnic societies, defending the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the clear example of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, how many of our senior politicians, especially on the Government side, can claim they have acted in the manner described by the former President, Mary Robinson? There have been one or two shameful examples of Members of the other House using inflammatory language in an attempt to gain votes. Only rarely were they strongly condemned by their senior colleagues.</P>
    <P>Questions must be asked of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I would be very grateful if he or his advisers could provide answers. Is there, many months after the announcement was made, a campaign package ready to combat racism? If so, what is the proposed launch date of the campaign? We know about Northern Ireland, but have no knowledge of the campaign date here. What is the precise focus of the national awareness campaign? Exactly how much of the allocated budget of £4.5 million has been spent to date? What are the campaign materials being produced &ndash; posters, leaflets, television or radio broadcasts? What is the timeframe of their production? Have briefs been issued to designers and tenders invited for any printed materials? These are the practical matters that the Minister will know about if there really is a campaign in existence.</P>
    <P>I listened to the splendid advertisements on the radio by Amnesty International, and I congratulate the organisation for them. They consisted of Dublin-sounding voices talking about living in Dublin or Ireland, being proud to be black, but ashamed of Irish society. That was interesting as they do not feel that they have been made part of our community in the way they would like to be. It is shameful to think that a voluntary, non-governmental organisation like Amnesty International has led the field in the area, despite the commitment of the Government. I know of no <Col N="989" /> radio advertising in the Government's campaign. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House that there is, but I have not heard it. The one by Amnesty International, which I have heard, serves as a reproach to the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the steering committee to which the Minister frequently refers, how many times has it met? How long were the meetings? How many members attended &ndash; all or just a few? What decisions did they make on the national awareness campaign, the review of the existing prohibition of incitement to hatred legislation and proposals for new legislation to fill gaps? </P>
    <P>Racially motivated crime stands out. It is always bad when there is an assault, but it is significantly worse if it is racially motivated. We do not seem to have legislation to cover this satisfactorily. What resources are at the disposal of the committee? How many delegated staff does it have and what are their precise duties? Are minutes of the meetings kept and are they available to this House, or are we going to find ourselves in a situation like Marian Finucane when she asked about protocol and was told that she was entitled to the information but that it would not be given to her? She would have to use the Freedom of Information Act, which would take her months. I suppose we could do that, but it would not be necessary if there were co-operation and goodwill. Perhaps the Minister will be able to prove me wrong, but I believe that there have been only two meetings of the committee, that nothing of significance has been achieved and that members are becoming disillusioned. Consequently, I call on the Government to take strong action.</P>
    <P>We must address the issue of racial awareness, and we have a legal obligation to do so. We have recently ratified the UN convention and have until 2003 to implement the EU anti-racism directive. Under this directive, we will have to broaden the scope of our equality legislation. The Minister congratulates himself in the amendment of the equality legislation, apparently ignoring the fact that, under our EU obligations, we will have to broaden its scope. Certain exemptions the State has allowed itself will have to be dropped and sanctions for discrimination will have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</P>
    <P>On the subject of dissuading people by law, one will say that one cannot legislate for morality. I have said so myself. One cannot change people's hearts immediately by legislation, but let me put on the record the words of Martin Luther King, who addressed this topic:</P>
    <P>. . . while it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated. It may be true that the law cannot change the heart but it can restrain the heartless. It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and I think that is pretty important, also.</P>
    <P>While the law may not change the hearts of men, it does change the habits of men if vigorously enforced, and we certainly need it in light of the <Col N="990" /> attacks that have been perpetrated and the experience of some of those in this country who happen to be of a different colour or ethnic origin. I think particularly of the young man, Christian Richardson, who was employed here in a high-tech industry. He was very successful and enjoyed himself socially. His parents came to Ireland to visit and while walking along Pearse Street, they was attacked and his father was very nearly killed as a result. They managed to survive. Later, the young man, who courageously decided to stay in Ireland, was badly beaten in Fairview in a racially motivated attack. That is a reproach to all of us. I know I have been critical of the Minister, but I will be happy if he is able to answer the questions I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on bringing this matter to the attention of the House. As the House will be aware, the Senator has led the fight for human rights in this House on many issues and it is fair to say that we have all followed, some with more reluctance than others. He has succeeded on nearly all these issues, in terms of legislation at least.</P>
      <P>The problem with issues of this sort is not a matter of legislation but, as Senator Norris said, of legislating about morality. It is about changing people's minds and actions in a non-legislative fashion. A long-term campaign is needed against racism. Somewhere in the human psyche is a terrible fear of the unknown and included in this are people coming into the country from abroad, because it is part of the human condition to regard that their entry as a threat. If we do not learn to regard it as a benefit it will be to the detriment of ourselves as well as those who come into the country.</P>
      <P>That is the problem we are facing and it is not a new one for the nations of the world, but it is for Ireland. I suggest that we are not facing it very successfully, and this has to be acknowledged by reading the Government's amendment to Senator Norris's motion. Very little is being done and this amendment is camouflage for not taking concrete action. It is aspirational and once again expresses the views, hopes, dedication and commitment of everybody in this House to a non-racist outlook and policy, but does absolutely nothing about it. The problem is long term, very expensive and requires great commitment from everybody. There is no sign of that in the Government's rather flimsy amendment today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people are the most successful hypocrites in Europe on this issue. We have never before had to confront the problems associated with racism. Certainly we have had minorities, ones which we have treated badly. We were late in recognising the difficulties and rights of the gay community. We were late in recognising the same rights and difficulties of the Traveller community. Whereas we recognised them, certainly in the case of the Traveller community, by introducing an Incitement to Hatred Bill and similar legislation, we have not been successful in changing <Col N="991" /> people's minds about this issue. There is still bitter prejudice against the Traveller community which has not been resolved either by legislation or education. Despite the fact that we introduced incitement to hatred legislation, we do not seem to have been successful.</P>
    <P>Why did we introduce incitement to hatred legislation? It is very interesting, because it is fundamentally dramatic in its impact. It is a major infringement of the freedom of speech which we cherish so much. It is a rightful infringement of this freedom, because Irish society and official Ireland takes the view that racism is so fundamentally wrong that there must be curbs in other fundamental rights to stop racism. Freedom of speech is not an absolute, nor should it be. There are other areas as well, such as libel, where it should not be an absolute. We decided on the issue of racism that absolute rights should be curtailed, and that is indisputably right and proper.</P>
    <P>The problem for Ireland is that we have been isolated and immune from this issue for so long that we have developed in our own minds the most extraordinary reputation that we are great crusaders against racism, that is as long as it is somewhere else. We crusaded for so long against racism, and rightly so, in other countries. We crusaded against discrimination in Northern Ireland and against racism in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Everybody in Ireland was on the anti-apartheid bandwagon when the Dunnes Stores workers were picketing because of South African oranges. Nobody said a word against them and there was a great consensus in their favour. Everybody in Ireland was in favour of sanctions against South Africa, provided, of course, we only did a tiny percentage of our trade with them, provided it was a long way away. We were, proudly, partly responsible for leading world opinion against racism in South Africa. We were an independent, neutral nation which had for a long time championed the rights of minorities. We portrayed ourselves as being an oppressed nation. With that experience who could more clearly speak for those minorities abroad than we could? No one, and that was fine, that was right and we had a proud record.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Keogh and I went to South Africa as observers for the first multi-racial elections. On the surface nobody could be better qualified than an Irish parliamentarian to do that. We had an unblemished record against racism because we did not have to confront the problem. It was so easy to do that, and so we have been able to contribute and claim the credit for the reduction and the fall of racism in other countries, as a neutral country with our history of being an oppressed minority.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, now that the problems associated with minorities and multi-culturalism landed on our own doorstep, we cannot cope with them. I do not doubt the belief of the Government and every politician in this country when they say, or certainly the lip service which they pay and in <Col N="992" /> which they in theory believe, regarding the equality of races and the equal treatment which must be accorded. The practice is different and at present we are floundering.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister and others when they announce a £4.5 million plan, but I see no follow-up or evidence, as Senator Norris has so rightly said, of a concrete plan to counter racism in the longer term. It will not be done with £4.5 million, £45 million or even £450 million. The only way it will be done is with a long-term plan of education and the removal of fear.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to answer the specific questions Senator Norris asked about the programme which was announced, where it is going and what is being done. If he does not and he allows this problem to continue to exist in a vacuum, which is what will happen, unscrupulous politicians will inevitably exploit that, as they have done all over the world to whip up hatred, which is just beneath the surface of the human mind on this issue. They will whip up hatred against these minorities and then we will become the oppressor, no longer the oppressed. They will use that hatred to get themselves elected. Ireland has a proud record on this issue, and we have an opportunity to practise what we preach. The Minister has an opportunity to show the world that we can pass the test, which we are in danger of failing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Donovan for giving way.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to tackling racism in all its forms and has made very significant progress in the past four years in introducing measures to combat racism. Racism is an issue which we must unite against as a society and developments in the past week have been unhelpful in terms of supporting the many initiatives undertaken by the Government on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation. It has established agencies such as the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigation to deal with victims of racism and discrimination. Other bodies such as the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Garda Racial and Intercultural Office, and the Reception and Integration Agency have also been established under the Government. A new Human Rights Commission has been established to protect human rights and the Government has provided its full support to the Citizen Traveller Campaign in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the Government that Ireland now has one of the most comprehensive codes of anti-discrimination legislation in Europe. We are a Government of action, not words. I am particularly pleased to have piloted through the Oireachtas both the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, which prohibit discrimination on nine grounds, including religion, race and membership of the Traveller community. Both Acts contain a broad definition <Col N="994" /> of race which covers race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this comprehensive body of legislation allowed the Government to proceed with Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. We were not in a position to ratify the convention until the Attorney General was satisfied that we had sufficient legal measures in place to ratify and implement its provisions. Ratification entered into force last January. The new legislation meant that the Government was in a position to implement the provisions of the convention with immediate effect. The Government has already signed the major universal and European human rights instruments and complies fully with their terms.</P>
    <P>The new Equality Authority has been working towards the elimination of discrimination on the grounds covered by our legislation, including the ground of race. The authority has prepared a range of videos in various languages to help people understand the equality legislation and the institutions established by the legislation. Last November, the authority organised an anti-racism in the workplace week jointly with IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation and the ICTU.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Equality Investigation, which was also established under the Employment Equality Act, has been providing redress for individuals who consider that they may have suffered discrimination. The Government enacted the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, allowing for the establishment of the Human Rights Commission. The commission will be a powerful independent body charged with the task of keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of our laws in relation to the protection of human rights in their widest sense.</P>
    <P>Legislation is in place which prohibits incitement to hatred. The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, makes it an offence to incite hatred against any group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the Traveller community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in Dublin Castle last autumn at our national conference against racism preparatory to the world conference against racism, the 1989 Act is being reviewed in my Department with a view to improving its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, that is, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, the State has the power to declare illegal and prohibit organisations which promote and incite racial discrimination. The Act also renders membership of such organisations a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism was established in 1998 with direct funding from my Department. <Col N="995" /> As part of its overall aim of developing an integrated approach against racism, the NCCRI introduced an anti-racism protocol for political parties and a declaration of intent for candidates at elections. I am pleased to confirm that the protocol and declaration have received the support of, and have been adopted by, all the political parties in the State.</P>
    <P>The national consultative committee has also been active in the area of awareness raising. In 1999, it organised a series of over 80 events nationwide in its &ldquo;True Colours&rdquo; festival in association with Government and non-government agencies. These included seminars, lectures, artistic events, launches and other intercultural and anti-racism initiatives. The committee has established a training unit for anti-racism awareness raising training to Departments, national media organisations, trade unions, etc. To mark the international day against racism on 21 March, the committee launched an information pack for schools in association with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Garda has also been active in the area of anti-racism. The Garda Racial and Intercultural Office has recently been established. The office is responsible for co-ordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity. The office produced a video aimed at a Garda audience which examines the effects of prejudice, discrimination and cultural differences as well as providing information for gardai on dealing with racist incidents. The office also publishes and circulates a periodic newsletter.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, the Government has provided £900,000 towards the Citizen Traveller Campaign in order to address the underlying causes of mistrust between Travellers and the settled community and to promote a greater understanding between both communities.</P>
    <P>With improvements in the economy in the late 1990s, the number of immigrants has increased significantly. The number of asylum of applications rose steeply from about 700 in 1995 to almost 11,000 in 2000. The Government recognises that Ireland is becoming an increasingly multicultural society, in which persons of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds enrich our society. New policies and actions have been taken and continue to be taken to deal with the increase in the population of ethnic minorities. The Government recently established a statutory agency, the Reception and Integration Agency, under the aegis of my Department. The agency has responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of services for both asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>Last October the Government agreed to my proposal to implement a national anti-racism public awareness programme with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed <Col N="996" /> and cultural diversity is valued. Work on the implementation of the awareness programme is well under way. The framework for the evaluation for the programme was developed by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism after consultations with non-governmental organisations, social partners Departments over a three month period.</P>
    <P>The Government allocated a core budget of £1.5 million per annum to the programme over a three-year period beginning this year. In February I announced the composition of the high-level steering group to implement the programme in partnership with the equality division of my Department. The steering group has an independent chairperson and 19 members and had its first meeting on 2 April. It was not found possible to meet earlier owing to the foot and mouth disease precautions and, in fact, earlier meetings were cancelled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The group is now involved in the three month preparatory phase of the programme outlined in the NCCRI evaluation. The first task the steering group undertook was to arrange for a baseline survey of attitudes and opinions on minority ethnic groups, racism and interculturalism among the general public and key audiences. The nationwide survey will be a cornerstone of the programme, its results helping to determine the focus and direction of the campaign while serving as a benchmark. Further surveys will be arranged during and at the end of the programme to assist in monitoring changes in attitudes and opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering group is aware of the need to support community-based initiatives. It intends to involve community groups, area-based partnerships and organisations of minority ethnic groups in the awareness programme. With this in mind, plans are under way to launch a grants fund to support and facilitate such groups and organisations. This is an aspect of the programme the group can proceed with immediately and in advance of a formal launch, preparations for which are in train. The launch and media campaign, if they are to be a success, must be well planned and properly co-ordinated and there are key tasks to be carried out as part of that. These include the conduct of a survey of attitudes and opinions, analysis of its results, development of links with key organisations working in the area of racism, integration of existing initiatives into the programme, development of a distinct identity and image for the programme, preparation of <Col N="997" /> media and information packs and the seeking of support of key media organisations.</P>
    <P>Part of the task of the steering group will be to monitor all elements of the programme and measure its impact and success. The group will provide a progress report to Government on an annual basis and will also publish an annual report. We all appreciate the need for an anti-racism awareness programme. However, the temptation to rush into short-term actions must be resisted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been resisted very well so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This programme will operate over a period of three years and it needs to be carefully planned. It will be broad-based and aim to produce long-term sustainable outcomes lasting well beyond the three-year period. The programme will be as successful as the foundations on which it is built and the high-level steering group must be allowed the space to bring its expertise to this challenging task. I wish the group every success in its work and I look forward to seeing the results of its efforts in due course.</P>
      <P>Racism is a scourge on societies and the Government is determined that it should not be allowed to gain a foothold. Addressing the problem is a serious task which requires commitment and action on many levels. I ask the House for its support in allowing the Government to continue its worthwhile efforts in reviewing and developing the numerous measures it has put in place to tackle racism in all its forms. These have been outlined by Senator O'Donovan in the Government's amendment to the motion put down by Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>This has traditionally been a country of emigration and it is only in recent years that we have experienced different ethnic minorities arriving on our shores in larger numbers than anticipated. While we set out on a greenfield site, legislatively, structurally and administratively, measures were put in place to provide what is a very sophisticated system. This system, like it or not, has been a major success and I would go so far as to say that asylum seeking procedures and the accommodation, care and attention given to the human beings who arrive on our shores are second to none. I challenge any Senator to go across Europe and produce for me a system which is better structurally, administratively&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read reports of widespread racism in society and I reject them. They are simply untrue and do not stand up to scrutiny. When we originally sought to settle people there was a small minority of places where fear became the instant <Col N="998" /> reaction. Once people were educated about the value of diversity and interculturalism the fear dissipated. I can point to towns and villages tonight as prime examples of precisely what I am talking about. That is not the reaction of a society which is latently or endemically racist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>So there is no racism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn such charges with the contempt they deserve. Of course, I accept that there is within certain people the capacity to be racist. There might even be a minority of people who, through complete ignorance, act in a racist fashion and that is why we have put in place the measures I have outlined. It is very ironic that Members of the Oireachtas, or anyone else, should choose to criticise this Government's record in tackling racism when we put in place the very legislation which allowed us to sign, for the very first time, an international convention against racism. We could not sign previously for the simple reason that the legislative framework was not in place. Of course, there will be those who say what is in place is insufficient and that more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>I am the very first to accept that more needs to be done which is precisely why I set up the steering group and obtained Government funding of £4.5 million over the next three years for a public awareness campaign. I have repeatedly stated my absolute abhorrence of racism in all its forms and consistently stressed the need to respect people's individuality and humanity. I have sought at all times to ensure that people's personal dignity, irrespective of whether they were deemed to be illegal immigrants or refugees, was respected. If there were times when, administratively, structurally or legislatively, we failed in any way, I immediately sought to stop the gaps.</P>
      <P>I can safely say the record speaks for itself and will stand and bear comparison with any country in Europe. I will go further and say that the legislative framework in place is a model of its type and there is no country, in the EU or beyond, which can boast as modern, sophisticated and comprehensive a body of legislation dealing with discrimination. That is not to say, to use the words of Senator Norris, one can legislate for morality. I am not certain private morality can be legislated for, but I am certain that if legislation is geared in a particular direction it can definitely steer public morality in a way acceptable to a civilised society. In this matter legislatively, administratively and structurally we have sought to succeed. If we have not at all times done so, <i>mea culpa.</i> We have sought at all times to redress defects which became apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not bother setting up a Director of Equality Investigation, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission if I did not believe in the values they are in place to espouse. I deeply resent accusations to the contrary, which appear every now and then, by people who should know better. The steering group will now <Col N="999" /> complete its early study of what is required to be done in the short term. It will continue to monitor and assess the situation. In as much as we have in place today all the items I have already outlined, we will put more safeguards, structures and legislation in place, if required. However, it is difficult to take on board the unmerited criticism which has been doing the rounds in this country for some time &ndash; I am not speaking about any Member of this House &ndash; when one knows that one has done more than any one of those critics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Norris's interjections were involuntary and resulted from his strong belief in his motion. I remind him that he will have the opportunity to respond to or reject the points made by those speakers later in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not come into the House in a defensive position when a motion is tabled by the Opposition. He comes here in good faith. I invite him to come into the House as a realist rather than a defendant. He came here this evening as a defendant and that is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>One recognises that the Minister has a genuine commitment, but the difference between that and reality varies dramatically. There is also a difference between a casual and a determined commitment to ensure that legislation is enforced. The Minister referred to the 1989 Act which provides against racial discrimination. However, there have not been any successful prosecutions under that legislation. One must question the effectiveness or otherwise of that Act 12 years later. I request the Minister to introduce an amendment to that legislation to make it effective. That request should not be met with a defensive response.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by the Government is nonsense. It endorses the Government's commitment to tackle racism in all its forms. However, that commitment is not a determined one. It also applauds the measures introduced by the Government which have resulted in comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation. Legislation may be in place, but it is not being enforced. The Minister referred to cases across the country. We are all aware of communities in rural areas and larger towns in our constituencies where there is no racism and where people are happily integrated. However, there is a percentage of people involved in racist behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the necessity for the awareness committee which is being set up to do a survey. He mentioned the need for the steering group to undertake key tasks as part of the planning and development of the launch, including conducting a survey of attitudes and opinions and analysing its results. However, there is no need to conduct such a survey as ample surveys have been done by Amnesty International and the EU. The Eurobar report which was published recently <Col N="1000" /> reflected poorly on our attitudes to racial discrimination. We must take action.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to legislation and to people's attitudes. One can legislate for people's actions so action can be taken against them if they act contrary to the law, but one cannot legislate for people's attitudes. Martin Luther King said that one cannot legislate for a man's heart, but one can legislate for his habits. We must have effective legislation which deals specifically with a person's habits and how he or she treats and deals with other people. Only education will change what is in a person's heart and mind. I am delighted education was raised. It is vital that we educate our people, and this process should start in the home. We hear stories regularly about racist remarks being made to children at school because of their ethnic background, whether they are from the Traveller community or another community, or the colour of their skin. Many of those comments come from within the home. People need to be educated.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we undertake a public awareness campaign. While we appreciate that money has been set aside, that campaign has not yet started. Reports show that a cross-section of our community has anti-ethnic attitudes. An opinion poll of more than 1,000 people, which was done by Amnesty International, showed that 40% of people would be reluctant to welcome Travellers as their neighbours. As a member of a local authority, I thought the figure would have been higher given how people react to halting sites. Some 15% of respondents said they could see themselves being friends with refugees, asylum seekers, Travellers or Romanians. I am concerned about that frightening percentage. Romania is one of our eastern European neighbours and it was the centre of cultural development in past centuries. Many people refer to the capital of Romania as the equivalent of Paris in the western part of Europe, yet only 15% of people would see themselves being friends with Romanian refugees. Interestingly, 32% said they could be friendly with black people and 39% said they could be friendly with Chinese people. That begs the question, what about the 68% and 61% respectively? </P>
    <P>These are the people who need to be educated and informed and who must open their minds to the wider world. One talks about global economies. We must globalise our minds and attitudes about people. As a people who were forced to emigrate in the past to a variety of countries &ndash; we all have relatives abroad &ndash; it is unfortunate that such a high percentage of people do not have an open mind about those who have come to this country for a variety of reasons. There is a need to undertake a public awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister came into the House in a defensive mode. He should accept the reality that all is not well in this State in terms of our attitude to ethnic diversity. A high percentage of people do not recognise the benefits of inter-culturalism. We need to educate people. There is a fear of the <Col N="1001" /> unknown but if that barrier can be crossed, there will be greater openness. There is an urgent need to address the matter.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing number of attacks on those from minority groups, be they ethnic or cultural minorities. Many attacks are not reported as victims believe there is no point in doing so. This is unsatisfactory given that Ireland has signed up to international conventions on human rights. There is much legislation, much paper, but the situation on the ground begs the question as to what the Government is doing to ensure this does not continue. There is a need for urgent action and I support Senator Norris's motion. The amendment is a farce. I am disappointed that Fianna Fáil felt the need to table such a laborious amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn comes from a lovely part of west Clare and I had imagined her as the lily among the briars on the other side of the House. However, aspects of her contribution to the debate were hard to stomach. She stated that the Minister was defensive in his contribution. In fact, he gave a strong defence of Government policy. There is merit in Senator Norris's motion to which the Government amendment is not a total rebuff. The Minister agreed that much needs to be done and is constantly reviewing the situation. He has, however, achieved much since taking over his Department four years ago.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was appointed in 1997, there was an emerging problem related to an influx of asylum seekers. The rainbow coalition had left the cupboard bare, and the Minister had to work from a difficult position. There were few staff, no funding, no appeals mechanism, and no provisions for dealing with asylum seekers. Not alone has the Minister introduced worthwhile legislation, he has provided £200 million in his four years in office to provide facilities and extra staff. This must be acknowledged and encouraged. There were some 700 cases being dealt with per annum when the Minister took office. This had escalated to some 11,000 last year. Behind Belgium, Ireland is in second highest position <i>per capita</i> in its acceptance of asylum seekers and refugees among EU member states in recent years. This is an EU statistic.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the situation regarding racism is not as bad as painted by some, although we do have problems. I abhor racist attacks but do not believe they are the full picture. Some 200 asylum seekers have come to the west Cork area. They were accepted, perhaps in a jaundiced way by some, but they had their rights and were generally welcome. Although there have been unfortunate incidents in Dublin, these are the exception rather than the rule. The younger generation has a greater tolerance of people of different races and cultures than older people. Education is the key to tackling racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> The situation regarding the Traveller community is also far from resolved. In west Cork, a local authority bought a house and two acres of land for a Traveller family, as they wanted space for their business. Having spent £180,000 on a five bedroom house and two acres of land, the local authority was told by the family that it was too far from the local town and that they did not want it. They wanted two houses in the town. Great efforts can be made to help people but things do not always work out.</P>
    <P>I visited my local hospital in Bantry one week ago for a minor check-up. The majority of doctors in the hospital are African or Asian. They are most welcome at the hospital, the only one serving west Cork. They do an excellent job and engender great respect from old and young in the area. There are also nurses from Indonesia at the hospital who have integrated into the community at Bantry without difficulty. I would hate the message from this debate to be that there is a problem with racism in a broad sense in Ireland. There are incidents which we must condemn but we are doing an excellent job in many respects.</P>
    <P>I compliment Amnesty International on its worthwhile campaign, which Senator Norris mentioned. The Senator said that the Amnesty report was a reproach to Government but I disagree. We can act on the report. A future Government advertising campaign will complement what Amnesty International is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot change mindsets; it can only introduce legislation. From reading certain newspaper articles, one would think that the Minster should be on the streets policing how people think. That is not possible. The Minister has brought forward the legislation required and taken action on which he is to be complimented. In the next three years, the Government has committed to investing £4.5 million on an advertising campaign to combat racism. That is a lot of money and must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Last October, the Government agreed to a proposal from the Minister to implement an anti-racism awareness programme. In February this year, the Minister announced the establishment of a high level steering group to implement it, in conjunction with the equality division of his Department. I take issue with Senator Norris for making fun of the fact that there has been no meeting of the group since February due to the foot and mouth crisis. All groups were advised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not to hold meetings unless absolutely necessary. It is unfair to say that the steering group sat idle during that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have come a long way since June 1997. Money has been spent and useful fora established. The Minister has established the Human Rights Commission, promoted the Citizen Traveller Campaign initiative, and established the Reception and Integration Agency. It should be recognised that much work has been done by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1003" /> Reform in the past four years. The Minister has achieved more than many are capable of.</P>
    <P>I accept that we cannot ignore the issue, that we must constantly review it. There is more work to be done, as the Minister has accepted. It is an exaggeration to say that we can run before we can walk. That is an unfair criticism of the Minister. The Government has responded exceptionally well over the past three years.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on putting down this motion. It has generated a very heated debate and that is very welcome. I agree with my colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, that the Minister should not have been so defensive about this. This is an honest endeavour to tackle an issue that is absolutely real. I will always give credit where it is due. The Minister expressed his views very honestly and forthrightly, pointing to legislation which has been enacted and so forth. I found it utterly unbelievable that he should say there is no racism in Ireland. It is so blind and it shows where the Government is coming from.</P>

      <P>He spoke as if these were very isolated incidents which happened very occasionally. We have heard of many incidents. The statistics are available from polls and investigations which were carried out by the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the initial debates on equality legislation, including employment equality, in the Oireachtas. At that time, the mid-1990s, contributors were most concerned about the obvious and endemic racism towards the Traveller community. At that time we did not have the problem of racism as we encounter it today, where our new found prosperity has been accompanied by an influx of asylum seekers and economic immigrants. We must admit that despite legislation, effort and campaigns, anti-Traveller feeling is still part of our society. To change the attitudes within society is difficult, even with the best will of the legislators. Every local authority member knows this. Every councillor who has tried to introduce the Traveller accommodation programme knows how difficult it is. It is met with the 'not in my back yard' attitude. Those who support these programmes often find that colleagues are put under enormous pressure from local communities not to vote for them. Why is this? Of course it is nothing to do with the Travellers. It is nothing to do with the people themselves, it is to do with the value <Col N="1004" /> of property, a fear of house prices declining. Then it will be said that these people do appalling things, that they are violent. All the arguments which Members know so well are put forward. Despite campaigns, that has not changed significantly. It demonstrates how difficult it is to change attitudes within our society.</P>
    <P>We say that there is no racism towards asylum seekers or immigrants. One of the difficulties is that many who come here seeking work are very poor, but not all of them are. Many are very skilled, yet cannot get jobs and are forced to live on social welfare payments because we cannot find it within ourselves to have a system which works sufficiently well to allow them get the jobs they so desperately want. They are housed in low-cost accommodation, side-by-side in many instances, with the poorest in our own society, indigenous people as it were. That breeds fear and distrust. Some Irish people feel that others should not get benefits which they themselves are not entitled to. Others should not get housing which they have waited for. The fear is not only that of the unknown. It is a fear of being left behind because the people coming into the country will get the benefits first. The fear of the unknown has to be challenged and counteracted. That should form part of an awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about isolated incidents. These are the reported incidents, like stone throwing and actual attacks. What about when immigrants are to be housed in certain areas? The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, will be very familiar with a case in his constituency. Opposition was not to the immigrants to be housed in the area, it was a planning problem. This was a euphemism. Many people do not want people from another ethnic background living beside them &ndash; the statistics were quoted earlier. The objections are subtle. The more middle-class the area the more subtle these objections are. We know this and should admit that it is true. We should not blind ourselves from it.</P>
    <P>The essence of Senator Norris's motion is that he condemns the Government's lack of movement on the proposed racial awareness programme. The Minister accepts that some of the existing legislation needs to be updated and changes are in train. There have been no prosecutions under the incitement to hatred legislation. One wonders why this is the case. People can point to that and feel that maybe there is not a will. I do not know.</P>
    <P>Attitudes do not change without education. Where should this education be offered? Senator Taylor-Quinn has already said that it has to happen within the home, but we have to bypass the home in some circumstances. Many people of a certain generation have no experience of dealing with immigrant people. Children are meeting immigrants in their schools and generally integrating quite well with them. Education has to come mainly through our schools. It has to be for<Col N="1005" /> mally admitted within schools that this is now a different society.</P>
    <P>I hope that we continue to prosper as a society and attract the people we need. We cannot have a society which has a racist attitude. This needs to be changed. Education is the fundamental way to deal with this. The awareness campaign is important and it should be up and running now. How long must we wait for expert groups to decide on the issues? If it is done well we might feel it was worth waiting for. There are people who have already been victims of racism, either subtly or overtly. They are the people we need to reach out to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. There is an obligation on all of us to use our positions to seek to influence public opinion and to come to terms with racism which is undoubtedly a factor in contemporary society. Sometimes it manifests itself in the most spectacular of ways, very often demonstrated to us television. We shake our heads and state that it is a gross violation of human rights and that we are embarrassed about it. However, that is only the thin end of the wedge.</P>
      <P>Sadly, racism seems to be deep-rooted in our psyche. As a country, Ireland has a reputation for being open, generous and hospitable. In the past, it seemed we had no difficulty in dealing with poorer people provided they remained in their own countries. We were prepared to send missionaries to these countries, to donate pennies for the black babies etc. That was all jolly fine, provided these people stayed south of the equator. When some of them came to visit us, however, that was a scéil eile.</P>
      <P>In terms of condemning the Government, I suppose there is truth in the argument that, as a country, we did not respond quickly enough. There was nothing in our previous experience or in existing legislation or public procedures which prepared us for dealing with the influx of asylum seekers and overseas people who have come here, in relatively large numbers, in recent years. Immigration was never part of our history. In the Irish experience the opposite was the case, we sent out the people for whom we were not able to make provision. As a result, we were not prepared, particularly in the public sector, for what happened and we were slow to respond to the situation as it emerged and as it continues to develop.</P>
      <P>Only so much can be achieved through legislation and there is a good corpus of legislation in place at present. However, it is a long journey from enacting legislation to putting it into practice. In the long term, the latter is what matters. A previous speaker referred to the mindset, which it is what we must seek to change. I am glad this debate is taking place because there is none among our number who is without influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major disseminators of information in society are religion, education and the media. <Col N="1006" /> These are the major forces that influence people's mindsets. Legislators, in their own right, have a role to play in terms of making efforts to introduce legislation and make proper provision. Unless, however, there is a parallel effort on the part of those who shape our religious beliefs and our moral tenets, those who educate us as children and as adults and the media, the mean, grudging and short-sighted mindset will not be changed. We are aware of this because we cannot even change people's mindset in relation to something as basic as litter.</P>
    <P>People's mindsets can be changed. This often happens when initiatives are taken at local and community level. I accept that the circumstances surrounding the influx of refugees to this country from Kosovo are slightly different from those of other refugees and that there was a huge surge of sympathy for Kosovars as a result of what they had experienced. However, I wish to draw attention to the fact that a group of Kosovars who were located in the town of Kenmare were integrated after a short period. This happened mainly because of the efforts and attitude of the archdeacon, the local parish priest, who, because he spearheads the town's entry to the Tidy Towns Competition, which it wins every year, has great influence in the community. He was able to shape the attitude of the members of the local community to these strangers who came to their town. In no time these individuals were welcomed into people's houses and they began helping the archdeacon cultivate plants in his greenhouses. They discovered that they had a common language because Latin is the language used to describe plants. Each had enough knowledge of Latin to allow a conversation to take place.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this matter can only be dealt with well at local level. Members of communities must display leadership and influence public opinion to bring out the best and generous side of Irish people which, it appears, is difficult to bring out at present. Efforts on the part of the Government must be supplemented by good, decent endeavour at community level and local level.</P>
    <P>In terms of education, I accept that we ask a great deal of our education system but if it does not transmit values it has no value. If schools are not moral communities where people from different economic backgrounds, countries or ethnic backgrounds are not valued, they are not worthy of being centres of education. Education has a huge role to play. I accept, however, that teachers were not prepared to deal with this matter because they did not have access to the language required. We need to work with the practitioners of educational delivery in our classrooms and establish inservice and incareer courses to help them to influence children. It is well known that if one can influence children, one has a fair hope of influencing their parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> I recall that, as a youngster growing up in Kerry, it was our greatest delight to be allowed to play with those whom we called &ldquo;tinkers&rdquo;. We did not intend to disparage these children by referring to them in this way. We thought it was great fun to play with them and we were allowed to do so. Nobody felt we were unsafe being around these children.</P>
    <P>The media have a major role to play, if they so choose. I return to Kerry to give a further example to support my argument. A certain shopkeeper, who also happens to be a local councillor, received enormous publicity in the media by informing the nation that his shop had been broken into on four occasions in a four week period and that each break-in was carried out by a Nigerian. Nobody asked him the details of each incident, whether they were reported to the Garda and the action taken on foot of these alleged incidents. I am familiar with the village where these events allegedly took place and nobody there had laid an eye on a Nigerian, with the exception of the one whose image appears on the front of Trócaire boxes. In this instance, the media did not ask the critical questions. This is the type of occurrence which stirs up racism. The media has a central and major role to play in terms of influencing public opinion.</P>
    <P>Our attitude in this country is grossly undeveloped and underdeveloped and we must take steps to reverse the position. There are priests and pastors who, every Sunday, have a captive audience &ndash; I accept that, as matters stand, they no longer preach to the entire parish &ndash; to which they should preach about the importance of Christian charity, human decency and good values. Without that kind of input from them, from the education system and the media, the racial awareness programme will not achieve full results. I appeal to those who are in a position to influence public opinion to play their part in helping us to change this racist mindset, which is like a poison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fond of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is likeable in many ways. However, his contribution was about as innocuous and as lacking in awareness as any delivered by a Minister in this House. I am intrigued by the Government's determination to insert the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination legislation&rdquo; into the motion by means of the amendment. It appears, therefore, that if a black person is beaten up on Dawson Street, the anti-discrimination legislation can perhaps be invoked, whereas the crime should be one of racially motivated assault. We are talking, and apparently the Government is determined to talk, in terms which do not appreciate the scale of racial violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, I do not want to make the mistake of branding us a racist people. We must, however, deal with the realities of life in Ireland, which are <Col N="1008" /> that the country has changed dramatically and quickly. Tragically, we have succumbed, especially elements of the Government, to a racist motivation in public opinion, such as in the response to the influx of asylum seekers. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform used the phrase &ldquo;a glut of asylum seekers&rdquo;, a phrase he has used on occasion in recent years, I do not believe he meant to be offensive, but he offered language which encouraged such thinking. That is the first aspect, the careless use of language.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is the determination to turn the influx of asylum seekers into a national crisis. Let us remember we were supposed to have a crisis because of the influx of asylum seekers, but we do not have a crisis about the health service. The use of the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is capable of being interpreted as code because foreigners are concerned. The silence of the Government in repudiating one of the Independent Members of the Dáil whose support it needs when he launched into what was essentially a racist rant about Romanians was disgraceful.</P>

      <P>If ever a political party of which I was a member was anything other than unequivocal about such matters, that would be the end of my membership of that party. I invite the supporters of the Government to ask the Ministers responsible to speak to the individual concerned, who is the chair of an Oireachtas committee, and say to him that, if he uses such language again, they will not be part of it. We cannot eliminate racism. What we can do is minimise its impact, educate public opinion and, above all, give positive signals and support to those whose instincts are to be repelled by it.</P>
      <P>I have consistently asked in the House how the immigration service figures out who should be stopped at airports and ferry ports for further investigation. No one will tell me what are the criteria and the advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. I am also aware of the number of black people who come here for perfectly legitimate reasons who are either embarrassed or delayed because members of the immigration service stop, question and humiliate them. I want to know if someone told them to keep an eye on people on the basis of their skin colour. Is that one of the criteria, not for stopping people but for questioning them further? That is what I would like to know.</P>
      <P>I attended a conference in 1992 at which an eminent Peruvian development economist was a guest. He was almost late for the conference because he was held at Dublin Airport by the immigration service. I am aware of two successive occasions when 15 year old children from a school in Bradford were denied visas by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come here on an educational tour despite the fact they were legal residents in Britain. No one would tell me the reason. The following year two different children were also refused visas to come here on an educational tour. I have no idea why that happened. No one will tell me because individual cases are not discussed. I love the way privacy becomes an issue when it is safer to do so.</P>
      <P>These are only anecdotes but they all amount to the same thing, that we have a problem to a degree in institutions, in the security forces, especially the Garda, in the way the issue is discussed in politics and in the way we tolerate appalling language from members of the political system. It is the Government's job &ndash; I would say this whoever was in government &ndash; to take every possible measure to deal with this.</P>
      <P>Then we see a programme to counter racism being announced with a great flourish and no one knows what is happening. Organisations like Amnesty International wonder what is happening because no one has told them. Amnesty International is an organisation which most Governments love when it criticises the people they do not like. They will cite the organisation at great length if they want to criticise others.</P>

      <P>My first exposure to real-life racism was about 30 years ago when I visited Chicago. I stayed with an Irish family on that occasion. They were very fine people and both of them have since gone to their eternal reward. They told me the house in which they lived was new and that they had moved from another house a year earlier to stay ahead of the coloured people who had moved into their area. Their moving in would have devalued their property and they wanted to protect their investment.</P>
      <P>Another exposure to racism was when I was held by the British authorities for not translating my name from Irish into the English language. It took four European countries and the European Parliament to obtain an undertaking from Britain that that would not happen again. I regard that as racism.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the Minister of State regarding the advertisement in question. I am a regular supporter of Amnesty International and make regular financial contributions to it, but it made a mistake in lampooning Ministers in the manner it did. There is an introverted element of racism in that act.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time we have discussed the issue of racism in the House. I raised and discussed it on three different occasions. On each one I had reason to compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for his hands-on approach to this challenge and for his prompt intervention each time it was necessary, once in his native county of Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Racism is a cancer which must be rooted out at all costs. We must prevent it from becoming <Col N="1011" /> rooted in the first instance. I have previously had occasion to speak about an attack on a coloured doctor in Nenagh, which I regard as outrageous. I was not clear whether the attack was racially motivated. In the same town on previous occasions other attacks had taken place, one fatal, which did not involve people of other races. We must be clear whether attacks are racially motivated.</P>
    <P>I compliment every Senator who has spoken. I have no doubt all spoke with deep concern and compassion. It is important that these issues are discussed on a regular basis because it is easy to become complacent. However, it was disingenuous for a speaker to juxtapose Ireland and South Africa in making the case against racism. This was done by a speaker who has since left the House. This is not correct. It is an exaggeration. It has an effect which is the opposite to the one each person in this House is trying to achieve. Such a comparison might even prompt people who have the evil of racism within them to use it as a cover for a racist attack.</P>
    <P>We must arrive at a balance if we are to be positive and compassionate. We must also be careful not to believe that any one of us has a monopoly on the issue of human rights or compassion. This will only drive the goodwill of the majority away from the moral leadership which we can provide. We must use our positions as legislators to provide that vital moral leadership. One cannot legislate for the morality which is necessary in a case such as this.</P>
    <P>The moment we exclude communities from arriving at their own initiatives and being innovative in their approach we lose our main strength. As I listened to some of the contributions to the debate I tried to relate what was being said to communities with which I was familiar but I could not see a relationship. I do not suggest that the case histories described have not happened in other areas. I thought of communities in town such as Ennis and Clogheen. In the initial stages communities had doubts, faced unknown situations and did not know how to respond but the moment they were given leadership they gave everything that was required and more.</P>
    <P>We need definitions and analyses. I am concerned about the word &ldquo;integration&rdquo;, for example. Must people who bring to Ireland a beautiful and rich culture, a tradition they are proud of and a language of their own, become as we are? If that is the case we will lose the opportunity to have our culture enhanced. We must be careful about what integration means. New people must be made welcome and given opportunities equal to everyone else. However, far from expecting them to abandon their language, we would show far more respect for our immigrants by trying to learn it. When one hears a couple of words of one's own language in a strange environment one is made to feel particularly comfortable. We should aim to understand the cultures of people who come to live in <Col N="1012" /> Ireland. That is what is meant by cultural diversity.</P>
    <P>We must not generalise or exaggerate. Given our historical background and particularly the Christian principles and tradition we espouse &ndash; there was a time in America when notices were placed in windows reading, &ldquo;No Irish or dogs&rdquo;&ndash; we are ideally suited to give good example.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to face the issue of racism as a partnership. We must not score points but try to come together. Ní neart go cur le chéile. If we do, we will do justice to the people who are vulnerable and need our help. I believe that every person who spoke this evening feels exactly the same in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the motion because it accuses the Government of lack of movement with regard to the promised racial awareness programme. Nothing could be further from the truth. A few weeks ago during Private Members' time we discussed the Arms Trials of 1970. On that occasion the Government was accused of cynicism when it proposed an amendment to the Fine Gael motion. This evening the Government amendment was described as farcical. I do not accept that. The Minister was accused of being defensive. The Minister is right to defend his proud record and his achievements of recent years in promoting awareness of racism. An opposition speaker recognised that a well co-ordinated awareness campaign will not change everyone's attitude. Isolated cases of racism will continue to occur. It is wrong to generalise or to claim that Irish people are, by and large, racist.</P>
      <P>The achievements of the Minister are a matter of fact. I support the Government amendment because I do not believe there has been a lack of movement. Much more needs to be done and will be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister has established the national consultative committee on racism and inter-culturalism, the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission and the Garda racial and intercultural office. He has promoted the citizen Traveller campaign and established the Reception and Integration Agency. This is not lack of movement.</P>
      <P>These actions were taken prior to the announcement that £4.5 million has been allocated for the next three years to ensure suitable funding for a properly co-ordinated public awareness campaign. Last October the Government agreed to a proposal from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to implement a national anti-racism public awareness programme with the overall aim of contributing to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and inter-cultural society where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. The Government allocated a core budget of £1.5 million per annum to the programme over a three year period, beginning on 1 January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objectives of the awareness programme are as follows: to act as a catalyst to <Col N="1013" /> stimulate public awareness of racism; to contribute to a commitment to address racism in Ireland; to affirm cultural diversity as a value in our society and to encourage practical ways of taking it into account; to help create the conditions that make it more difficult for racism to exist; and to contribute to a range of policies that promote an inclusive approach to minority ethnic groups, including refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>In February this year, the Minister announced the establishment of a high level steering group to implement the programme in partnership with the equality division of his Department. The steering group has an independent chairperson and 19 members. Its membership is broadly based and includes representatives of ethnic minority communities, the four social partners, national bodies such as the Equality Authority and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, and relevant Departments. The group is chaired by an eminent person, Mr. Joe McDonagh of Galway, who is a former president of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The secretariat for the group is provided by the equality division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister state that initiatives will be taken in the areas of community and local development, media and communications, the role of statutory authorities and public education, and will aim to produce long-term sustainable outcomes. As other speakers mentioned, the community is a good place in which to start educating people.</P>
    <P>Genuine fear was instilled in people when they were made aware that people from other countries and cultures would be coming to live among them. That fear and apprehension is understandable. It is important to point out, however, that at that time the Minister sent his officials around the country to public meetings where consultation took place and where the public was educated. They became aware that they had nothing to fear and they accepted that fact. Nowadays, when asylum seekers or refugees are placed in various rural and urban locations throughout the country we do not have big public gatherings of people to criticise the fact. By and large, people have welcomed these developments which are working quite well.</P>
    <P>The first task of the steering group was to arrange for a baseline survey of attitudes and opinions on minority ethnic groups, racism and interculturalism among the public and key audiences. The survey, which will be nationwide, will be a crucial cornerstone of the programme. An Opposition Senator disputed that this survey was necessary, but I think it is. It is very necessary to have the views of everybody in the country before decisions are made. The results of the survey will help to determine the focus and direction of the campaign and will serve as a benchmark for the programme.</P>
    <P>The steering group is aware of the need to support community based initiatives. With this in <Col N="1014" /> mind, plans are under way to launch a small grants fund to support and facilitate such groups and organisations. Preparations are in train for a formal launch of the programme. The launch and the media campaign, if they are to be successful, must be well planned and properly co-ordinated. That point was made by Senator Keogh who said that we will look back and say we were right to take our time and get it right. I am sure we will. It is important to sit back in the cold light of day and consider everybody's views fairly, before launching the awareness campaign. That is the way we should proceed.</P>
    <P>The group will provide an annual progress report to the Government and will also publish an annual report. While we all appreciate the need for an anti-racism awareness programme, the temptation to take short-term action must be resisted. I agree that short-term action may not be the correct procedure for us to make people aware of racism. In spending nearly £5 million on an awareness campaign, we must set about our business properly.</P>
    <P>We have had awareness campaigns in many other areas which worked for the public. We must always try to legislate for the common good, although unfortunate incidents will always take place. I respect Senator Norris for tabling the motion. I am sure he is aware of isolated racist incidents that have taken place. We must approach the argument in a balanced way, however. It should be realised that some people, including asylum seekers, have come to the country who have been involved in attacks on our citizens. It is important to point that out. I admire Senator Norris for raising the issue but I want to point out that, on a small scale, some attacks have been made on Irish citizens by people from other countries and cultures. Perhaps we have not been so fast to highlight that fact. We should have balance and should recognise that wrong can be done on both sides. We are all seeking the same thing, however, in trying to create this awareness. The Government is standing on its record. It has done much and will do more.</P>

      <P>I thank all my colleagues who took part in the debate, starting with Senator Ross who seconded the motion. I hope that all the speakers on this side of the House have been very effective. I wish, in particular, to compliment those on the Government benches because it was a lively debate. Many Government speakers were constructive, particularly Senator Ó Murchú and most especially Senator Quill. Her contribution was one of the most excellent that I have heard in the House. It was reasoned and thoughtful. She went right to the heart of the matter in highlighting the need for local community leadership and education. She is absolutely right. If the Government put Senator Quill on that committee we would soon have action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was heartened by the positive response from Members on the other side of the House. The Minister was a bit more tetchy but he was in a <Col N="1015" /> very weak position. His speech was astonishing, it really was. It was defensive. The sad thing, as far as I was concerned, was that he denied the existence of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, he said there was no racism. Then he said that he would like to refute the charge that there was racism in this country. Then he said, &ldquo;Well, there might be a little bit here and there. isolated cases&rdquo;, and so on. If one does not recognise the problem, how can one address it and cure it? Certain elements in the Government, and certainly in this Department, are in denial, which is a great problem. I put 15 questions to the Minister, comprising six main questions and some subsidiaries, yet I did not receive a single answer, not one. In the ante-chamber afterwards, the Minister said that he would answer me and perhaps he will. I live in hope. It would be a very good thing if he were able to do so.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that there is racism. I wrote an article about the subject in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and I have never received such virulent mail as I did after its publication. It was astonishing. The reason I tabled this motion is that we were promised something which has not been delivered. I am not the only person who thinks so and neither is Amnesty International. In its edition of 12 May, <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
      <P>Last autumn, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. O'Donoghue, announced a propaganda campaign to combat racism, and rightly won praise for his plans. But that campaign has yet to see the light of day. Why the delay? It is surely not beyond the wit of man to express in succinct terms the anti-racist message and to harness the wealth of talent in Ireland's advertising industry to get that message across with punch. There is need also for an up-to-date legislative framework that defines racially motivated crime, thereby giving the gardaí the means to act against it.</P>
      <P>There has been a series of questionnaires and surveys on this subject. The African refugee network survey of 1999 questioned 40 refugees. Thirty said they were denied service because of their skin colour, 11 said they had been verbally abused and four claimed physical abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2000, the <i>Star</i> newspaper commissioned Lansdowne Market Research to conduct a survey of 1,100 people. They found that 27% said they were disturbed by the presence of minority groups, 33% said too many minorities live in Ireland, 23% said immigrant status should not fully guarantee rights and 7% said Ireland should not grant political asylum to those escaping human rights violations. Even more worrying, the Union of Students in Ireland &ndash; our young people &ndash; conducted a survey of 500 third level students, 39% of whom claimed they would find it difficult to accept a Traveller as a sibling or <Col N="1016" /> spouse, 6% said they would not find it difficult to accept minorities of any kind and 20% said all illegal immigrants should be deported without exception. That is an astonishing survey. That is clear factual evidence.</P>
    <P>A letter that was sent to a black woman in Dublin stated:</P>
    <P>Mrs. Wog, I noticed on Wednesday a member of your litter, a young black bastard, nostrils wide apart, ape-like lips, crawling around on the floor. I ask that you hand over that animal for the purpose of vivisection so that the white race may be able to come up with a cure for HIV, TB, Rubella, VD and all the other diseases that you black bastards have spread.</P>
    <P>I could multiply instances such as this one, so racism does exist. In 1996, a Fianna Fáil councillor in Waterford stated:</P>
    <P>The sooner shotguns are at the ready and those Travelling people are put out of the country the better. They are not our people, they are not natives.</P>
    <P>Can anyone tell me that there is not racism in this country?</P>
    <P>
      <i>Time Out Dublin Guide 1999</i> stated:</P>
    <P>You also noticed the extraordinary virulent racism that has become a feature of Irish life. In Dublin racist folk were generally happy to identify themselves as racist as the label does not carry the same sense of shame as it does in European countries. Black people, white people perceived not to be white enough, Bosnian refugees, for example, and Ireland's own travelling community can all expect loud comments and even open abuse on the streets of our city.</P>
    <P>I have heard it and we cannot deny it.</P>
    <P>A garda married to a member of an ethnic minority group said:</P>
    <P>I have noticed recently, not just in the job in the past few years, things have started changing. We are becoming more racist. Maybe we were always racist but just didn't see it but it's a fear that I have now that I didn't always have.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the remarkable conference in Trinity College on Ireland: Pluralism or Prejudice, Dr. Ronit Lentin, a lecturer on ethnic and racial studies in the college, said the Government's contradictory messages on asylum and immigration together with the media response were major causative facts in contemporary Irish racism. This indicates the level of the problem. Amnesty International has put to the Government certain actions it believes could be taken to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>No official records are kept of racially motivated incidents. It is left to voluntary bodies to do so and a cause of concern that such material is not collected. This puts into context the weakness of the Minister's response. I took the foot and mouth disease outbreak seriously. I tabled a <Col N="1017" /> motion and was one of the first to raise the alarm bells in this House. I stand on my record on that matter but to tell us there cannot be a meeting of a 19 person group because of foot and mouth disease is laughable. It is utter, absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>The questions I asked were all specific and the response was: &ldquo;With this in mind plans are under way&rdquo;. That has a nice rhetorical sound but it means absolutely damn all. The Minister stated, &ldquo;Preparations are in train for a formal launch&rdquo;. I asked him for a date, not whether they were in train, and he singularly failed to give it to the House. That is the reason I am worried and pressing the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of groups which have made formal representations and submitted ideas to the group. They are good people&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well and I am delighted to hear it. It is a pity the Minister of State is not the Minister as we might have received a more satisfactory response but I doubt even he could manufacture a fact out of thin air because that is difficult.</P>
      <P>This kind of situation was raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the Lower House last night. He said 300,000 immigrants would be required to facilitate industrial development and the Taoiseach more or less agreed. Deputy Mitchell asked what was being done to facilitate them in terms of education, which is important. However, it should be two way. There should be induction courses for immigrants in order that they do not cause irritation. The Taoiseach's reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> Racially motivated incidents were increasing, but not alarmingly so. Research shows it is not a major issue but I am aware of an increasing number of cases.</P>
    <P>It is depressing when the Taoiseach views it like that.</P>
    <P>I do not accuse members of the Government of being racist. The Minister is rather irascible, which is one of his more engaging qualities, and gets up on his high horse from time to time but that is what we like about him. That is what makes him so loveable but he is not racist. However, he is blind to this issue because he denied the existence of a serious racial problem earlier and that is not sustainable. Unfortunately, that seems to be endemic in certain sections of the Government. Thank God in those circumstances for people such as the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who helps to keep the situation under observation. I do not accuse my friends in Fianna Fáil of being racist.</P>
    <P>Although I had sharp comments to make &ndash; I stand over every one of them &ndash; I was impressed by the moderation of the contributions on the other side and the obvious desire of every speaker to counter and combat racism. If my voice is a little shrill this evening, it is because I believe it necessary to prod, provoke and generate a little action. Even the Sinn Féin Minister in the North has managed to produce a programme of education. Let us not fall behind. Let us do it as well. I thank my colleagues for their contributions, all of which, in varying degrees, were valued.</P>
